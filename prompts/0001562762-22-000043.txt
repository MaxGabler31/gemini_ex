ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
We are a leading producer, global marketer and exporter of a full range of Met coals. We own a portfolio of operating mines and development projects in Queensland in Australia, and in Virginia, West Virginia and Pennsylvania in the United States. We are one of the largest Met coal producers globally by export volume, serving customers on five continents.
Our operations in Australia, or our Australian Operations, consist of the 100%-owned Curragh producing mining property located in the Bowen Basin of Australia. Our operations in the United States, or our U.S. Operations, consists of two producing mining properties (Buchanan and Logan), one temporarily idled mining property (Greenbrier) and two development mining properties (Mon Valley, formerly named Pangburn-Shaner-Fallowfield, and Russell County), primarily located in the Central Appalachian region of the United States, or CAPP, all of which are 100%-owned. Our U.S. Operations and Australian Operations are strategically located for access to transportation infrastructure. In addition to Met coal, our Australian Operations sell thermal coal under a long-term legacy contract assumed in the acquisition of Curragh, which is used to generate electricity, to Stanwell Corporation Limited, or Stanwell, a Queensland government-owned entity and the operator of the Stanwell Power Station located near Rockhampton, Queensland, and some thermal coal in the export market. Our U.S. Operations also produce and sell some thermal coal that is extracted in the process of mining Met coal.

----------------------------------+----------------------------


Our core business strategy focuses on the production of Met coal for the North American and seaborne export markets. Sales of Met coal represented 94.6% of our total coal revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021. Most of the Met coal that we produce is sold, directly or indirectly, to steel producers. Met coal sales represented 81.4% of our total volume of coal sold in 2021. The remaining 18.6% of our total volume sold in 2021 was thermal coal, the majority of which was sold to Stanwell. 
Met coal is a key ingredient in the production of steel using blast furnaces, and approximately 770 kilograms of Met coal is required to produce one ton of steel.
We have a geographically diverse customer base, across a range of global markets. Major consumers of our seaborne Met coal in 2021 were located in high-growth Asian markets, Brazil and Europe. These consumers are all major global steel or Met coke producers. We are well-positioned in the key high-growth Asian markets (Japan, South Korea and India) as sales to direct end users in Asia represented 48.3% of our total revenue, including Tata Steel Limited, or Tata Steel, which accounted for 16.7% of total revenue, in 2021.
The charts below show the split of our direct sales by geographic region in 2021 and the split of our revenues and sales volume by export and domestic sales in 2019, 2020 and 2021.

To support our operations, we have proven and probable coal reserves totaling 556 MMt as of December 31, 2021, 215 MMt and 341 MMt of which are in Australia and the United States, respectively. For more information regarding our coal reserves, see Item 2. “Properties.”
COVID-19
The ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic has continued to result in a challenging working environment. Authorities in many countries around the world have implemented numerous and varying measures to reduce the spread and limit the impact of COVID-19, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, curfews, stay-at-home orders, business shutdowns and closures. Many countries have implemented multi-stage policies with the goal of re-opening markets and boosting economic activity. 
There is uncertainty regarding how the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business including whether it will result in further changes in demand for Met coal, increases in operating costs or impacts to our supply chain, and whether measures will result in port closures or border restrictions, each or all of which can impact our ability to produce and sell our products.
The safety and wellbeing of our workforce remains our highest priority and we continue to manage the potential threat of COVID-19 at our mines and offices. The Company’s COVID-19 Steering Committee, formed in 2020, has successfully monitored the effect of the pandemic across our Australian Operations and U.S. Operations and continues to implement proactive preventative measures to ensure the safety and well-being of employees and contractors. These procedures include increased screenings of employees as they arrive at the workplace, strict adherence to hygiene and social distancing guidelines while at work and also a cleaning and sanitization program for equipment and facilities. 

Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31, 2021 8


Throughout 2021 the COVID-19 Steering Committee focused on encouraging all workers across all jurisdictions to be vaccinated. This included providing access to educational materials about vaccine safety and efficiency, as well as arranging for several vaccination clinics to be held close to our U.S. Operations and Australian Operations in order to ensure access and availability for all employees. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we implemented a Vaccine Incentive Program at our U.S. Operations that provides cash payment to employees who provided proof of vaccination. Since the program commenced, vaccination rates amongst our U.S. workforce has improved significantly. At our Australian Operations, vaccination rates continue to increase as the Australian Federal and Queensland state government’s vaccination program roll out. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview”.
History and Australian Public Offering
We were founded in 2011 by Garold Spindler, James Campbell and a fund affiliated with The Energy & Minerals Group, or EMG, with the intention of evaluating, acquiring and developing Met coal properties. 
Since 2011, Coronado Coal LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and other affiliated entities, including Coronado Group LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which we refer to, collectively, as Coronado Group, have grown the scale and platform of our current operations principally from four acquisitions:
•in 2013, Coronado Group acquired Greenbrier from Lehman Brothers;
•in 2014, Coronado Group acquired Logan from Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (now known as Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.);
•in 2016, Coronado Group acquired Buchanan from CONSOL Energy Inc., or CONSOL Energy; and
•in 2018, Coronado Group acquired Wesfarmers Curragh Pty Ltd (now known as Coronado Curragh Pty Ltd), including the Curragh producing mining property, from Wesfarmers Ltd, or Wesfarmers.
Prior to the initial public offering, Coronado Global Resources Inc., our parent company, was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Coronado Group LLC, which is currently owned by funds managed by EMG, which we refer to, collectively, as the EMG Group, and certain members of our management.
On October 23, 2018, we completed an initial public offering on the Australian Securities Exchange, or ASX, which we refer to as the Australian IPO.
On May 14, 2021, we successfully completed the institutional component of a fully underwritten 1-for-4.73 pro-rata accelerated non-renounceable entitlement offer, or the Entitlement Offer. On completion, a total of 253,108,820 fully paid new CDIs (representing a beneficial interest in 25,310,882 shares of common stock) were issued, which are traded on the ASX. 
On June 1, 2021, we successfully completed the retail component of the Entitlement Offer. On completion, a total of 39,466,010 fully paid new CDIs (representing a beneficial interest in 3,946,601 shares of common stock) were issued, which are traded on the ASX. 
Coronado Group LLC, the Company’s controlling stockholder, exercised its right to participate in the institutional component of the Entitlement Offer and purchased 71,980,363 of the new CDIs (representing a beneficial interest in 7,198,036.3 shares of common stock). 
As of December 31, 2021, the EMG Group and management beneficially own approximately 50.4% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock through their ownership of Coronado Group LLC. The remaining 49.6% is owned by public investors in the form of CDIs traded on the ASX. In addition, Coronado Group LLC holds one share of preferred stock Series A, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company, or the Series A Share, which is the only share of preferred stock issued and outstanding. The holder of the Series A Share is permitted to nominate and elect members of our Board of Directors in relation to the level of the holder’s aggregate beneficial ownership of shares of our common stock.

Organizational Structure
The following chart shows our current organizational structure:
Overview of Operations
Met Coal
Met coals are primarily used in the manufacture of coke, which is used in the steel-making process, as well as direct injection into a blast furnace as a replacement for coke.
Sales of Met coal represented approximately 94.6% of our total coal revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021. Most of the Met coal that we produce is sold, directly or indirectly, to steel producers. The steel industry’s demand for Met coal is affected by several factors, including the cyclical nature of that industry’s business, general economic conditions and demand for steel, tariffs on steel and steel products, technological developments in the steelmaking process and the availability and cost of substitutes for steel, such as aluminum, composites and plastics. We compete based on coal quality and characteristics, price, customer service and support and reliability of supply. Seaborne Met coal import demand can be significantly impacted by the availability of indigenous coal production, particularly in the leading Met coal import countries of China and India, among others, and the competitiveness of seaborne Met coal supply, including from the leading Met coal exporting countries of Australia, the United States, Russia, Canada and Mongolia, among others.
Thermal Coal
Sales of thermal coal represented approximately 5.4% of our total coal revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021. The thermal coal we produce is predominantly a byproduct of mining Met coal. The thermal coal we produce is sold, directly or indirectly, to power stations, predominantly Stanwell, as an energy source in the generation of electricity. Demand for our thermal coal products is impacted by economic conditions, environmental regulation, demand for electricity, including the impact of energy efficient products, and the cost of electricity generation from alternative fuels. Our thermal coal products primarily compete with producers of other forms of electric generation, including natural gas, oil, nuclear, hydro, wind, solar and biomass, that provide an alternative to coal use.

Segments
In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 280, Segment Reporting, we have adopted the following reporting segments:
•Australia; and
•United States.
In addition, “Other and Corporate” is not a reporting segment but is disclosed for the purposes of reconciliation to our consolidated financials.
These segments are grouped based on geography and reflect how we currently monitor and report the results of the business to the Chief Executive Officer who is our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, Chief Operating Officer - United States, Chief Operating Officer - Australia and the Group Chief Financial Officer. Factors affecting and differentiating the financial performance of each of these two reportable segments generally include coal quality, geology, coal marketing opportunities, mining and transportation methods and regulatory issues. We believe this method of segment reporting reflects the way our business segments are currently managed, resources are allocated and the way the performance of each segment is evaluated. The two segments consist of similar operating activities as each segment produces similar products.
Diversification
We have 100% ownership over all four of our operating mines, allowing us full control over all operating decisions. This control is critical during times of crisis, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and it allowed us to react swiftly and decisively to temporarily idle our U.S. operating mines in response to a quick, sharp and unprecedented contraction in demand from Europe, Brazil and North America during the first half of 2020. On June 1, 2020, we resumed production at the Buchanan and Logan mines in the U.S. The Greenbrier mine remains idle and is currently held for sale.
The below charts show run-of-mine, or ROM, production and saleable production for our Australian Operations and our U.S. Operations for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.


We benefit from a geographically diverse asset base, in Australia and the United States, with access to multiple transportation infrastructure options, including key rail and port infrastructure, providing access to both seaborne export and domestic markets. We have access to the key major markets in both the Atlantic and Pacific basins, and our wide footprint provides flexibility to respond quickly to changes in global market demands.
The low cost nature of our assets is a function of the quality of the assets and the available mine infrastructure to extract our reserves efficiently. We believe being geographically diverse allows us to sell our products to our customers in a number of countries. This allows the sales team to leverage these relationships to provide value added solutions like blends with third parties, which is margin accretive.
Our production is diversified across high quality products, such as hard coking coal, or HCC, semi coking coals, or SCC, and pulverized coal injection, or PCI, coal from our Australian Operations, and significant production of HCC, comprising high volatile content, or High-Vol, (including sub-category A of High-Vol, or HVA, and

Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31, 2021 11


sub-category B of High-Vol, or HVB), coal with medium volatile content, or Mid-Vol, and coal with low volatile content, or Low-Vol, coals from our U.S. Operations. This broad product range supports a wide variety of customer requirements and various blending opportunities, being valued for its attractive coke-making characteristics.

We have a dedicated global marketing team that generates direct sales for our Met coal. Our customer base spans across a full spectrum of key global markets. We sell directly to a number of large, high-quality and well-known companies in the steel industry globally. Many of our core customers have been our longstanding customers for over 20 years, and source our products as essential base load, which translates into a long history of contract renewal for such customers. We are a major supplier to tier one steel mills in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, India, Europe, Brazil, North America and China. Given the quality of our diverse customer base, we believe the demand for our products is insulated across all stages of the commodity cycle. This flexibility is reflected in our ability to take advantage of current favorable pricing into China out of the United States.
2021 Coronado’s coal trade flows
Overview of Australian Operations—Curragh
Curragh is located in Queensland’s Bowen Basin, one of the world’s premier Met coal regions. Curragh has been operating since 1983, and produces a variety of high-quality, low-ash Met coal products. We believe our HCC product is recognized by steelmakers for its low-ash content, consistency of quality and favorable coking attributes. We believe that our SCC products are similarly valued, in particular for their low wall pressure, which makes them suitable for stamp charging coke ovens, and our PCI coal at Curragh is recognized by steelmakers

Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31, 2021 12


for its low phosphorus and sulphur content. These Met coal products are exported globally to a diverse customer base located primarily in Asia. Curragh also produces thermal coal. The thermal coal produced at Curragh is primarily sold domestically under a long-term contract to Stanwell, with a limited amount being exported. 
Revenues from our Australian Operations represented 61.2% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. See Item 2. “Properties” for more information regarding Curragh. 

For the year ended December 31, 2021, 72.3% of the total volume of coal sold by our Australian Operations was Met coal and 27.7% of the total volume of coal sold by our Australian Operations was thermal coal, the majority of which is sold to Stanwell. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Curragh sold 8.0 MMt of Met coal into the seaborne coal markets. The majority of customers purchase multiple grades or products and have purchased Curragh coal continuously through all stages of the coal/commodity pricing cycle. Curragh’s Met coal is typically sold on annual contracts negotiated by our Australian Operations’ sales managers, with pricing agreed to bilaterally or with reference to benchmark indices or spot indices. Our Australian Operations have maintained a high level of contract coverage against planned production. In 2021, approximately 90% of Curragh’s Met coal export sales were made under term contracts (with the balance sold on framework contracts that do not involve a binding commitment to supply, or in the spot market).
Overview of U.S. Operations—Buchanan and Logan
Our producing mining properties in the United States are located in the CAPP region, specifically in Virginia and West Virginia, which is a highly-developed, active, coal-producing region. Met coal produced by our U.S. Operations is consumed regionally by North American steel producers or exported by seaborne transportation to steel producers (primarily in Asia, Europe and South America). The U.S. Operations also produce small quantities of thermal coal that is extracted in the process of mining Met coal, which is sold predominantly to global export markets, as well as within North America. We believe that many regard Met coal from the CAPP region (where our U.S. Operations are located) to be of the highest quality in the world owing to its generally low-ash and sulphur content. Our U.S. Operations offer a range of Met coal products, with significant production of HCC, comprising High-Vol (including HVA and HVB), coal with Mid-Vol, and coal with Low-Vol.
Sales from our U.S. Operations to export markets are typically priced with reference to a benchmark index. We generally sell our seaborne coal through intermediaries Free on Rail (Incoterms 2010), or FOR., and, therefore, our realized price on FOR sales does not include transportation to the seaborne port or costs to transload into a vessel. Consistent with seaborne sales, sales to North American customers are generally sold on a FOR. basis where the customer arrangers for and incurs the cost of transportation to their facility. 
A portion of our sales is sold to North American steel and coke producers on annual contracts at fixed prices that do not fluctuate with the benchmark index. The fixed-price nature of these annual contracts provides us with visibility on our future revenues, as compared to spot sales or sales priced with reference to a benchmark index. For 2022, we have entered into annual contracts to sell approximately 2.9 MMt Met coal with North American steel and coke producers. During periods of stable and rising prices, we strive to take advantage of the spot market. Spot export contracts are negotiated throughout the year. Revenues from our U.S. Operations, in the

Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31, 2021 13


aggregate, represented 38.8% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. See Item 2. “Properties” for more information regarding Buchanan, Logan and the other mining properties that compose our U.S. Operations.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, 97.2% of the total volume of coal sold by our U.S. Operations was Met coal and 2.8% was thermal coal. We sold 73.9% of total Met coal from our U.S. Operations into the seaborne Met coal markets for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
The Greenbrier mine remains idled since April 1, 2020, following the 2020 economic downturn and decline in demand induced by COVID-19 and is classified as held for sale in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Customers
We sell most of our coal to steel producers, either directly or through intermediaries, such as brokers. We also sell thermal coal to electricity generators either directly or through intermediaries such as brokers. Major consumers of our seaborne Met coal in 2021 were located in India, China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Brazil and Europe. These consumers are all major global steel or Met coke producers. The majority of our sales are made under contracts with terms of typically one year or on a spot basis. 
Tata Steel
Our U.S. Operations and Australian Operations are parties to a Long Term Coal Sale and Purchase Agreement with Tata Steel, or the Tata Steel Long Term Agreement, with a term ending in March 2022. We have commenced negotiations with TATA Steel to extend our long term relationship after the expiry of the current agreement. 

Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31, 2021 14


The Tata Steel Long Term Agreement provides for the sale of a minimum of 3.0 MMt of coal per contract year, consisting of certain specific quantities of Hard Coking Coal, or HCC, Semi Coking Coal and pulverized coal injection, or PCI, Coal. Pricing is re-negotiated each quarter, with coal sales priced in reference to benchmark indices. If we fail to agree on a quarterly price, the Tata Steel Long Term Agreement provides for alternative pricing based on historical market prices and the continuance of deliveries until an agreement on pricing can be reached. Coal sold pursuant to the Tata Steel Long Term Agreement is sold Free on Board (Incoterms 2010), or FOB, and the agreement contains industry-standard terms and conditions with respect to delivery, transportation, inspection, assignment, taxes and performance failure.
Xcoal
In 2021, we sold 2.2 MMt of coal to Xcoal Energy Resources LLC, or Xcoal, largely from our U.S. Operations. Coal revenues from Xcoal represented 28.3% of coal revenues from our U.S. Operations. Purchase orders with Xcoal are entered into primarily on an ad hoc (shipment-by-shipment) basis. Xcoal, as well as other customers, typically take ownership of coal upon loading into the rail car (FOR) and are responsible for handling transportation logistics to the port and beyond. From July 1, 2021, we agreed to credit terms with Xcoal, and any sales to Xcoal in excess of the credit amount are made on prepayment, letter of credit or cash on delivery terms. 
Stanwell
We are party to contractual arrangements with Stanwell, including a Coal Supply Agreement, or the CSA, and the Curragh Mine New Coal Supply Deed, dated August 14, 2018, or the Supply Deed.
Under the CSA, we deliver thermal coal from Curragh to Stanwell at an agreed price and quantity. Stanwell may vary the quantity of thermal coal purchased each year so the total quantity to be delivered to Stanwell each year cannot be precisely forecast. The coal that we supply to Stanwell constitutes the majority of the thermal coal production from Curragh. Our cost of supplying coal to Stanwell was greater than the price paid by Stanwell for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
Under the CSA, we also share part of the revenue earned from export Met coal sales (from particular Tenements (as defined below)) with Stanwell through various rebates. The most material rebate is the export price rebate, which is linked to the realized export coal price for a defined Met coal product, as follows:
•For the first 7.0 MMtpa of export coal sales: when the 12-month trailing, weighted-average realized export coal price of Reference coal exceeds the Tier 1 Rebate Coal Floor Price, we pay a rebate of 25% of the difference between the realized export coal price and the Tier 1 Rebate Coal Floor Price.
•For export coal sales above 7.0 MMtpa: when the 12-month trailing, weighted-average realized export coal price of Reference coal exceeds the Tier 2 Rebate Coal Floor Price, we pay a rebate of 10% of the difference between the realized export coal price and the Tier 2 Rebate Coal Floor Price.
The CSA also provides for:
•a tonnage rebate to Stanwell per Mt on the first 7.0 MMtpa of export coal sales and on export coal sales above 7.0 MMtpa; and
•a rebate on run-of-mine, or ROM, coal mined in the Curragh “Pit U East Area.”
The total Stanwell rebate for the year ended December 31, 2021, was $55.4 million and has been included in the consolidated statements of operations included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Supply Deed grants us the right to mine the coal reserves in the Stanwell Reserved Area, or the SRA. In exchange, we agreed to certain amendments to the CSA and to enter into a New Coal Supply Agreement, or the NCSA upon the expiration of the CSA (which is expected to occur in 2027). On July 12, 2019, we entered into the NCSA with Stanwell. From the earlier of the expiry of the CSA, the date of termination of the CSA, and January 1, 2029, we will continue to supply thermal coal to Stanwell under the NCSA. The term of the NCSA is expected to be 10 years, and Coronado will supply to Stanwell 2 million ‘Tonnes Equivalent’ of thermal coal per annum (based on a nominal gross calorific value of 25.6GJ) at a fixed contract price that varies in accordance with agreed formulae, inclusive of all statutory charges and royalties in respect of coal sold and delivered under

Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31, 2021 15


the NCSA. The export rebates which were payable under the CSA are not payable during the term of the NCSA. The supply term, the contract tonnage and the contract price under the NCSA are subject to adjustment in accordance with a financial model agreed between Stanwell and us. In summary, we have agreed that the total value of the discount received by Stanwell on coal supplied to it under the NCSA should (by the expiry date of the NCSA) be equal to the net present value of A$210 million as at the date of the Supply Deed. The net present value of the deferred consideration was $230.5 million as of December 31, 2021. On January 18, 2021, the Option Coal Supply Agreement, or the OCSA, contemplated by clause 5 of the NCSA was entered into, in respect of the supply of certain additional coal to Stanwell during the term of the NCSA.
See Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks related to the Supply Deed with Stanwell may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.”
Transportation
Coal produced at our mining properties is transported to customers by a combination of road, rail, barge and ship. See Item 2. “Properties” for descriptions of the transportation infrastructure available to each of our mining properties. Rail and port services are typically contracted on a long-term, take-or-pay basis in Australia, while these contracts are typically negotiated on a quarterly basis in the United States. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional information on our take-or-pay obligations.
Australian Operations
Our Australian Operations typically sell export coal FOB, with the customer paying for transportation from the outbound shipping port. The majority of Curragh’s export Met coal is railed approximately 300 kilometers to the Port of Gladstone for export via two main port terminals, RG Tanna Coal Terminal, or RGTCT, and Wiggins Island Coal Export Terminal, or WICET. Curragh also has capacity available to stockpile coal at the Port of Gladstone. For sales of thermal coal to Stanwell, Stanwell is responsible for the transport of coal to the Stanwell Power Station. 
Rail Services
Curragh is linked to the Blackwater rail line of the Central Queensland Coal Network, or CQCN, an integrated coal haulage rail system owned and operated by Aurizon Network Pty Ltd., or Aurizon Network. Curragh has secured annual rail haulage capacity of up to 12.0 MMtpa (plus surge capacity) under long-term rail haulage agreements with Aurizon Operations Limited, or Aurizon Operations, and Pacific National Holdings Pty Limited, or Pacific National. 
The RGTCT Coal Transport Services Agreement with Aurizon Operations is for 8.5 MMtpa of haulage capacity to RGTCT. Curragh pays a minimum monthly charge (components of which are payable on a take-or-pay basis), which is calculated with reference to the below-rail access charges, haulage/freight charges, a minimum annual tonnage charge and other charges. The RGTCT Coal Transport Services Agreement terminates on June 30, 2030.
The Coal Transport Services Agreement with Pacific National is for 1.0 MMtpa of haulage capacity to RGTCT. Curragh pays a minimum monthly charge (components of which are payable on a take-or-pay basis), which is calculated with reference to the below-rail access charges, haulage/freight charges, a minimum annual tonnage charge and other charges. The Coal Transport Services Agreement with Pacific National terminates on July 31, 2029. 
The Wiggins Island Rail Project, or WIRP, Transport Services Agreement with Aurizon Operations is for 2.0 MMtpa of capacity to WICET. This contract is effectively 100% take-or-pay (for a portion of the rail haulage and all capacity access charges). This agreement expires on June 30, 2030.
Port Services
Curragh exports coal through two terminals at the Port of Gladstone, RGTCT and WICET. At RGTCT, we and Gladstone Port Corporation Limited, or GPC, are parties to a coal handling agreement that expires on June 30, 2030. The agreement may be renewed at our request and, subject to certain conditions, GPC is required to agree

Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31, 2021 16


to the extension if there is capacity at RGTCT to allow the extension. We currently have the right to export between 7.7 MMtpa and 8.7 MMtpa at our nomination on a take-or-pay basis.
We have a minority interest in WICET Holdings Pty Ltd, whose wholly-owned subsidiary, Wiggins Island Coal Export Terminal Pty Ltd, or WICET Pty Ltd, owns WICET. Other coal producers who export coal through WICET also hold shares in WICET Holdings Pty Ltd. In addition, we and the other coal producers (or shippers) have take-or-pay agreements with WICET Pty Ltd and pay a terminal handling charge to export coal through WICET, which is calculated by reference to WICET’s annual operating costs, as well as finance costs associated with WICET Pty Ltd’s external debt facilities. Our take-or-pay agreement with WICET Pty Ltd, or the WICET Take-or-Pay Agreement, provides Curragh with export capacity of 1.5 MMtpa. The WICET Take-or-Pay Agreement is an “evergreen” agreement, with rolling ten-year terms. If we inform WICET Pty Ltd that we do not wish to continue to roll the term of the WICET Take-or-Pay Agreement, the term would be set at nine years and the terminal handling charge payable by us would be increased so that our proportion of WICET Pty Ltd’s debt is amortized to nil by the end of that nine-year term.
Under the WICET Take-or-Pay Agreement, we are obligated to pay for that capacity via terminal handling charges, whether utilized or not. The terminal handling charge payable by us can be adjusted by WICET Pty Ltd if our share of WICET Pty Ltd’s operational and finance costs increases, including because of increased operational costs or because another shipper defaults and has its capacity reduced to nil. The terminal handling charge is subject to a financing cap set out in the terminal handling charge methodology and has already been reached and is in force. If another shipper defaults under its take-or-pay agreement, each remaining shipper is effectively proportionately liable to pay that defaulting shipper’s share of WICET Pty Ltd’s costs going forward, in the form of increased terminal handling charges.
If we default under the WICET Take-or-Pay Agreement, we would be obligated to pay a termination payment to WICET Pty Ltd. The termination payment effectively represents our proportion of WICET Pty Ltd’s total debt outstanding, based on the proportion of our contracted tonnage to the total contracted tonnage of shippers at WICET at the time the payment is triggered. Shippers can also become liable to pay the termination payment where there is a permanent cessation of operations at WICET. Since WICET began shipping export tonnages in April 2015, four WICET Holdings Pty Ltd shareholders have entered into administration and Take-or-Pay Agreements subsequently terminated, resulting in the aggregate contracted tonnage of shippers decreasing from 27 MMtpa to 15.5 MMtpa.
Under the WICET Take-or-Pay Agreement, we are required to provide security (which is provided in the form of a bank guarantee). The amount of the security must cover our estimated liabilities as a shipper under the WICET Take-or-Pay Agreement for the following twelve-month period. If we are in default under the WICET Take-or-Pay Agreement and are subject to a termination payment, WICET Pty Ltd can draw on the security and apply it to amounts owing by us. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks related to our investment in WICET may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations” and Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional information on our take-or-pay obligations.
During 2019, Coronado entered into an Agreement with Washpool Coal Pty Ltd for assignment of their WICET capacity of 1.6 MMt per annum, on a take-or-pay basis for a term to June 30, 2022, at market rates.
U.S. Operations
Our U.S. Operations’ domestic contracts are generally priced FOR at the mine with customers bearing the transportation costs from the mine to the applicable end user. For direct sales to export customers, we hold the transportation contract and are responsible for the cost to the export facility, and the export customer is responsible for the transportation/freight cost from the export facility to the destination. A portion of our U.S. export sales are made through Xcoal and other intermediaries. For these sales, Xcoal or the intermediary typically take ownership of the coal as it is loaded into the railcar. The intermediary is responsible for the rail transportation and port costs.
Rail Services
Our U.S. Operations are served by Northfork Southern and CSX Transportation railroads. In 2021, we shipped approximately 95.4% of our total shipments via rail from our U.S. mining properties.

Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31, 2021 17


Northfork Southern railroad serves our Buchanan mining property and transports Buchanan’s coal to Lamberts Point Coal Terminal Pier 6 and to CNX Marine Terminal for export customers and to our domestic customers either directly or indirectly via inland river dock facilities where the coal is transloaded on to barges and then transported to the customer facilities.
CSX Transportation railroad serves our Logan and Greenbrier mining properties. CSX transports Logan and Greenbrier’s coal to Kinder Morgan Pier IX Terminal or CNX Marine Terminal or Dominion Terminal Associates (DTA) for export customers and either directly to the customers or to inland river dock facilities for domestic customers. 
Port Services
Norfolk Southern’s Lamberts Point Coal Terminal Pier 6 is the largest coal loading facility in the Northern Hemisphere with 48 million tons of annual export capacity and is the main terminal at the Lamberts Point located in Norfolk, Virginia. Kinder Morgan’s Pier IX is a coal export terminal with an annual export capacity of 16 million tons located in the Port of Hampton Roads in Newport News, Virginia.
Our U.S. Operations have dedicated inventory capacity and a take or pay obligation to transload one million net tons per year through Kinder Morgan’s Pier IX Terminal, which expires at the end of March 2024. Our U.S. Operations also have alternate port access through CNX Marine Terminal which is a transshipping terminal at the Port of Baltimore owned by CONSOL Energy.
DTA Terminal is a coal export terminal located in the Port of Hampton Roads in Newport News, Virginia. DTA Terminal is 65% owned by Alpha Metallurgical Resources and 35% by Arch Coal and has annual export capacity of 22 MMt.
Kanawha River Terminal is a Norfolk Southern/CSX-served coal terminal located on the Ohio River at mile marker 314.5, Ceredo, West Virginia.
Suppliers
The principal goods we purchase in support of our mining activities are mining equipment, replacement parts, diesel fuel, natural gas, ammonium-nitrate and emulsion-based explosives, off-road tires, steel-related products (including roof control materials), lubricants and electricity. As a general matter, we have many well-established, strategic relationships with our key suppliers of goods and do not believe that we are dependent on any of our individual suppliers.
We also depend on several major pieces of mining equipment and facilities to produce and transport coal, including, but not limited to, longwall mining systems, continuous miners, draglines, dozers, excavators, shovels, haul trucks, conveyors, coal preparation plants, or CPPs, and rail loading and blending facilities. Obtaining and repairing these major pieces of equipment and facilities often involves long lead times. We strive to extend the lives of existing equipment and facilities through maintenance practices and equipment rebuilds in order to defer the requirement for larger capital purchases. We use our global leverage with major suppliers to ensure security of supply to meet the requirements of our active mines. See Item 2. “Properties” for more information about operations at our mining properties.
We use contractors and other third parties for exploration, mining and other services, generally, and are reliant on a number of third parties for the success of our current operations and the advancement of our development projects. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Our profitability could be affected adversely by the failure of suppliers and/or outside contractors to perform.”
Thiess Mining Services Contract
We currently use Thiess Pty Ltd, or Thiess, as our primary mining contractor for our Australian Operations.
We are party to a long-term mining contract with Thiess to provide hydraulic excavator overburden and coal mining, pit dewatering, run of mine rehandling services and maintenance of Coronado owned heavy mobile equipment at the Curragh North operation until December 31, 2025, referred to as Part A Services; and to provide rope shovel overburden removal using Coronado’s rope shovel and Thiess supplied ultra-class truck services

Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31, 2021 18


until March 31, 2022, referred to as Part B Services. We are currently working towards finalizing agreements with Thiess to take on management and operation of additional mining fleets, including the rope shovel and ultra-class trucks currently included in the Part B Services. These new agreements are expected to commence following the expiry of the Part B Services.
Competition
We operate in a competitive environment. We compete with domestic and international coal producers, traders and brokers. We compete on price, coal quality, transportation, optionality, reputation and reliability. Demand for Met coal and the prices that we will be able to obtain for our Met coal are highly competitive and are determined predominantly by world markets, which are affected by numerous factors, including: general global, regional and local economic activity; changes in demand for steel and energy; industrial production levels; short-term constraints, including weather incidents; changes in the supply of seaborne coal; technological changes; changes in international freight or other transportation infrastructure rates and costs; the costs of other commodities and substitutes for coal; market changes in coal quality requirements; government regulations which restrict, or increase the cost of, using coal; tariffs imposed by countries, including the United States and Australia, on the import of certain steel products and any retaliatory tariffs by other countries; and tax impositions on the resources industry, all of which are outside of our control. In addition, coal prices are highly dependent on the outlook for coal consumption in large Asian economies, such as China, Japan, South Korea and India, as well as any changes in government policy regarding coal or energy in those countries. 
In developing our business plan and operating budget, we make certain assumptions regarding future Met coal prices, coal demand and coal supply. The prices we receive for our Met coal depend on numerous market factors beyond our control. Accordingly, some underlying coal price assumptions relied on by us may materially change and actual coal prices and demand may differ materially from those expected. Our business, operating and financial performance, including cash flows and asset values, may be materially and adversely affected by short- or long-term volatility in the prevailing prices of our products.
Competition in the coal industry is based on many factors, including, among others, world supply price, production capacity, coal quality and characteristics, transportation capability and costs, blending capability, brand name and diversified operations. We are subject to competition from producers in Australia, the United States, Canada, Russia, Mongolia and other coal producing countries. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors—We face significant competition, which could adversely affect profitability.”
Environmental Sustainability
We are focused on extracting high quality Met coal in an environmentally responsible way. Coal mining is one of the most environmentally regulated industries in the world, and it is vital that we consistently meet or exceed relevant regulatory standards.
We are subject to various environmental laws, regulations and public policies in Australia and the United States. Managing our environment and climate change risks is a key component of our corporate strategy and it is integrated into all stages and areas or our daily operations. We seek to minimize our environmental impact and ensure we meet or exceed our legislative and regulatory environmental obligations. 
Coronado’s environmental sustainability initiatives and strategy are discussed further in our 2020 Sustainability Report, which can be found on our website at www.coronadoglobal.com/sustainability/. Nothing on our website, including our 2020 Sustainability Report or sections thereof, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our 2021 Sustainability Report is expected to be available in May 2022. 
Climate change 
While our operations are recognized as vital contributors to the communities and economies in which we operate, we acknowledge that our mining activities create greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions. Climate change is one of the most significant issues for the steel industry and the industry has made significant reductions in GHG emissions by improving energy efficiency and using new technologies. Where possible, we are continuing to identify and implement GHG emissions and energy reduction opportunities across our business, whilst monitoring climate related risks and the sustainability of our operations. We are committed to working with other industry participants to support, develop and introduce new coal production and energy-generation technologies, that help reduce the environmental impact while continuing to meet global energy and steel demands.

Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31, 2021 19


Our Australian Operations disclose GHG scope 1 and 2 emissions annually to the Clean Energy Regulator under the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Scheme. Our U.S. Operations disclose GHG scope 1 and 2 emissions, including fugitive emissions (methane), for the facilities required to report their emissions annually to the United States Environmental Protection Agency. 
Our operations are currently focused on implementing reporting improvements, identifying opportunities for reducing emissions intention on a per ton of production basis and benchmarking ourselves against our peer group prior to setting any emission reduction targets. We are also evaluating a range of potential projects that could have a positive impact on our emissions profile including assessing options for a “behind the meter” type solar farm and opportunities to harvest incidental coal seam gas (fugitive emissions - Scope 1) to either generate electric power on site at Curragh or to use as a partial replacement for diesel fuel.
Increased public concern may result in additional regulatory risks as new laws and regulations aimed at reducing GHG emissions come into effect in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any legislation that limits or taxes GHG emissions could adversely impact our growth, increase our operating costs, or reduce demand for our coal. 
With respect to physical climate risks, our operations may be impacted by weather-related events potentially resulting in lost production, supply chain disruptions and increased operating costs, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial results of operations. 
On November 13, 2021, the Glasgow Conference of Parties 26, or COP26, agreed on the language around fossil fuels in the final Glasgow Climate Pact. A call on countries to “phase out” coal power was changed to “phase down of unabated coal power”, that is coal power that does not include the capture and storage of carbon dioxide emission. 190 countries have now agreed to phase down coal power. 65 countries have now committed to coal phase out, including more than 20 new commitments at COP26. 48 countries are members of the Powering Past Coal Alliance, or PPCA. All major coal financing countries have committed to end international coal finance by the end of 2021. As a result, Glasgow COP26 is expected to accelerate the trend of higher finance and insurance costs for coal miners and coal-fired power generators. The agreement on carbon accounting has also made global trade in carbon more likely, eventually accelerating the competitiveness of low-carbon solutions in the power and steel sectors.
Under the Paris Agreement, Australia must submit emissions reduction commitments known as Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs, which includes its national targets. Australia’s first NDC commitments are:
•2015 NDC: committed to reduce emissions by 26 to 28% below 2005 levels by 2030.
•2020 NDC update: affirmed the 2030 target, outlined Australia’s practical, technology-led approach to emission reductions, include new actions and measures since 2015.
•2021 NDC update: committed to net zero emissions by 2050, inscribed low emissions technology stretch goals, affirmed the 2030 target, and reported 2021 projections results showing Australia is on track to exceed this target by up to 9 percentage points.
Australia will submit its second NDC to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or UNFCCC, in 2025.
Human Capital Disclosures
Our ability to attract and retain skilled, motivated and engaged employees is an essential part of our business. Investing in the skill and capabilities of our people will underwrite our long-term growth and sustainability. In both Australia and United States, we operate in regional locations with highly competitive labor markets. In each location, we are creating a high-performing workforce with a talent pipeline for future leaders, including succession planning for critical roles. To achieve this, we continue to create a culture that welcomes and values all people and where our core values of collaboration, accountability, respect and excellence are demonstrated in everything that we do.
We had 1,577 employees as of December 31, 2021. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, there were 1,848 contractors supplementing the permanent workforce, primarily at Curragh.

Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31, 2021 20


As of December 31, 2021, approximately 12% of our total employees, all at our Australian Operations, were covered by a single, federally-certified collective Enterprise Agreement, or the EA, for specified groups of mining and maintenance employees. The EA links us with; the Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union; the Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union; the Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia; and our employees performing mining and operational functions. In May 2019, the Australian Fair Work Commission approved the Curragh Mine Enterprise Agreement 2019. This EA has a nominal expiration date of May 26, 2022 and will remain in place until replaced or terminated by the Fair Work Commission. Our U.S. Operations employ a 100% non-union labor force.
Safety
Our employees and contractors are our most valuable assets and we consider their safety our number one priority. Safety is essential to all business functions and is never to be compromised, under any circumstance. The health and safety of our people is reinforced every day through our culture, behaviors, training, communication and procedures. 
We manage safety and health through continuous improvement efforts and the implementation of practices and procedures that address safety risks in full compliance with the legal and regulatory frameworks of both the United States and Australia. We empower our people to consistently strive to have a safety mindset, and act by applying, managing and monitoring effective controls to prevent adverse outcomes with all activities and operations. Our programs are intended to reinforce our position that safety and health should always be front of mind for all employees and contractors. These programs are assessed on a regular basis to ensure they continue to be fit for purpose. We have robust training programs and strategic initiatives in place to ensure workers are informed about health and safety matters, including coal workers’ pneumoconiosis, or CWP, silicosis, hearing loss, and other occupational illnesses. In addition, we conduct sampling and health checks with our workers in line with health and safety legislative requirements. 
We recognize that the mental health and wellbeing of our employees is equally as important as physical health and acknowledge that the pandemic has had a significant impact on the mental health of communities and societies across the world. In 2021, we introduced an Employee Assistance Program, or EAP, in the U.S. and increased the promotion of the EAP service in Australia which has been in operation for a number of years. Both programs offer employees and their families confidential and free counselling services
Safety performance is monitored through physical observations from both internal and external parties and through the reporting of key metrics. Safety performance is assessed monthly against internal goals and on a quarterly basis is benchmarked against our peers within the mining industry. 
We set targets for safety interactions which is a process where employees observe a risk behavior and provide immediate feedback if it is deemed, or has the potential to be, unsafe. This is monitored by management daily through safety meetings, site visits, employee discussions, and management observations. The process allows for greater empowerment, innovation and employee input into the mining process. 
On November 21, 2021, one of our employees at the Curragh mine, was fatally injured while working in the dragline operations. The Resources Safety & Health Queensland Inspectorate subsequently issued directives requiring isolation of the accident site and temporary suspension of dragline operations at Curragh until the Inspectorate and the Company were satisfied that these activities could recommence safely. Work at the mine recommenced gradually from November 24, 2021, following return to work safety sessions involving all workers on site. On December 10, 2021, the Inspectorate allowed dragline operations to recommence. We have complied with all requirements of the Inspectorate in relation to the incident. 
The 12-month rolling average Total Reportable Injury Frequency Rate (“TRIFR”) as of December 31, 2021 for our Australian Operations was 3.07 and the Total Reportable Incident Rate (“TRIR”) for 12-month rolling average as of December 31, 2021 for our U.S. Operations was 2.51. As indicated in the graphs below, our Australian Operations outperformed the Queensland industry average in 2020 and 2021 and our U.S. Operations outperformed the U.S. national average in 2020 and 2021. We strive to ensure that we continue to provide a safe operating environment for all employees and contractors.

Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31, 2021 21



The safety and wellbeing of our workforce remains our highest priority and we continue to manage the potential threat of COVID-19 at our mines and offices. The Company’s COVID-19 Steering Committee, formed in 2020, has successfully monitored the effect of the pandemic across our Australian Operations and U.S. Operations and continues to implement proactive preventative measures to ensure the safety and well-being of employees and contractors. See “—COVID-19” above for more information.
Workforce composition and diversity
Our values (CARE – Collaboration, Accountability, Respect, Excellence) guide our policies, processes and actions as they relate to all workforce interactions and people related initiatives. As part of these values and to enable our people to excel within the workplace we are building a diverse and inclusive workforce, where unique viewpoints are heard, valued and respected. We believe this directly impacts the safety and productivity of our people. Our employees are trained to recognize and mitigate potential biases towards others. We continue to invest in training initiatives to challenge hiring managers’ unconscious bias and preconceptions. These initiatives have equipped our leaders with knowledge and tools to identify and challenge stereotypes and biased decision making. It also led to the review of policies and processes that may have inhibited the hiring and promotion of certain people. This included reviewing the wording used in job advertisements and challenging what has historically been regarded as essential experience to ensure that people entering the industry, or who have taken a career break, are not unintentionally disadvantaged.
We invest in training and development programs for both our new and long-serving employees. Investing in graduate recruitment, traineeships and internship programs through partnerships with leading education institutions has been central to accessing talent and building our brand. Further, our internal leadership development enhances succession planning and the transfer of skills and knowledge across our business.
As at December 31, 2021:
•in the United States, close to 9% of Senior Managers were female.
•in Australia, 28% of employees at a General Manager, Senior Manager and Senior Professional level were female, an increase of approximately 4% from December 31, 2020.
•in Australia, 33% of new employees were female.
•7% of our global workforce were female.
•61% of all employees were between the ages of 30 and 50 year.
We supported 2 of our female employees in Australia to participate in the Women’s Mentoring Program run by Women in Mining and Resources Queensland (WIMARQ). This program was created in response to identified demand for formal mentoring for women working in Queensland’s minerals and energy sectors and to improve retention and progression of women in our sector. It provides a structured, sustainable mentoring process that

Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31, 2021 22


supports women through career guidance and direction by sharing experiences, developing goals and forging exceptional mentoring relationships beyond the program’s duration.
Attracting and retaining the right people
We continued to focus our efforts on recruiting trainees and other entry level roles. We have also implemented the following initiatives: 
•Comprehensive training, performance and leadership development programs.
•Competitive and flexible remuneration structure.
We have continuous improvement and feedback mindset in relation to further promoting employee engagement and motivation. Across our business there is concerted effort to develop leadership skills, foster and inclusive working environment, and assist managers improve engagement and productivity. 
In 2021, our total rolling turnover rate was 27.9% and 18.4% and our voluntary departure rolling turnover rate was 17.3% and 15.4%, in Australia and the U.S., respectively. In 2020, our total rolling turnover rate was 14.3% and 36.5% and our voluntary departure rolling turnover rate was 8% and 11%, in Australia and the U.S., respectively. 
Regulatory Matters—Australia
Our Australian Operations are regulated by the laws and regulations of the Commonwealth of Australia, or Cth, the State of Queensland, or Qld, and local jurisdictions. Most environmental laws are promulgated at the state level, but the Australian federal government has a role in approval of actions which have national environmental significance. In Queensland, the environmental laws relevant to coal mining include development legislation, pollution, waste, ecosystem protection, cultural heritage and native title land contamination and rehabilitation legislation. In addition, the Australian federal government regulates foreign investment and export approvals.
Tenements
We control the coal mining rights at Curragh under 14 coal and infrastructure mining leases, or MLs, and three mineral development licenses, or MDLs, granted pursuant to the Mineral Resources Act 1989 (Qld). We refer to the MLs and MDLs at Curragh, collectively, as the Tenements. Renewal of certain Tenements will be required during the mine life of Curragh and the Queensland government can vary the terms and conditions on renewal. There are a number of existing mining and petroleum tenements which overlap with the Tenements. The priority, consent and coordination requirements under the Mineral Resources Act 1989 (Qld), the Petroleum and Gas (Production and Safety) Act 2004 (Qld) and Mineral and Energy Resources (Common Provisions) Act 2014 (Qld) (as relevant) may apply with respect to those overlaps. Extensive statutory protocols govern the relationships between co-existing mining and exploration rights and these protocols are largely focused on encouraging the overlapping tenement holders to negotiate and formulate arrangements that enable the co-existence of their respective interests. See Item 2. “Properties” for more information regarding the Tenements.
Mineral Resources Act 1989 (Qld)
The Mineral Resources Act 1989 (Qld) and the Mineral and Energy Resources (Common Provisions) Act 2014 (Qld), together, provide for the assessment, development and utilization of mineral resources in Queensland to the maximum extent practicable, consistent with sound economic and land use management. The Mineral Resources Act 1989 (Qld) vests ownership of minerals, with limited exceptions, in the Crown (i.e., the state government). A royalty is payable to the Crown for the right to extract minerals. The Mineral Resources Act 1989 (Qld) creates different tenures for different mining activities, such as prospecting, exploring and mining. A ML is the most important tenure, as it permits the extraction of minerals in conjunction with other required authorities. The Mineral Resources Act 1989 (Qld) imposes general conditions on a ML.
A person who is the holder of a ML must keep the records necessary to enable the royalty payable by the person to be ascertained. The royalty payable on the value of coal sold, disposed of or used (post October 1, 2012) is as set out below:

Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31, 2021 23


•if the average price per Mt is A$100 or less: 7%;
•if the average price per Mt is more than A$100 but less than or equal to A$150: 7% on the first A$100 and 12.5% on the balance of the average price per Mt; and
•if the average price per Mt is A$150 or more: 7% on the first A$100, 12.5% on the next A$50 and 15% on the balance of the price per Mt.
The royalty payable for coal sold, disposed of or used in a return period is then calculated by multiplying the royalty rate by the value of the coal. Queensland Revenue Office Royalty Ruling MRA001.1 contains details on the costs that can (and cannot) be deducted when calculating the applicable royalty and the method for determining the value of the coal. Where there is a change in legislation or case law that affects the content of a royalty ruling, the change in the law overrides the royalty ruling—i.e., the Commissioner will determine the royalty liability in accordance with the changed law. See Item 2. “Properties” for a discussion of the royalties currently applicable to Curragh.
Mining Rehabilitation (Reclamation)
Mine closure and rehabilitation risks and costs are regulated by Queensland state legislation.
Amongst other things, an Environmental Authority Holder, or EA Holder, must provide the Queensland State Government with financial assurance for the purpose of drawing upon in the event that an EA Holder defaults on its obligations to rehabilitate the mine site.
The Mineral and Energy Resources (Financial Provisioning) Act 2018 (Qld), or the Financial Provisioning Act establishes a financial provisioning scheme, or the Scheme, from which the Department of Environment and Science, or the DES, sources funds to rehabilitate and remediate land subject to mining.
Under the Financial Provisioning Act, all mine operators are required to make a submission to the DES in respect of an Estimated Rehabilitation Cost, or ERC, for the mine site. The ERC is determined using the DES-approved ERC calculator. Using this information, the DES sets the ERC for the mine. The DES provides the ERC to the manager of the Scheme, or the Scheme Manager. The Scheme Manager undertakes a risk assessment of the mine, which is based upon independent advice from a scheme risk advisor. It includes detail on the mine operator’s financial soundness and credit rating, characteristics of the mining operation (e.g., life of mine, or LOM, and off-take agreements), rehabilitation history, environmental compliance history and the submission made by the company. Risk categories include high, moderate, low and very low. If the ERC and risk categories are set at moderate, low or very low for a mine, then there is a need to pay an annual contribution based on a small percentage of the ERC to the Scheme. If the category is high, then the operation provides a surety for the whole ERC and possibly a contribution to the Scheme. The risk assessment of the mine and, therefore, the amount of the contribution to the fund is assessed and paid annually in perpetuity, or until a clearance certificate is obtained. 
Each year, the Scheme Manager is required to make an Annual Review Allocation to determine whether the mine will provide surety or pay a contribution to the Scheme depending on the value of the ERC relating to applicable environmental authorities, as follows:
1) ERC < A$100,000 - cash surety or bank guarantees
2) ERC = A$100,000 – A$450 million - pay a cash contribution into the Scheme
3) ERC > A$450 million - pay a cash contribution into the Scheme and provide bank guarantees.

Curragh has 2 environmental authorities, or EAs, which are covered by the Scheme, namely EA number EPML00643713 and EA number EPVX00635313. Under the transitional arrangements for the Scheme, Curragh’s existing financial assurance arrangements were deemed to be the ERC for both environmental authority number EPML00643713 and AE number EPVX00635313. In September 2020, Curragh applied for a new ERC in respect of EA number EPML00643713 which applies for the period from 3 November 2020 to 2 November 2022.
In October 2021, the Scheme Manager completed the assessment of the Annual Review Allocation for EA number EPML00643713 and issued an Annual Review Allocation of “Moderate”. The moderate rating resulted in Curragh being obliged to make a financial contribution to the Scheme of 2.75% of the ERC. In January 2022, the Scheme Manager completed an assessment of the Annual Review Allocation for EA number EPVX00635313

Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31, 2021 24


and issued an Annual Review Allocation of “High” in respect of MDL162 requiring Curragh to maintain its historical financial assurance in respect of 100% of the ERC for Environmental Authority Number EPVX00635313.
The Financial Provisioning Act also requires for a Progressive Rehabilitation and Closure Plan, or a PRCP, with respect to mined land. This requirement will be integrated into the existing EA processes for new mines, minimizing the regulatory burden on government and industry. All mining projects carried out under a ML that make a site-specific EA application will be required to provide a PRCP. If approved by the administering authority, a stand-alone PRCP schedule will be given to the applicant together with the EA. The PRCP schedule will contain milestones with completion dates for achieving progressive rehabilitation of the mine site. The Financial Provisioning Act provides transitional arrangements for three years for the application of the PRCP requirement to existing mines. The requirement for a PRCP commenced on November 1, 2019, or the PRCP start date, however all existing mining operations only transition into the PRCP framework once a transition notice is issued by the relevant government department. Curragh has been issued with a transition notice with respect to its PRCP and is required to submit the proposed PRCP to the administering authority by October 21, 2022.
Environmental Protection Act 1994 (Qld)
The primary legislation regulating environmental management of mining activities in Queensland is the Environmental Protection Act 1994 (Qld), or the EP Act. Its objective is to protect Queensland’s environment while allowing for development that improves the total quality of life, both now and in the future, in a way that maintains ecologically sustainable development. Under the EP Act, it is an offense to carry out a mining activity unless the person holds or is acting under an EA for the activity. The EA imposes conditions on a project. It is an offense to contravene a condition of an EA. In addition to the requirements found in the conditions of an EA, the holder must also meet its general environmental duty and duty to notify of environmental harm and otherwise comply with the provisions of the EP Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. For example, the following are offenses under the EP Act:
•causing serious or material environmental harm;
•causing environmental nuisance;
•depositing proscribed water contaminants in waters and related matters; and
•placing contaminants where environmental harm or nuisance may be caused.
The EA holder must also be a registered suitable operator under the EP Act. We are a registered suitable operator.
We hold EA EPML00643713, which authorizes the mining of black coal, mineral processing, chemical storage, waste disposal and sewage treatment over the 14 MLs at Curragh on certain conditions. Those conditions include requirements in relation to air and water quality, regulated structures (e.g., dams), noise and vibration, waste, land use, rehabilitation and watercourse diversion.
We also hold a range of subsidiary EAs for our Australian Operations. See “—Mining Rehabilitation (Reclamation)” above for more information regarding the Financial Provisioning Act. 
Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act 2003 (Qld)
The Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act 2003 (Qld) imposes a duty of care on all persons to take all reasonable and practicable measures to ensure that any activity conducted does not harm Aboriginal cultural heritage. Its object is to provide effective recognition, protection and conservation of Aboriginal cultural heritage.
We have obligations relating to Aboriginal cultural heritage with respect to a number of cultural heritage objects and areas located within the area of the Tenements. We work closely with the Aboriginal people to manage the cultural heritage objects, areas or evidence of archaeological significance, within our mining operations. We are party to a Cultural Heritage Management Plan (and associated Cultural Services Agreement) with the Gaangalu Nation People that applies to all of the Tenements. The plan establishes a coordinating committee and sets out the steps to be followed to manage activities that may impact Aboriginal cultural heritage.

Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31, 2021 25


Native Title Act 1993 (Cth)
The Native Title Act 1993 (Cth), or NTA, sets out procedures under which native title claims may be lodged and determined and compensation claimed for the extinguishment or impairment of the native title rights or interests of Aboriginal peoples. Its object is to provide for the recognition and protection of native title, to establish ways in which future dealings affecting native title may proceed and to set standards for those dealings, to establish a mechanism for determining claims to native title and to provide for, or permit, the validation of past acts, and intermediate period acts, invalidated because of the existence of native title.
With respect to MLs and MDLs granted under the Mineral Resources Act 1989 (Qld) on state land where native title has not been extinguished, a principle known as the non-extinguishment principle governs. Broadly, under this principle, native title rights are suspended while the mining tenure, as renewed from time to time, is in force. The grant (or renewal) of a mining tenure in respect of land where native title may exist must comply with the NTA to ensure the validity of the tenure. Registered native title claimants have certain notification, consultation and negotiation rights relating to mining tenures. Where native title is extinguished (i.e., freehold land), the NTA does not apply.
Regional Planning Interests
The Regional Planning Interests Act 2014 (Qld), or the RPI Act manages the impact of resource activities and other regulated activities in areas of the state that contribute, or are likely to contribute, to Queensland’s economic, social and environmental prosperity (e.g., competing land use activities on prime farming land). The RPI Act identifies areas of Queensland that are of regional interest, including strategic cropping areas and strategic environmental areas. Under the RPI Act, conducting a resource activity in an area of regional interest requires a regional interest development approval, unless operating under an exemption. Importantly, pre-existing mining activities being undertaken at the date of the introduction of the legislation are exempt.
We applied for and were granted a regional interest development approval for the “Curragh Expansion Project” (for ML700006, ML 700007 and ML700008), which is subject to regional interest conditions, such as mitigation. Certain protection conditions were also imposed on us with respect to our application for ML 80171 (which has since been granted). These include an obligation to provide mitigation in the event that strategic cropping land is impacted by future operations.
Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth)
The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth), or the EPBC Act, provides a federal framework to protect and manage matters of national environmental significance, such as listed threatened species and ecological communities and water resources. In addition, the EPBC Act confers jurisdiction over actions that have a significant impact on the environment where the actions affect, or are taken on, Commonwealth land, or are carried out by a Commonwealth agency.
Under the EPBC Act, “controlled actions” that have or are likely to have a significant impact on a matter of national environmental significance are subject to a rigorous assessment and approval process. A person must not take a “controlled action” unless approval is granted under the EPBC Act. Any person proposing to carry out an “action” that may be a “controlled action” must refer the matter to the Commonwealth Minister for a determination as to whether the proposed action is a controlled action.
On November 2, 2016, the Commonwealth Minister for the Department of the Environment and Energy administering the EPBC Act approved the extension of the existing Curragh mining area to include mining four additional Tenements—ML 700006, ML 700007, ML 700008 and ML 700009 (EPBC Act referral 2015/7508)—as a “controlled action,” on certain conditions. The conditions include requirements in relation to offsets and groundwater.
Mine Health and Safety
The primary health and safety legislation that applies to Curragh are the Coal Mining Safety and Health Act 1999 (Qld) and the Coal Mining Safety and Health Regulation 2001 (Qld), which we refer to, together, as the Coal Mining Safety Legislation.

Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31, 2021 26


Additional legislative requirements apply to operations that are carried on off-site or which are not principally related to coal mining (e.g., transport, rail operations, etc.). The Coal Mining Safety Legislation imposes safety and health obligations on persons who operate coal mines or who may affect the safety or health of others at coal mines. Under the Coal Mining Safety Legislation, the operator of a coal mine must, among other things:
•ensure that the risk to coal mine workers while at the operator’s mine is at an acceptable level;
•audit and review the effectiveness and implementation of the safety and health management system to ensure the risk to persons is at an acceptable level;
•provide adequate resources to ensure the effectiveness and implementation of the safety and health management system;
•ensure the operator’s own safety and health and the safety and health of others is not affected by the way the operator conducts coal mining operations;
•not carry out an activity at the coal mine that creates a risk to a person on an adjacent or overlapping petroleum authority if the risk is higher than an acceptable level of risk;
•appoint a site senior executive for the mine;
•ensure the site senior executive develops and implements a safety and health management system for all people at the mine;
•ensure the site senior executive develops, implements and maintains a management structure for the mine that helps ensure the safety and health of persons at the mine; and
•not operate the coal mine without a safety and health management system for the mine.
We recognize that health and safety are imperative to the ongoing success of our Australian Operations. As the operator at Curragh, we have in place a comprehensive safety and health management system, which includes an emergency response team, to address these legislative requirements. In accordance with the Coal Mining Safety Legislation we have also established an occupational hygiene baseline for dust exposure at Curragh.
Water Act 2000 (Qld)
In Queensland, all entitlements to the use, control and flow of water are vested in the state and regulated by the Water Act 2000 (Qld). Allocations under the Water Act 2000 (Qld) can be managed by a water supply scheme operator, such as SunWater Ltd, which is a Government-owned corporation regulated by the Queensland Competition Authority. We have purchased the required water allocations for Curragh and entered into a suite of related channel and pipeline infrastructure agreements and river supply agreements with SunWater Ltd to regulate the supply of water pursuant to these allocations. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors—In times of drought and/or shortage of available water, our operations and production, particularly at Curragh, could be negatively impacted if the regulators impose restrictions on our water offtake licenses that are required for water used in the CPPs.”
National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 (Cth).
The National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 (Cth) imposes requirements for both foreign and local corporations whose carbon dioxide production, greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions and/or energy consumption meets a certain threshold to register and report GHG emissions and abatement actions, as well as energy production and consumption as part of a single, national reporting system. The Clean Energy Regulator administers the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 (Cth), and the Department of Environment and Energy is responsible for related policy developments and review.
In accordance with the Emissions Reduction Fund Safeguard Mechanism under this legislation, Curragh has been assigned a baseline for its covered emissions and we must take steps to keep our emissions at or below the baseline or face penalties.

Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31, 2021 27


Labor Relations
Minimum employment entitlements, embodied in the National Employment Standards, apply to all private-sector employees and employers in Australia under the federal Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth). These standards regulate employment conditions and paid leave. Employees who are associated with the day-to-day operations of a local mine or mines and who are not located in head office or corporate administration offices are also covered by the Black Coal Mining Industry Award 2010 which regulates conditions including termination arrangements; pay and hours of work.
Unfair dismissal, enterprise bargaining, bullying claims, industrial actions and resolution of workplace disputes are also regulated under state and federal legislation. Some of the workers at Curragh are covered by the EA, which was approved by the Fair Work Commission, Australia’s national workplace relations tribunal. See “—Human Capital Disclosures” above.
Regulatory Matters—United States
Federal, state and local authorities regulate the U.S. coal mining industry with respect to matters such as employee health and safety, protection of the environment, permitting and licensing requirements, air quality standards, water pollution, plant and wildlife protection, the reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining has been completed, the discharge of materials into the environment, surface subsidence from underground mining and the effects of mining on groundwater quality and availability. In addition, the industry is affected by significant requirements mandating certain benefits for current and retired coal miners. Numerous federal, state and local governmental permits and approvals are required for mining operations. Because of extensive and comprehensive regulatory requirements, violations during mining operations occur from time to time in the industry. The summary below is a non-exhaustive summary of material legislation that applies to our U.S. Operations. Although this summary focuses on federal laws, most states (including Virginia, West Virginia and Pennsylvania) have their own regulatory schemes that either mirror federal laws or create additional layers of regulation.
Clean Air Act of 1970
The U.S. Clean Air Act of 1970, or the CAA, regulates airborne pollution that may be potentially detrimental to human health, the environment or natural resources. The CAA and comparable state laws that govern air emissions affect U.S. coal mining operations both directly and indirectly.
Direct impacts on coal mining and processing operations may occur through the CAA permitting requirements and/or emission control requirements relating to particulate matter, or PM, nitrogen dioxide, ozone and sulfur dioxide, or SO2. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, pursuant to the CAA, administers rules that apply PM emissions limits to emissions from coal preparation and processing plants constructed or modified after April 28, 2008. In addition, in recent years, the EPA has adopted more stringent national ambient air quality standards, or NAAQS for PM, nitrogen oxide, ozone and SO2. It is possible that these modifications as well as future modifications to NAAQS could directly or indirectly impact our mining operations in a manner that includes, but is not limited to, the EPA designating new areas of the country as being in nonattainment of applicable NAAQS or expanding existing nonattainment areas, and prompting additional local control measures pursuant to state implementation plans, or SIPs, required to address such revised NAAQS. SIPs may be state-specific or regional in scope. Under the CAA, individual states have up to 12 years from the date of designation of attainment/nonattainment areas to secure reductions from emission sources. 
The CAA also indirectly, but significantly, affects the U.S. coal industry by extensively regulating the SO2, nitrogen oxides, mercury, PM, greenhouse gases, and other substances emitted by coal-burning facilities, such as steel manufacturers, coke ovens and coal-fired electric power generating facilities. Over time, the EPA has promulgated or proposed CAA regulations to impose more stringent air emission standards for a number of these coal-burning industries, especially the power generation sector. While the EPA under the Trump Administration moved toward repealing or loosening some of those regulations, it is unclear the extent to which the Trump Administration’s deregulatory changes for coal-burning facilities under the CAA will survive under the Biden Administration. This is particularly the case for greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired electric generating facilities, as President Biden has called for bringing the U.S. power sector to zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2035. Collectively, CAA regulations and uncertainty around future CAA requirements could reduce the demand

Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31, 2021 28


for coal and, depending on the extent of such reduction, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operations.
NAAQS Revisions. The CAA requires the EPA to periodically review and, if appropriate, revise the NAAQS to ensure protection of public health. In recent years, the EPA has reviewed the NAAQS for PM, ozone and SO2. The PM NAAQS was last revised and made more stringent in 2012. Individual states have developed SIPs, which detail the PM emission reductions their sources must meet in order for the state to maintain or achieve the 2012 PM NAAQS. On April 14, 2020, the EPA announced its intention to retain, without changes, the 2012 PM NAAQS. This action was finalized by EPA on December 18, 2020. On June 10, 2021, EPA announced that it would reconsider this decision in light of scientific evidence pointing to health issues caused by exposure to PM. EPA expects to issue a proposed rule with more stringent standards for PM in Summer 2022 and a final rule in Spring 2023.
In 2015, the EPA issued a final rule reducing the primary ozone NAAQS from 75 to 70 parts per billion but retaining the existing secondary ozone NAAQS. States with moderate or high nonattainment areas must submit SIPs for the 2015 ozone NAAQS by October 2021. Environmental and industry groups challenged the 2015 ozone NAAQS in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. On August 23, 2019, the court denied all the petitions for review against the 2015 primary NAAQS but concluded that the EPA had not provided a sufficient rationale for its decision on the 2015 secondary NAAQS and remanded that standard to the EPA. Prior to the court’s decision, EPA initiated another periodic review of the ozone NAAQS. This most recent review culminated in a final rule by the EPA on December 31, 2020 to retain all aspects of the 2015 ozone NAAQS, including the secondary standard with additional rationale in response to the court’s 2019 decision. It remains to be seen whether there will be legal challenges to the December 2020 final rule, or whether the EPA will reconsider the rule under the new administration. More stringent ozone or PM NAAQS, if promulgated, would require new SIPs to be developed and filed with the EPA and may trigger additional control technology for mining equipment or coal-burning facilities, or result in additional challenges to permitting and expansion efforts. This could also be the case with respect to the implementation of any new requirements triggered by any future, more stringent NAAQS for nitrogen oxide and SO2, although the EPA promulgated a final rule on March 18, 2019 that retains, without revision, the existing NAAQS for SO2 of 75 parts per billion average over an hour.
Cross State Air Pollution Rule, or CSAPR. The CAA includes a so-called Good Neighbor Provision that requires upwind states to eliminate their significant contributions to downwind states’ nonattainment of the NAAQS. On July 6, 2011, the EPA finalized the CSAPR, which was meant to satisfy this Good Neighbor Provision. CSAPR requires the District of Columbia and 27 states from Texas eastward (not including the New England states or Delaware) to reduce power plant emissions that cross state lines and significantly contribute to ozone and/or fine particle pollution in downwind states. Following litigation in the D.C. Circuit and U.S. Supreme Court, the first phase of the nitrogen oxide and SO2 emissions reductions required by CSAPR commenced in January 2015; further reductions of both pollutants in the second phase of CSAPR became effective in January 2017. 
On October 26, 2016, the EPA published the final CSAPR Update Rule to address implementation of the 2008 NAAQS for ground-level ozone. This rule imposed further reductions in nitrogen oxides emissions beginning in 2017 in 22 upwind states subject to CSAPR. According to the EPA, these reductions would reduce, but not eliminate, the upwind states’ significant contributions to downwind states’ air pollution. The CSAPR Update Rule did not include any deadline by which upwind states would have to completely eliminate their significant contributions to downwind states’ air pollution. The EPA maintained, however, that the rule would assist downwind states in bringing their areas of “moderate” nonattainment with the 2008 ozone NAAQS into compliance by the CAA-mandated July 20, 2018 deadline. 
On December 6, 2018, the EPA followed up the CSAPR Update Rule with the CSAPR Close-Out. Pursuant to the CSAPR Close Out, the EPA found that it would not be feasible to impose cost-effective emissions on twenty upwind states before 2023, which was two years after the CAA-mandated 2021 deadline for states to bring their areas of “severe” nonattainment into compliance with the 2008 NAAQS. The EPA further concluded that the downwind states would achieve compliance with the 2008 NAAQS by 2023 even without further reductions by the upwind states, and the CSAPR Close-Out therefore required no further reductions from the upwind states beyond those required by the CSAPR Update Rule.
The CSAPR Update Rule and the CSAPR Close-Out were both challenged in the D.C. Circuit. On September 13, 2019, the D.C. Circuit found that upwind states had to eliminate any significant contributions to downwind states’ air pollution by the applicable 2008 NAAQS for ground-level ozone deadline, regardless of questions of

Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31, 2021 29


feasibility. Pursuant to the D.C. Circuit’s ruling, the CSAPR Update Rule was remanded to the EPA. On October 1, 2019, the D.C. Circuit issued a judgment vacating the CSAPR Close-Out on the same basis.
On October 15, 2020, EPA proposed the Revised CSAPR Update Rule, which fully addressed twenty-one states’ outstanding interstate pollution transport obligations for the 2008 NAAQS for ozone. For nine states, EPA found that their projected 2021 emissions do not significantly contribute to non-attainment and/or maintenance problems in downwind states. The remaining twelve states were found to contribute to the non-attainment and/or maintenance problems in downwind states. EPA proposed to issue new or amended Federal Implementation Plans requiring additional emissions reductions from electricity generating units in those states beginning in the 2021 ozone season. On March 15, 2021, EPA finalized a rule update that requires additional emissions reduction of nitrogen oxides from power plants in twelve states. Additional emission reduction requirements in these states could adversely affect the demand for coal.
Mercury and Air Toxic Standards, or MATS. The EPA published the final MATS rule in the Federal Register on February 16, 2012. The MATS rule revised the New Source Performance Standards, or NSPS, for nitrogen oxides, SO2 and PM for new and modified coal-fueled electricity generating plants, and imposed Maximum Achievable Control Technology, or MACT, emission limits on hazardous air pollutants, or HAPs, from new and existing coal-fueled and oil-fueled electricity generating plants. MACT standards limit emissions of mercury, acid gas HAPs, non-mercury HAP metals and organic HAPs. The rule provided three years for compliance with MACT standards and a possible fourth year if a state permitting agency determined that such was necessary for the installation of controls. Although the MATS rule has been and continues to be the subject of EPA review and litigation, it remains in effect and has contributed to the need for many coal-fired power plants to install addition pollution controls, convert to natural gas, or retire
Following issuance of the final MATS rule, numerous petitions for review were filed. After proceedings before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, the U.S. Supreme Court on June 29, 2015 held that EPA interpreted the CAA unreasonably when it deemed cost irrelevant to the decision to regulate HAPs from new and existing coal-fueled and oil-fueled power plants. The Supreme Court remanded the case to the D.C. Circuit, which ultimately allowed the rule to remain in effect while EPA promulgated a series of supplemental findings on the costs and benefits of the rule in response to the Supreme Court’s ruling. 
Most recently, on May 22, 2020, the EPA finalized a supplemental finding, or Supplemental Cost Finding, that health and environmental benefits not directly related to mercury pollution should not be included in the benefit portion of the analysis. Using this framework EPA found that the costs of the MATS rule “grossly outweigh” any possible benefits and, therefore, that that regulating HAPs from coal-fired and oil-fired power plants is not “appropriate and necessary” under the CAA. However, EPA determined that while it could revise the cost-benefit analysis for the MATS rule, it could not remove coal-fired plants from HAPs regulation. The MATS rule therefore remains in effect. EPA also determined in the Supplemental Cost Finding that the MATS rule is adequately protective of public health, as required by the CAA’s residual risk and technology review provisions. Westmoreland Mining Holdings, a coal company, filed a petition with the D.C. Circuit in May 2020 challenging the legality of the MATS rule. Health and medical groups and other industry groups filed a petition of review opposing the Supplemental Cost Finding, and its reversal of the previous finding that it was “appropriate and necessary” to regulate HAPs. Environmental groups also challenge the EPA’s residual risk and technology review of the MATS rule, arguing that more stringent standards are necessary. This litigation remains ongoing. While the vast majority of coal-fired power producers have already complied with the 2012 MATS rule standards, any future reductions in the standards due to the ongoing litigation or additional EPA action could increase the cost of coal-fired electric power generation and negatively impact the demand for coal.
Clean Power Plan and Affordable Clean Energy, or ACE. In 2014, the EPA proposed a sweeping rule, known as the “Clean Power Plan,” to cut carbon emissions from existing electricity generating units, including coal-fired power plants. A final version of the Clean Power Plan was adopted in August 2015. The Clean Power Plan aimed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from electrical power generation by 32% by 2030 relative to 2005 levels through the reduction of emissions from coal-burning power plants and increased use of renewable energy and energy conservation methods. Under the Clean Power Plan, states were free to reduce emissions by various means and were to submit emissions reduction plans to the EPA by September 2016 or, with an approved extension, September 2018. If a state had not submitted a plan by then, the Clean Power Plan authorized the EPA to impose its own plan on that state. In order to determine a state’s goal, the EPA divided the country into three regions based on connected regional electricity grids. States were to implement their plans by focusing on (i) increasing the generation efficiency of existing fossil fuel plants, (ii) substituting lower carbon dioxide emitting

Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31, 2021 30


natural gas generation for coal-powered generation and (iii) substituting generation from new zero carbon dioxide emitting renewable sources for fossil fuel powered generation. States were permitted to use regionally available low carbon generation sources when substituting for in-state coal generation and to coordinate with other states to develop multi-state plans. 
Following adoption, in 2015 twenty-seven states sued the EPA in the D.C. Circuit, claiming that the EPA overstepped its legal authority in adopting the Clean Power Plan. In February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered the EPA to halt enforcement of the Clean Power Plan until the lower court ruled on the lawsuit and until the Supreme Court determined whether or not to hear the case. 
In a parallel litigation, twenty-five states and other parties filed lawsuits challenging the EPA’s final NSPS rules for carbon dioxide emissions from new, modified, and reconstructed power plants under the CAA. One of the primary issues in these lawsuits was the EPA’s establishment of standards of performance based on technologies including carbon capture and sequestration, or CCS. New coal plants could not meet the new standards unless they implement CCS. In conjunction with the EPA’s proposal to rescind the Clean Power Plan, the EPA also requested a stay of the NSPS litigation. The D.C. Circuit granted the request. 
In October 2017, the EPA commenced rulemaking proceedings to rescind the Clean Power Plan, and in December 2017, the EPA published an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking announcing its intent to commence a new rulemaking to replace the Clean Power Plan with an alternative framework for regulating carbon dioxide. The rulemaking would culminate in the EPA replacing the Clean Power Plan with ACE. On September 17, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit dismissed the Clean Power Plan litigation and NSPS litigation as moot in light of the ACE rule. 
On June 19, 2019, the EPA finalized the ACE rule as a replacement for the Clean Power Plan. The ACE rule establishes emission guidelines for states to develop plans to address greenhouse gas emissions from existing coal-fired power plants. The ACE rule has several components: a determination of the best system of emission reduction for greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants, a list of “candidate technologies” states can use when developing their plans, and new implementing regulations for emission guidelines under Section 111(d) of the CAA. Unlike the Clean Power Plan, the ACE rule only includes as candidate technologies those that increase the efficiency of individual emission units, also referred to as heat rate improvement measures; the ACE rule does not include other methods such as co-firing with natural gas or adding renewable generation facilities. 
Upon finalization of the ACE rule, the rule was subject to a challenge in the D.C. Circuit in American Lung Association et al. v. EPA, et al. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit vacated the ACE rule and remanded the question of the “best system of emission reduction” for carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants to EPA for further consideration. In reaching its decision, the court found that ACE would not be the most effective means of reducing emissions, and further rejected the idea that EPA is limited under the Clean Air Act to only regulate emissions reductions at the source. On February 22, 2021, the D.C. Circuit Court granted EPA’s motion to stay issuance of the mandate to repeal until EPA could respond to the remand in a new rulemaking action. 
In addition to potential CAA regulatory changes, it is possible that other future international, federal and state initiatives to control greenhouse gas emissions could increase costs associated with coal production and consumption, such as costs for additional controls to reduce carbon dioxide emissions or costs to purchase emissions reduction credits to comply with future emissions trading programs. Future regulation in the United States could occur pursuant to future treaty commitments, new domestic legislation or regulation by the EPA. On February 19, 2021, the United States rejoined the international climate agreement reached at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France during December 2015, also known as the Paris Agreement. President Trump previously withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement, beginning a four-year exit process. In an executive order, President Biden directed that federal agencies review recent actions that the President believes may interfere with the United States’ participation in the Paris Agreement. While the Paris Agreement sets only voluntary pledges for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the recent executive actions signal a shift toward consideration of new or more stringent federal regulations to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. In addition, many states, regions and governmental bodies have already adopted their own greenhouse gas emission reduction initiatives and have or are considering the imposition of fees or taxes based on the such emission by certain facilities, including coal-fired electric generating facilities. Others have announced their intent to increase the use of renewable energy sources, with the goal of displacing coal and other fossil fuels. Federal legislation along these lines is also a possibility. Depending on 

Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31, 2021 31


the particular regulatory programs or new laws enacted at the federal and state levels, the demand for coal could be negatively impacted, which would have an adverse effect on our operations.
There have also been numerous challenges to the permitting of new coal-fired power plants by environmental organizations and state regulators for concerns related to greenhouse gas emissions. For instance, various state regulatory authorities have rejected the construction of new coal-fueled power plants based on the uncertainty surrounding the potential costs associated with greenhouse gas emissions under future laws. In addition, several permits issued to new coal-fueled power plants without greenhouse gas emission limits have been appealed to the EPA's Environmental Appeals Board. A federal appeals court allowed a lawsuit pursuing federal common law claims to proceed against certain utilities on the basis that they may have created a public nuisance due to their emissions of carbon dioxide, while a second federal appeals court dismissed a similar case on procedural grounds. The United States Supreme Court overturned that decision in June 2011, holding that federal common law provides no basis for public nuisance claims against utilities due to their carbon dioxide emissions. The United States Supreme Court did not, however, decide whether similar claims can be brought under state common law. As a result, tort-type liabilities remain a concern. To the extent that these risks affect our current and prospective customers, they may reduce the demand for coal-fired power, and may affect long-term demand for coal.
Regional Haze. The EPA promulgated a regional haze program designed to protect and to improve visibility at and around Class I Areas, which are generally national parks, national wilderness areas and international parks. This program may restrict the construction of new coal-fired power plants, the operation of which may impair visibility at and around the Class I Areas. Additionally, the program requires certain existing coal-fired power plants to install additional control measures designed to limit haze-causing emissions, such as SO2, nitrogen oxide and PM. States were required to submit Regional Haze SIPs to the EPA in 2007; however, many states did not meet that deadline. In 2016, the EPA finalized revisions to the Regional Haze Rule which addresses requirements for the second planning period. In September 2019, the EPA issued final regional haze guidance that indicates that a re-evaluation of sources already subject to best available retrofit technologies is likely unnecessary. The guidance also encourages states to balance visibility benefits against other factors in selecting the measures necessary to make “reasonable progress” toward natural visibility conditions. Finally, when comparing various control options to determine which ones may be “cost-effective”, the final guidance recommends comparing cost to visibility benefits. SIPs will be required by July 31, 2021. If states adopt SIPs with more stringent requirements, demand for coal could be affected.
New Source Review, or NSR. Pursuant to NSR regulations, stationary sources of air pollution must obtain an NSR permit prior to beginning construction of a new “major” source of emissions or a “major” modification of an existing major source. If a project is determined to trigger NSR, Prevention of Significant Deterioration regulations require the project to implement Best Available Control Technology and/or Non-Attainment New Source Review Lowest Achievable Emission Rate control technology.
Beginning in the late 1990s, the EPA filed lawsuits against owners of many coal-fired power plants in the eastern U.S. alleging that the owners performed non-routine maintenance, causing increased emissions that should have triggered the application of these NSR standards. Some of these lawsuits have been settled with the owners agreeing to install additional emission control devices in their coal-fired power plants.
The remaining litigation and uncertainty around the NSR program rules could impact demand for coal. In recent years, EPA proposed and promulgated several revisions to its NSR regulations and policies concerning NSR permitting. For example, one such change, known as the Project Emissions Accounting Rule on October 22, 2020, revises the NSR regulations to clarify that recent emission decreases can be considered in part of the NSR applicability test. In addition, the EPA on November 14, 2018 issued a final rule that clarified the appropriate test for determining whether two nominally separate modifications to existing facilities should be considered in a single NSR applicability analysis. While these changes have the potential to reduce NSR permitting burdens for coal-fired power plants and other coal-burning facilities, their fate under the Biden Administration remains uncertain.
Coke Ovens. Coke Oven Batteries and Coke Ovens: Pushing, Quenching, and Battery Stacks are two source categories regulated by the CAA. The initial technology-based standards for Coke Oven Batteries were promulgated by EPA in 1993. In 2003, EPA issued technology-based standards for Coke Ovens: Pushing, Quenching, and Battery Stacks. In 2005, EPA revised the technology-based standards and issued risk-based standards following a residual risk review. On June 26, 2020, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California found EPA had violated its statutory duty to perform a technology review of its initial

Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31, 2021 32


technology-based standards for Coke Ovens: Pushing, Quenching, and Battery Stacks and a residual risk review of those standards. The court also found that EPA had violated its statutory duty to conduct a follow-up technology review and second residual risk review of the standards for Coke Oven Batteries. The court held that EPA has 30 months to comply with its statutory duty for these two source categories. To the extent that EPA ultimately promulgates more stringent technology-based standards as a result of the court-ordered technology and residual risk reviews, it could affect our current and prospective customers and may affect long-term demand for coal.
On January 21, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that ordered the review of certain environmental regulations promulgated under the Trump administration. Those environmental regulations include ozone and particulate matter NAAQS, the ACE rule, and other air emission rules potentially affecting coal-fired power plants and other coal-burning facilities. It is unclear what affect this order will have on the demand for coal.
Clean Water Act of 1972
The U.S. Clean Water Act of 1972, or the CWA, and corresponding state law governs the discharge of toxic and non-toxic pollutants into the waters of the United States. CWA requirements may directly or indirectly affect U.S. coal mining operations.
Water Discharge. The CWA and corresponding state laws affect coal mining operations by imposing restrictions on discharges of wastewater into waters of the United States through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, or NPDES, or an equally stringent program delegated to a state agency. The EPA and states may develop standards and limitations for certain pollutants, including through the technology-based standard program and water quality standard program. These restrictions often require us to pre-treat the wastewater prior to discharging it. NPDES permits require regular monitoring, reporting and compliance with effluent limitations. New requirements under the CWA and corresponding state laws may cause us to incur significant additional costs that could adversely affect our operating results.
Dredge and Fill Permits. Many mining activities, such as the development of refuse impoundments, fresh water impoundments, refuse fills, and other similar structures, may result in impacts to waters of the United States, including wetlands, streams and, in certain instances, man-made conveyances that have a hydrologic connection to such streams or wetlands. Under the CWA, coal companies are also required to obtain a Section 404 permit from the USACE prior to conducting certain mining activities, such as the development of refuse and slurry impoundments, fresh water impoundments, refuse fills and other similar structures that may affect waters of the United States, including wetlands, streams and, in certain instances, man-made conveyances that have a hydrologic connection to streams or wetlands. The USACE is authorized to issue general “nationwide” permits for specific categories of activities that are similar in nature and that are determined to have minimal adverse effects on the environment. Permits issued pursuant to Nationwide Permit 21, or NWP 21, generally authorize the disposal of dredged and fill material from surface coal mining activities into waters of the United States, subject to certain restrictions. Since March 2007, permits under NWP 21 were reissued for a five-year period with new provisions intended to strengthen environmental protections. There must be appropriate mitigation in accordance with nationwide general permit conditions rather than less restricted state-required mitigation requirements, and permit holders must receive explicit authorization from the USACE before proceeding with proposed mining activities. The USACE may also issue individual permits for mining activities that do not qualify for Nationwide Permit 21.
The CWR/Navigable Waters Protection, or NWPR. Recent regulatory actions and court decisions have created some uncertainty over the scope of CWA jurisdiction. On June 29, 2015, the EPA and the USACE jointly promulgated final rules, collectively known as the Clean Water Rule, or the CWR, redefining the scope of waters protected under the CWA, revising regulations that had been in place for more than 25 years. These rules expanded the scope of CWA jurisdiction, making discharges into more bodies of water subject to the CWA’s permitting and other requirements. Following the CWR’s promulgation, numerous industry groups, states, and environmental groups challenged the CWR. On October 9, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit stayed the CWR’s implementation nationwide, pending further action in court. Further, on February 28, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order directing the relevant executive agencies to review the CWR, and on July 27, 2017, the EPA and the USACE published a proposed rule to rescind the CWR. On January 22, 2018, the Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s decision, ruling that jurisdiction over challenges to the CWR rests with the federal district courts and not with the appellate courts, which was followed by the dissolution of the stay by the Sixth Circuit, and on February 6, 2018, in response to the January 2018 Supreme Court decision, the agencies published a final rule to postpone the adoption of CWR and maintain the status quo (the pre-2015 rule)

Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31, 2021 33


through February 6, 2020 pending the agencies’ review of the CWR. Multiple states and environmental groups have filed challenges to this delay. On August 16, 2018, the federal court in South Carolina enjoined the February 6, 2018 rule, effectively reinstating the CWR in Virginia and Pennsylvania (where we have operations) and in 24 other states. The injunction is being challenged on appeal.
On April 21, 2020, the EPA and the USACE published the Navigable Waters Protection Rules, or the NWPR. The NWPR revises the definition of waters of the United States and replaces the CWR. The NWPR shrinks the agencies’ jurisdiction, particularly as it relates to tributaries and adjacent waters. The NWPR went into effect on June 22, 2020. The NWPR was enjoined in Colorado, but this decision was overturned by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. On December 7, 2021, the EPA and the USACE announced a proposed rule to revise the definition of “waters of the United States.” The new definition would reflect the pre-2015 definition as well as consideration of recent Supreme Court decisions.
On April 22, 2020, in an unrelated case the Supreme Court ruled that provisions of the CWA require an NPDES permit when there is a direct discharge from a point source to navigable waters or the functionally equivalent discharge to groundwater. The NWPR, however, had excluded groundwater from the agencies’ jurisdiction. On January 21, 2021, EPA issued guidance applying the ruling of the Supreme Court to the NPDES permitting program. Under the Biden Administration, the EPA rescinded this guidance memorandum, thus eliminating a new factor that likely would have reduced clean water protections. 
The Department of Justice has filed motions in various federal courts asking for remand of the NWPR back to the EPA and the USACE. Litigation of this matter remains ongoing. Uncertainty surrounding the NWPR remains, including what impact it may have on our operations.
Effluent Limitations Guidelines for the Steam Electric Power Generating Industry. On September 30, 2015, the EPA published a final rule setting new or additional requirements for various wastewater discharges from steam electric power plants. The rule set zero discharge requirements for some waste streams, as well as new, more stringent limits for arsenic, mercury, selenium and nitrogen applicable to certain other waste streams. On April 12, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit agreed with environmental groups that the portions of the rule regulating legacy wastewater and residual combustion leachate are unlawful. The Court vacated those portions of the rule. 
On August 31, 2020, the EPA finalized a rule to revise the guidelines and standards for the steam electric power generating point source category applicable to two categories of wastewater streams regulated by the 2015 rule: flue gas desulfurization wastewater, or FGD, and bottom ash transport water, or BA. With respect to FGD, selenium standards are less stringent than under the 2015 rule, and certain types of facilities, such as facilities with high FGD flow, low utilization boilers and those set to retire coal combustion units, are subject to less stringent effluent limits. The compliance deadline for FGD technology-based wastewater limits was extended from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2025. With respect to BA, the EPA, among other things, eliminated a strict no-discharge requirement and implemented a not-to-exceed ten-percent volumetric purge. We cannot at this time predict how this rule will be enforced by the new Biden administration or if it will seek a revision. 
The Biden Administration’s January 20, 2021 executive order for review of environmental regulations indicated the Biden Administration would review the NWPR amongst other CWA-related regulations. 
Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977
The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, or the SMCRA, which is administered by the U.S. Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, or OSM, establishes operational, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining and many aspects of underground mining in the United States. Unlike the CAA and the CWA, SMCRA is primarily concerned with the holistic regulation of coal mining as an industry. Its general environmental standards require surface operations to mine in such a way as to “maximize the utilization and conservation” of coal while using the best technology currently available to minimize land disturbance and adverse impacts on wildlife, fish, and environmental values. SMCRA requires operators to accomplish these goals by restoring the land to its approximate pre-mining condition and contour.
The SMCRA implements its environmental standards through “cooperative federalism.” Under the SMCRA, a state may submit a qualifying surface mining regulatory scheme to the OSM, and request to exert exclusive jurisdiction over surface mining activities within its territory. If OSM finds that the state’s scheme meets SMCRA’s

Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31, 2021 34


requirements and gives approval, the state becomes the primary regulatory authority with oversight from OSM. If a state has a surface mining regulatory scheme that is less stringent than the surface mining standards under SMCRA and OSM regulations, or if mining on federal lands is involved, the OSM will impose federal regulations on surface mining in that state. Each of Virginia, West Virginia and Pennsylvania, where our Buchanan, Logan, Greenbrier and Mon Valley operations are based, has adopted qualifying surface mining regulatory schemes and has primary jurisdiction over surface mining activities within their respective territories. However, even if a state gains approval for its surface mining regulatory program, the OSM retains significant federal oversight, including the ability to perform inspections of all surface mining sites to ensure state program and mine operator compliance with federal minimum standards. The OSM and its state counterparts also oversee and evaluate standards of:
•performance (both during operations and during reclamation);
•permitting (applications must describe the pre-mining environmental conditions and land use, the intended mining and reclamation standards, and the post-mining use);
•financial assurance (SMCRA requires that mining companies post a bond sufficient to cover the cost of reclaiming the site, and the bond is not released until mining is complete, the land has been reclaimed and the OSM has approved the release);
•inspection and enforcement (including the issuance of notices of violation and the placement of a mining operation, its owners and controllers on a federal database known as the Applicant Violator System, meaning that such person or entity is blocked from obtaining future mining permits); and
•land restrictions (SMCRA prohibits surface mining on certain lands and also allows citizens to challenge surface mining operations on the grounds that they will cause a negative environmental impact).
Regulations under the SMCRA and its state analogues provide that a mining permit or modification can, under certain circumstances, be delayed, refused or revoked if we or any entity that owns or controls us or is under common ownership or control with us have unabated permit violations or have been the subject of permit or reclamation bond revocation or suspension.
Under the SMCRA and its state law counterparts, all coal mining applications must include mandatory “ownership and control” information, which generally includes listing the names of the operator’s officers and directors, and its principal stockholders owning 10% or more of its voting shares, among others. Ownership and control reporting requirements are designed to allow regulatory review of any entities or persons deemed to have ownership or control of a coal mine, and bar the granting of a coal mining permit to any such entity or person (including any “owner and controller”) who has had a mining permit revoked or suspended, or a bond or similar security forfeited within the five-year period preceding a permit application or application for a permit revision. Similarly, regulatory agencies also block the issuance of permits to applicants, their owners or their controlling persons, who have outstanding permit violations that have not been timely abated.
These regulations define certain relationships, such as owning over 50% of stock in an entity or having the authority to determine the manner in which the entity conducts mining operations, as constituting ownership and control. Certain other relationships are presumed to constitute ownership or control, including among others, the following:
•being an officer or director of an entity;
•being the operator of the coal mining operation;
•having the ability to commit the financial or real property assets or working resources of the permittee or operator; and
•owning of record 10% or more of the mining operator.
This presumption, in some cases, can be rebutted where the person or entity can demonstrate that it in fact does not or did not have authority directly or indirectly to determine the manner in which the relevant coal mining operation is conducted.

Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31, 2021 35


We must file an ownership and control notice each time an entity obtains a 10% or greater interest in us. If we or entities or persons deemed to have ownership of control of us have unabated violations of SMCRA or its state law counterparts, have a coal mining permit suspended or revoked, or forfeit a reclamation bond, we and our owners and controllers may be prohibited from obtaining new coal mining permits, or amendments to existing permits, until such violations or other matters are corrected. This is known as being “permit-blocked.” Additionally, if an owner or controller of us is deemed an owner or controller of other mining companies, we could be permit-blocked based upon the violations of, or permit-blocked status of, an owner or controller of such other mining companies. If our owner or controller were to become permit blocked, this could adversely affect production from our properties.
In recent years, the permitting required for coal mining has been the subject of increasingly stringent regulatory and administrative requirements and extensive activism and litigation by environmental groups. After a permit application is prepared and submitted to the regulatory agency, it goes through a completeness and technical review. Public notice of the proposed permit is given for a comment period before a permit can be issued. Regulatory authorities have considerable discretion in the timing of the permit issuance and the public has the right to comment on and otherwise engage in the permitting process, including public hearings and through intervention in the courts. Monetary sanctions and, in certain circumstances, even criminal sanctions may be imposed for failure to comply with the SMCRA permits. Before a SMCRA permit is issued, a mine operator must submit a bond or other form of financial security to guarantee the performance of reclamation bonding requirements.
SMCRA provides for three categories of bonds: surety bonds, collateral bonds and self-bonds. A surety bond is an indemnity agreement in a sum certain payable to the regulatory authority, executed by the permittee as principal and which is supported by the performance guarantee of a surety corporation. A collateral bond can take several forms, including cash, letters of credit, first lien security interest in property or other qualifying investment securities. A self-bond is an indemnity agreement in a sum certain executed by the permittee or by the permittee and any corporate guarantor made payable to the regulatory authority. For our U.S. Operations, we meet our reclamation bonding requirements by posting surety bonds and participation in the Commonwealth of Virginia bond pool. Our total amount of reclamation surety bonds outstanding was approximately $28.5 million as of December 31, 2021. The surety bond requirements for a mine represent the calculated cost to reclaim the current operations if it ceased to operate in the current period. The cost calculation for each surety bond must be completed according to the regulatory authority of each state.
The SMCRA Abandoned Mine Land Fund requires a fee on all coal produced in the United States. The proceeds are used to rehabilitate lands mined and left unreclaimed prior to August 3, 1977 and to pay health care benefit costs of orphan beneficiaries of the Combined Fund created by the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992. The fee amount can change periodically based on changes in federal legislation. Pursuant to the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, from October 1, 2012 through September 30, 2021, the fee is $0.31 and $0.13 per Mt of surface-mined and underground-mined coal, respectively. See Item 2. “Properties” for information regarding reclamation and other taxes applicable to our U.S. mining properties.
While SMCRA is a comprehensive statute, SMCRA does not supersede the need for compliance with other major environmental statutes, including the Endangered Species Act of 1973, or the ESA, CAA, CWA, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, or the RCRA, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA.
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969
The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, or NEPA, applies to mining operations or permitting requirements that require federal approvals, NEPA requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of all “major federal actions” significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. NEPA requires federal agencies, such as the EPA or the OSM, to incorporate environmental considerations in their planning and decision-making. The federal agency carrying out the requirements of NEPA must prepare a detailed statement assessing the environmental impact of and alternatives to the particular action requiring agency approval. These statements are referred to as Environmental Impact Statements or Environmental Assessments. NEPA also defines the processes for evaluating and communicating environmental consequences of federal decisions and actions, such as the permitting of new mine development on federal lands. U.S. coal mining companies must provide information to agencies with respect to proposed actions that will be under the authority of the federal

Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31, 2021 36


government. The NEPA process involves public participation and can involve lengthy timeframes. Ultimately, federal agencies may require mitigation measures pursuant to their NEPA review.
On July 16, 2020, the White House Council on Environmental Quality, or the CEQ finalized a proposed rule, which went into effect on September 14, 2020. The new rule made it easier to obtain approval for new projects, including by eliminating the need to evaluate so-called cumulative impacts which could ultimately limit agencies’ consideration of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. However, pursuant to Executive Order 13990, CEQ began a comprehensive review of the 2020 rule and announced a phased approach to amending NEPA regulations. An Interim Final Rule was issued June 29, 2021 which extended the deadline for Federal agencies to develop or update their NEPA implementing procedures to conform to the CEQ regulations by two years.
Solid Waste Disposal Act of 1995 and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976
The Solid Waste Disposal Act of 1965, or SWDA, was the first federal act to target waste disposal technology. The SWDA governs disposal of both municipal and industrial waste, promotes advancement of waste management technology and sets waste management standards. The SWDA was amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, or RCRA. RCRA affects U.S. coal mining operations by establishing “cradle to grave” requirements for the generation, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The RCRA also addresses the environmental effects of certain past hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal practices, and may require a current or past site owner or operator to remove improperly disposed hazardous wastes. The RCRA also sets forth a framework for managing certain non-hazardous solid wastes. Part or all of the RCRA program may be delegated to a state pursuant to a state implementation plan if the state standards are at least as stringent as federal standards.
Subtitle C of the RCRA exempted fossil fuel combustion wastes from hazardous waste regulation until the EPA completed a report to Congress and made a determination on whether the wastes should be regulated as hazardous. On December 19, 2014, the EPA announced the final rule on disposal of coal combustion residuals, or CCR or coal ash, by electric utilities and independent power producers. As finalized, the rule continues the exemption of CCR from regulation as a hazardous waste, but does impose new requirements at existing CCR surface impoundments and landfills that will need to be implemented over a number of different time-frames in the coming months and years, as well as at new surface impoundments and landfills. On August 24, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit held that certain provisions of the EPA’s CCR rule were not sufficiently protective, and it invalidated those provisions. Since then, the EPA has finalized changes to its CCR regulations in response to some aspects of the court’s ruling, primarily to regulate unlined ponds but extend certain deadlines for initiating their closure, and allowing site-specific alternate liner determinations. 
The Biden Administration’s January 20, 2021 executive order for review of environmental regulations indicated that the Biden Administration will review environmental regulations affecting the management and disposal of CCR. On January 11, 2022, the EPA announced that it was taking steps to protect groundwater from coal ash contamination, including plans to finalize a federal permitting program for the disposal of coal ash and establishing regulations for legacy coal ash surface impoundments. We cannot predict at this time if and/or when such rules will go into effect. 
The EPA regulations on CCR management and disposal exempt coal ash that is disposed of at mine sites and reserve any regulation thereof to the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement or "OSMRE." After proposing CCR regulations in 2007, the OSMRE suspended all rulemaking actions on CCRs, but could re-initiate them in the future. In addition, while many mining wastes such as overburden and coal cleaning wastes are exempt from RCRA hazardous waste regulations, certain wastes may be subject to the RCRA’s requirements. The RCRA also governs underground storage tanks containing hazardous substances and petroleum products, which are used in some coal mining operations, although we do not have underground storage tanks associated with our U.S. Operations.
The Biden Administration’s January 20, 2021 executive order for review of environmental regulations indicated that the Biden Administration will review environmental regulations affecting the management and disposal of CCR. It is unclear what effect this order will have on the demand for coal.

Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA, authorizes the federal government and private parties to recover costs to address threatened or actual releases of hazardous substances (broadly defined) that may endanger public health or the environment. Current owners and operators of contaminated sites, past owners and operators of contaminated sites at the time hazardous substances were disposed, parties that arranged for the disposal or transport of the hazardous substances and transporters of hazardous substances could be potentially responsible parties, or PRPs, under CERCLA. PRPs may be liable for costs related to contaminated sites, including, but not limited to, site investigation and cleanup costs incurred by the government or other parties, damages to natural resources and costs of certain health assessments or studies. In addition, CERCLA authorizes the federal government to order PRPs to conduct investigation and cleanup of releases of hazardous substances at certain contaminated sites.
CERCLA requires that a list of contaminated sites, referred to as the National Priorities List, be compiled by EPA using certain criteria to evaluate the potential relative risk to the public health and the environment from releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances. Strict, joint and several and retroactive liability may be imposed on hazardous substance generators and facility owners and operators, regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity. The failure to comply with a federal government order under CERCLA may result in civil penalties, including fines and/or punitive damages, in addition to the costs incurred by the federal government due to the party’s failure to comply with an order.
We could face liability under CERCLA and similar state laws for properties that (1) we currently own, lease or operate, (2) we, our predecessors, or former subsidiaries have previously owned, leased or operated, (3) sites to which we, our predecessors or former subsidiaries, sent waste materials, and (4) sites at which hazardous substances from our facilities’ operations have otherwise come to be located.
Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977
The Mine Act, which was amended by the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006, or the MINER Act, governs federal oversight of mine safety and authorizes the U.S. Department of Labor’s Mine Safety and Health Administration, or MSHA, to regulate safety and health conditions for employees working in mines within the United States, and to enforce various mandatory health and safety requirements. The Mine Act mandates four annual inspections of underground coal mines, two annual inspections of all surface coal mines, and permits inspections in response to employee complaints of unsafe working conditions. The statute and its regulations also mandate miner training, mine rescue teams for all underground mines, and involvement of miners and their representatives in health and safety activities. MSHA has also promulgated regulations governing a wide range of activities, including roof support, ventilation, combustible materials, electrical equipment, fire protection, explosives and blasting, and mine emergencies. MSHA has the statutory authority to issue civil penalties for non-compliance, to set the period for abatement of violations, and to seek injunctive relief requiring a company to cease operations until certain conditions are corrected. The MINER Act requires mine specific emergency response plans in underground coal mines, implemented new regulations regarding mine rescue teams and sealing of abandoned areas, requires prompt notification of mine accidents, and imposes enhanced civil and criminal penalties for violations. Various states also have enacted their own new laws and regulations addressing many of these same subjects. MSHA continues to interpret and implement various provisions of the MINER Act, along with introducing new proposed regulations and standards. For example, the second phase of MSHA’s respirable coal mine dust rule went into effect in February 2016 and requires increased sampling frequency and the use of continuous personal dust monitors. In August 2016, the third and final phase of the rule became effective, reducing the overall respirable dust standard in coal mines from 2.0 to 1.5 milligrams per cubic meter of air. In the last several years, MSHA has also proposed regulations governing respirable silica, and the exposure of miners to underground diesel exhaust fumes, and testing, evaluation, and approval of electric motor-driven mine equipment and accessories. MSHA has issued guidance for employers and workers regarding how to mitigate the risks of COVID-19 rather than mandatory standards. During a September 29, 2021 stakeholder call, MSHA leadership indicated that it would not issue an Emergency Temporary Standard requiring COVID-19 vaccinations or testing at mine sites.
Black Lung (Coal Worker’s Pneumoconiosis)
The Mine Act amended the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, which is the legislation that mandates compensation for miners who were totally and permanently disabled by the progressive respiratory

Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31, 2021 38


disease caused by coal workers’ pneumoconiosis, or black lung. Under current federal law, a U.S. coal mine operator must pay federal black lung benefits and medical expenses to claimants who are current employees, and to claimants who are former employees who last worked for the operator after July 1, 1973, and whose claims for benefits are allowed. Coal mine operators must also make payments to a trust fund for the payment of benefits and medical expenses to claimants who last worked in the coal industry prior to July 1, 1973. The trust fund is funded by an excise tax on sales of U.S. production, excluding export sales, of up to $1.21 per Mt for deep-mined coal and up to $0.61 per Mt for surface-mined coal, each limited to 4.4% of the gross sales price. In 2019, these tax rates were cut in half compared to the pre-2019 level, falling to $0.61 per Mt of underground-mined coal or $0.31 per Mt of surface-mined coal, limited to 2% of the sales price. Our total excise taxes paid to this trust fund in 2020 were $0.9 million. In December 2019, President Trump signed into law a provision that restored the rate to its pre-2019 level through December 31, 2020. On December 27, 2020, then-President Trump extended the trust fund excise tax through December 31, 2021 at the pre-2019 rate. Historically, very few of the miners who sought federal black lung benefits were awarded these benefits; however, the approval rate has increased following implementation of black lung provisions contained in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, or the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act introduced significant changes to the federal black lung program, including an automatic survivor benefit paid upon the death of a miner with an awarded black lung claim, and established a rebuttable presumption with regard to pneumoconiosis among miners with 15 or more years of coal mine employment that are totally disabled by a respiratory condition. These changes could have a material impact on our costs expended in association with the federal black lung program. In addition to possibly incurring liability under federal statutes, we may also be liable under state laws for black lung claims. See Note 20 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further information of applicable insurance coverage.
National Labor Relations Act of 1935
The National Labor Relations Act of 1935, or the NLRA, governs collective bargaining and private sector labor and management relations. While we do not have a unionized workforce in the United States, to the extent that non-supervisory employees decide to seek representation or engage in other protected concerted labor activities, the NLRA and the rules promulgated by the National Labor Relations Board, or NLRB, set the parameters for employees’ and union activity and our response. The NLRA applies to both unionized and non-union workforces. Any employee complaints related to the pandemic and any related labor actions, if they are tied to terms and conditions of employment that affect the workforce generally, will be governed by the NLRA. In addition, recent NLRB- promulgated rules regarding joint employer status under the NLRA clarified the basis upon which contractors and vendors, as well as their employees (and the unions representing them), could allege that we are jointly and severally liable for any unfair labor practices or bargaining obligations of the third-party employer. While the rules made the joint employer test generally more employer-friendly, there is always the possibility of claims that we are a joint employer with a contractor or vendor.
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010
The United States Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the Affordable Care Act, was enacted in March 2010 and included substantial reforms to the U.S. health care system intended to increase affordability of health insurance, expand the Medicaid program and support innovative health care delivery methods designed to lower costs. The Affordable Care Act included a number of provisions designed to reduce Medicare expenditures and the cost of health care generally, to reduce fraud and abuse, and to provide access to increased health coverage. For example, the law prohibits insurers from refusing to cover preexisting conditions, requires coverage for certain types of care, and can subject certain large employers to a shared responsibility payment if they do not offer health coverage to their full-time employees. The Affordable Care Act also created government-run, taxpayer-funded health insurance marketplaces (known as “Exchanges”).
The Affordable Care Act impacts the coal mining industry’s costs of providing health care benefits to its eligible active employees, with both short term and long term implications. It affects health care costs by, among other things, setting the maximum age for covered dependents to receive benefits at 26, requiring certain benefits for occupational disease related illnesses, and eliminating lifetime dollar limits on essential benefits per covered individual and restrictions on annual dollar limits on essential benefits per covered individual. The Affordable Care Act also included significant changes to the federal black lung program, including an automatic survivor benefit paid upon death of a miner with an awarded black lung claim and the establishment of a rebuttable presumption with regard to pneumoconiosis among miners with 15 or more years of coal mine employment that are totally disabled by a respiratory condition. The Affordable Care Act also provides lifetime benefits to certain dependents

Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31, 2021 39


who survive the death of a miner, if the miner had been receiving the benefits before death. For additional information, please see above “––Black Lung (Coal Worker’s Pneumoconiosis).”
The Affordable Care Act has faced ongoing legal challenges, including litigation and legislation seeking to invalidate or modify some or all of the law or the manner in which it has been implemented. For example, the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 repealed the “Cadillac tax,” which would have imposed a 40% tax on high-cost employer plans starting in 2022. The constitutionality of the individual mandate, and the entire Affordable Care Act, was challenged in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, and is currently under review by the Supreme Court. The outcome of these cases is uncertain, and any change they make to the Affordable Care Act could have a significant impact on the U.S. health care industry and employers providing health coverage to their workers. Further, the fact that implementation of certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act can be affected by Executive Orders and regulations promulgated by federal governmental agencies that may change when a new President takes office also contributes to the uncertainty as to how the law will affect the U.S. health care industry and employers providing health coverage to their workers.
Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974
The Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, or SDWA, is the federal law that protects public drinking water supplies throughout the United States. Under the SDWA, the EPA sets federal health-based standards for drinking water quality and implements technical and financial programs to ensure drinking water safety. The SDWA requires regular monitoring and reporting of water quality. The SDWA is applicable to public water systems that have at least 15 service connections or serve at least 25 people per day for 60 days of the year. Further, SDWA standards apply to water systems based on their type and size. There are four categories: i) community water systems, ii) non-community water systems, iii) non-transient, non-community water systems and iv) transient non-community water systems.
The SDWA requires the EPA to establish National Primary Drinking Water Regulations for contaminants that may cause adverse public health effects. These regulations include mandatory requirements and non-enforceable health goals. The EPA sets regulations for drinking water system concentrations of certain organic contaminants, inorganic contaminants, microbiological contaminants, disinfection byproducts, residual disinfectant levels, and radionuclide levels. The EPA also sets filtration requirements for drinking water systems that vary depending on the size of the population served by the system.
The SDWA also regulates the underground injection of fluids into porous formations or rocks through wells and similar conveyance systems, and regulates the construction, operation, permitting and closure of such wells.
The SDWA can impact coal mining operations in the United States to the extent that the operations could impact drinking water supplies.
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966
The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, or NHPA, governs the preservation of historical properties throughout the United States. The NHPA requires the Department of the Interior’s National Park Service to implement the national policy to preserve for public use historic sites, buildings and objects of national significance for the inspiration and benefit of the people of the United States. Alternatively, a state may carry out this program with oversight from the Department of the Interior if the Department of the Interior approves the state’s historic preservation program. In executing this policy, the National Park Service identifies National Historic Landmarks and places them on a National Register of Historic Places. The NHPA requires that each federal agency prior to authorizing expenditure of federal funds on a federal or federally assisted undertaking, or prior to issuing a federal license for such an undertaking, consider the effect of the undertaking on historic resources and to provide the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation with a reasonable opportunity to comment on the undertaking. Accordingly, the NHPA could create an additional level of scrutiny on a coal mining operation, particularly during the permitting process, to the extent that a mining operation could come within the scope of a historical site. The SMCRA also provides protection for historic resources that would be adversely affected by mining operations by requiring the OSM to comply with the NHPA. If a property is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, SMCRA requires consideration of the property’s historic values in determining issuance of a surface coal mining permit.

Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31, 2021 40


Endangered Species Act of 1973
The Endangered Species Act of 1973, or ESA, governs the protection of endangered species in the United States and requires the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Marine Fisheries Service to formally review any federally authorized, funded or administered action that could negatively affect endangered or threatened species. Under the ESA, the responsibilities of these agencies include listing and delisting species, designating critical habitats, developing recovery plans and conducting five-year reviews of listed species.
The Fish and Wildlife Service studies projects for possible effects to endangered species and then can recommend alternatives or mitigation measures. The OSM and state regulators require mining companies to hire a government-approved contractor to conduct surveys for potential endangered species, and the surveys require approval from state and federal biologists who provide guidance on how to minimize mines’ potential effects on endangered species. Certain endangered species are more typically at issue under the ESA with respect to mining, including the long-eared bat and Guyandotte crayfish, which are found in the Central Appalachian region, including parts of Virginia and West Virginia. Mitigation methods can cause increased costs to coal mining operators. Changes in listings or requirements under these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our costs or our ability to mine some of our properties in accordance with our current mining plans. The ESA allows landowners to receive a special permit to take listed species in some circumstances, provided they have developed a Habitat Conservation Plan approved by the Fish and Wildlife Service.
The U.S. Department of the Interior issued three proposed rules in July 2018 aiming to streamline and update the ESA, and they became effective on September 26, 2019. The rules weaken the protections afforded species listed as threatened, and make it more difficult to add species to the threatened and endangered species lists and easier to delist species. However, on June 4, 2021, the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Fisheries Service announced a plan to strengthen the ESA and revise or rescind regulations passed under the Trump Administration.
Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918
The Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, or MBTA, as modified by the Migratory Bird Treaty Reform Act of 2004, makes it unlawful without a waiver to pursue, hunt, take, capture, kill or sell migratory birds, or any part, nest or egg of any migratory bird. A migratory bird species is included on the list of species protected by the MBTA if it meets one or more of the following criteria: i) it occurs in the United States or U.S. territories as the result of natural biological or ecological processes and is currently, or was previously listed as, a species or part of a family protected by certain international treaties, or their amendments, entered into by the United States and Canada, Mexico, Japan or Russia; ii) revised taxonomy results in it being split from a species that was previously on the list, and the new species occurs in the United States or U.S. territories as the result of natural biological or ecological processes; or iii) new evidence exists for its natural occurrence in the United States or U.S. territories resulting from natural distributional changes and the species occurs in a protected family. The Migratory Bird Treaty Reform Act of 2004 requires the Fish and Wildlife Service to publish an informational list of all nonnative, human-introduced bird species to which MBTA does not apply. The most recent list of all nonnative, human-introduced bird species was published on April 16, 2020.
Since coal mining is seen as an industry that can threaten bird populations, coal operators are required to ensure that their operations do not negatively impact migratory birds, or to take mitigation measures. Violations of the MBTA are either misdemeanor or felonies punishable by a fine or imprisonment. Efforts in 2020 and 2021 to narrow the applicability of the MBTA were unsuccessful.
Regulation of explosives
Our surface mining operations are subject to numerous regulations relating to blasting activities, including the Federal Safe Explosives Act, or SEA. SEA applies to all users of explosives. Knowing or willful violations of the SEA may result in fines, imprisonment, or both. In addition, violations of SEA may result in revocation of user permits and seizure or forfeiture of explosive materials. Pursuant to federal regulations, we incur costs to design and implement blast schedules and to conduct pre-blast surveys and blast monitoring. In addition, the storage of explosives is subject to strict regulatory requirements established by four different federal regulatory agencies. For example, pursuant to a rule issued by the Department of Homeland Security in 2007, facilities in possession of chemicals of interest, including ammonium nitrate at certain threshold levels, must complete a screening review

in order to help determine whether there is a high level of security risk such that a security vulnerability assessment and site security plan will be required. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives, or ATF, regulates the sale, possession, storage and transportation of explosives in interstate commerce. In addition to ATF regulation, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is evaluating a proposed ammonium nitrate security program rule. In 2015, the OSM also proposed a rulemaking addressing nitrogen oxide clouds from blasting; on July 30, 2019, however, the OSM withdrew the proposed rulemaking.
