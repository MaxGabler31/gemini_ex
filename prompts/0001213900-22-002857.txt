OVERVIEW



We were incorporated in the State of Delaware in May 2009.



In 2009, IDT Corporation, our former parent corporation, completed a tax-free spinoff (the “Spin-Off”) of the Company through a pro rata distribution of our common stock IDT’s stockholders.



IDW Media Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is a holding company consisting of the following principal businesses:




● | IDW Publishing, or IDWP, a publishing company that creates comic books, graphic novels, digital content through its imprints IDW, Top Shelf Productions, Artist’s Editions and The Library of American Comics; and

IDWP is an award-winning publisher of comic books, original graphic novels, and art books. Founded in 1999, IDWP has a long tradition of supporting original, powerful creator-driven titles. In 2002, IDWP published 30 Days of Night by Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith followed by other horror titles that kickstarted a resurgence in horror-comic publishing across the industry. Since then, IDWP has significantly diversified its publications. Joe Hill and Gabriel Rodríguez’s Locke & Key, Jonathan Maberry’s V Wars, Stan Sakai’s Usagi Yojimbo, Beau Smith’s Wynonna Earp, Alan Robert’s The Beauty of Horror adult coloring books, and Darwyn Cooke’s graphic novel adaptations of Richard Stark’s Parker novels are just a few of the hundreds of outstanding, award-winning titles published since its inception.

COVID-19: Overview of Impacts 



IDWMH: Received two PPP loans related to core IDWE and IDWP operations.




o | $1,195,679 on April 27, 2020, subsequently forgiven on July 20, 2021
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


o | $1,195,680 on April 2, 2021, subsequently forgiven on October 27, 2021

● | IDWE: Industry-wide production suspensions halted filming and production of Wynonna Earp Season four after the completion of six of twelve episodes. IDWE continued its program to develop, package and pitch from its library on remote basis. Writer’s rooms have transitioned to virtual operations. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | IDWP: Direct market distribution was halted in April 1, 2020 by Diamond Comic Distributors, Inc. (Diamond), the industry’s primary distributor, and IDWP subsequently furloughed approximately 25% of its workforce. Using the proceeds of PPP loans, IDWP was able to bring back 50% of the furloughed workforce. IDWP transitioned to focus on direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) and indirect market channels, and was able to offset the lost direct market sales. Diamond resumed partial operations on May 20, 2020. Direct market sales volumes have since risen, past pre-COVID-19 levels and most products sold through Diamond have reverted back to pre-COVID-19 non-returnability with limited exceptions. Sales through Penguin Random House Publisher Services (PRHPS), a largely returnable market, have seen decreased overall returns. Effective in April 2021, the return policies have reverted back to pre-COVID-19. IDWP renegotiated the terms of one of its lease agreements due to COVID-19 impacts. Per ASC 842 guidance the lease liabilities were remeasured as of the modification dates as if the leases were new leases commencing at such time. Accordingly, the Right-Of-Use assets were adjusted by amounts equal to the adjustments to the lease liabilities. Although the delay in comic releases continues to have an impact on the industry, the impact has been slowly decreasing and returning to pre-COVID-19 levels.

During calendar 2021, we began to winddown IDW Games and, going forward, IDW Games is only backfilling final orders Prior to February 15, 2021, we also owned CTM Media Group (CTM), a company that develops and distributes print and digital-based advertising and information advertising for tourist destinations in targeted tourist markets in 32 states / provinces in the US and Canada. On February 15, 2021, we consummated the sale of CTM to an assignee of Howard Jonas, the Company’s Chairman in exchange for (i) the cancelation of $3.75 million of indebtedness we owed to our Chairman’s designee, (ii) a contingent payment of up to $3.25 million based upon a recovery of quarterly revenues of CTM to 90% of its fiscal 2019 levels during the 18-month period following the sale, and (iii) a contingent payment if CTM is sold within 36 months of the sale for more than $4.5 million. As of July 31, 2020, CTM was reported as a discontinued operation and CTM’s operations have since been included in the financial statements as discontinued operations.



IDW Publishing



IDWP’s focus is to expand and market its library of titles, from both creator-owned titles in our IDW and Top Shelf brands; and also, in partnership with our top-of-class creative partners under our IDW brand. IDWP works synergistically with IDWE to develop new titles and to support existing titles.



IDWP is an award-winning publisher of comic books, original graphic novels, and art books. Founded in 1999, IDWP has a long tradition of supporting original, powerful creator-driven titles. In 2002, IDWP published 30 Days of Night by Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith followed by other horror titles that kickstarted a resurgence in horror-comic publishing across the industry. Since then, IDWP has significantly diversified its publications. Joe Hill and Gabriel Rodríguez’s Locke & Key, Jonathan Maberry’s V Wars, Stan Sakai’s Usagi Yojimbo, Beau Smith’s Wynonna Earp, Alan Robert’s The Beauty of Horror adult coloring books, and Darwyn Cooke’s graphic novel adaptations of Richard Stark’s Parker novels are just a few of the hundreds of outstanding, award-winning titles published since its inception.



In 2015, IDWP acquired Top Shelf Productions, an award-winning critically acclaimed publisher of graphic novels, which continues to operate as a thriving imprint. Top Shelf Productions is renowned for publishing works of literary significance including the #1 New York Times and Washington Post bestselling trilogy, March, by Congressman John Lewis, Andrew Aydin, and Nate Powell. March is the only graphic novel to have won the National Book Award and is the second most taught graphic novel in schools. In July 2019, Top Shelf Productions released George Takei’s graphic memoir, They Called Us Enemy, which debuted at #2 on the New York Times Paperback Nonfiction Best Sellers list and as a #1 bestseller on Amazon. Both titles are now perennial bestsellers and considered two of the finest non-fiction graphic novels ever made. Other iconic Top Shelf Productions titles include Kim Dwinell’s Surfside Girls, Jeff Lemire’s Essex County and The Underwater Welder, and Hannah Templer’s Cosmoknights.



In addition to its core of creator-driven franchises, IDWP has also partnered with the owners of major licensed brands to publish many successful licensed titles, including Hasbro’s Transformers, G.I. Joe, Dungeons & Dragons and My Little Pony; Sega’s Sonic The Hedgehog; CBS’s Star Trek; Viacom’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles; Toho’s Godzilla; and Lucasfilm’s Star Wars Adventures. These licensed titles bring with them diverse built-in audiences and build cache and retailer support for IDWP. With licensed franchises, IDWP’s strategy is to focus not only on licenses that have eager, built-in fan followings but also ongoing licensor support through other channels, such as toys, animation, and film. This strategy enables IDWP to expand its audience reach and to pursue sub-license opportunities with foreign publishers. IDWP also collaborates with other comic book publishers to co-publish certain titles, including Batman vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Locke & Key/The Sandman Universe: Hell & Gone (with DC Comics), Rick & Morty vs. Dungeons & Dragons (with Oni Press, Inc.) and Godzilla vs. Power Rangers (with Boom Studios).



IDWP is also home to Artist’s Editions, oversized deluxe hardcovers featuring scans of original art printed at the same size they were drawn with all the distinctive creative nuances that make original art unique. Some of the standout Artist’s Editions titles include Jim Lee’s X-Men, Mike Mignola’s Hellboy, David Mazzucchelli’s Daredevil Born Again and Jim Sterako’s Nick Fury Agent of SHIELD.



Many of IDWP’s titles are available worldwide through foreign licensing with 642 titles available in 62 territories in 24 languages. In 2020, IDW kicked off a major new initiative to release key titles as Spanish-language graphic novels in the North American market with the release of Spanish-language editions of They Called Us Enemy, Red Panda & Moon Bear, Locke & Key and Sonic the Hedgehog.

IDWP’s largest segment is the publication of comic book and trade paperback products. Its comics and graphic novels are primarily distributed through three channels: (i) to comic book specialty stores (the “direct market”). Diamond serves as IDWP’s distributor to the direct market, worldwide and beginning June 1, 2022, PRHPS will replace Diamond as IDWP’s distributor to the direct market. Although returnability was offered temporarily on products sold to the direct market in light of COVID-19, most products have reverted back to pre-COVID-19 non-returnability; (ii) to traditional retail outlets, including bookstores and mass market stores, on a returnable basis (the “non-direct market”). IDWP’s non-direct market distributor is PRHPS. IDWP works together with PRHPS to sell-in and promote IDWP titles to buyers at non-direct market customers such as Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Baker & Taylor, Ingram, Follett, Target, Walmart, and more; and (iii) to Ebook distributors (“digital publishers”). IDWP’s publications are widely available digitally through popular distributors such as Comixology, Amazon, Apple iTunes and iBooks, Google Play, Hoopla, Overdrive, and via IDWP’s own webstore at idwpublishing.com. Through the direct market and non-direct market, IDWP, including its imprint Top Shelf Productions, sold over 5.2 million units in fiscal year 2020 and was recognized as the fourth largest publisher in its category in calendar year 2019.



IDWP’s original agreement with Penguin Random House in June 2016 had a three-year term and automatically renewed for another three years unless terminated earlier.  Pursuant to the agreement, Penguin Random House is the exclusive worldwide distributor for all IDWP products other than periodical comic books for the non-direct market channel, and provides of the following services: warehousing, customer service, order fulfilment, shipping, returns processing, billing/collections, customer credit management, sales, sales reporting, stock control and Web-access to sales and inventory information.  In addition, to the non-direct market channel, IDWP’s agreement allows for Penguin Random House to provide distribution on a non-exclusive basis for the direct-to-consumer channel through Penguin Random House online consumer sites in the United States and Canada.



The agreement obligates Penguin Random House to, among other things, use reasonable skill and care in accordance with its usual practice in providing the services; and maintain a reserve against future returns. The agreement provides for the allocation of risk related to the products to be distributed between the IDWP and Penguin Random House and related to collection of amounts owing.



The agreement provides that both IDWP and Penguin Random House will not be liable to each other for failure to perform any obligation under the agreement to the extent that and so long as the failure is caused matters beyond their control.



The agreement also provides that either party may terminate the agreement upon a material or persistent uncured breach by the other party, or, on six months’ notice following a change of control of either party or party’s parent.



The agreement also contains customary indemnification and confidentiality provisions.



In June 2021, the original agreement with PRHPS was amended pursuant to which the original term was extended to March 31, 2024 and IDWP granted PRHPS exclusive worldwide multi-year sales and distribution rights for IDWP’s newly published and backlist comic book periodicals, trade collections, and graphic novels to the Direct Market comic shops beginning June 1, 2022. Pursuant to the amendment, PRHPS will (1) provide warehousing, customer service, order fulfilment, shipping, returns processing, billing/collections, customer credit management, sales, sales reporting, stock control and Web-access to sales and inventory information for IDWP’s single issue comic books and other products manufactured by IDWP and intended for distribution to the direct market and (2) maintain and operate a .biz retailer website for the provision of such services to IDWP.  



In 2014, IDWP launched IDW Games to develop and publish card, board, and tabletop games. Similar to IDWP’s book content, IDW Games offered a mix of popular licensed titles and creator developed strategic hobby games. IDW Games’ products were sold to distributors worldwide and are available through retailers such as Gamestop, Barnes & Noble, and Amazon, independent games and comics stores, as well as the direct-to-consumer channel through its website and marketing campaigns. In calendar 2021, the Company wound down IDW Games and, going forward, IDW Games is only backfilling final orders.



To further expand and build creator-owned properties beyond publishing, IDWP works with IDWE, as well as other outside partners, to bring creator-owned franchises to television and film through licensing arrangements.



To expand its business and outperform its industry competitors, IDWP continues to focus on launching new creator-owned titles and partnering with established brands to bring fan-favorite properties to the comics market. IDWP is expanding the reach of existing and new products through the development of specialty, library, and education markets; increased direct-to-consumer initiatives; and broadening the reach of creator-driven series through licensing opportunities.

In May 2019, IDWMH invested in a new publishing entity, Clover Press, established by Ted Adams and Robbie Robbins, co-founders of IDWP. Clover Press is a separate entity and operates independently from IDWP. Due to its size, and nature of the business, activity related to Clover Press was included with IDWP for presentation purposes while it was a consolidated entity. Effective April 1, 2020 IDWMH’s interest in Clover Press decreased to 19.9%, as a result it is now an investment valued at cost and no longer consolidated.



IDWP’s revenues represented 78% and 62.5% of our consolidated revenues in the fiscal years ended October 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  



IDW Entertainment 



IDWE is a production company and studio that develops, produces and distributes content based on IDWP’s original IP for a variety of formats including film and television.



IDWE was formed on September 20, 2013 to leverage IDWP properties into television series, features and other forms of media by developing and producing original content. IDWE maintains a robust development slate of properties based on IDWP properties primarily for the adult series marketplace and is in advanced conversations with various global studios and networks for their exploitation. IDWE actively recruits and acquires new franchise material for exploitation primarily in the series format.



IDWE has developed and/or produced three series for television that premiered in calendar 2020 and 2021:




● | Wynonna Earp season four aired in two parts due to worldwide COVID-19 related production shutdowns. The first six episodes of season four premiered July 26, 2020 and the second half of season four began airing March 5, 2021. The show was created by Emily Andras and stars Melanie Scrofano and is based on the IDWP comics of Beau Smith. Season four’s twelve episodes are being produced by Seven24 Films and distributed by IDWE, in partnership with Syfy and CTV Sci-Fi. Cineflix Studios is the co-producer and global distributor for the series. Season one’s thirteen episodes aired in fiscal 2016. Season two’s twelve episodes aired in fiscal 2017, and Season three’s twelve episodes aired in fiscal 2018.

● | V Wars debuted on Netflix on December 5, 2019. The 10-episode vampire thriller stars Ian Somerhalder and was produced by High Park Entertainment. The series was based upon Jonathan Maberry’s IDWP comic book series of the same name. The rights to IDWE’s streaming genre series V Wars reverts back to IDW in 2022; as a result we will be exploring opportunities to monetize the past season and potential opportunities to continue the story with a new partner. 


● | October Faction premiered on Netflix on January 23, 2020. The 10-episode show was based on the IDWP comics of Steve Niles and Damien Worm and was adapted by showrunner Damian Kindler and starred Tamara Taylor and J.C. MacKenzie. It was also produced by High Park Entertainment. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Locke & Key premiered on Netflix on February 7, 2020. The show is based on the critically-acclaimed graphic novels of Joe Hill and Gabriel Rodriguez published by IDWP. Season two has been set to air in October 2021 and Season three has been ordered by Netflix. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Locke & Key premiered on Netflix on February 7, 2020. The show is based on the critically-acclaimed graphic novels of Joe Hill and Gabriel Rodriguez published by IDWP. Season two has been set to air in October 2021 and Season three has been ordered by Netflix. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | IDWE recently closed a deal to develop a new animated series based on one of our popular Top Shelf graphic novels with a major kid’s cable network.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Surfside Girls is currently in production for Apple TV+ and is based on the Top Shelf graphic novel of the same name. The 10-episode season one live-action series will wrap production in February 2022 and, while there is no release date yet announced, will most likely premiere before the end of 2022.



While in the past IDWE focused solely on TV development and production opportunities, a broadening of our strategic goals has evolved to focus on the building of a film slate and podcast opportunities. With more varied opportunities for our content and IP, we will be able to grow our brand, expand the perception of what IDWE does, and ultimately grow revenue and opportunities as an entertainment production/studio in the comic book/graphic novel space.

IDWE’s revenues represented 22.0% and 37.5% of our consolidated revenues in the fiscal years ended October 31, 2021 and October 31, 2020, respectively.



CTM (Discontinued operations)



As a result of the economic downturn related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impact it had on CTM, the Company decided to sell CTM and focus on our entertainment and publishing business.  Pursuant to a SPA dated as of July 14, 2020, we sold all of the stock of CTM to an assignee of the Chairman in exchange for (i) the cancelation of $3.75 million of indebtedness owed by us to the Chairman’s designee, (ii) a contingent payment of up to $3.25 million based upon a recovery of quarterly revenues of CTM to 90% of its fiscal 2019 levels during the 18-month period following the CTM Sale Date, and (iii) a contingent payment if CTM is sold within 36 months of the CTM Sale Date for more than $4.5 million.  The CTM Sale closed on February 15, 2021 and CTM is only consolidated up until the sale date with the gain reflected separately in the consolidated statement of operations.



Our Strategy  



IDWP and IDWE work together to jointly and synergistically develop and produce books and entertainment so as to allow us to capitalize on the global demand for original content from streaming services as well as traditional broadcast and other networks and other content services. We seek to improve our strategic positioning across all media, whenever possible and financial performance by primarily focusing on development of entertainment that can generate value from our intellectual property and to increase coordination between IDWP and IDWE to improve our development pipeline. To date, we have sold projects to Hulu, Syfy, BBC America, Netflix and Endeavor Content, while others are in active discussion. We believe that our potential projects would be attractive to a broad range of potential distribution channels and participants.



We seek to own “all rights” to intellectual property (“IP”) of our content in order to, afford us significant production-based fees supplemented by merchandising, games, video and other fandom-driven revenue opportunities.



We believe that our key strategic points of differentiation include:




● | IP creation, control and ownership through a creator-friendly (e.g., Steve Niles, Joe Hill) publishing engine and high-value licenses (e.g. ViacomCBS, Sega). 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | TV and film development, production and distribution (e.g., Surfside Girls, Locke & Key) with a platform agnostic approach to partnership. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Merchandise via partnerships and direct-to-consumer sales. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------




Given recent developments surrounding COVID-19, IDWP has revised its ongoing release schedule to better align with the needs and capacity of the changing retail marketplace. IDWP continues to serve both the direct and non-direct markets through its distribution partners and has added an increased focus on direct to consumer, digital initiatives, and development of merchandise. Content generation remains a key priority for IDWP as we continue to launch new creator-owned titles and expand partnerships with established brands to bring fan-favorite properties to the comics, graphic novel, and games markets. During the market slowdown, IDWP was able to quickly reduce ongoing content production to better suit the needs of the organization at the time, picking back up as the market showed signs of recovery.



In an effort to manage the risks associated with COVID-19, IDWE diversified its development slate and staffed appropriately to focus on both kids and adult animation projects, which minimize the effects of COVID-19 through remote work-from-home initiatives. IDWE can shift into work-from-home protocols seamlessly thanks to our centralized filing and workflow systems. Though television will remain the core business, we are also expanding into podcasts, and other digital content as a way to increase the creation of IP.



Competition 



IDWP competes most directly with both public and privately held companies that publish or license for publishing comic books and graphic novels, and further develop their franchises through digital media including shows and feature films. Public company competitors for IDWP include Disney (Marvel) and WarnerMedia (DC). Privately held competitors include Oni Press, Boom! Studios, Dark Horse (Embracer Group) and Image Comics. 





6







IDWE competes with all forms of entertainment. A significant number of companies produce and/or distribute television shows and films, and provide pay television and SVOD programming services. IDWE also competes to obtain creative talents and story properties that are essential to the success of our IDWE business.



The success of our operations is heavily dependent upon public taste and preferences. In addition, operating results fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the television and book markets. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods.



Intellectual Property



There are two primary sources of the content that IDWP develops, publishes, and exploits across a range of distribution channels:




● | Original, creator-owned material that marks its debut to the consuming public via IDWP’s published products (“Creator Content”); and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Content that has already been successfully exploited in other media (“Licensed Content”). 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




IDWP enters into publishing agreements with owners of both Creator Content and Licensed Content pursuant to which IDWP licenses the right to exploit such content (“Publishing Agreements”).



IDWP’s Publishing Agreements grant to IDWP exclusive, long term, worldwide rights to publish and sell the licensed content in all languages via traditional channels such as print and digital comics, graphic novels, and trade collections, and niche channels such as board games, coloring books, audio on demand, and high-end limited edition publications (“Publishing Rights”).



A smaller percentage of Publishing Agreements cover a more limited range of licensed rights in order to accommodate pre-existing products and markets already established by licensors such as foreign publishers seeking to have IDWP publish an English only version, licensed content owners seeking expansion into niche markets that can be more successfully exploited by IDWP, and establish authors who have already enjoyed publishing success prior to partnering with IDWP.



Many of IDWP’s Creator Content Publishing Agreements also grant to IDWP exclusive film, television, merchandising, and other ancillary worldwide rights in all formats, languages, and current and future media and delivery technologies (“Ancillary Rights”) that can then be exploited through IDWE or otherwise. 



IDWP exploits the Publishing Rights via sales to comic book specialty stores, traditional retail outlets, and direct to consumers, and via sublicenses to digital distribution platforms and foreign territory sub-publishers.



IDWP exploits the Ancillary Rights primarily via its relationship with IDWE, but also through other third-party buyers.



IDWP has registered and owns domain names that it uses to digitally promote and sell its products. It also has trademarked its name and logo, as well as the name and logo of its Top Shelf Productions imprint.



IDWP has developed game mechanics for certain of its game products that it treats as proprietary intellectual property in its Publishing Agreements.



Regulation 



The County of Los Angeles, in the state of California, has been subject to regulatory protocols associated with reopening the music, television and film production industries, which were closed as a result of COVID-19. Effective June 12, 2020, the County of Los Angeles Department of Public Health adopted a staged approach, supported by science and public health expertise, to allow music, television and film production to resume. These protocols, which are required to be adhered, cover (1) workplace policies and practices to protect employee health; (2) measures to ensure physical distancing; (3) measures to ensure infection control; (4) communication with employees and the public; and (5) measures to ensure equitable access to critical services. We are complying with all regulatory protocols associated with the County of Los Angeles Department of Public Health.
Employees 



As of January 19, 2022, the Company had 78 full-time United States employees and 3 part-time employees, including 58 full-time employees and 2 part-time employees at IDWP, 10 full-time employees at IDWE, and 10 full-time employees and 1 part-time employee at IDW Media Holdings.
