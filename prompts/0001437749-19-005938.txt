Overview
 
Through Healthcare Staffing, Inc. ("HCS"), our wholly-owned subsidiary acquired on July 27, 2017, we provide outsourced health care staffing and related services in the State of Georgia. The Company has also historically owned a portfolio of mortgage securities which generated earnings to support on-going financial obligations. These securities were marketed for sale and sold for a total of $13 million during 2018.  Our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, is traded on the OTC Pink marketplace of the OTC Markets Group, Inc. under the symbol “NOVC”.
Recent Developments
 
Emergence from Bankruptcy. On July 20, 2016 (the “Bankruptcy Petition Date”), Novation and three of its subsidiaries, NovaStar Mortgage LLC (“NMLLC”), NovaStar Mortgage Funding Corporation and 2114 Central LLC (the “Debtors”), filed voluntary petitions (the “Bankruptcy Petitions”) for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland (the “Bankruptcy Court”).  The Company and one of its subsidiaries subsequently filed with the Bankruptcy Court, and amended, a plan of reorganization (the “Plan”) for the resolution of the outstanding claims against and interests pursuant to Section 1121(a) of the Bankruptcy Code (as amended and supplemented, the "Plan") and a related disclosure statement.  The Bankruptcy Court entered an order on June 12, 2017 confirming the Plan (the “Confirmation Order”) solely with respect to the Company, which provided that the effective date of the Plan will occur when all conditions precedent to effectiveness, as set forth in the Plan, have been satisfied or waived. Two of the conditions to the effectiveness of the Plan were (i) the closing of the Company’s acquisition (the “HCS Acquisition”) of all of the capital stock of HCS and (ii) the restructuring of the Company’s then outstanding senior notes. The HCS Acquisition and the note restructuring were completed on July 27, 2017 and the Company filed a Notice of Occurrence of Effective Date of the Plan with the Bankruptcy Court. Under the Plan, holders of existing equity interests in the Company (i.e., the common stock) retained their interests.
 
On September 25, 2017, the bankruptcy case of 2114 Central, LLC was dismissed by order of the Bankruptcy Court.  Thereafter, on December 22, 2017, NMLLC filed with the Bankruptcy Court a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization, and on December 26, 2017 filed a related disclosure statement.  The Bankruptcy Court entered an order on February 16, 2018 approving the disclosure statement, as revised.  On April 11, 2018, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed NMLLC's plan of reorganization.  This plan allows NMLLC to exit bankruptcy, but prohibits the use of NMLLC assets for anything other than for the payment of NMLLC obligations.  See Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies for settlement information that was agreed to by NMLLC as part of its reorganization efforts.  These obligations of approximately $1.5 million are captured in Note 2 - Reorganization in the numbers reported for the year ended December 31, 2018.
 
Acquisition of Healthcare Staffing, Inc. On July 27, 2017, the Company completed the HCS Acquisition, acquiring all of the outstanding capital stock of HCS from Butler America, LLC (“Butler”) for approximately $24.0 million in cash, pursuant to the terms and conditions of a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of February 1, 2017 (as amended, the “HCS Purchase Agreement”), by and among the Company, Novation Holding, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“NHI”), HCS and Butler. The purchase price is subject to adjustment as provided in the HCS Purchase Agreement. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the HCS Acquisition. The operations of HCS are the Company’s primary operations.
Note Refinancing. On July 27, 2017, the Company entered into a Senior Secured Note Purchase Agreement, dated as of the same date (the “Note Purchase Agreement”), with NHI and HCS as guarantors (together with the Company, collectively, the “Credit Parties”), Taberna Preferred Funding I, Ltd. (“Taberna I”), Taberna Preferred Funding II, Ltd. (“Taberna II”) and Kodiak CDO I, Ltd. (“Kodiak” and, together with Taberna I and Taberna II, the “Noteholders”) and Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, as collateral agent for the benefit of the Noteholders, to refinance $85,937,500 of principal indebtedness of the Company under the Company’s senior notes (collectively, the “2011 Notes”) held by the Noteholders, issued pursuant to three Indentures, each dated as of March 22, 2011 (the “Note Refinancing”). Pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, the Noteholders exchanged their 2011 Notes for new notes from the Company in the same aggregate principal amount (collectively, the “2017 Notes”) on the terms and conditions set forth therein. The unpaid principal amounts of the 2017 Notes bear interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 3.5% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears until maturity on March 30, 2033. The 2017 Notes generally rank senior in right of payment to any existing or future subordinated indebtedness of the Credit Parties. See Notes 2 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the Note Refinancing.

Business
 
Our business includes the operation of HCS and the management of our other investments, as described below.
 
HCS
 
Established in 1995, HCS is the largest outsourced healthcare services provider in the State of Georgia. HCS delivers outsourced full-time and part-time employees primarily to Community Service Boards (“CSB”). A CSB is a quasi-state organization providing behavioral health services at facilities across Georgia including mental health services, developmental disabilities programs and substance abuse treatments. The State of Georgia has a total of 21 CSB. Each CSB has a number of facilities, including crisis centers, outpatient centers and 24-hour group homes that require a broad range of employees, such as registered nurses, social workers, house parents and supervisors. The CSB market in Georgia is large and growing steadily, as the demand for the services provided by the CSB continues to grow. The Georgia Association for CSB estimates that CSB in Georgia provided services to more than 173,000 people in 2010, a figure that grew to more than 188,000 people in 2016. In addition to providing outsourced employees to CSB, HCS also provides healthcare outsourcing and staffing services to hospitals, schools, crisis units, clinics, doctors offices, prisons and a variety of privately owned businesses.
 
Over the past 15 years, HCS has become the largest medical services outsource provider in Georgia, operating throughout the state. HCS has long-term relationships with its customers and has been providing services to several clients for more than 15 years. The services and positions provided to non-CSB clients are similar to the ones provided to CSB client.
 
Other Investments
 
Prior to 2017, the Company originated, purchased, securitized, sold, invested in and serviced residential nonconforming mortgage loans and mortgage securities. As a result of those activities, we acquired mortgage securities that continued to be a source of our earnings and cash flow. Residual securities consisted of interest-only and overcollateralization bonds. Collectively, these securities are referred to as our retained mortgage securities. The Company marketed these securities for sale and sold them during 2018 for a total of $13 million.
Strategy
 
The strategy of HCS is to continue expanding its market share in providing healthcare staffing services in Georgia and in particular serving Georgia CSBs. HCS is the dominant player in providing services to Georgia CSBs and has earned a market share of 55% of the CSB business. HCS will also continue to expand business to additional hospitals, private group homes, clinics, rest homes, prisons and retirement centers. Furthermore, the HCS strategy includes expanding clerical staff within existing customers, as well as gaining new clients. The longer-term strategy includes expansion beyond the Georgia market and may include acquisitions of staffing companies outside of Georgia, particularly in states that have public health infrastructure similar to that of Georgia.
 
We expect to use profits from HCS along with, potentially, other funding sources to acquire other businesses or make investments.
 
Competition
 
HCS competes with numerous national staffing and recruiting businesses that specialize in the medical and healthcare industry, such as Nursefinders, Lighthouse Recruiting, Action Med and Brightstar. Other national staffing businesses have divisions that compete with HCS in Georgia, including Kelly Services, Interim, Randstad and Maxim. Numerous Georgia non-national and smaller staffing providers also compete with HCS.
Regulation
 
The healthcare industry is subject to extensive and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations related to, among other things, conduct of operations, and costs and payment for services. HCS is not directly regulated as a healthcare provider, although the customers of HCS are highly regulated. Therefore, HCS complies with many of the regulations prescribed for its customers.
 
HCS provides services directly to its clients on a contract basis and receives payment directly from them. However, many clients are reimbursed under the federal Medicare program and state Medicaid programs for the services they provide. Therefore, HCS also may be affected indirectly by reimbursement changes in government programs, particularly Medicare and Medicaid.
