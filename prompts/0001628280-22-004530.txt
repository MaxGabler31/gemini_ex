Our Purpose and Mission
Our purpose is to empower people by simplifying work. As a result, our mission is to help organizations succeed with Apple.
Overview
We are the standard in Apple Enterprise Management, and our cloud software platform is the only vertically-focused Apple infrastructure and security platform of scale in the world. We help IT and security teams confidently protect the devices, data, and applications used by their workforce, while providing employees with consumer-simple, privacy-protecting technology. With Jamf’s software, devices can be deployed to employees brand new in the shrink-wrapped box, set up automatically and personalized at first power-on and administered continuously throughout the lifecycle of the device.
Jamf was founded in 2002, around the same time that Apple was leading an industry transformation. Apple transformed the way people access and utilize technology through its focus on creating a superior consumer experience. With the release of revolutionary products like the Mac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad, Apple built the world’s most valuable brand and became ubiquitous in everyday life.
We believe employees have come to expect the same high-quality Apple user experience at work as they enjoy in their personal lives. This is often not possible as many organizations rely on legacy solutions to administer devices or do not give employees a choice of device. Unlike competitors, our software solutions are Apple-first and Apple-best to preserve and extend the native Apple experience, allowing employees to use their devices as they do in their personal lives, while retaining their privacy and fulfilling IT’s enterprise requirements around deployment, access, and security.
We have built our company through a primary focus on being the leading solution for Apple in the enterprise because we believe that due to Apple’s broad range of devices, combined with the changing demographics of today’s workforce and their strong preference for Apple, that Apple will become the number one device ecosystem in the enterprise by the end of this decade. We believe that the enterprise management provider that is best at Apple will one day be the enterprise leader, and that Jamf is best positioned for that leadership. Through our long-standing relationship with Apple, we have accumulated significant Apple technical experience and expertise that give us the ability to fully and quickly leverage and extend the capabilities of Apple products, operating systems, and services. This expertise enables us to fully support new innovations and operating system releases the moment they are made available by Apple. This focus has allowed us to create a best-in-class user experience in the enterprise and grow to more than 60,000 customers deploying 26.6 million devices in more than 100 countries and territories as of December 31, 2021.
We sell our SaaS solutions via a subscription model, through a direct sales force, online, and indirectly via our channel partners, including Apple. Our multi-dimensional go-to-market model and cloud-deployed offering enable us to reach all organizations around the world, large and small, with our software solutions. As a result, we continue to see rapid growth and expansion of our customer base as Apple continues to gain momentum in the enterprise. Our customers include many highly recognizable brands and organizations including Apple itself, 9 of the largest 10 Fortune 500 companies, 8 of the top 10 Fortune 500 technology companies, 22 of the 25 most valuable brands (according to the Forbes Most Valuable Brands rankings), and 10 of the 10 largest U.S. banks (based on total assets according to bankrate.com) as of December 31, 2021. Additionally, we see opportunities to sell add-on products from our software platform into our current install base in order to provide greater value for our customers. Our focus on customer success and innovation has resulted in a Net Promoter Score of 50 as of December 31, 2021, which significantly exceeds industry averages.
Complementing our software platform is Jamf Nation, the world’s largest online community of IT and security professionals focused exclusively on Apple in the enterprise. This active, grassroots community serves as a highly-qualified and efficient crowd-sourced Q&A engine for anyone with questions about Apple deployments. This community selflessly acts as a resource for existing and potential customers and is also an important asset in providing feature feedback and ideas for our product roadmap.
On July 1, 2021, we completed our acquisition of Wandera, Inc. (“Wandera”), a leader in zero trust cloud security and access for mobile devices, extending our leadership in Apple Enterprise Management. The acquisition uniquely positions us to 
help IT and security teams protect devices, data, and applications while extending the intended Apple experience through the most robust and scalable Apple Enterprise Management platform in the market. Further, as we strive to enable an outstanding Apple experience, we look beyond the device hardware and ensure the full technology stack between the user and the application is harmonized. This experience includes identity and access management that does not harshly interrupt user productivity and workflows, security monitoring that respects end user privacy, and traffic routing that is optimized for each specific application — regardless of the location of the end user. From advanced anti-phishing and network threat protection to privacy-aware content filtering and fast, secure zero trust access, our network-based technologies are designed for any end user working from any platform.
Industry Background
Key trends impacting how enterprises use and manage technology to engage employees and drive productivity include:
Apple’s democratization of technology
Apple is ubiquitous. It is the most valuable brand in the world according to Forbes, and in 2018, it became the first company to cross a market capitalization of $1 trillion. Apple’s success has been driven by delivering the best user experience to its customers through its innovative combination of hardware, software, and cloud services. It has transformed the technology landscape by placing the user first, creating a harmonious, interconnected experience across devices, and designing everything around maximizing the Apple user experience.
In the 1990s and early 2000s, endpoint technology was dominated by Microsoft Windows, particularly in the workplace. Many enterprises prioritized standardization over user experience in order to facilitate the deployment, security, and management of massive numbers of Windows PCs. Employees were not typically given a choice in their devices. In the 2000s, Apple introduced a series of revolutionary products that transformed how the world interacts with technology. Apple released the iPod in 2001, followed by the iPhone in 2007, and the iPad in 2010. These products, which utilized Apple iOS (Apple’s proprietary mobile operating system), shared a design element that placed the user first. The rapid rise in popularity of iOS devices, combined with the proliferation of web-based applications, created a “halo effect,” leading to a resurgence of Apple’s Mac computer. These devices empowered users to easily leverage powerful technology regardless of their technical expertise. Apple’s consumer-focused technology provided a significantly more capable, intuitive, and faster experience than the technology many employees previously had in the workplace.
Apple’s focus on the user experience has transformed employees’ expectations for technology overall. Employees expect a simple, intuitive, seamless experience that fosters creativity, productivity, and collaboration. Apple currently offers an entire ecosystem of desktops, laptops, tablets, phones, and wearable devices designed to interoperate seamlessly at home, at work, and everywhere in-between. This has made Apple the leading technology brand overall, with nearly 60% of Apple users “not being able to live without the brand,” according to a 2021 brand intimacy study by MBLM.
The consumerization of IT
The consumerization of IT refers to the migration of software and hardware products originally designed for personal use into the enterprise. Today, employees are often less inclined to draw a line between work and personal technology and commonly prefer not to settle for enterprise solutions that are harder to use than what they have at home. In response to the consumerization of IT movement, enterprises are transforming digitally to create a more engaged workforce, offering employees consumer-like tools and choice of technology brands. As the competition for talent escalates, we believe technology will play a central role in either improving or degrading the employee experience. Empowering employees to use their preferred devices is important to attract, engage, and retain productive employees. Today, with more organizations than ever before managing and onboarding new employees remotely, the technology experience and the employee experience are synonymous.
Rapidly evolving workplace demographics are also accelerating the consumerization of IT. Millennials currently represent the largest segment of the U.S. workforce, and have been since 2016, according to a 2018 study by the Pew Research Center. Millennials are the first digitally-native generation that has grown up with broadband, smartphones, tablets, laptops, and a massive library of apps through which they interact with the world and each other. Millennials demand more from their enterprise IT organizations. They expect to work from anywhere at any time. They expect to be able to collaborate instantly. They expect to have a choice in the technology brand they use.
This trend is expected to continue as younger generations continue to enter the workforce and workplace technology continues to directly impact employment decision-making. In a 2021 survey conducted by Vanson Bourne and commissioned by us, 89% of workers are willing to make a salary sacrifice for device choice and nearly two-thirds would choose Apple.
Consumerization of IT has been one of the most significant trends impacting enterprise IT over the past decade. This trend is exemplified by Apple’s iPhone, introduced in 2007. The iPhone was quickly preferred by many employees for its superior user experience compared to the corporate issued mobile phones controlled by enterprise IT departments. Mass consumer adoption of the iPhone pushed organizations to develop corporate policies that support the use of personal devices for work. As a result, Apple — the ultimate consumer technology company — has become critically important to enterprise IT organizations.
Apple’s momentum in enterprise IT
Fueled by Apple’s popularity and the consumerization of IT, Apple devices have gained widespread acceptance across the enterprise, from the executive suite to new hires. As a result, Apple market share in the enterprise has grown significantly. According to Apple CEO Tim Cook, Apple is now in every Fortune 500 company, and “eight in ten companies are writing custom apps for their enterprise.” Apple’s enterprise revenue, disclosed as $25 billion in 2015, is estimated to have grown to over $40 billion in 2019 according to Atherton Research. Apple’s commitment to the enterprise has expanded through partnerships with enterprise giants, such as Accenture, Cisco, Deloitte, General Electric, IBM, Salesforce, and SAP.
Evidence of this momentum is further supported by Statcounter, an organization that aggregates data based on web traffic. According to Statcounter, Apple operating systems comprised 24% of global web traffic (both business and consumer) in December 2021, up from 4% in January 2009. Apple’s gains in the U.S. have been even more significant, with Apple operating systems now representing over 44% of web traffic in December 2021, compared to 30% for Microsoft and 24% for Google. Over that same period, the market share of Microsoft in the U.S. has declined from 92% to 30%. According to IDC data, the Mac has been the fastest growing computer worldwide for the past two years with a Compound Annual Growth rate of 25%, more than ten percentage points faster than growth of the PC industry, and faster than all other major PC brands.
The increased use of mobile devices to access the internet is largely responsible for the decline in market share of Windows over the past decade. Over this same decade, however, the Mac computer has grown in popularity and market share, further demonstrating that Apple’s increased use is not limited to iOS devices. While the Mac computer was once primarily associated with creative or artistic activities, it now represents a growing share of computers within the enterprise. According to a 2021 IDC Report (Worldwide Unified Endpoint Management Software for Apple Devices 2021 Vendor Assessment), adoption of Mac usage in the enterprise (firms with 1,000+ employees according to IDC) is growing by many measures. In the United States, average penetration of macOS devices was around 23% in 2020, compared with 17% in 2019, according to IDC’s 2020 and 2019 Enterprise Mobility and Workspace Software Surveys. This wave of new Mac devices requiring seamless remote access to business apps and resources is causing friction among many enterprise end-user computing support and management teams, which have historically focused more on Windows device management. Macs, of course, are not the entire story around Apple devices in the enterprise. According to IDC’s 2021 enterprise survey, iPhones account for 49% of the smartphone installed base among U.S. enterprises, and iPads make up the majority of tablets used in the enterprise.
Given the expectations of both current and future employees, offering employees a choice in technology brand is becoming imperative for many enterprises. When given a choice, more than 70% of employees surveyed worldwide would choose Mac over PC and iOS over Android, according to a 2018 survey conducted by us. Considering IDC’s estimate of current Mac enterprise penetration, we believe there is significant opportunity to fill the gap between how many employees want a Mac and how many currently use one.
Digital transformation in response to COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the need for solutions to empower remote work, distance learning, and telehealth. While these trends were gaining mind share prior to the pandemic, the pandemic created momentum for these digital transformation changes that we believe will continue post COVID-19. Workflows that were once aspirational have become essential. For example, many companies with a remote workforce need to ship devices directly from the manufacturer to the end user and have all the enterprise requirements fulfilled without IT ever touching the devices. While this workflow has been used by some organizations in the past to increase IT efficiency and smooth the user experience, it now has become a logistical and scalable advantage for device distribution and employee safety. In healthcare, providers are attempting to conserve personal protective equipment and generally minimize in-person patient contact. As such, providers have used iPads to facilitate virtual inpatient care, serve patients at home, and connect isolated patients with loved ones, with some providers even loaning the 
required devices to patients. In education, digital technology has never played a more important role, and many school districts continue to offer fully remote or hybrid learning models. These school districts require a solution that helps educators, students, and parents embrace distance learning technology. This sudden and significant shift from in-person to virtual interactions is forcing these modern workflows into the mainstream. The vision of employee or student empowerment delivered through Jamf solutions can help organizations operate at the level they did before the necessity to conduct their business or function in a remote environment.
We believe these trends will continue. According to a 2021 Gallup study, COVID-accelerated remote work trends have persisted with nearly half of employed Americans working exclusively or partially remote and over 90% of such remote workers hoping remote work continues post-pandemic. More organizations than ever before are examining their remote employee and work-from-home policies and looking for solutions to guide them. According to a 2021 PricewaterhouseCoopers study, over 70% of executives are planning new investment in tools for virtual collaboration and/or IT infrastructure to secure virtual connectivity to support remote work. Now, the technology experience and the employee experience are synonymous.
The limitations of legacy enterprise solutions
Legacy solutions do not deliver the full Apple user experience because they are either outdated, overly Windows-centric, or treat all devices the same across operating systems. In particular, cross-platform solutions that treat devices the same tend to rely on the lowest common denominator technology that is shared across the relevant ecosystems. Apple, Microsoft, and Google have each introduced device-specific cloud services to automate enterprise IT processes. Fully embracing these cloud services demands specific focus on the respective ecosystem. Legacy solutions do not leverage the native capabilities of Apple and do not deliver the full Apple experience across several key areas, including the following:
•Provisioning and deployment. Legacy solutions commonly rely on processes, such as disk imaging, that are manual or time-intensive for IT departments and diminish the Apple user experience. As a result, IT departments need to spend additional time and effort setting up and configuring devices similar to a traditional PC deployment, and users receive a muted Apple experience that is overly complex and falls short of expectations.
•Operating system updates. Cross-platform legacy solutions are unable to allocate sufficient resources to always support the latest operating systems from all manufacturers. As a result, IT departments are forced to place moratoriums on operating system upgrades (through manually distributed emails) so they can test and then slowly roll out operating system upgrades weeks or months after they become available. This approach is contrary to Apple user expectations and also delays deployment of potentially important security updates which often results in such solutions not supporting the latest Apple operating system features and can cause security vulnerabilities that put an organization at risk. This is exacerbated with the release of the Apple M1 chip on new Mac devices which revolutionizes its performance. Those not aligned with Apple and same-day support — be it management or security solution provider — are unable to support this new hardware which prevents users from being productive and protected.
•Application licensing and lifecycle. Cross-platform solutions offer limited options for application distribution and installation, which often require hands-on IT oversight. Microsoft, Apple, and Google each possess their own commerce solutions for third-party application purchases and distribution. Enterprise integrations for these commerce solutions require deep understanding of the platform and associated service. Cross-platform solutions have historically struggled to stay current with the standards of each platform’s features.
Additionally, the enterprise requirements for security and privacy result in the need to wrap applications with middleware, such as containers, degrading Apple’s intended user experience. License tracking in the cross-platform solution environment can also be manual. All of this effort creates extra and error-prone work for IT departments and dilutes the Apple user experience.
•Endpoint protection. Legacy solutions do not leverage Apple’s native security tools and Endpoint Security framework, thereby providing limited visibility into an organization’s fleet of devices and limited identification of potential security threats. Those not fully aligned with Apple’s native security tools and Endpoint Security framework are unable to support the Apple M1 chip for Mac and cannot apply new restrictions in Apple’s latest operating system, macOS Monterey, on M1 Mac devices.
In most cases, legacy solutions rely on endpoint protection solutions that were originally designed for Windows. As a result, these solutions deliver endpoint protection to devices in a manner which degrades the Apple user 
experience and performance and may not function properly in an Apple environment. In addition, the signature-based approach utilized by these solutions can only identify backward-looking threats specific to Microsoft and does not communicate with native Apple security tools that could identify more relevant and immediate threats.
•Identity-based access to resources. The concept of a workplace perimeter is quickly fading as employees demand flexibility to work from anywhere with seamless access to enterprise applications and resources. Enterprises need to make it simple for users to authenticate and access enterprise resources from anywhere with a single identity. To provide users access to corporate resources, many organizations bind their devices with Azure Active Directory (“AAD”). While binding devices to AAD works well with Windows-based devices, it does not create an efficient experience for other ecosystems, including Apple. Additionally, to be able to service devices in the enterprise, IT often creates a secondary administrator account on each device that tends to become a management headache, user experience burden, and security risk.
For enterprise Apple deployments, the limitations of legacy solutions all add up to higher operational and support costs, greater security vulnerability, lower productivity, and a degraded user experience. While its devices may have higher upfront costs, implementing the full Apple experience results in higher productivity and lower total cost of ownership. Realizing these potential benefits requires an enterprise software solution specifically built for the Apple ecosystem.
Our Solution
We are the standard in Apple Enterprise Management, and our cloud software platform is the only vertically-focused Apple infrastructure and security platform of scale in the world. Our SaaS solutions provide a cloud-based platform for full lifecycle enterprise security and IT management of devices. We help IT and security teams confidently protect the devices, data, and applications used by their workforce, while providing employees with consumer-simple, privacy-protecting technology. Our solutions are purpose-built to provide both technical and non-technical IT personnel with a single software platform to administer their end-users’ devices, while preserving the legendary Apple experience end-users have come to expect. We believe that our success is born out of a primary focus on Apple and our commitment to optimizing the end-to-end user experience. As of December 31, 2021, we had more than 60,000 customers, over 24,000 of which became customers in the last two years, in more than 100 countries and territories.
We believe employees have come to expect the same high-quality Apple user experience at work as they enjoy in their personal lives. This is often not possible as many organizations rely on legacy solutions to administer devices or do not give employees a choice of device. Unlike competitors, our software solutions are Apple-first and Apple-best to preserve and extend the native Apple experience, allowing employees to use their devices as they do in their personal lives, while retaining their privacy and fulfilling IT’s enterprise requirements around deployment, access, and security. Our software platform provides the following key benefits:
•Device provisioning and deployment. We provide a scalable, zero-IT-touch deployment right out of the shrink-wrapped box, personalized for each end-user. Our offering makes it possible for IT professionals to easily manage the traditionally challenging tasks of deployment, information encryption, and loading and updating software, without ever touching the device. Jamf customer research has shown that our seamless cloud deployment capabilities lower the total cost of ownership of its devices, enable the native Apple experience in the enterprise, and ultimately make the devices more effective and secure.
•Self-service. We extend the Apple experience with a customizable enterprise self-service app that empowers end users to satisfy their own IT needs. With a single click, end users can install apps pre-approved by IT, request a new app, automatically resolve common technical issues, and easily connect and configure enterprise resources, like the nearest printer, without waiting for IT. While the end user experience is simple, the range of capabilities is immense. Our self-service app empowers users to be productive and self-sufficient while simultaneously reducing the labor burden on IT.
•Operating system updates. Many Apple users expect immediate access to new features by upgrading the moment Apple releases a new operating system. Given our primary focus on Apple, we are able to offer robust, immediate support for operating system feature updates — including Apple’s new M1 chip for Mac — so they can be effortlessly deployed on the same day they are released by Apple. IT teams have the flexibility to automate updates or let users initiate the updates, ensuring employees stay up-to-date with all of the latest security and privacy features, plus leverage new Apple hardware once available.
•Application lifecycle and licensing. We give IT teams the ability to automate key workflows related to the installation and deployment of both Apple App Store and third-party applications, all from the most expansive app catalog, ensuring a more efficient IT management process. These capabilities include automated targeted distribution of apps to employees based on their work needs, user-initiated app installed via a customized enterprise app store and automated volume purchasing and license management, and automated tracking, deployment, and updating of third-party applications.
•Endpoint protection. We safeguard and amplify device security through an enterprise endpoint protection solution purpose-built for Apple and mobile devices. Jamf endpoint protection is specifically designed to identify Apple and mobile targeted threats while preserving user experience and performance. Our software solution is built around the unique challenges that Apple and mobile devices face in enterprise security, with behavior-based detection and prevention of Apple-specific threats and enterprise visibility into native Apple security tools. Through close monitoring of a device’s network communications, Jamf endpoint protection detects and blocks extends its protections to advanced security threats and phishing attacks. Jamf endpoint protection is architected using native Apple application programming interfaces (“APIs”) and designed to co-exist within an organization’s existing enterprise security solutions. It supports Apple’s new M1 chip and empowers IT, InfoSec, and end users to take advantage of the revolutionary efficiency, speed, and performance the M1 chip offers.
•Identity-based access to resources. We enable end users to easily and securely connect to enterprise resources with a single cloud-based identity credential, simplified using biometrics on the Apple device. End users can then immediately access all of their corporate applications and shared resources. This eliminates the time-consuming need for multiple logins, reduces the number of IT tickets for password-related issues (which are frequently the leading cause of IT tickets) and removes the need for IT administrators to bind devices to AAD. Additionally, Jamf is able to dynamically block or grant administrative rights on the Apple device itself based on an end user’s cloud-based identity, thus removing the need for additional administrator accounts on the device.
•Network risk management. Regardless of end-user device type, network security is critical, especially with remote work and as workers expect to access company resources anywhere at any time. Jamf replaces legacy conditional access and VPN technology to deliver true zero trust network access (“ZTNA”). It ensures that after a user authenticates into their device, business connections are secured while enabling non-business applications to route directly to the internet. This preserves end-user privacy and optimizes network infrastructure. We are focused on securing connections, regardless if the end user leverages Apple or another device type. Network security is an extension of the Apple experience, and Jamf is focused on protecting every connect point. 
Our software platform provides value to both end users and IT departments. Users receive the legendary Apple experience they have come to expect, and IT departments are able to empower employees, enhance productivity and lower total cost of ownership. According to a July 2021 Apple-commissioned study conducted by Forrester Consulting, The Total Economic Impact Of Mac In Enterprise: M1 Update, an M1 Mac in the enterprise results in $843 cost savings per device versus a comparable PC (when considering three-year hardware, software, support, and operational costs), a 20% improvement in employee retention, and a 5% increase in productivity of all employees. An M1 Mac also results in 48 hours of increased productivity per employee over three years. These metrics result in a payback period of less than 6 months for an M1 Mac.
Furthermore, 2021 Jamf customer research conducted by Hobson & Company and commissioned by us found benefits from simplifying IT management, reducing the time spent provisioning devices, the time spent on ongoing device management, and the time spent managing apps all by 90%. Additionally, that research found Jamf improved end-user experience, reducing end-user productivity loss due to technical problems by 90% and the time spent on help desk tickets by 70%. According to this research, Jamf also helped mitigate risk by reducing the time IT spent remediating incidents and vulnerabilities by 70%. Overall, Hobson & Company found that a typical organization could expect a 781% three-year return on investment and a 2.7 month payback period when using Jamf.
Our Relationship with Apple
Jamf was founded in 2002 with the sole mission of helping organizations succeed with Apple, making it the first Apple-focused device management solution. Today, we have become the largest infrastructure and software platform built specifically for enterprise deployments of the Apple ecosystem. Our relationship with Apple has endured and grown to be multi-faceted over the past 20 years.
To continuously offer a software solution built specifically for Apple, we have always worked closely with Apple’s worldwide developer relations organization in an effort to support all new Apple innovations the moment their hardware and software is released. Additionally, throughout the course of our relationship, Jamf and Apple have formalized several contractual agreements:
•Apple as a customer. In 2010, Apple became a Jamf customer, using our software solution to deploy and secure its fleet of devices internally. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Apple as a customer represented less than 1% of our total revenue.
•Apple as a channel partner in education and in retail. In 2011, Apple became a Jamf channel partner in the education market, reselling our software solution to K-12 and higher education organizations within the United States. In 2012, Apple expanded their channel relationship by offering our software solution to businesses through Apple retail stores in the United States. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Apple as a channel partner facilitated approximately 6% of our bookings.
•Mobility Partner Program. In 2014, we became a member of Apple’s Mobility Partner Program, which focuses on solution development and effective go-to-market activities.
Each of these contractual relationships continue to this day and span all enterprise technology across the Apple ecosystem, including Mac, iPad, iPhone, and Apple TV. In addition to these contractual relationships, Apple and Jamf personnel frequently join forces to influence and collaborate as we work with customers, helping them succeed with Apple.
Market Opportunity
We believe our solution addresses a large and growing market covering the use of Apple technology in the enterprise. According to Frost & Sullivan, the global Total Addressable Market for Apple Enterprise Management was estimated to be $12.2 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 17.7% to $23.4 billion by the end of 2024. This market represents the potential number of Apple mobile phones (iPhones), tablets (iPads), laptop and desktop computers (Macs), media streaming devices (Apple TVs), and portable media players (iPods) based on growing acceptance by education and business IT departments. Frost & Sullivan includes both devices purchased and provided by enterprises as well as bring your own devices (“BYODs”) owned by end-users that may require Apple Enterprise Management to provide necessary access to resources or services from the enterprises. The potential device numbers are multiplied by the Jamf average selling price (“ASP”) for each Apple device and enterprise type.
With the Wandera acquisition in 2021, we estimate that Jamf’s Total Addressable Market grew by $6 billion, to approximately $18 billion, as a result of the additional products we are able to sell to run on Apple devices. However, we believe our Total Addressable Market is even larger. While we strive to enable an outstanding Apple experience, we also look beyond the device hardware to ensure the full technology stack between the user and the application is optimized. This includes identity and access management that does not interrupt user productivity and workflows, security monitoring that respects end user privacy, and traffic routing that is optimized for each specific application. From advanced anti-phishing and network threat protection to privacy-aware content filtering and fast, secure zero trust access, our network-based technologies are designed for any end user working from any platform. We believe this cross-platform expansion knocks down barriers for customer adoption and will grow our Total Addressable Market. Additionally, we believe our Total Addressable Market could expand further as Apple may make additional devices available for enterprise management, such as the Apple Watch, and as we develop future solutions which provide value to enterprises managing their Apple ecosystem. We are currently in the process of refreshing our Total Addressable Market to incorporate a number of these factors.

This is evidenced by our growing number of more than 60,000 customers as of December 31, 2021, including 22 of the 25 most valuable brands (according to the Forbes Most Valuable Brands rankings). In addition, hundreds of independent customer ratings on popular software review websites, including Gartner Peer Insights, G2Crowd, and Capterra, have earned Jamf recognition as the “Customers’ Choice.” Through our intense focus on connecting, managing, and protecting devices, we are able to provide a differentiated solution when compared to other cross-platform providers who attempt to satisfy all requirements for all platforms.
•Strong partner ecosystem. Our meaningful expertise managing the Apple ecosystem and our unique understanding of enterprise customers have motivated us to publish a large catalog of open APIs so our customers can integrate and extend their existing software solutions. It is upon this robust APIs catalog that we have built a strong partner ecosystem that includes hundreds of integrations and solutions made available in our Jamf Marketplace.
In addition to our developer partners, we have relationships with solution partners. One example is the work we have done to integrate our products with Microsoft Endpoint Manager and AAD. Development activities with Microsoft have resulted in solutions that optimize the Apple ecosystem within a Microsoft-centric enterprise. Jamf’s authentication and account management solutions have deep integrations with AAD. Additionally, customers can sync their Jamf inventory data with Microsoft Endpoint Manager, providing a consolidated view of all devices from all manufacturers in the organization’s fleet. This integration provides customers with simple and unified visibility. In addition, the integration provides tremendous operational benefits, including enforcing compliance policies, ensuring only compliant devices can gain access to protected company resources like Office 365, and helping users remediate their device compliance issues via Jamf’s self-service application.
•Effective go-to-market capabilities. The combination of our strong partner ecosystem (including Apple and Microsoft), our e-commerce capability, and our extensive enterprise and inside sales organizations has created a differentiated and powerful go-to-market approach. We believe this robust go-to-market structure allows us to effectively and efficiently reach our entire addressable market, including both large and small organizations in all geographic regions throughout the world. This also allows us to “land and expand” within our customer base by beginning with a limited engagement at each customer and increasing that customer relationship over time.
•Differentiated technology. While Jamf technology has many powerful capabilities built to help promote digital transformation and satisfy the challenging requirements of connecting, managing, and protecting Apple in the enterprise, specific innovations that set us apart from others in the market include:
•Powerful architected-for-Apple agent. Apple IT administrators can access remote computers and file systems, collecting attributes and intelligence as if they were physically sitting with each and every Apple device in their fleet.
•Enterprise attributes and smart grouping. Through our smart grouping technology, Jamf can dynamically group devices, based on standard attributes, enterprise attributes, or a combination thereof to target and execute business workflows at scale.
•Leading security capabilities that extend cross-platform. Jamf is the only endpoint security vendor with natively integrated network security and secure connections to remote applications. 
•Industry-specific workflows. We have created industry-specific workflows that go beyond device management to solve issues for particular industries such as education, healthcare, and hospitality, including solutions built around remote work, distance learning, and telehealth.
•High performance native Apple APIs. Jamf creatively utilizes extensive APIs from published Apple technologies which allows us to be ready instantly with each new Apple operating system.
•Enterprise self-service. Our simple-to-use enterprise self-service solution enables IT to empower end-users with a privately brandable application that allows users to install approved apps or perform complex tasks from a personalized enterprise catalog.
Our Growth Strategy
We help organizations succeed with Apple by connecting the Apple experience with the needs of the enterprise. By preserving and enhancing the Apple experience in an enterprise context, we believe we can drive our growth within the current Apple ecosystem as well as fuel further Apple penetration in enterprises, which will extend our opportunity. The key elements of our growth strategy include:
•Extend technology leadership through R&D investment and new products. We intend to continue investing in research and development and pursuing select technology acquisitions in order to enhance our existing solutions, add new capabilities and deployment options, and expand use cases. For example, in 2021 following the Wandera acquisition, we launched three new products, Jamf Private Access (a ZTNA solution), Jamf Data Policy (a solution to enforce acceptable usage policies and manage data consumption), and Jamf Threat Defense (a mobile device solution to protect users from malicious intent). We believe this strategy of continued innovation will allow us to reach new customers, cross-sell to existing customers, and maintain our position as the standard for Apple in the enterprise. In addition, many organizations with Apple also have non-Apple devices. The solutions they use to connect, manage, and protect devices, users, and data can vary in platform-centricity (i.e. the level of focus centered on a specific platform, like Apple) as you move from the device to the network. As you move further away from device-level capabilities and move closer to cloud security and identity functions like network security and identity-based focus, the broader our focus is, and that’s where solutions that offer cross-platform support, such as Jamf Private Access, provide Jamf with the ability to capture Windows and Android users in addition to our Apple base.
•Deliver unique industry-specific innovation. All industries today are experiencing new challenges related to social distancing, such as remote work, distance learning, and telehealth. We intend to continue developing and enhancing Apple-specific functionality for certain verticals, such as education, healthcare, and hospitality, to help these organizations serve the changing needs of their students, teachers, patients, and workers. For example, our patented mobile-to-mobile management technology provides teachers and parents control over school-issued iPads — whether they are ten feet away or ten miles. We have patent-pending healthcare listener functionality that empowers hospitals to launch device workflows based on events in the electronic medical record, giving patients access to their care plans and control over their room environment through a hospital-issued iPad. We have also launched a patented telehealth workflow, Virtual Visits, aimed to protect providers while still connecting patients to care and their communities. Providers are able to virtually round to their patients, and patients can simply connect with families outside the hospital without IT ever having to touch the device. Once patients are discharged, Virtual Visits can help to automatically digitally wipe the device to prepare it for the next patient. We believe targeted, vertical-specific functionality can help us further penetrate industries which already use devices, or provide a differentiated solution to enter a new industry or solve a new use case.
•Grow customer base with targeted sales and marketing investment. We aim to expand our customer base by continuing to make significant and targeted investments in our direct sales and marketing in an effort to attract new customers and drive broader awareness of our software solutions. In addition, with our expanded platform, we can reach beyond our historical sales efforts focused on IT executives and administrators and sell to Chief Information Officers, Chief Information Security Officers, and line-of-business leaders. We also plan to increase our channel sales and marketing organization to deepen and expand our joint go-to-market efforts through partners, including resellers, managed service providers, global systems integrators, carriers, and the Apple 
consultant network, in order to reach new territories and further scale our business through their loyal customer network and expert service delivery. We believe the channel is an efficient way to sell to a wide variety of customers and reach new jurisdictions in a cost-effective manner while still focusing on customer satisfaction and retention.
•Increase sales to existing customers. We believe our base of more than 60,000 customers as of December 31, 2021 represents a significant opportunity for sales expansion. Our opportunities to deliver further value to existing customers include (1) growing the customers’ number of devices currently in use; (2) selling additional Jamf products; (3) expanding customers’ use of Jamf from one Apple product, like Mac, to additional Apple products used within the organization, like iPad, iPhone, and Apple TV; and (4) expanding the way customers use Apple products by showcasing capabilities available once customers fully embrace Jamf for deployment. Additionally, Apple continues to grow their ecosystem of solutions that can bring value to organizations, as they did with the introduction of tvOS management in 2017, making the Apple TV an attractive product to deliver new use cases in conference rooms, classrooms, hospitality environments, and for digital signage across a range of industries. The strength of Jamf’s “land and expand” strategy is evidenced by our dollar-based net retention rate, which has exceeded 116% as of the end of each of the twelve fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2021, calculated on a trailing twelve months basis.
•Expand global presence. We have a large international presence which we intend to continue growing. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 34% of our new subscriptions originated outside of North America, compared to 32% for the prior year. We intend to continue making investments in our international sales and marketing channels to take advantage of this market opportunity, while refining our go-to-market approach based on local market dynamics. Furthermore, we will invest in our products and technology to fulfill the unique needs of the market we target.
•Grow and nurture Jamf Nation. Jamf Nation is the world’s largest online community of IT and security professionals focused exclusively on Apple in the enterprise. It consists of a knowledgeable and active community of Apple-focused administrators and Jamf users who come together to gain insight, share best practices, vet ideas with fellow administrators, and submit product feature requests. We intend to continue investing in our community platform and these relationships to ensure that our Jamf Nation community remains a vibrant forum for discussion and problem-solving for our users. We believe this community will continue to be a focal point for the Apple ecosystem and can also be helpful in introducing Jamf to potential new customers.
•Cultivate relationships with developer partners. We believe one of the most powerful elements of our software platform is the ability to use published APIs to extend its value with other third-party or custom solutions. As of December 31, 2021, more than 250 integrations and value-added solutions were published on the Jamf Marketplace. These solutions extend the value of Jamf, protect customers’ existing IT investments and encourage greater use and expansion of Jamf within the enterprise.

Jamf Now is an intuitive, pay-as-you-go Apple device management software solution for small-to-medium-sized businesses (“SMBs”). Jamf Now prioritizes simplicity through a design that is targeted for organizations with limited or no IT resources, and it can be adopted by such organizations without engaging Jamf sales, training, or services personnel. Jamf Now allows customers to set up their own accounts to enroll their devices and immediately benefit regardless of any prior experience with Jamf. Jamf Now facilitates the consistent configuration of devices remotely, provides a 360-degree view of inventory, and remotely enforces passcodes, encryption, installed software, and locking or wiping of devices. Jamf also makes it easy to leverage its other solutions within Jamf Now with Jamf Now Plus. Jamf Now Plus is an enhanced tier of service that offers all the functionality of Jamf Now and support for custom applications, custom profiles, and macOS package deployment while still designed to be a streamlined, easy-to-use management tool. Jamf Now Plus also includes password sync preview functionality powered by Jamf Connect, which helps keep Mac passwords in sync with cloud credentials and enforces password policies from identity providers Microsoft Azure AD and Okta to maintain consistency and security across all users. We expect that soon Jamf Now Plus will include malware prevention preview functionality powered by Jamf Protect, which helps prevent malicious software and other threats from running on Mac devices in an environment. These capabilities better equip small and mid-sized businesses with key functionality to manage and secure their Apple devices.
Jamf School
Jamf School is a purpose-built software solution for educators and is supported by value-add workflow apps that empower teachers to create a focused, active, and personal learning environment. We have a long and successful presence in the education market, dating back to the early 2000s, and we introduced Jamf School in early 2019 following the acquisition of ZuluDesk B.V. (“ZuluDesk”). Launching Jamf School significantly increased our value in the classroom and allows us to further empower teachers, students, and even parents.
Teachers using Jamf School are able to quickly and easily control all devices in their classroom, which ultimately aids the focus of students. Teachers design lesson plans leveraging content from Apple’s App Store combined with their own teaching materials to meet their curriculum needs to then easily deploy these lessons to students. They can also restrict specific functions during assessments and control what content and resources students have access to on their iPads at a specific time. This functionality works seamlessly whether the teacher and student(s) are in the same physical classroom or if they are learning from home or in different locations.
With Jamf School, parents can use their personal iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, or Android device to govern the access children have when using their school-issued iPads at home. Parents can control and limit their children’s device usage, applications, and functionality when the student is not in the school. Jamf School transforms processes that once required IT involvement into dynamic interactions that put the power in the hands of the people who have the greatest impact on meeting each student’s learning needs.
Jamf School also engages and connects the student. Students can gain automatic access to subject-specific materials and applications, while unrelated or irrelevant content is hidden to avoid distraction. Through a self-service portal, students are also able to choose applications from an approved list of content, empowering them to have control over their learning. Teachers and parents can be confident students are focused and connected, which is specifically important in situations where students may bring their devices home or have prolonged control of their devices outside of the school district’s possession.
Jamf Data Policy
Jamf Data Policy, launched in 2021 following the acquisition of Wandera, is a solution to enforce acceptable usage policies to eliminate shadow IT and block risky content and manage data consumption with real-time analytics and granular reporting.
Jamf Data Policy features include:
•configuring caps for when data usage thresholds are reached and setting real-time alerts and notifications for users and admins;
•setting rules to ensure only acceptable websites can be reached and data usage is compliant;
•implementing and enforcing policies to manage data usage based on locations;
•compressing data in real time to tackle rising data consumption without cutting performance or productivity;
•setting policies that apply to different groups in different circumstances; and
•accommodating all mobile and Windows 10 devices, allowing users to work with their preferred model.
Jamf Connect
Jamf Connect allows IT Admins to provision devices with business-critical applications based solely on an employee’s cloud-identity. Users will enjoy a seamless experience when accessing their device and applications by using either biometric passwordless access or a single password that is synchronized down to the local-account level, even when the password is changed— keeping employees on task. Jamf Connect transforms how users connect to their corporate identity and therefore provides users with a seamless connection to corporate resources.
Jamf Connect gives IT administrators the ability to monitor all company Mac devices and control who is accessing them, providing comfort that both the device and corporate information are protected. Jamf Connect substantially improves the user experience by reducing IT help desk tickets for password resets. Additionally, IT administrators are able to service each device using their cloud identity without requiring a separate admin account on the device, which is a management headache, security vulnerability, and a user experience hazard.
Jamf Private Access
Jamf Private Access, launched in 2021 following the acquisition of Wandera, is a ZTNA solution that replaces legacy conditional access and VPN technology. More employees than ever before are working from different locations and on various devices. Organizations need to be able to ensure secure access to company resources as devices are rarely being connected from within a traditional network perimeter. Jamf Private Access ensures that, after a user authenticates into their device, business connections are transparently secured while enabling non-business applications to route directly to the internet, preserving end-user privacy, maintaining the end-user experience without slowing it down, and optimizing secure network infrastructure. This solution works across device ecosystems and signifies Jamf’s expansion into cross-platform capabilities. 
Jamf Protect
Jamf Protect provides protection of Mac-targeted malware and creates customized telemetry and detections that give enterprise security teams unprecedented visibility into their Macs, extending Apple’s security and privacy model to the enterprise while upholding the Apple user experience.
Based on historical needs, most endpoint security products have been designed for Windows and ported to Apple environments only when necessary. Jamf Protect was specifically designed to protect a customer’s fleet of Mac computers by leveraging in-depth knowledge of how adversaries attack Macs.
As market share for the Mac computer has grown in the enterprise, attackers have started focusing on and innovating malware for Macs. It is no longer sufficient to protect these devices with a solution designed for a different platform.
Capabilities of Jamf Protect include:
•mapping the security posture of a customer’s Mac fleet against the Center for Internet Security benchmarks;
•preventing execution and quarantining of known macOS malware and unwanted applications to keep end users safe;
•extending information security visibility into macOS built-in security tools for awareness and improved reporting, compliance, and security;
•receiving real-time alerts to analyze activity on the device and choose whether to proactively block, isolate, or remediate threats;
•providing granular control to information security teams over what data is collected and where it is sent, and allowing companies that monitor endpoint activity for compliance reasons to gather authentication and other activity tracked by macOS into their system of record; and
•supporting the latest operating system from the first day it’s available to ensure users receive the latest and most pressing security updates, while providing the user with a superior macOS experience.
Jamf Threat Defense
Jamf Threat Defense, launched in 2021 following the acquisition of Wandera, is a complete solution to protect workers from malicious attackers with minimal impact to the user experience by monitoring a device’s network activity. Jamf Threat Defense protects iOS, Android, and Windows endpoints from being compromised through mobile threat detection and zero-day phishing prevention with a streamlined app for notifications and remediation. Jamf Threat Defense operates across a diverse range of devices and ownership models, whether BYOD, corporate owned personally enabled (“COPE”), or corporate owned business only (“COBO”), empowering users with their preferred model in a way that protects the business.
Our Technology
Our software platform was purpose-built to help organizations succeed with Apple, ensuring the highest standards for security and performance while preserving the Apple user experience. Our platform is built on the following core tenets:
Optimized for cloud
We build products that provide Apple-focused device management, identity and access management, and endpoint protection solutions optimized for cloud environments. Our products are built on the market-leading cloud platform (Amazon Web Services (“AWS”)), but are architected for flexibility to utilize other cloud platforms. This foundation has enabled us to scale and support millions of devices since our SaaS offering launched in 2012.
Global availability
Our products are designed to deploy worldwide, using regional AWS servers to deliver the performance required by our customers. We are able to rapidly expand our global cloud footprint as demand for our products grows in new regions.
Scalable and reliable
Our products are designed to remove customers’ worry about availability, scalability, and maintenance of the infrastructure that powers their solution. Our customers are responsible for their fleet of devices, while Jamf handles all back-end management and scaling operations at the software layer and on a global basis for infrastructure management. Jamf employees are located worldwide to ensure we are available whenever and wherever our customers need us.
We are able to quickly provision new capacity and scale operations through automation on top of our cloud software platform. We continually demonstrate the success of our offering by supporting numerous Fortune 500 customers and large-scale education customers even at their most demanding peak periods.
Our SaaS offerings are designed for reliability with a highly available infrastructure design spanning numerous data centers for all regions in which we have operations. Jamf is built to be “always on” to all of our cloud customers. If infrastructure becomes unavailable for any reason, our offering reroutes traffic to a secondary location to ensure we deliver on our Service Level Agreements. This availability is monitored externally from an outside provider, and Jamf employees are proactively notified if availability is ever impacted.
Jamf empowers customers to seamlessly upgrade to our latest software. Our software platform streamlines automated backups, upgrades, and enables roll-back if required for any reason. Our extensive experience running distributed systems at scale helps our customers remain focused on meeting their organizational needs.
Enterprise-grade security
Security is a critical customer requirement and a guiding principle at Jamf. Our customers frequently use our products to manage integral platforms, which informs our approach to security and compliance. We integrate security principles into 
development processes, test product code and infrastructure for potential security issues, and deploy security technologies. We have access controls to data in our production environments that are strictly assigned, monitored, and audited. To ensure our processes remain innovative and secure, we undergo continuous third-party testing for vulnerabilities within our software architecture. We also engage with a third-party audit firm to audit our security program against well-known security standards like SOC2 Type II and ISO27001.
Differentiated technology
While there are many powerful capabilities of our technologies, the following are a few that set us apart from others in the market:
•Powerful architected-for-Apple agent. Jamf has been perfecting its Apple device agent for nineteen years. Using the Jamf agent, Apple IT administrators can access remote computers and file systems, collecting attributes and intelligence as if they were physically sitting with each and every Apple device in their fleet. The Jamf agent is written at the user-level and therefore does not require loading code into the operating system kernel, known as a kernel extension (“kext”). Most Windows-based cross-platform competitors employ kexts when they are ported to the Mac, which results in a slower, less secure and less stable solution. Jamf’s agent is able to quickly and safely consolidate and scale Apple inventory data beyond any cross-platform solution.
•Enterprise attributes and smart grouping. Not only does Jamf have more inventory information about devices than our competitors, but because of our extensible enterprise attributes, we can consolidate data based on device usage or user. Through our patented smart grouping technology, Jamf is then able to dynamically group devices, based on standard attributes, enterprise attributes or a combination thereof to target and execute business workflows at scale. These workflows can be extremely advanced when tapping into the Jamf policies engine, which includes full scripting capabilities for maximum flexibility.
•Industry workflows. Part of filling the gap between what Apple provides and what the enterprise requires is providing technology that extends far beyond basic management to meet the unique needs of specific industries. For example, Jamf’s patented mobile-to-mobile management technology provides teachers the control of student iPads in the classroom they need. Jamf’s patent-pending healthcare listener functionality empowers hospitals to launch device workflows based on events in the electronic medical record. Jamf also has developed a patented telehealth workflow, Virtual Visits, aimed to protect providers while still connecting patients to care and their communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. And Jamf’s patented setup and reset iOS applications create a shared device workflow that is required in these industries as well as retail, hospitality, field services and more.
•High performance native Apple APIs. Jamf creatively utilizes extensive APIs from published Apple technologies. Using native Apple APIs also allows us to be ready instantly with each new Apple operating system as Apple preserves forward-moving compatibility of their native APIs. We have a pending patent application for this innovative solution.
•Enterprise self-service. Jamf’s value is more than simply retaining the legendary Apple user experience as devices are deployed throughout the enterprise. We believe Jamf actually improves upon the Apple experience with a simple-to-use enterprise self-service solution. This application enables IT to empower end-users with a privately brandable application that allows users to install approved apps or perform complex tasks with a single mouse click from a personalized enterprise catalog. Jamf’s self-service app empowers users to setup resources, update configurations, apply policies and troubleshoot common issues with a single click. The self-service app taps into Jamf’s underlying technologies, allowing end-users to simply and quickly solve their own problems without submitting an IT ticket.
Sales and Marketing
Sales
We have a global, multi-faceted go-to-market approach that allows us to efficiently sell to and serve the needs of organizations of varying sizes. By offering a range of products and routes to the market, including through a direct sales force, online, and indirectly via our channel partners (including Apple), we can serve many types of organizations across the world.
Our direct sales force services larger organizations and those with more complex requirements. The direct sales organization is divided into inside and outside sales teams, organized by customer size, and is further segmented with teams focused on acquiring new logos or growing spend in our existing customer base. Our direct sales force is supported by sales development representatives that provide qualified leads as well as other technical resources.
To complement our direct sales teams, we have a large network of over 200 channel partners globally that resell our products located across the world.

Approximately 54% of our bookings were facilitated via our channel partners for the year ended December 31, 2021.
One of our notable channel partners is Apple, which, as a channel partner, facilitated approximately 6% of our bookings for the year ended December 31, 2021. Apple education became a Jamf channel partner in 2011 and resells Jamf to K-12 and higher education organizations within the United States. In 2012, Apple expanded its channel relationship by offering Jamf products to businesses through Apple retail, which includes their stores in the United States and sales teams that are focused on SMBs. In 2014, we became a member of Apple’s Mobility Partner Program that focuses on solution development and effective go-to-market activities. We work closely with these various Apple teams across both sales and marketing to develop close relationships and expand our customer base.
For smaller businesses or those with less complex requirements, we provide an online self-service e-commerce model that allows organizations to find products best suited for their needs. This provides an efficient way to introduce smaller organizations to Jamf, with an opportunity for the relationship to grow over time.
Our global, multi-faceted go-to-market approach, combined with the ability for customers to easily trial our products, has allowed us to build an efficient, high velocity sales model.
Marketing
A key ingredient to our sales effectiveness and efficiency is our marketing engine. Our global marketing team builds market awareness of Jamf, generates preference and demand for our products, and enables our sales teams and channel partners to efficiently develop business with new and existing customers.
We focus our marketing strategy on building recognition of the Jamf brand through thought leadership and differentiated messaging that emphasizes the business value of our products. Our efforts include content marketing, social media, search engine optimization, events, and public and analyst relations. We leverage this brand awareness to acquire new customers and cross-market our software solutions to our existing customer base through global campaigns that integrate digital, social, web, email, customer advocacy, and field marketing tactics, such as regional customer/prospect conferences. To create maximum impact, these campaigns are created and adapted to serve all geographic regions and routes to market. We then accelerate prospects or customers through the buying journey by enabling our sales team and channel partners with a range of product/solution content, internal tools, such as return on investment calculators, competitive intelligence, and case studies. Finally, we capitalize on the voices of our highly satisfied and loyal customers using a variety of customer advocacy tactics including case studies and videos, software reviews, social amplification, references, and referrals.
The Jamf brand further benefits from Jamf Nation, the world’s largest online community of Apple administrators. Jamf Nation is our active community, including Jamf customers and potential customers, who share ideas and solutions related to their Apple deployments. Jamf Nation’s large volume of user-generated content serves as a great source of organic search traffic, introducing prospective customers to the Jamf brand and Jamf products. Complementing Jamf Nation, we host JNUC, the world’s largest enterprise Apple IT and security administrator conference. With thousands of attendees, publicly streamed keynotes and over 140 customer and Jamf-led sessions, we further tap into the power of our passionate customer base and garner significant market attention as the leader in our space.

It is important to us that our customers have the resources they need to succeed with Apple, and customers are encouraged to connect and engage with the larger community of Apple administrators. This is best evidenced by Jamf Nation. Complementing our world-class technical support, this active, grassroots community serves as a highly-qualified and efficient crowd-sourced Q&A engine for anyone with questions about Apple and Jamf deployments. Jamf Nation members come together to gain insight, share best practices, vet ideas with fellow administrators, and submit product feature requests. We intend to continue investing in these relationships and ensure that our Jamf Nation community remains a vibrant forum for discussion and problem-solving for our customers.
Research and Development
Our research and development department is focused on enhancing our existing products and developing new products to maintain and extend our leadership position. Our department is built around small teams who practice agile development methodologies that enable us to innovate at a rapid pace and at scale on a global basis. The teams are organized to support our mission of helping organizations succeed with Apple and ensuring that we continue to deliver same-day support for Apple across our portfolio. In order to provide same day support for Apple, we deliberately schedule our annual efforts around Apple’s anticipated product release schedules and we reserve engineering capacity accordingly. This nimble approach enables us to successfully support the Apple enterprise by staying current on Apple releases and delivering differentiated solutions, many of which form the core of our intellectual property portfolio. Approximately 25% of our global employee base is dedicated to research and development. Our research and development teams are organized into teams that are focused by product and based principally in Minneapolis, MN, Eau Claire, WI, Katowice, Poland, and Brno, Czech Republic.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade dress, and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. These laws, procedures, and restrictions provide only limited protection. As of December 31, 2021, we owned nine issued U.S. patents and sixteen issued patents in foreign jurisdictions. Excluding any patent term adjustments or patent term extensions, our issued U.S. patents will expire between 2034 and 2040. We cannot be assured that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will require us to narrow the scope of the claims sought. Our issued patents, and any future patents issued to us, may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, may not provide sufficiently broad protection, and may not prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers.
We have registered “Jamf” and the “Jamf” logo as trademarks in the United States and other jurisdictions. We have also registered numerous Internet domain names related to our business.
We enter into agreements with our employees, contractors, customers, partners, and other parties with which we do business to limit access to and disclosure of our technology and other proprietary information. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will be sufficient or effective to prevent the unauthorized access, use, copying, or the reverse engineering of our technology and other proprietary information, including by third parties who may use our technology or other proprietary information to develop products and services that compete with ours. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies that are competitive with ours or that infringe on, misappropriate, or otherwise violate our intellectual property and proprietary rights, and policing the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and proprietary rights can be difficult. The enforcement of our intellectual property and proprietary rights also depends on any legal actions we may bring against any such parties being successful, but these actions are costly, time-consuming, and may not be successful, even when our rights have been infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated.
Furthermore, effective patent, copyright, trademark, trade dress, and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products are available, as the laws of some countries do not protect intellectual property and proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the United States. In addition, the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection of intellectual property and proprietary rights are uncertain and still evolving.
Companies in the software industry or non-practicing entities may own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and other intellectual property and proprietary rights, and these companies and entities have and may in the future request license agreements, threaten litigation, or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of their intellectual property and proprietary rights.
See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property and IT Systems” for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our intellectual property.
Competition
We generally compete with large cross-platform enterprise providers and early stage providers of Apple enterprise solutions. Large enterprise providers, such as VMware, Microsoft, and IBM, typically compete with us on one particular solution (e.g. device management, identity, or endpoint-security) intended for cross-platform use and not specialized for Apple. Given Jamf’s success, a number of companies are following our approach to deliver on an Apple ecosystem vision. While the latter category of competitors are Apple-focused, they lack the depth of our platform and none have grown to a meaningful scale to be considered material competitors.

Human Capital Resources
Jamf is a culmination of passionate, committed, and bright people who shape our culture and live our core values of Selflessness and Relentless Self-Improvement. We do not say we are the best, but we strive to be the best — for our customers, our employees, and our communities. Our leaders encourage autonomy, exploration, and innovation with spirit and enthusiasm. Through transparency, openness, and humility, we embrace the opportunity to challenge ourselves. We are a group of curious self-starters who thrive on taking initiative and are excited by global impact. We strive to provide an environment where our employees enjoy the freedom to be themselves and work how they work best. As of December 31, 2021, our voluntary retention rate for employees was 91%. Additionally, in our annual employee engagement survey conducted in September 2021, 88% of over 1,800 employees responding agreed that they would recommend Jamf as a great place to work. Furthermore, in December 2021, Jamf was certified by Great Place to Work®, a global leader in workplace culture, as a “Great Place to Work®,” with 90% of employees saying Jamf is a great place to work compared to 59% of employees at a typical U.S.-based company. In 2021, Jamf also ranked as a Fortune Best Workplaces for Women, Fortune Best Workplaces in Technology, Fortune Best Workplaces for Millennials, and Fortune Best Workplaces for Parents.
We believe that we can only be our best selves when given the freedom to be ourselves. To that end, we believe it is important to create a safe space where everyone is able to express their unique needs to propel Jamf to be a global leader of equality and fairness in the workplace. Our employee-led Inclusion & Diversity Global Steering Committee’s goal is to help others feel empowered for safe and authentic expression, to lead the projects, events and groups that they are passionate about, and take action on issues related to inclusion and diversity at Jamf. Our Employee Resource Groups, Womxn@Jamf, Accessibility@Jamf, The Shades of Jamf, and PROUD@Jamf, provide a safe space for empowerment and cultural education. As of December 31, 2021, based on employees who chose to identify their gender, approximately 31.1% of our workforce and 35.8% of new hires in 2021 were women. Women also made up approximately 34.5% of the Jamf management team as of December 31, 2021.
As of December 31, 2021, we had 2,212 employees, of which 1,407 were employed in the United States and 805 were employed outside of the United States. We have high employee engagement and consider our current relationship with our employees to be good. In certain countries in which we operate we are subject to, and comply with, local labor law requirements, which automatically make our employees subject to industry-wide collective bargaining agreements. An insubstantial number of our employees are currently subject to collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any work stoppages.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented a number of measures focused on promoting employee choice, health, and safety and ensuring business continuity. We carefully assess, and reassess, safe working conditions for our offices on a case-by-case basis to ensure that we implement appropriate protective measures, such as capacity restrictions based on local government and health organization guidance. We believe that we have the opportunity to be a leader in a new approach to work, which is rooted in a flexible and hybrid model enabled by a digital-first mindset that puts employee choice, health, and safety first.
Government Regulation
We are subject to many U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business, including laws and regulations that involve data privacy and data protection, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, health and safety, competition, consumer protection, taxation, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and corruption, 
economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions, and securities law compliance. Our business may also be affected by the adoption of any new or existing laws or regulations or changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect our business. Many relevant laws and regulations are still evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created or amended in a manner that could harm our business, and new laws and regulations may be enacted, including in connection with the restriction or prohibition of certain content or business activities.
We receive, process, store, use and share data, some of which contains personal information. We are therefore subject to U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding data privacy and the collection, storage, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other data from users, employees or business partners, including the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), the U.K. - General Data Protection Regulation” (“UK-GDPR”) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), among others. These laws expand the rights of individuals to control how their personal data is processed, collected, used and shared and create new regulatory and operational requirements for processing personal data, increase requirements for security and confidentiality and provide for significant penalties for non-compliance. The implementation of the expanded data protection regulation like the GDPR has led other jurisdictions to either amend, or propose legislation to amend their existing data privacy and cyber-security laws to resemble all or a portion of the requirements of such expanded regulation (e.g., for purposes of having an adequate level of data protection to facilitate data transfers from the EU) or enact new laws to do the same. Accordingly, the challenges we face in the with respect to the GDPR, UK-GDPR, and CCPA will likely also apply to other jurisdictions that adopt regulatory frameworks of equivalent complexity. Accordingly, there are also a number of legislative proposals recently enacted or pending before the U.S. Congress, various state legislatures and foreign governments concerning content regulation and data protection that could affect us. These and other laws and regulations that may be enacted, or new interpretation of existing laws and regulations, may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs in order to comply.
The foregoing description does not include an exhaustive list of the laws and regulations governing or impacting our business. See the discussion contained in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have a material adverse effect on our business.
