Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

The Company
 Flowers Foods, Inc. (which we reference to herein as “we,” “our,” “us,” the “company,” “Flowers” or “Flowers Foods”), founded in 1919 as a Georgia corporation and headquartered in Thomasville, Georgia, is currently the second-largest producer and marketer of packaged bakery foods in the United States (“U.S.”).  Our principal products include breads, buns, rolls, snack cakes, and tortillas and are sold under a variety of brand names, including Nature’s Own, Dave’s Killer Bread (“DKB”), Wonder, Canyon Bakehouse, Tastykake, and Mrs. Freshley’s.  Our brands are among the best known in the baking industry. Many of our brands have a major presence in the product categories in which they compete. 
 Flowers’ strategic priorities include developing our team, focusing on our brands, prioritizing our margins, and proactively seeking out smart, disciplined acquisitions and are described further in the following section.  We believe executing on our strategic priorities will drive future growth and margin expansion and deliver meaningful shareholder value over time.   
 COVID-19 
 We continue to monitor the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations, results of operations, and liquidity. Our operations may continue to experience disruption due to the continued uncertainty caused by the pandemic, including but not limited to additional variants of the COVID-19 virus, new geographic hotspots, changes in the number of COVID-19 cases, the rate of vaccination within the U.S. population and the efficacy of the vaccines, changes in the global and U.S. economic environment, and changes in pandemic safety policies.  
 In recognition and support of our frontline workers, we paid a total of $5.2 million and $12.3 million in appreciation bonuses to eligible hourly and non-exempt employees, leased labor, and contract workers in Fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively.  These appreciation bonuses are in addition to the company’s annual performance-based cash incentive plan, in which all Flowers employees participate.  
 Our Fiscal 2021 sales declined compared to Fiscal 2020 primarily due to the additional week in the prior year.  Fiscal 2020 benefitted from the significant rise in demand for our branded retail products at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as positive shifts in mix throughout the year and the additional week. Comparatively, Fiscal 2021 benefitted from favorable pricing, a continued positive shift in mix from store branded retail to branded retail products, and a partial recovery in non-retail sales. As steps to mitigate the pandemic have waned, including the easing of mandatory shutdowns and restaurant closures, our non-retail sales have been recovering.  Compared to our historical pre-pandemic sales, our Fiscal 2021 sales were elevated as we continued to benefit from the positive mix shift to branded retail products and favorable pricing, partially offset by volume declines.  The unpredictability of the pandemic makes forecasting this recovery in non-retail sales difficult, but such a recovery or a significant shift in mix from branded retail to store branded retail products could negatively impact our results of operations, including our net sales, earnings, and cash flows.  For additional discussion on the impact of the pandemic on our results of operations, refer to Part II, Item 7., Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this Form 10-K.
 We believe we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash needs and we continue to take steps to preserve adequate liquidity during the ongoing pandemic as further discussed in Part II, Item 7., Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this Form 10-K.  As discussed further in the “Transformation Strategy Initiatives” section below, we are continuing to move forward with the ERP system upgrade and our digital strategy initiatives and do not anticipate the pandemic to materially alter the timing of these initiatives. 
 Our main focus throughout the pandemic has been and continues to be the health and safety of our team members and independent distributor partners. From the start of the pandemic, we have followed the guidance of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), taking a number of recommended steps to safeguard those in our facilities. These steps included, but are not limited to, monitoring the symptoms of everyone entering our facilities, requiring face coverings, maintaining (where possible) social distancing of six feet, conducting enhanced cleaning and sanitizing of common areas and frequently touched surfaces, performing decontamination of work areas and equipment when there is a confirmed or presumptive case of COVID-19 at a facility, and contact tracing. Company-wide bans on non-essential travel and non-essential visitors at all locations were put into place, corporate offices were closed, and office staff were directed to work remotely. In addition, the company issued regular communications about COVID-19 prevention steps. When COVID-19 vaccinations became available, we shared educational information with our team members and encouraged vaccination for those eligible.

We have followed the guidance issued by the CDC and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and modified our face mask and wellness screening policies to align with local, state, and workplace safety regulations. We remain vigilant in reporting COVID-19 cases in our facilities and continue to evaluate our pandemic safety measures as the pandemic evolves. The majority of employees in non-production roles continue to work remotely.  We intend to implement a work policy in 2022 addressing guidelines for three distinct work personas: full-time remote, full-time in office, or flex, a combination of the two. These plans may be impacted by, among other things, consideration of pandemic safety measures, the rate of vaccinations and the efficacy of the vaccines, the threat of additional COVID-19 variants, and the ability of office staff to work effectively from remote locations. Although the impact of these measures, or any other measures adopted by governmental authorities, on our business and workforce is uncertain, these requirements may result in increased costs and could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
While we have had no temporary production interruptions in Fiscal 2021 due to COVID-19, such interruptions are possible in the future due to the uncertainty of the pandemic. The potential closure of several of our bakeries across the country at the same time – or in close succession – could negatively affect our ability to meet our production requirements, even if the interruption is temporary. Additionally, unforeseen disruptions in other areas of our operations, including but not limited to procurement of raw materials, transport of our products, or recovery by our foodservice customers, could negatively impact our operations, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity.
 During Fiscal 2021, we have experienced labor shortages at some of our bakeries. A number of factors may continue to adversely affect the labor force available to us, including high employment and government regulations. Other factors that may negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our production lines or run at full capacity might include, but are not limited to, a labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our workforce that could lead to increased labor costs, including additional overtime to meet demand and higher wage rates to attract and retain workers. An overall labor shortage, lack of skilled labor, increased turnover or labor inflation could have a material adverse impact on the company’s operations, results of operations, liquidity, or cash flows.
 Strategic Initiatives 
 We are a brand-focused company dedicated to the consumer and committed to growing our most profitable brands through innovation, market expansion, and prudent mergers and acquisitions (“M&A”).  Our strategic priorities and our long-term goals are as follows:
Strategic Priorities:
  
• | Develop team: Capabilities to build brands and create value.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | Focus on brands: Enhance relevancy and expand presence. Invest in our brands to align with consumers to maximize our return on investment.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Prioritize margins: Optimize the portfolio and supply chain.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | Smart M&A: Disciplined approach to acquisitions in the grain-based foods arena that enhance our branded portfolio and margin profile.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Long-term Goals:
  
• | Grow sales by 1% to 2% annually (excluding any future acquisitions).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Grow EBITDA by 4% to 6% annually (excluding any future acquisitions) (The company defines EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Grow earnings per share by 7% to 9% annually.
--+----------------------------------------------

 The key to our success in achieving our goals is our talented and dedicated team.  We recognize the importance of investing in our people as further discussed in the “Human Capital Resources” section below, which details how we attract, retain, and develop our team.  Additionally, we recognize the importance of realigning people and responsibilities in successfully implementing our long-term strategies.  This realignment can take the form of organizational changes or providing crucial tools, including investments in our information systems.  During Fiscal 2020, we implemented organizational changes to better align the team to our new strategies, hired new team members with unique expertise and insight, and created the transformation office.  The transformation office is a cross-functional team responsible for over-overseeing the implementation of our strategic priorities, including our digital and ERP initiatives, which are discussed in more detail under the “Transformation Strategy Initiatives” section below.

A major focus of our long-term strategy is to evolve our sales portfolio to higher margin, value-added branded retail products that we expect will generate top line growth and improve overall profitability. We expect an optimized portfolio will drive share gains by targeting growth segments with new, innovative products.  We have established clear roles for the brands and product lines within our portfolio to enable more targeted decision-making on brand investment.  Over the past several years, we have completed brand rationalization initiatives resulting in a more streamlined brand and product assortment, reduced brand portfolio complexity, and increased efficiency.  In Fiscal 2020, our sales mix shifted to more profitable branded retail products due to increases in at-home dining resulting from COVID-19, which led to increased sales and operating income, further illustrating the potential of an optimized portfolio.  In Fiscal 2021, we have continued to benefit from this positive shift in sales mix. 
 As we implement our targeted sales portfolio strategy, the flexibility of our production and distribution systems allows us to pivot capacity to meet this changing demand.  As an example, in Fiscal 2020, we repurposed bakery assets at our Lynchburg, Virginia facility, converting it to an all-organic bakery to meet rising demand for our DKB products and to better serve east coast markets with fresher product and reduce distribution costs.  Also, we believe our flexible bakery system has been crucial in navigating demand changes caused by the pandemic as we have been able to quickly shift production to high demand products and adjust distribution where needed. We are continuing to optimize our distribution system by reducing network complexity through depot consolidation and reducing transport miles. 
 M&A has always been, and we expect will continue to be, an important part of our long-term growth strategy.  We employ a disciplined approach to M&A, seeking out candidates primarily in the grain-based foods arena that will enhance our branded portfolio, extend our geographic presence, are a strong cultural fit, and add enhanced capabilities to our company.  We believe our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation will enable us to execute our M&A strategy.  
 Transformation Strategy Initiatives
 In the second half of Fiscal 2020, we launched initiatives to transform how we operate our business.  The primary goals of these new initiatives are: (1) enable a more agile business model, empowering the organization by fundamentally redesigning core business processes and our ways of working; (2) embed digital capabilities and transform the way we engage with our consumers, customers and employees; and (3) modernize and simplify our application and technology infrastructure landscape, inclusive of the upgrade of our ERP system.  We completed the initial planning and road mapping phase of these multi-year transformation initiatives at the end of Fiscal 2020 and transitioned into the design phase in early Fiscal 2021.  
Digital Strategy Initiatives
 Our digital strategy initiatives include investments in digital domains of e-commerce, autonomous planning, and bakery of the future.  In e-commerce, we strive to become a category and market share leader, engage with the consumer through digital platforms and marketplaces, and support our retail partners’ omnichannel strategies.  The autonomous planning domain encompasses predictive ordering, cost-to-serve modeling, integrated business planning, and supply and demand forecasting, among other areas.  Bakery of the future involves transforming our current manufacturing processes and operational visibility to apply industry-leading digital manufacturing tools, such as real-time performance management and visibility, automation of repetitive processes, standardization of processes and procedures, and sensor-based quality monitoring tools to improve consistency and quality.  
 Combined, these digital domains are expected to improve data visibility and efficiencies while automating many of our processes.  When fully implemented, we expect this work will further our brand efforts, bring us ever closer to the consumer, increase operational efficiencies, and deliver higher-quality, real-time insights, which will in turn enable more predictive business decision-making. We transitioned into the implementation phase for the e-commerce, autonomous planning, and bakery of the future domains and selected two bakeries for the pilot program for bakery of the future and autonomous planning in Fiscal 2021.  
 ERP Upgrade
 This initiative includes upgrading our information system to a more robust platform and is expected to improve data management and efficiencies while automating many of our processes.  During the first quarter of Fiscal 2021, we engaged a leading, global consulting firm to assist us in planning and implementing the upgrade of our ERP platform and serve as the system integrator for the project.  We transitioned into the build phase of the project in the beginning of Fiscal 2022.
 We expect this initiative will require significant capital investment and expense over the next several years.  See Item 1A., Risk Factors, “We may experience difficulties in designing and implementing the upgrade of our ERP system.”

Segment
 Since the beginning of Fiscal 2019, we have managed our business as one operating segment.  The company concluded it has one operating segment based on the nature of the products the company sells, its intertwined production and distribution model, the internal management structure and information that is regularly reviewed by the chief executive officer (“CEO”), who is the chief operating decision maker, for the purpose of assessing performance and allocating resources.  Beginning with the first quarter of Fiscal 2019, the comparative periods have been presented on a consolidated basis due to the change to a single operating segment.  See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for detailed financial information about our operating segment. 
 Brands & Products
 We report our sales as branded retail, store branded retail, or non-retail and other.  The non-retail and other category includes foodservice, restaurant, institutional, vending, thrift stores, and contract manufacturing.  The chart below presents our Fiscal 2021 sales by sales category (source:  internal sales data warehouse (“SDW”); amounts may not compute due to rounding). 
 


Our brands are some of the best-known in the U.S. fresh packaged bread industry and many of them hold leading market positions in the categories in which they compete.  We believe having a well-diversified portfolio of brands allows us to be more competitive in the marketplace and appeal to a broader range of consumers. Our principal products are breads, buns, rolls, snack cakes, and tortillas.  The table below presents the major brands within our diversified brand portfolio:
 
 
Strategic Positioning | Key Brands 
----------------------+--------------------------------
Mainstream | Nature's Own, Wonder, Tastykake
Organic | Dave's Killer Bread 
Gluten Free | Canyon Bakehouse 

Brand Highlights
  
• | Nature’s Own is the best-selling loaf bread in the U.S. Nature’s Own’s sales, at retail, were $1.3 billion for Fiscal 2021.

Our brands and products are sold through various channels throughout the U.S.  The table below presents our sales by channel for Fiscal 2021 (source:  internal SDW; amounts may not compute due to rounding). 
 

* All Other includes thrift store, vending, and retail distributor sales.
 Marketing
 We support our key brands with an advertising and marketing effort that targets consumers through electronic and in-store coupons, social media (such as Facebook and Twitter), digital media (including e-newsletters to consumers), websites (our brand sites and third-party sites), event and sports marketing, on-package promotional offers and sweepstakes, and print advertising. When appropriate, we may join other sponsors with promotional tie-ins. We often focus our marketing efforts on specific products and holidays, such as hamburger and hot dog bun sales during Memorial Day, the Fourth of July, and Labor Day, and snack cakes for specific seasons.  Additionally, we have made and are continuing to make marketing investments to target e-commerce sales as consumers shift to more online shopping alternatives, such as grocery delivery sites, retailer websites and apps, among others.  
Customers
 Our top 10 customers in Fiscal 2021 accounted for 53.7% of sales. During Fiscal 2021, our largest customer, Walmart/Sam’s Club, represented 21.2% of the company’s sales. The loss of, or a material negative change in our relationship with, Walmart/Sam’s Club or any other major customer could have a material adverse effect on our business. Walmart/Sam’s Club was the only customer to account for 10% or more of our sales during Fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019.  
 Fresh baked foods’ customers include mass merchandisers, supermarkets and other retailers, restaurants, quick-serve chains, food wholesalers, institutions, dollar stores, and vending companies. We also sell returned and surplus product through a system of thrift stores. The company currently operates 243 such stores and reported sales of $60.3 million during Fiscal 2021 from these outlets. 
 We also (1) supply national and regional restaurants, institutions and foodservice distributors, and retail in-store bakeries with breads and rolls; (2) sell packaged bakery products to wholesale distributors for ultimate sale to a wide variety of food outlets; and (3) sell packaged snack cakes primarily to customers who distribute them nationwide through multiple channels of distribution, including mass merchandisers, supermarkets, vending outlets and convenience stores. In certain circumstances, we enter into co-packing arrangements with retail customers or other food companies, some of which are competitors.  Although we service public health care, military commissaries, and prisons, among other governmental institutions, we do not have any material government contracts.

Distribution
 We distribute our products through a direct-store-delivery (“DSD”) distribution system and a warehouse delivery system.  The DSD distribution system involves aggregating order levels and delivering products from bakeries to independent distributors for sale and direct delivery to customer stores. The independent distributors are responsible for ordering products, stocking shelves, maintaining special displays, and developing and maintaining good customer relations to ensure adequate inventory and removing unsold goods.  The warehouse delivery system involves primarily delivering our products to customers’ warehouses.
 The company has sold the majority of the distribution rights for territories to independent distributors under long-term financing arrangements. Independent distributors, highly motivated by financial incentives from their distribution rights ownership, strive to increase sales by offering outstanding service and merchandising. Independent distributors have the opportunity to benefit directly from the enhanced value of their distribution rights resulting from higher branded sales volume.
 Our DSD distribution system is comprised of three types of territories: (1) independent distributor-owned and operated territories (independent distributors own the rights to distribute certain brands of our fresh packaged bakery foods in defined geographic markets); (2) distribution rights that are classified as available for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets; and (3) other company operated territories.  The table below presents the approximate number of territories used by the company as of January 1, 2022:
 
 
Type of territory | Number of territories | 
-------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------+------
Independent distributor-owned and operated territories | | 5,340
Territories classified as available for sale | | 432 
Other company operated territories | | 80 
Total territories | | 5,852

 

Our warehouse distribution system delivers a portion of our packaged bakery snack products from a central distribution facility located near our Crossville, Tennessee snack cake bakery. We believe this centralized distribution system allows us to achieve both production and distribution efficiencies. Products coming from different bakeries are then cross-docked and shipped directly to customers’ warehouses nationwide. Our frozen bread and roll products are shipped to various outside freezer facilities for distribution to our customers.
 Intellectual Property
 We own a number of trademarks, trade names, patents, and licenses. The company also sells products under franchised and licensed trademarks and trade names which we do not own pursuant to contractual arrangements.  We consider all of our trademarks and trade names important to our business since we use them to build strong brand awareness and consumer loyalty.
Raw Materials
 Our primary baking ingredients are flour, sweeteners, shortening, yeast and water. We also purchase organic and gluten-free ingredients.  We also use paper products, such as corrugated containers, folding cartons, films and plastics to package our bakery foods. We strive to maintain diversified sources for all of our baking ingredients and packaging products.  In addition, we are dependent on natural gas or propane as fuel for firing our ovens. 
 Commodities, such as our baking ingredients, periodically experience price fluctuations. The cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation, weather conditions, domestic and international supply and demand, global logistics dynamics, or other unforeseen circumstances. We enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments in an effort to manage the impact of such volatility in raw material prices, but some organic and specialty ingredients do not offer the same hedging opportunities to reduce the impact of price volatility.  Any decrease in the supply available under these agreements and instruments could increase the effective price of these raw materials to us and significantly impact our earnings. 
 Regulations 
 As a producer and marketer of food items, our operations are subject to regulation by various federal governmental agencies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the U.S. Department of Labor (the “DOL”).  We also are subject to the regulations of various state agencies, with respect to production processes, product quality, packaging, labeling, storage, distribution, labor, and local regulations regarding the licensing of bakeries and the enforcement of state standards and facility 
 9


inspections.  Under various statutes and regulations, these federal and state agencies prescribe requirements and establish standards for quality, purity, and labeling.  Failure to comply with one or more regulatory requirements could result in a variety of sanctions, including monetary fines or compulsory withdrawal of products from store shelves.  
 Advertising of our brands is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission, and we are subject to certain health and safety regulations, including those issued under the Occupational Safety and Health Act.
 The cost of compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on the company’s business.  We believe we are currently in substantial compliance with all material federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting the company and its properties.  
 Our operations, like those of similar businesses, are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations with respect to environmental matters, including air and water quality and underground fuel storage tanks, as well as other regulations intended to protect public health and the environment.  The company is not a party to any material proceedings arising under these laws and regulations.  We believe compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations will not materially affect the Consolidated Financial Statements or the competitive position of the company.  The company is currently in substantial compliance with all material environmental laws and regulations affecting the company and its properties.
 Competitive Overview
 The U.S. market for fresh and frozen bakery products is estimated at $43.2 billion at retail. This category is intensely competitive and has continued to experience consolidation. Flowers Foods is currently the second-largest company in the U.S. fresh baking industry based on market share as presented in the following chart (amounts may not compute due to rounding). (Source:  IRI Flowers custom database, 52 weeks ending 12-26-21; Flowers private label sales from SDW): 
 

The current competitive landscape for breads and rolls in the U.S. baking industry consists of Bimbo Bakeries USA (BBU), Flowers Foods, and Campbell Soup Company, under the Pepperidge Farm brand, along with a number of smaller independent regional bakers, local bakeries, and retailer-owned bakeries. 
 Some of these smaller regional bakers do not enjoy the competitive advantages of larger operations, including greater brand awareness and economies of scale in purchasing, distribution, production, IT, advertising and marketing. However, size alone is not sufficient to ensure success in our industry. The company faces significant competition from regional and independent bakeries in certain geographic areas.
 Competition in the baking industry continues to be driven by a number of factors, including the ability to serve retail and foodservice customers, generational changes in family-owned businesses, and competitors’ promotional efforts on branded bread and 
 10


store brands. Competition typically is based on the ability to target changing consumer preferences, product availability (including through e-commerce channels), product quality, brand loyalty, price, and effective promotions. Customer service, including frequent deliveries to keep store shelves well-stocked, is also a competitive factor.
 The company also faces competition from store brands that are produced either by us or our competitors. Store brands (also known as “private label”) have been offered by food retailers for decades. With the growth of mass merchandisers like Walmart and the ongoing consolidation of regional supermarkets into larger operations, store brands have become a significant competitor to the company in those areas where the company does not have the contract to produce the store brand. The store brand share of retail fresh packaged bread in the U.S. accounts for approximately 19% of the dollar sales and approximately 30% of unit sales, though its share has steadily declined over the past seven years, in particular, the last two years.  
 Human Capital Resources
 As of January 1, 2022 Flowers and its subsidiaries had approximately 8,900 employees located throughout the U.S. and approximately 4,300 long-term leased employees. Approximately 970 employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and there are no material outstanding labor disputes. 
 Our legacy of excellence is built on 100+ years of hard work by thousands of Flowers team members. As W.H. Flowers, Jr. said, “The key to any enterprise or goal is people. People of character, people of integrity, people who don’t mind working and taking advantage of their opportunity.” We continue to strive toward a people-centric legacy by implementing initiatives that enhance the lives of each and every employee—current and prospective. 
 Flowers aims to attract a qualified workforce through an inclusive and accessible recruiting process that utilizes online recruiting platforms, campus outreach, apprenticeships, internships, and job fairs. In 2022, we plan to advance our partnership with the Thurgood Marshall College Fund by leveraging its Talent Sourcing program in our recruiting efforts. 
 Flowers is also a proud second chance employer, furthering the commitment started by its DKB brand. Established in 2015, the Dave’s Killer Bread Foundation helps businesses create meaningful and sustainable employment opportunities for individuals impacted by the criminal justice system. At Flowers, we have implemented recruitment initiatives at our bakeries to attract and retain ex-offenders. 
 In addition, Flowers is a long-time supporter of causes that support U.S. veterans and their families. Presently, Flowers employs more than 550 veterans.
 For current Flowers team members, the company offers competitive wages, benefits, and training opportunities, while also promoting a safe and healthy workplace. The company provides its employees with resources to enhance their skills and careers, including:
  
• | Elevating the long-term impact of learning and development in the Flowers organization by investing in a new Learning Management System in Fiscal 2022.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Providing a range of formal and informal learning programs, which are designed to help employees continuously grow throughout their careers. Programs include Skillsoft online learning and a Mentor Up Mentoring Program which are both available at our bakeries.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Offering a variety of programs that contribute to our leadership, training and development goals, including internal programs such as the “Flowers Front-Line Leadership Program,” “Lead Now” for leaders at all levels, and “Leading The Flowers Way” for our high potential leaders.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Encouraging employees to discuss their professional development during annual performance reviews with their supervisors.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Offering Career Conversations training for supervisory employees to discuss career pathing and employee development.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To foster a greater culture of inclusion, in Fiscal 2021, the entire Flowers senior leadership team participated in unconscious bias training. In Fiscal 2022, Flowers intends to continue its development of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I) training for its workforce. The company’s board of directors (the “Board” or “Board of Directors”) receives regular updates from management on our inclusion and diversity efforts.  We are currently developing a standard set of metrics to be included in these updates to the Board to evaluate our progress on these efforts. These metrics could include statistics pertaining to retention, attrition, and promotion and statistics on DEI trainings administered, among others. 
 11


Additionally, we regularly conduct anonymous surveys to capture feedback from our team members on a variety of topics, including, but not limited to, confidence in company leadership, competitiveness of our compensation and benefits package, career growth opportunities and how we can make our company an employer of choice. The results are shared with our team members and reviewed by senior leadership, who seek to analyze areas of opportunity and prioritize actions and activities in response to the feedback to drive meaningful change in our overall employee experience. As an example, our leadership team approved the implementation of a self-managed time-off policy for those at the director and above level as a result of survey feedback.
 Total Rewards
 We have a demonstrated history of investing in our workforce by providing competitive wages and benefits. Our benefits package includes:
  
• | comprehensive health insurance coverage to employees working 30 hours or more each week;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | parental leave to all new parents for birth, adoption or foster placement;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | short-term disability to provide wage protection for up to six months;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a tuition reimbursement program; and
--+-------------------------------------


• | a 401(k) plan with generous company match.
--+-------------------------------------------

 We believe that because employees drive our success, they should share in that success. In addition to competitive wages and benefits, when annual company goals are met, eligible team members at all levels are rewarded with a bonus. Furthermore, in recognition and support of our frontline workers, we paid a total of $5.2 million and $12.3 million in appreciation bonuses to eligible hourly and non-exempt employees, leased labor, and contract workers in Fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. These appreciation bonuses are in addition to the company’s annual performance-based cash incentive plan, in which all Flowers employees participate.
 Environmental, Social and Governance Objectives
 We are developing a process to integrate environmental, social and governance objectives into our decision-making to deliver long-term value. In doing so, we intend to consider guidance by our stakeholders and third-party frameworks, including the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). To learn more about our sustainability goals, programs, and initiatives, you can access the social responsibility section of our website at https://www.flowersfoods.com/company/social-responsibility, which includes a link to our latest Sustainability Report.  
 Sustainability is core to our strategy and how we connect with consumers and grow our company. Our leading brands and delicious bakery foods are made with a commitment to operating efficiently, reducing waste, and sourcing ingredients responsibly. 
 As part of that strategy, we recognize our responsibility to uphold the company’s founding values, which for more than 100 years, have centered on working ethically, responsibly, and with integrity. We also look for ways to make a positive difference at work and in our communities. By collaborating with stakeholders, including team members, business partners, suppliers, and customers, we are working to become a more sustainable company.
