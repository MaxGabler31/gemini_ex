ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
----------------------------------+----------

Our Company
 
Our company, founded in 1980, has recently transitioned from its former business as a skin health company to a company focused on real estate development and asset management, concentrating primarily on investments in, and the management and development of income producing real estate assets.
 
Until the sale of our consumer products division, we were a global skin health company providing integrated disease management and aesthetic solutions to dermatologists, professional aestheticians, and consumers. Starting in 2014, we began to sell off certain business units and product lines and on January 23, 2017, we sold our last remaining major product line. Following this transaction, we had only minimal operations and assets remaining, of immaterial value to our company. We completed the process of liquidating the remaining legacy inventory and assets of the last minor business line during 2018, and we no longer operate within the skin health business.
 
Our focus is now to build our company into a leading real estate, asset management and development company concentrating primarily on investments in high yield income producing assets and other opportunistic commercial properties via direct property ownership and/or asset management. Our objective is to generate long term net asset value growth while adhering to institutional best practices and a deep research process for all investments.
 
For income producing properties, we intend to acquire assets that provide recurring income with the potential for income growth over the long-term. We believe there can be an attractive risk/reward profile to such properties based on the location and the underlying creditworthiness of the tenants. We intend to use such income generation to fund additional acquisitions and development opportunities and for general corporate purposes. In addition, we intend to invest in land assets that can be developed into income generating properties or properties for sale. We believe that our size and scale provide an opportunity to take advantage of smaller-tier assets that most traditional investors do not focus on due to size limitations, thus creating unique investment opportunities. In particular, we intend to target assets in secondary and tertiary markets that require minimal capital expenditures but generate initial unlevered cash flow yields that are higher than those in primary markets.
 
A second component of our investment strategy will revolve around sourcing asset management opportunities for which we would operate as an asset manager of real estate properties. We are not structured as a Real Estate Investment Trust, or REIT, thus we have the ability to retain earnings and to operate in real estate asset management, development, and peripheral real estate activities, items that may be limited by REIT requirements. We will look to utilize our existing infrastructure to provide economies of scale to owners of real estate assets as we grow our portfolio over time.
 
Gadsden Transaction
 
On March 13, 2019, we entered into a stock purchase agreement, or the Gadsden Purchase Agreement with Gadsden Growth Properties, Inc., a Maryland corporation or Gadsden, pursuant to which, we will issue to Gadsden: (i) 708,485,395 shares of our common stock; (ii) a number of shares of our newly designated 7% Series A Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock that is equal to the number of shares of Gadsden’s 7% Series A Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock that are outstanding at the closing date, which is expected to be 889,075 shares; (iii) a number of shares of our newly designated Series B Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock that is equal to the number of shares of Gadsden’s Series B Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock that are outstanding at the closing date, which is expected to be 11,788,994 shares; and (iv) a number of shares of our 10% Series C Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock that is equal to the number of shares of Gadsden’s 10% Series C Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock that are outstanding on the closing date, which is expected to be 2,498,682 shares (which we collectively refer to as Our Securities). In consideration for Our Securities, Gadsden will transfer and assign to us: (i) all of the Class A limited partnership interests in Gadsden Growth Properties, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, or OPCO, and (ii) all of the general partnership interests in OPCO. OPCO is the operating partnership of Gadsden that has all of its assets and liabilities. Accordingly, at the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Gadsden Purchase Agreement (which we refer to as the Gadsden Transaction), Gadsden will remain a private company with its only asset being Our Securities issued to it and we will acquire OPCO, including the Gadsden portfolio of real estate investments. Closing of the Gadsden Transaction is expected to occur within one week of the date hereof.

The Gadsden Purchase Agreement provides that 278,178,750 shares, or the Holdback Shares of our common stock that will be issued to Gadsden will be subject to forfeiture based on the reconciliation and adjustment of the net asset value of Gadsden’s assets and Gadsden’s proposed real estate investments that have not closed as of the closing date of the Gadsden Purchase Agreement (such investments referred to as the Scheduled Investments).
 
The number of Our Securities being issued to Gadsden at the closing is based upon an estimated net asset value of Gadsden of $211,573,000, or the Contract NAV. The Contract NAV includes Gadsden’s assets and all of its Scheduled Investments. The Gadsden Purchase Agreement provides for a reconciliation and adjustment of the final net asset value of Gadsden as follows:
 

● | If the Contract NAV is more than the Gadsden final net asset value, then the difference (referred to as the Shortfall) will be settled by the transfer of shares of our common stock, at a value equal to 3.771023733 shares of our common stock for each $1.00 of Shortfall if the Gadsden final net asset value is $80 million or more (and 2.860407207 for each $1.00 of Shortfall to the extent that the Gadsden final net asset value is less $80 million);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | First, the Shortfall will be paid by transfer of Holdback Shares by Gadsden to us and such transferred shares will be cancelled. If the amount of the Shortfall is more than the value of the Holdback Shares, then we will issue more shares of our common stock to our stockholders of record as of the closing date. 
● | Gadsden’s final net asset value will be determined as the fair value of the each of the assets of Gadsden on the closing date and the Scheduled Investments acquired on or prior to May 20, 2019. Such fair value will be determined in accordance with the following: 


● | In accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, and shall be derived from our annual report on Form 10-K for either of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 or December 31, 2020 with Gadsden having the option to choose which such fiscal year to utilize, 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | As of the date of an appraisal from a licensed appraiser with knowledge of the applicable market that need not be a national firm, or 
● | If the Gadsden asset is sold or otherwise disposed of in consideration for cash, the gross cash proceeds from the sale minus any indebtedness or other liabilities relating to the Gadsden asset being sold or otherwise disposed of that were not assumed by the purchaser and that remain indebtedness or other liabilities of us following the sale or other disposition. 

 
The Gadsden Purchase Agreement also contains a mechanism for issuing additional shares of our common stock to Gadsden or our legacy stockholders, as applicable, if there is a loss determination. The Stock Purchase Agreement defines a loss determination as an event that gives rise to a loss due to a breach of a representation and warranty by a party or the failure of a covenant to be performed by a party that was not fully performed, in each case, after consideration of any express waiver or amendment. After the amount of a loss has been determined in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Gadsden Purchase Agreement, the amount of the loss will be paid by us as follows: (i) if our Board determines that the amount of the loss will be paid in cash, then such amount will be paid by check payable to the order of Gadsden or our legacy stockholders; or (ii) if our Board does not determine that the amount of the loss will be paid in cash, then such amount will be paid by us issuing and delivering shares of common stock with an aggregate fair value equal to the amount of the loss to Gadsden or our legacy stockholders. The Gadsden Purchase Agreement provides that no loss will be determined until the aggregate amount of losses claimed exceeds $100,000, it being acknowledged that from and after such threshold, all losses shall be subject to adjustment as set forth above.
 
The Gadsden Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of us and Gadsden, which survive the closing for a period expiring March 31, 2020, except for the representations and warrants contained in Sections 3.1(d)(i) (Authority), 3.1(k) (Taxes), 3.2(d)(i) (Authority) and 3.2(l) (Taxes), which shall survive for the applicable statute of limitations regarding such subject matters.
 
Additionally, the Gadsden Purchase Agreement provides for customary pre-closing covenants of the parties, including a covenant to conduct their respective businesses in the usual, regular and ordinary course substantially consistent with past practice and to refrain from taking certain actions without the other parties’ consent. The parties have also agreed not to solicit proposals relating to specified “Competing Transactions” (as defined in the Gadsden Purchase Agreement) or, subject to certain exceptions relating to the receipt of unsolicited offers that may be deemed to be “Superior Competing Transaction” (as defined in the Gadsden Purchase Agreement), enter into discussions concerning or provide information in connection with Competing Transactions.

We also agreed to take such actions as is necessary, which may include accepting the resignations of directors or removing directors without cause and filling the vacancies on our Board of Directors so that as of the closing, our Board of Directors shall consist of (i) the current members of the Board of Directors of Gadsden who are John Hartman, Larry E. Finger, Jay M. Gratz, B.J. Parrish, Russell C. Platt, James Walesa, and Robert G. Watson, Jr.; and (ii) our existing directors Dennis M. McGrath and Dolev Rafaeli. At the closing of the Gadsden Transaction, our executive officers are expected to be the executive officers of Gadsden. In addition, Gadsden agreed to take such actions as is necessary, which may include accepting the resignations of directors or removing directors without cause and filling the vacancies on the Board of Directors of Gadsden so that as of the closing, the Board of Directors of Gadsden shall consist of the same members as our Board of Directors described above.
 
Consummation of the Gadsden Transaction is subject to various conditions, including, among others, customary conditions relating to: (i) approval of the Gadsden Transaction by the vote of Gadsden’s stockholders holding two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Gadsden’s common stock, Gadsden’s 7% Series A Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock entitled to vote thereon (on an as-converted basis) and Gadsden’s 10% Series C Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock entitled to vote thereon (on an as-converted basis); (ii) absence of injunction by any court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction and absence of law that prevents, enjoins, prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the Gadsden Transaction; (iii) receipt of all consents, approvals and authorizations legally required to be obtained to consummate the Gadsden Transaction; and (iv) receipt of customary legal opinions from counsel to us and Gadsden. The obligation of each party to consummate the Gadsden Transaction is also conditioned upon the other party’s representations and warranties being true and correct (subject to certain materiality exceptions), the other party having performed in all material respects its obligations under the Gadsden Purchase Agreement, and the absence of a material adverse effect on each party.
 
In addition, the obligation of Gadsden to complete the Gadsden Transaction is subject to the satisfaction (or waiver, to the extent permitted by applicable law) of the following conditions: we shall have, on a consolidated basis, not less than $800,000 of unrestricted cash; and we shall have received a letter of resignation from each member of our Board of Directors, other than the directors who are to be members of the Board after the Gadsden Transaction.
 
The Gadsden Purchase Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the closing, in any of the following ways: (i) by mutual written consent of us and Gadsden; (ii) by either Gadsden or us if the Gadsden Transaction shall not have occurred on or prior to March 31, 2019; provided, that a party that has materially failed to comply with any obligation of such party set forth the Gadsden Purchase Agreement shall not be entitled to exercise its right to terminate; (iii) by Gadsden upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of us as set forth in the Gadsden Purchase Agreement, or if there shall have been a material adverse effect; (iv) by us upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Gadsden as set forth in the Gadsden Purchase Agreement, or if there shall have been a material adverse effect; (v) by either Gadsden or us if any order by any governmental entity of competent authority preventing the consummation of the Gadsden Transaction shall have become final and nonappealable; (vi) by either Gadsden or us if Gadsden stockholder approval shall not have been obtained; (vii) by either Gadsden or us prior to obtaining Gadsden stockholder approval if Gadsden or us has delivered a notice of a Superior Competing Transaction (provided that for the termination to be effective, such party shall have paid the applicable termination fee); (viii) by Gadsden if our Board of Directors shall have withdrawn, qualified or modified in a manner adverse to Gadsden, or shall recommend that the ours stockholders approve or accept a Competing Transaction, or if we shall have delivered a notice of a Superior Competing Transaction or shall have publicly announced a decision to take any such action; or (ix) by us if Gadsden’s board of directors shall have withdrawn, qualified or modified in a manner adverse to us, or shall have failed to make when required, its recommendation to approve the Gadsden Purchase Agreement, or shall recommend that Gadsden’s stockholders approve or accept a Competing Transaction, or if Gadsden shall have delivered a notice of a Superior Competing Transaction or shall have publicly announced a decision to take any such action.
 
Gadsden is required to pay a termination fee of $200,000 if the Gadsden Purchase Agreement is terminated: (i) by Gadsden at any time prior to the receipt of Gadsden stockholder approval upon delivery of a notice of a Superior Competing Transaction; (ii) by us upon any of the events described in subsection (ix) of the preceding paragraph; or (iii) by us if Gadsden stockholder approval shall not have been obtained and (A) prior to such termination, a person has made any bona fide written proposal relating to a Competing Transaction which has been publicly announced prior to the Gadsden’s stockholder meeting and (B) within twelve months of any such termination, Gadsden or any subsidiary of Gadsden shall consummate a Competing Transaction, or enter into a written agreement with respect to a Competing Transaction that is ultimately consummated with any person.

We are required to pay a termination fee of $250,000 if the Gadsden Purchase Agreement is terminated: (i) by us upon delivery of a notice of a Superior Competing Transaction; (ii) by Gadsden upon any of the events described in subsection (viii) of the paragraph above regarding termination; (iii) by Gadsden, upon a breach of certain representations, warranties, covenants or agreements on our part set forth in Gadsden Purchase Agreement; or (iv) or by Gadsden if Gadsden stockholder approval shall not have been obtained and (A) prior to such termination, a person has made any bona fide written proposal relating to a Competing Transaction which has been publicly announced prior to the termination of the Gadsden Purchase Agreement and (B) within twelve months of any such termination, we or any subsidiary of us shall consummate a Competing Transaction, or enter into a written agreement with respect to a Competing Transaction that is ultimately consummated with any person.
 
If the Gadsden Purchase Agreement is validly terminated, the Gadsden Purchase Agreement will terminate (except for the provisions described Section 5.2 (Access to Information; Confidentiality and Confidentiality Agreement), Section 7.1 (Termination), Section 7.2 (Break-Up Fees and Expenses), Section 7.3 (Effect of Termination) and Article VIII (Survival of Representations and Warranties, Indemnification) of the Gadsden Purchase Agreement, which provisions shall survive such termination), and there will be no other liability on the part of either party to the other except for the termination fees and expenses described above; provided, that no party will be relieved from liability for fraud or a willful breach, or our failure to issue and deliver Our Securities upon satisfaction of the conditions to closing set forth in the Gadsden Purchase Agreement, in which case the aggrieved party will be entitled to all rights and remedies available at law or in equity.
 
We will have available approximately $800,000 of cash available at the closing of the Gadsden Transaction. This amount is expected to be used to pay compensation to our directors of $250,000; compensation to our Chief Executive Officer of $100,000; purchase of 15,200 shares of Gadsden’s 7% Series A Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock from an affiliate of a Gadsden board member for an aggregate purchase price of $380,000; and $70,000 for audit, accounting and other professional fees and working capital. Accordingly, we will continue to require to raise additional capital to fund its operations and pay our operating expenses. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms and conditions, if at all.
 
We had previously entered into an agreement and plan of merger, or the Merger Agreement, with FC Merger Sub, Inc., a Maryland corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiary, or FC Merger Sub, Gadsden and OPCO on November 8, 2018, which as amended on December 27, 2018, January 14, 2019 and January 25, 2019, pursuant to which FC Merger Sub would have merged with and into Gadsden, with Gadsden surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of our company. In connection with the proposed merger, on November 9, 21018, we filed a registration statement on Form S-4 (No. 333-228304). The staff of the SEC was furloughed due to the U.S. Federal Government’s recent shutdown which resulted, among other things, that the review and expected timing for the registration statement was delayed to the extent that the merger would have required additional amendments to the registration statement and the timing for the consummation of the proposed merger was not certain. The parties therefore determined to terminate the Merger Agreement on March 13, 2019 in connection with the Gadsden Purchase Agreement and we withdrew the registration statement.

Contribution Transaction
 
On March 31, 2017, we entered into an Interest Contribution Agreement with First Capital Real Estate Operating Partnership, L.P., or FCOP, First Capital Real Estate Trust Incorporated, or FCREIT, and FC Global Realty Operating Partnership, LLC, our wholly-owned subsidiary. The parties entered into amendments to the Interest Contribution Agreement on August 3, 2017, October 11, 2017 and December 22, 2017. Pursuant to the Interest Contribution Agreement, as amended (which we collectively refer to as the Contribution Agreement), FCOP contributed certain real estate assets to us. In exchange, FCOP received shares of our common stock and Series A Convertible Preferred Stock as described below. We refer to this transaction as the Contribution Transaction.
 
On May 17, 2017, FCOP transferred $10 million agreed upon value of assets to us, consisting of the following:
 

● | three unoccupied land sites intended for development as gas stations located in northern California;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a 75% interest in a limited liability company that owns an unoccupied land site intended for development as a gas station, located in northern California; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a 100% interest in a limited liability company, which we refer to as the Avalon Interest, which owns a 17.9133% interest in a limited liability company called Avalon Jubilee LLC that owns property located in Los Lunas, New Mexico being developed as a single family residential development. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The proposed gas station sites are located in Atwater and Merced, California and had an agreed upon value at the time of acquisition of $2.6 million. We intend to explore our options for the development of these properties. We may (i) lease a property to a developer who will handle all further development of the property, with us receiving monthly lease payments from the developer; (ii) engage a contractor to develop a property to a certain level, then lease it to a developer which will handle the final development and leasing of the property, with us receiving monthly payments from the developer; or (iii) engage a contractor to completely develop a property, then lease it directly to a tenant who will remit monthly lease payments back to us. The option or options selected for these properties will depend upon the types of tenants interested in operating gas stations and/or related ventures on those properties, as well as our capitalization and available financial resources. In these arrangements, the construction and/or management of the properties are or will be handled by third-party firms which specialize in such work. Therefore, we anticipate that we will not need to hire significant additional personnel to develop, maintain and manage these properties. As for funding for any costs associated with these properties’ development, although we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to obtain funding, we will seek funding from one or more of the following potential sources (i) funding from third-party investors; (ii) funding as a result of loans secured by the properties; or (iii) joint-funding arrangements with developers and/or managers of these properties.
 
The residential development in New Mexico consists of approximately 250, non-contiguous, single family residential lots, and a 10,000 square-foot club house, which is under construction. The agreed upon value of this property at the time of acquisition was approximately $7.4 million. This property already has a management and construction arrangement in place. We are the minority holder in that property, holding a 17.9133% interest.
 
In exchange for these assets, we issued to FCOP 879,234 shares of our common stock, which represented approximately 19.9% of its issued and outstanding common stock immediately prior to the closing date, at a per share value of $2.5183, or $2.2 million in the aggregate. We issued the remaining $7.8 million of the approximately $10 million consideration to FCOP in the form of 123,668 shares of its then newly designated non-voting Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, which were subsequently converted into common stock.
 
The number of shares of common stock issued to FCOP and to be issued upon conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock was determined by dividing the $10 million value of the assets by $2.5183, a specified price per share value which represents a 7.5% premium above the volume-weighted average price of all on-exchange transactions in its common stock executed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, during the forty-three (43) trading days prior to the trading day immediately prior to the public announcement of the transaction by us and FCREIT on March 31, 2017, as reported by Bloomberg L.P. We believe that the trading price of our common stock at the time of the Contribution Transaction represented the value of our prior medical device business and not our new real estate development business. No appraisals were obtained for these properties by us, however we did receive draft copies of appraisals obtained by FCOP. The value of the contributed assets was arrived at by the mutual agreement of the parties after analyzing each of the assets in comparison to historical sales of similar land parcels and reviewing the draft appraisals received from FCOP. In other words, the valuation was arrived at by negotiation and arms-length agreement based upon each party’s review of sales prices for comparable properties and without the benefit of a formal appraisal.

The Contribution Agreement contemplated that additional contributions would be made prior to December 31, 2017 if FCOP completed its purchase of additional properties; however, FCOP failed to acquire those additional properties before the December 31, 2017 deadline and, therefore, only the closing described above was completed.
 
In January 2018, we learned of a suit filed in November 2017 by the holder of the majority interest in Avalon Jubilee, LLC. The suit was filed against the previous holders of the two interests and alleged that the right of first refusal contained in the operating agreement for Avalon Jubilee, LLC had not been honored, thereby not allowing the majority holder its option to purchase those interests. While we were not named in the suit, the suit did name several ‘John Does’ as defendants and cast doubt upon the legitimacy of the transfer of the interest in Avalon Jubilee, LLC to us. As a result of this discovery, we were required under accounting rules to write down our investment in Avalon Jubilee, LLC by about $1 million, and expended additional funds to enter into negotiations with the majority interest holder to resolve our ownership of its interest in Avalon Jubilee, LLC. On April 27, 2018, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into an agreement with Alpha Alpha LLC, the majority holder, and Presidential Realty Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries, the other holder, under which our subsidiary, First Capital Avalon Jubilee LLC, was recognized as a 17.9133% member in Avalon Jubilee, LLC, and the operating agreement and other documents for that venture were so amended to reflect that acknowledgement. 
 
Shortly after the Avalon matter was resolved, we discovered that one of the other properties transferred to us by FCOP, known as Greensands II, was not the property described in the documents underlying the transaction, including a draft appraisal used as part of the valuation determination for the stock issued by us to FCOP for the transaction. The property valued in that appraisal was actually a neighboring property once owned by FCOP and known as Greensands I; however the appraisal referred to it as Greensands II. The actual property transferred was significantly smaller than the property which FCOP believed it was purchasing. A subsequent re-appraisal and re-valuation of the actual property received resulted in a write-down of the property’s value by $1.4 million. That adjustment required us to restate our 2017 financials as reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2017, and delayed by several days the filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2018, resulting in us incurring significant additional accounting and legal fees for those filings.
 
See “—Litigation—Suneet Singal Litigation” below for more details regarding these two matters.
 
We elected to early adopt ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805) Clarifying the Definition of a Business. Accordingly, the determination of whether the transaction represents a business combination was evaluated by applying ASU 2017-01 guidance. We have determined that the group of assets assumed do not include (and also, none of them on a stand-alone basis) include, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create output and thus it was determined that the contribution represents an acquisition of assets rather than a business combination. Accordingly, the total sum of the fair value of consideration given (i.e., the fair value of the equity interests issued) together with the transaction costs, was allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values at the date of acquisition. Such allocation did not give rise to goodwill.
 
Our Prior Business Operations
 
Under its previous name, PhotoMedex, Inc., our company was, until the recent sale of the last significant business unit (its consumer products division which was sold to ICTV Brands, Inc., or ICTV, on January 23, 2017 (see Note 2, Discontinued Operations, to our consolidated financial statements), as described below and in other sections of this report, a global skin health company providing integrated disease management and aesthetic solutions to dermatologists, professional aestheticians and consumers. We provided proprietary products and services that addressed skin diseases and conditions including psoriasis, acne, actinic keratosis (a precursor to certain types of skin cancer), photo damage and unwanted hair.
 
On October 4, 2016, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with ICTV for the sale of our consumer division for $9.5 million, including $5 million in cash plus a $4.5 million royalty agreement. We also entered into a transition services agreement, pursuant to which we agreed to provide ICTV with certain accounting, benefit, payroll, regulatory, IT support and other services for periods ranging from approximately three months to up to one year following the closing date, during which time ICTV would arrange to transition the services it receives to its own personnel. This transaction was completed on January 23, 2017.

On July 12, 2017, we entered into a termination and release agreement under which the asset purchase agreement described above was terminated and is of no further force and effect, except for certain surviving rights, obligations and covenants described in the termination and release agreement. Pursuant to the termination and release agreement, ICTV paid us $2 million in cash and we agreed that ICTV will have no further royalty or other payment obligations under the asset purchase agreement. As partial consideration for the releases provided by ICTV pursuant to the termination and release agreement and in accordance with the terms therein, on July 12, 2017, we entered into a bill of sale and assignment, which provides that we sold, assigned, transferred, conveyed and delivered to ICTV, and ICTV purchase and accept from us, all of the right, title and interest, legal or equitable, in and to a deposit in the amount of $0.21 million held by a consumer division vendor, Sigmatron International, Inc., pursuant to an arrangement between us and Sigmatron International, Inc.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, we discontinued our LHE® brand product lines, which were previously sold through our subsidiary, Radiancy, Inc., or Radiancy. Except for an occasional sale of leftover inventory, this business line had basically ceased operations with the NEOVA sale September 23, 2016. We liquidated the remaining legacy inventory and assets of this business line and no longer operate this business. This resulted in a net expenses of $172, from net revenues of $302, less expenses to adjust for account receivable write offs and changes in tax liabilities related to the former product lines.
 
Organizational Chart
 
The following chart depicts our organizational structure following the sale of our prior business and the Contribution Transaction. All subsidiaries are wholly-owned unless otherwise indicated.
 


*These entities were affiliated with our former medical and consumer business. We are in the process of closing and dissolving these entities.
 
Our Real Estate Business
 
Our focus is to build our company into a leading real estate, asset management, and development company, concentrating primarily on investments in high yield income producing assets and other opportunistic commercial properties via direct property ownership and/or asset management. Our objective is to generate long term net asset value growth while adhering to institutional best practices and a deep research process for all investments.

Income Producing Properties
 
For income producing properties, we intend to acquire assets that provide recurring income with the potential for income growth over the long-term. We believe there can be an attractive risk/reward profile to such properties based on the location and the underlying credit attributes of the tenants. In addition, we may invest in loans that are secured by income producing properties or ground leases on such properties. We believe that owning a diversified portfolio of actively managed properties and other real estate related investments, can produce a consistent stream of income with long-term upside potential from income growth or redevelopment.
Real Estate Development
 
We look to invest in land assets that can be developed into income generating commercial, residential, and hospitality properties, for-sale residential properties, or mixed-use development opportunities. Such properties may require extensive planning, and for these investments, we may partner with local developers, architects, and engineers to maximize the highest and best use. We focus on development properties where we believe the risk profile is misunderstood thus creating significant opportunity if we are able to turn the development into a stabilized operating property.
Competition
 
We believe the real estate business is very competitive. Our properties may compete with local sites in attracting skilled labor during construction and in attracting tenants and end-users upon completion. We compete with several types of real estate investors for acquisitions of properties, including real estate limited partnerships, private equity, REITs, developers, financial institutions, and individuals that own, manage, finance, or develop properties. Many of these groups have larger operations and greater financial resources than we do.
 
We believe that our size and scale provide an opportunity to take advantage of smaller-tier assets that most traditional investors do not focus on due to size limitations, thus creating unique investment opportunities with attractive risk/reward profiles.
 
Investment Strategy
 
Our diversified investment strategy provides us with flexibility to invest across real estate asset classes and submarkets in the United States and globally. We will look to utilize our industry experience and relationships to identify the transactions which generate the most attractive risk/reward opportunities consistent with our strategy. We enforce a rigorous and repeatable underwriting process based on deep research and due diligence.
 
One of our core strategies is that we intend to find investments in secondary and tertiary markets with assets that require minimal capital expenditures but generate initial unlevered cash flow yields that are higher than those in primary markets. We look to acquire assets in submarkets where the population and employment trends are positive and where the underlying asset serves a key purpose to the local community.
 
A second component of our investment strategy will revolve around sourcing asset management opportunities for which we would operate as an asset manager of real estate properties. We are not currently structured as a REIT, thus we have the ability to retain earnings and to operate in real estate asset management, development, and peripheral real estate activities, activities that may be limited by REIT requirements. We will look to utilize our existing infrastructure to provide efficiencies of scale to owners of real estate assets as we grow our portfolio over time.
 
Our criteria for evaluating investments includes, but is not limited to, submarket location of the asset, economic and population growth fundamentals of the location, credit quality of the tenant, terms of the underlying leases, historical cash flow and capital expenditure needs at the property, ability to acquire financing secured by the property, tax and regulatory risks associated with the investment, environmental and structural attributes of the property, long-term viability of the asset, and potential redevelopment opportunities of the real estate.
 
We do extensive research on these investment attributes when preparing our investment memorandum. We compare the real estate acquisition we are making to other investments with similar risk profiles both inside and outside the direct real estate investment sector to best assess the merits of the opportunity.

Existing Portfolio
 
In 2017, we acquired under the Contribution Agreement (i) three unoccupied land sites intended for development as gas stations in northern California, (ii) a majority (75%) membership interest in a limited liability company that owns an unoccupied land site located in Northern California, and (iii) a minority (17.9133%) interest in a limited liability company which owns property located in Los Lunas, New Mexico being developed as a single family residential development.
 
In 2018, our subsidiary, RETPROP I, LLC, completed the acquisition of a 7,738 square foot medical office building in Dayton, Ohio. The building’s former owner, and current tenant, a medical practice, has entered into a lease with us to continue its occupancy through April 2022, with the option to renew that lease for two additional five-year terms.
 
On January 14, 2019, we acquired, from Gadsden, a preferred interest in Gadsden Roseville, LLC, which is the sole owner of an investment parcel referred to as the Roseville parcel. The Roseville parcel is located on Roseville Road in Sacramento, California and is an approximately 9.6 acres parcel that is entitled for the development of approximately 65 small lot single family detached homes.
 
These assets constitute our existing asset portfolio.

Our Intellectual Property
 
We do not have any material intellectual property rights relating to our real estate business. However, we do employ certain proprietary processes related to the real estate business which are protected as trade secrets of our company. We have not, at this time, registered any patents, trademarks, or copyrights associated with our real estate business and do not expect to do so in the near future.
 
Our legacy global skin health business provided integrated disease management and aesthetic solutions to dermatologists, professional aestheticians and consumers. We protected our proprietary rights relating to our legacy business from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that our proprietary rights were covered by valid and enforceable patents, trademarks, trade names or copyrights, or were effectively maintained as trade secrets.
 
In connection with the sales of our legacy medical device and consumer products lines, we transferred the intellectual property associated with those product lines, including trademarks and trade names, to their respective purchasers. Accordingly, after those sales, we had 20 trademarks, either registered or being registered, in markets around the world that we had either intended to maintain in support of our legacy capital equipment products or considered as useful in our developing real estate business. These include 9 trademarks issued in the U.S. and 11 trademarks issued in the rest of the world. After the discontinuation of our LHE business line, we have determined that those remaining trademarks would not be useful in our real estate business and have determined that these marks will not be renewed.
 
Research and Development
 
Our research and development expenditures relating to our legacy business operations were approximately $0.14 million in 2017. As of January 23, 2017, the research and development personnel were transferred to ICTV in connection with the closing of the sale of the consumer product line assets.
Government Regulation
 
Regulations Relating Real Estate Business
 
Federal, State and/or Local Regulatory Compliance 
 
We are subject to a variety of Federal, state, and/or local statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations covering the purchase, development, construction and operation of real estate assets. These regulatory requirements include zoning and land use, building design, construction, worksite safety, traffic, and other matters, such as local rules that may impose restrictive zoning and developmental requirements. We are subject to various licensing, registration, and filing requirements in connection with the development, construction, advertisement, and sale of certain real estate assets. Additionally, state and/or local governmental agencies may impose moratoriums on new construction in an area due to the need for infrastructure development, including road development and utility remediation. Finally, state and/or local governments retain certain rights with respect to eminent domain which could enable them to restrict or alter the use of our property. These requirements may lead to increases in our overall costs. The need to comply with these requirements may significantly delay development and/or construction with regard to properties, or lead us to alter our plans regarding certain real estate assets. Some requirements, on a property by property evaluation, may lead to a determination that development of a particular property would not be economically feasible, even if any or all necessary governmental approvals were obtained.

Environmental Regulatory Compliance
 
Under various Federal, state and/or local laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of a property may be required to investigate and/or clean-up hazardous or toxic substances released at that property. That owner or operator also may be held liable to third parties for bodily injury or property damage (investigation and/or clean-up costs) incurred by those parties in connection with the contamination at that site. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or otherwise caused the release of the hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances or other regulated materials also may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at a disposal or treatment facility, whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such persons.
 
The costs of remediation or removal of hazardous or toxic substances can be substantial, and the presence of contamination, or the failure to remediate contamination discovered, at a property we own or operate may adversely affect our ability to develop, construct on, sell, lease, or borrow upon that property. Current and former tenants at a property we own may have, or may have involved, the use of hazardous materials or generated hazardous wastes, and those situations could result in our incurring liabilities to remediate any resulting contamination if the responsible party is unable or unwilling to do so.
 
In addition, our properties may be exposed to a risk of contamination originating from other sources. While a property owner generally is not responsible for remediating contamination that has migrated on-site from an off-site source, the contaminant’s presence could have adverse effects on our ability to develop, construct on, operate, sell, lease, or borrow upon that property. Certain environmental laws may create a lien on a contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs the government may incur to remediate that contamination. Moreover, if contamination is discovered on a property, environmental laws may impose restrictions on the manner in which that property may be used, or how businesses may be operated on that property, thus reducing our ability to maximize our investment in that property. Our properties have been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times; however, the identification of new areas of contamination, a change in the extent or known scope of contamination, or changes in environmental regulatory standards and/or cleanup requirements could result in significant costs to us.
 
Employees
 
As of March 28, 2019, we had 2 full-time employees devoted to the ongoing business of our company, which consisted of 1 executive officer and 1 legal and administration staff.
 
Our employees are not represented by a labor union nor covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that we have good relations with our employees.
