WHOLESALE SEGMENT
Our Wholesale Segment is one of the largest wholesale distributors in the United States serving approximately 5,400 retail outlets including convenience stores, grocery stores, liquor stores, drug stores, and tobacco shops. We currently distribute over 17,000 different consumer products, including cigarettes and tobacco products, candy and other confectionery, beverages, groceries, paper products, health and beauty care products, frozen and refrigerated products and institutional foodservice products. Convenience stores represent our largest customer category. In December 2021, Convenience Store News ranked us as the sixth (6th) largest convenience store distributor in the United States based on annual sales.
Our Wholesale Segment offers retailers the ability to take advantage of manufacturer and Company sponsored sales and marketing programs, merchandising and product category management services, and the use of information systems and data services that are focused on minimizing retailers’ investment in inventory, while seeking to maximize their sales and profits. In addition, our wholesale distributing capabilities provide valuable services to both manufacturers of consumer products and convenience retailers. Manufacturers benefit from our broad retail coverage, inventory management, efficiency in processing small orders, and frequency of deliveries. Convenience retailers benefit from our distribution capabilities by gaining access to a broad product line, inventory optimization and merchandising expertise, information systems, and accessing trade credit.
Our Wholesale Segment operates seven distribution centers located in Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee and West Virginia. These distribution centers, combined with cross-dock facilities, include approximately 885,000 square feet of permanent floor space. Our principal suppliers include Altria, RJ Reynolds, ITG Brands, Hershey, Kellogg’s, Kraft Heinz, and Mars Wrigley. We also market private label lines of water, candy products, batteries, and other products. We do not maintain any long-term purchase contracts with our suppliers.

RETAIL SEGMENT
Our Retail Segment, through our Healthy Edge, Inc. subsidiary, is a specialty retailer of natural/organic groceries and dietary supplements which focuses on providing high quality products at affordable prices, with an exceptional level of customer service and nutritional consultation. All of the products carried in our stores must meet strict quality and ingredient guidelines, and include offerings such as gluten-free and antibiotic-free groceries and meat products, as well as products containing no artificial colors, flavors, preservatives, or partially hydrogenated oils. We design our retail sites in an efficient and flexible small-store format, which emphasizes a high energy and shopper-friendly environment.
We operate within the natural products retail industry, which is a subset of the U.S. grocery industry. This industry includes conventional, natural, gourmet and specialty food markets, mass and discount retailers, warehouse clubs, health food stores, dietary supplement retailers, drug stores, farmers markets, mail order and online retailers, and multi-level marketers. 
Our Retail Segment operates nineteen retail health food stores as Chamberlin’s Natural Foods (“Chamberlin’s”), Akin’s Natural Foods (“Akin’s”), and Earth Origins Market (“EOM”). These stores carry over 35,000 different national and regionally branded and private label products including high-quality natural, organic, and specialty foods consisting of produce, baked goods, frozen foods, nutritional supplements, personal care items, and general merchandise.
COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS
We believe that we benefit from a number of competitive strengths, including the following:
Industry Experience
The management teams for both of our business segments include substantial depth in the areas of finance, information technology, business development, retail store support, logistics, sales, and marketing. This experience is beneficial for the management of vendor and customer relationships as well as overall operational execution.
Flexible Distribution Capabilities and Customer Service Programs
Wholesale distributors typically provide convenience store retailers access to a broad product line, the ability to place small quantity orders, inventory management, and access to trade credit. As a large, full-service wholesale distributor, we offer retailers a wide array of manufacturer and Company sponsored sales and marketing programs, merchandising and product category management services, and the use of information systems that are focused on minimizing retailers’ investment in inventory, while seeking to maximize their sales and profit.
The wholesale distribution industry is highly fragmented and historically has consisted of a small number of large, full service wholesale distributors serving multiple geographic regions and a large number of small, privately-owned businesses. Relative to smaller competitors, large distributors such as our Company benefit from several competitive advantages including: increased purchasing power, the ability to service large chain accounts, economies of scale in sales and operations, and the resources to invest in information technology and other productivity-enhancing technologies.
Broad Product Selection
Our retail health foods business prides itself in carrying a broad and superior-quality selection of organic and natural food products and vitamin supplements. The breadth of our product offerings, combined with highly trained and knowledgeable in-store associates, has created a loyal customer following where our stores are sought out destinations, providing a personalized shopping experience.

BUSINESS STRATEGY
Our business strategy focuses on short, medium, and long term objectives designed to create shareholder value. Our strategic objectives are:

● | Maximizing liquidity and generating cash flow from operations in the short term.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Developing new customer-focused technology applications, expanding our foodservice platform, and investing in our infrastructure in the medium term.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Growing both organically and through acquisitions, and expanding our geographic footprint in the long term.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To execute this strategy, our Company has rigorous operational processes in place designed to control costs, manage credit risk, monitor inventory levels, and maintain maximum liquidity. The success of our strategy, however, is ultimately dependent on our ability to provide superior service, develop leading edge technologies, and maintain an exceptional array of product offerings.
PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS
The sales of cigarettes represented approximately 66% and 68% of our consolidated revenue in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively. Sales of candy, beverages, foodservice, groceries, health food products, paper products, health and beauty care products, and tobacco products represented approximately 34% and 32% of our consolidated revenue in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively.
INFORMATION ON SEGMENTS
Information about our segments is presented in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.
COMPETITION—Wholesale Segment
Our Wholesale Segment has a significant presence in the regions in which we operate. There are, however, a number of both national and regional wholesale distributors operating in the same geographical regions as our Company, resulting in a highly competitive marketplace. Our principal competitors are national wholesalers such as McLane Co., Inc. (Temple, Texas) and Performance Food Group (Richmond, Virginia), as well as regional wholesalers such as H.T. Hackney Company (Knoxville, Tennessee) and Imperial Super Regional Distributors (Elmwood, Louisiana) along with a host of smaller grocery and tobacco wholesalers. We also face competition from Amazon™ which pursues a vertical, multi-channel sales strategy whereby both retail consumers and business level customers are targeted.
​
Competition within the wholesale distribution industry is primarily based on the range and quality of the services provided, pricing, variety of products offered, and the reliability of deliveries. Our larger competitors principally compete on pricing and breadth of product offerings, while our smaller competitors focus on customer service and their delivery arrangements.
We believe our business model positions us to compete with a wide range of competitors including national, regional, and local wholesalers. As the sixth (6th) largest convenience store distributor in the United States based on annual sales (according to Convenience Store News), our wholesale distribution business has sufficient economies of scale to offer competitive pricing as compared to national wholesalers. Additionally, we believe our flexible distribution and support model allows us to provide a high level of service and customized merchandising solutions.

COMPETITION—Retail Segment
Natural food and supplement retailing is an intensely competitive business. We face competition from a variety of sales channels including local, regional, and national retailers, specialty supermarkets, membership clubs, farmers markets, other natural foods stores, and internet and/or digital direct-to-consumer retailers, each of which competes with us on the basis of product selection, quality, customer service, and price. 
The natural food retail industry is highly fragmented. According to The Natural Foods Merchandiser (“NFM”), there are approximately 10,400 natural food retail stores operating independently or as part of small retail chains and nearly 21,600 stores when national chains are included. These competitors include companies such as Whole Foods Market, Sprouts Farmers Market, Natural Grocers, General Nutrition Centers and Vitamin Shoppe. We also face competition from AmazonTM and other online competitors which continue to pursue vertical, multi-channel sales strategies whereby both retail consumers and business level customers are targeted. We also compete with specialty supermarkets, other independent natural foods stores chains, small specialty stores, and restaurants. In recent years, conventional supermarkets and mass market outlets such as Kroger, Albertsons, Walmart, Publix, Aldi, Trader Joe’s and Costco have significantly increased their offerings of organic and natural products adding another layer of competition.
​
SEASONALITY
Sales in the wholesale distribution industry are somewhat seasonal and tend to be higher in warm weather months during which our convenience store customers experience increased customer traffic. The warm weather months generally fall within the Company’s third and fourth fiscal quarters. Our retail health food business does not generally experience significant seasonal fluctuations in its business.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
AMCON is subject to regulation by federal, state and local governmental agencies, including but not limited to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (“ATF”) and the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”). These regulatory agencies generally impose standards for product quality and sanitation, workplace safety, and security and distribution policies.
The Company operates in 29 states and is subject to state regulations related to the distribution and sale of cigarettes and tobacco products, generally in the form of licensing and bonding requirements. Additionally, both state and federal regulatory agencies have the ability to impose excise taxes on cigarette and tobacco products. In recent years, a number of states have increased the excise taxes levied on cigarettes and tobacco products. We expect this trend to continue as legislators look for alternatives to fund budget shortfalls and as a mechanism to discourage tobacco product use.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
All of AMCON’s facilities and operations are subject to state and federal environmental regulations. The Company believes it is in compliance with all such regulations and is not aware of any violations that could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. Further, the Company has not been notified by any governmental authority of any potential liability or other claim in connection with any of its properties. The costs and effect on the Company to comply with state and federal environmental regulations were not significant during either fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2021.
