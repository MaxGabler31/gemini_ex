ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 Zynga Inc. (“Zynga” or “we” or the “Company”) is a leading provider of social game services. We develop, market and operate social games as live services played on mobile platforms such as Apple’s iOS operating system (“iOS”) and Google’s Android operating system (“Android”) and on social networking sites such as Facebook. Generally, all of our games are free to play, and we generate revenue through the sale of in-game virtual items (“online game revenue”) and advertising services (“advertising revenue”).
 We are a pioneer and innovator of social games and a leader in making “play” a core activity on mobile devices and social networking sites. We believe our leadership position in social games is the result of our significant investment in our people, content, brand, technology and infrastructure. Our leadership position in social games is defined by the following:
  
• | Established Portfolio of Social Games. We operate a number of popular social games including CSR Racing 2, FarmVille, Merge Dragons!, Words With Friends and Zynga Poker, as well as our Social Slots portfolio of games. Further, in January 2019, we expanded our portfolio of social games with Empires & Puzzles, through our acquisition of Small Giant Games Oy.

• | Engaged and Global Community of Players. According to our internal analytics system, in 2018, we had 88 million monthly active users (“MAUs”), of which 88% were mobile MAUs, and 23 million daily active users (“DAUs”), of which 91% were mobile DAUs.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Scalable Technology and Data. We leverage our technology to increase player engagement, cross-promote our portfolio of games, continually enhance existing games, launch new games and build the Zynga brand. We believe our scale results in network effects that deliver compelling value to our players, and we are committed to making significant investments to grow our community of players, their engagement and monetization over time. We believe that combining data analytics with creative game design enables us to create a superior player experience.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Consistent with our free-to-play business model, a small portion of our players have historically been payers. Because the opportunity for social interactions increases as the number of players increases, we believe that maintaining and growing our overall number of players, including the number of players who may not purchase virtual items, is important to the success of our business. As a result, we believe that the number of players who choose to purchase virtual items will continue to constitute a small portion of our overall players.
 Our top three online game revenue-generating games historically have contributed a significant portion of our revenue, though the games that represent our top three online game revenue-generating games vary over time. Our top three online game revenue-generating games accounted for 45%, 45% and 44% of our online game revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In 2018, our top three online game revenue-generating games were Zynga Poker, CSR Racing 2 and Hit It Rich! Slots. With respect to advertising and other revenue, Words with Friends generated a substantial portion of our advertising and other revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016.  
 Our operations are headquartered in San Francisco, California, and we have several operating locations in the U.S. as well as various international office locations in North America, Asia and Europe. We were originally organized in April 2007 and completed our initial public offering in December 2011. Our Class A common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “ZNGA.”
 Our Mission & Strengths
 Our mission is to connect the world through games. We pursue that mission in the following ways:
  
• | A galvanizing company vision. We believe that our vision for social gaming distinguishes us from others in the market. Zynga was founded with the simple premise that it is more fun to play games with other people and that social gaming is the best path to the mass market. Our approach is to build games around social features and systems to deliver a higher quality player experience with increased levels of engagement, organic acquisition and long-term retention.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Proven brands in popular genres. We have a portfolio of established brands such as CSR Racing 2, Empires & Puzzles, FarmVille, Hit it Rich! Slots, Merge Dragons!, Words With Friends and Zynga Poker in the categories of Action Strategy, Casual, Invest Express and Social Casino. We believe that mobile gaming is the fastest growing platform in gaming and we are committed to leveraging our experience in live services to grow our existing portfolio of games and introduce new intellectual property in these categories.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Talented teams and strong analytics. We have passionate teams of people focused on increasing the effectiveness and predictability of our live game services and new game development. Our teams balance the art and science of game making by combining creative innovation with a player-centric, data driven approach to surprise and delight players.

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Network
 We believe it is more fun for players to engage in our games with their friends and family. Players also progress faster in our games by connecting with their friends and other players in our network to instantly get what they need to complete quests, obtain virtual items and enhance their experience. We aspire to leverage our existing and new games to bring the best social playing experiences to our audience. Our network enables users to discover new games, find and connect with new friends, and challenge, cooperate and compete with their friends, all of which drive higher user engagement for games on our network.
Our Revenues
 We generate revenue from the following services:
 Virtual Items and Advertisement-Free Versions
 Our primary revenue source is the sale of virtual currency that players use to buy in-game virtual items. Virtual currency can also be earned for free by the player through game play or by accepting promotional offers from our advertising partners. We also generate revenue when players purchase advertisement-free versions of our mobile games.
Advertising and Licensing
 Our advertising services and licensing offer creative ways for marketers and advertisers to reach and engage with our players while allowing continued operation of a free-to-play business model. Our advertising and licensing offerings include:

• | Mobile Ads in our mobile games that include banner and interstitial advertisements;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Display Ads in our online web games that include banner advertisements;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Engagement Ads and Offers in which players can answer certain questions, watch-to-earn engagements or sign up for third party services to receive virtual currency and in-game bonuses;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Branded Virtual Items and Sponsorships that integrate relevant advertising and messaging within game play;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Licensing our brands.
--+----------------------

 The goal of our advertisement offerings are to enhance the player experience while delivering real value to advertisers.

Marketing and Distribution
 We acquire our players through unpaid channels by cross-promoting new games to our existing audience and through paid advertising channels. We have been able to build a large community of players through the viral and sharing features provided by social networks, the social innovations in our games and the network effects of our games. We also advertise our games within other mobile applications, on social networks such as Facebook via various in-app advertising partners and through other advertising partners such as Google. In 2018, 2017 and 2016 we spent $157.7 million, $147.2 million and $132.5 million, respectively, on these player acquisition costs.
Agreements with Apple, Google and Facebook
 Our revenue depends on our continued ability to publish our games on mobile platforms, primarily iOS and Android, and on social networking sites, primarily Facebook. In 2018, we derived 51% of our revenue and bookings from Apple, 38% of our revenue and 39% of our bookings from Google and 9% of our revenue and 8% of our bookings from Facebook. In 2018, an increasing number of our players played our games on mobile platforms.
 Our use of mobile platforms and data derived from mobile platforms is governed by the standard terms of service of the mobile platforms, primarily Apple and Google. Our use of the Facebook platform and data derived from Facebook is also governed by Facebook’s standard terms of service except for certain limited addenda. Any of these operators could unilaterally alter their terms of service in a manner that could harm our business. 
 Research and Development
 We believe continued investment in enhancing existing games and developing new games, and in software development tools and code modification, is important to attaining our strategic objectives. Our research and development expenses were $270.3 million, $256.0 million and $320.3 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which included stock-based compensation expense of $42.2 million, $42.2 million and $84.2 million, respectively, for research and development personnel.
Technology and Tools
 We have invested extensively in developing our proprietary technology stack, which has the ability to handle sudden bursts of activity for millions of players over a short period of time with high levels of performance and reliability. Our proprietary technology stack includes cloud computing management, a shared code base, network and cross-promotional features and proprietary data analytics. Our technology stack also supports the growth of our 2D and 3D game engines across our mobile games in addition to supporting high-level security and anti-fraud infrastructure. We are also investing in machine learning. We believe that investing in technology and tools can create competitive advantages as well as extend our technology leadership. We will continue to innovate and optimize across our technology and tools to deliver cost-effective, high performance and highly available social games.
Intellectual Property
 Our business is significantly based on the creation, acquisition, use and protection of intellectual property. Some of this intellectual property is in the form of software code, patented technology and trade secrets that we use to develop our games and to enable them to run properly on multiple platforms. Other intellectual property we create includes product and feature names and audio-visual elements, including graphics, music, story lines and interface design.
 While most of the intellectual property we use is created by us, we have also acquired rights to proprietary intellectual property. We have also obtained rights to use intellectual property through licenses and service agreements with third parties. These licenses typically limit our use of intellectual property to specific uses and for specific time periods.
 We protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law protections, as well as contractual restrictions. We actively seek patent protection covering our inventions and we acquire patents we believe may be useful or relevant to our business. We control access to our proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third parties. We also actively engage in monitoring and enforcement activities with respect to infringing uses of our trademarks, copyrights and domain names by third parties.
 In addition to these contractual arrangements, we also rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, domain names and patents to protect our games and other intellectual property. We typically own the copyrights to the software code to our content, as well as the trademarks for the brands or titles under which our games are marketed. We pursue the registration of our domain names, copyrights, trademarks, patents, and service marks in the U.S. and, for some, in locations outside the U.S. Our registered trademarks in the U.S. include “Zynga” and the names of our games, among others.

Competition
 We face significant competition in all aspects of our business. Specifically, we compete for the leisure time, attention and discretionary spending of our players with other social game developers on the basis of a number of factors, including quality of player experience, brand awareness and reputation and access to distribution channels.
 We believe we compete favorably on these factors. However, our industry remains highly competitive and is evolving rapidly. Other developers of social games could develop more compelling content that competes with our social games and adversely affects our ability to attract and retain players and their entertainment time. These competitors, including companies of which we may not be currently aware, may take advantage of social networks, access to a large user base and their network effects to grow rapidly and virally.
 Our competitors include:
  
• | Developers for Mobile and Web Games: We face competition from a number of competitors who develop mobile and web games. These competitors, some of which have significant financial, technical and other resources, greater brand recognition and longer operating histories, may create games that appeal to our players. The mobile game sector specifically is characterized by frequent product introductions, rapidly emerging mobile platforms, new technologies and new mobile application storefronts. Some of these competitors include Activision Blizzard (the parent company of King Digital), Aristocrat, DoubleU, Electronic Arts (EA Mobile), Epic Games, Glu Mobile, Jam City, Machine Zone, Netmarble (the parent company of Kabam), NetEase (NetEase Games), Niantic, Peak Games, Playtika, SciGames Interactive, Supercell, Take-Two Interactive Software, Vivendi (the parent company of Gameloft) and others. Because our games are free to play, we compete primarily on the basis of player experience rather than price. We also expect new competitors to enter the market and existing competitors to allocate more resources to develop and market competing games and applications.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Other Game Developers: Our players may also play other games on personal computers and consoles, some of which include social features that compete with our social games and have community functions where game developers can engage with their players. Some of these competitors include Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Epic Games, Nintendo, Riot Games, SEGA, Sony, Take-Two Interactive and Ubisoft.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Other Forms of Media and Entertainment: We compete more broadly for the leisure time and attention of our players with providers of other forms of Internet and mobile entertainment, including social networking, online casual entertainment and music. To the extent existing or potential players choose to read, watch or listen to online content or streaming video or radio, play interactive video games at home or on their computer or mobile devices rather than play social games, these content services pose a competitive threat.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Government Regulation
 We are subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet and mobile platforms, including those relating to privacy, use and protection of player and employee personal information and data (including the collection of data from minors), the Internet, behavioral tracking, mobile applications, content, advertising and marketing activities (including sweepstakes, contests and giveaways), and anti-corruption. Additional laws in all of these areas are likely to be passed in the future, which could result in significant limitations on or changes to the ways in which we can collect, use, host, store or transmit the personal information and data of our customers or employees, communicate with our players, and deliver products and services, and may significantly increase our compliance costs. As our business expands to include new uses or collection of data that are subject to privacy or security regulations, our compliance requirements and costs will increase and we may be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny.
 Some of our games and features are based upon traditional casino games, such as slots and poker. We have structured and operate these games and features with gambling laws in mind and believe that these games and features do not constitute gambling. Our social casino games are offered for entertainment purposes only and do not offer an opportunity to win real money.
 Seasonality
 Approximately 26% of our revenue was derived from the “advertising and other” category in 2018. Advertising budgets are generally highest during the fourth quarter and decline significantly in the first quarter of the following year, which affects the revenues we derive from advertisements in our games. Additionally, we generally experience increases in game downloads and resulting online game revenues in the fourth quarter and first quarter corresponding to increases in smartphone and tablet purchases during the holiday shopping season.

Employees
 Our future success depends upon the continued service of our key technical and management personnel and upon our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees, particularly our senior management team and highly skilled game designers, product managers and engineers. We currently have favorable employee relations, but the competition for technical personnel is intense, and the loss of key employees or the inability to hire such employees when needed could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition. As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,777 full-time employees.
Financial Information about Segments and Geographic Areas
 
We have one operating segment with one business activity, developing and monetizing social games.
