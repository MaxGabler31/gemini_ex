Introduction
 
PolarityTE™ is a commercial-stage biotechnology and regenerative biomaterials company focused on transforming the lives of patients by discovering, designing and developing a range of regenerative tissue products and biomaterials for the fields of medicine, biomedical engineering and material sciences. We believe that our PolarityTE platform technology is a new approach to pragmatic and functional tissue regeneration that has the potential to address many of the challenges currently facing the regenerative medicine and cell therapy markets. Recognizing the natural complexity of human tissue, our core “TE” platform begins with a small piece of the patient’s own, or autologous, healthy tissue, rather than artificially manipulated individual cells. From this small piece of healthy autologous tissue, we create an easily deployable, dynamic and self-propagating product designed to enhance and stimulate the patient’s own cells to regenerate the target tissues. Rather than manufacturing with synthetic and foreign materials within artificially engineered environments, we manufacture with the patient’s own tissue and use the patient’s own body to support the regenerative process to create the same tissue from which it was derived. We believe that our innovative method promotes and accelerates growth of the patient’s tissues to undergo a form of effective regenerative healing.


We believe our core “TE” platform has applications across many indications, including the regrowth of skin, bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, blood vessels and neural elements, as well as solid and hollow organ composite tissue systems. Our first product, SkinTE™, is registered with the United States Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, pursuant to the regulatory pathway for human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps) regulated solely under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act, or 361 HCT/Ps, which permits qualifying products to be marketed without first obtaining FDA marketing authorization or approval. SkinTE is commercially available for the repair, reconstruction, replacement and regeneration of skin (i.e., homologous uses) for patients who have suffered from wounds, burns or injuries that require skin coverage over both small and large areas of their body.


We believe that living systems require more than a simple singular input, like a growth factor, stem cell or nano-particle, to produce a complex output. We have designed, engineered and developed our technology platform to allow us to induce, maintain and promote the complete development of cellular entities, their products and tissue elements in a way that mirrors regenerative healing in the body. We aim to maintain and promote key dynamic processes that drive integrative regeneration of our tissue products once deployed back to the patient to improve upon common issues seen with other tissue products, such as immune system rejection, inflammation, and other adverse reactions.
 
The following chart summarizes the development of our core products and product candidates.

SkinTE, our first of the core “TE” tissue products, was registered with the FDA on August 14, 2017, and is now commercially available for the repair, reconstruction, replacement or regeneration of skin in patients who have or require treatment of acute and chronic wounds, burns, surgical reconstruction events, scar revision, or removal of dysfunctional skin grafts. We have initiated a staged-commercial release of SkinTE to select medical institutions, and expect to scale up manufacturing efforts during 2018 following the buildout of our 200,000 ft2 biomedical manufacturing facility.
 
In preclinical testing, we observed that SkinTE regenerated full-thickness skin complete with all of its layers (epidermis, dermis, hypodermis) and functional appendages, including hair follicles, sweat glands and sebaceous glands. Thus far, in the early stages of the human clinical application of SkinTE, we have observed results that are correlative with our preclinical observations. We intend to target sales of SkinTE toward the wound care market, which according to MedMarket Diligence LLC is expected to exceed 250 million wounds worldwide by 2020.
 
Because we do not expect our product candidates to require time-intensive, costly, multi-phase clinical trials or prior marketing approval or authorization like other therapeutics, biologics and devices, we plan to develop and commercialize several products simultaneously. As we believe our innovative platform technology has wide applicability—not only to regenerate multiple human tissues, organs, and composite structures, but also across other complex interacting biological systems (such as the immune system)—we believe that over time we can become a leader in the global regenerative medicine market, which according to Stratistics MRC is expected to exceed $100 billion by 2022.
 
We are a company built and run by physicians for patients and the physicians who care for them. We believe that developing tangible regenerative products requires an intimate knowledge of the realities that exist within the trenches of medicine. Our management team’s expertise is the result of years of medical training and clinical practice, extensive direct experience in the field at major reconstructive surgery and burn centers, and, collectively, hundreds of articles published in peer-reviewed journals and other publications. Our founders, Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Denver Lough, and Chief Operating Officer, Dr. Edward Swanson, left the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine to launch the Company and pursue their passion to impact the lives of patients on a much larger scale, and to address many of the clinical problems they encountered on a daily basis. Dr. Michael W. Neumeister, our Chief Medical Officer, is Professor and Chairman of the Department of Surgery at Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, and Dr. Stephen Milner, our Chief Clinical Officer, is former Professor of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery and Pediatrics at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and former Director of the Johns Hopkins Burn Center. Dr. Maurice Nahabedian, our Chief Surgical Officer, is Chairman of this year’s meeting of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, is former Professor and Section Chief of Plastic Surgery at MedStar Washington Hospital Center, and former Vice Chairman of the Department of Plastic Surgery at the Georgetown University.
 
We believe that our expertise is further bolstered by the vast knowledge and experience of our Clinical Board of Advisors, composed of leaders across a variety of medical and surgical specialties, including professors, chairmen of departments, and national surgical society presidents at a number of medical institutions, such as former President of the American Burn Association and Chairman of the American Board of Plastic Surgery, Dr. Martin C. Robson.

In addition to our Clinical Board of Advisors, we have assembled a Military and Mass Casualty Board led by Major General (U.S. Army – Retired) Jay Hood, who served as the Commander of First Army Division East, the Chief of Staff, United States Central Command and the Commander of Joint Task Force Guantanamo, among other high-level leadership positions during his 36 years of distinguished service. We intend to leverage the expertise of our Military and Mass Casualty Board to identify ways to use our technology platform to develop regenerative products with the potential to address the complex and devastating injuries of military service members, wounded warriors, veterans, and mass casualty victims.
 
Limitations of Current Wound Care and Regenerative Medicine Technologies and Products
 
To date, many wound care, regenerative medicine and tissue engineered products have focused on “large scale manufacturable materials” and “off the shelf” designs for products as opposed to employing a more patient-specific approach. Many products utilize animal-derived tissues, referred to as xenografts, or cadaveric-derived tissues, referred to as allografts, in part to allow for a robust supply chain of sourced raw materials. However, we believe these skin substitutes do not result in actual tissue regeneration.
 
We believe that, prior to PolarityTE, the evolving field of regenerative medicine has been characterized by tremendous potential, but has also been wedded to approaches that are fraught with significant challenges. We believe the approach to regenerative medicine that our predecessors and competitors employ has anchored itself within tissue engineering algorithms that—while potentially profitable because of mass production and scalability—are incongruent with living cells, dynamic tissues and reactive systems. Some current regenerative medicine approaches aim to isolate a single cellular population to regenerate a tissue, such as adipose-derived stem cells. Other approaches aim to deliver a molecule to manipulate cell function, such as driving cell growth and expansion, or coaxing one cell type to become another. The final prominent current approach aims to create some form of a scaffold that recapitulates the appearance of the target tissue with specific properties designed to mimic that tissue, such as polymers with similar mechanical properties of bone, and allow or encourage a targeted cellular function and tissue integration, such as 3-D printing of scaffolds and nano-particles.
 
We believe these approaches incorrectly focus on the synthesis and/or engineering of singularities (i.e. a type of cell, a type of molecule, and/or type of matrix) in an attempt to build a complex tissue from the ground up, which we believe creates an incomplete system without interactions, diverse cells and molecules, or a natural environment to direct organization.
 
Our Solution — The PolarityTE Core “TE” Platform Technology
 
We believe each person’s cells and tissues have vastly different and dynamic profiles (genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic etc.), and therefore different requirements when it comes to the regenerative potential and/or healing capacity of tissue-based systems. With this in mind, we designed our core “TE” platform technology to focus not on singularities but on regenerating complete tissue systems.
 
Our core “TE” platform and self-complexing intelligent regenerative materials technologies are based on our ability to create minimally polarized functional units, or MPFUs, which contain polarizing multi-cellular aggregates capable of expanding, proliferating and synthesizing those cells, materials, factors and/or systems we believe are necessary for integrative full-thickness three-dimensional tissue regeneration, not simply two-dimensional cell sheets. Instead of starting with artificial materials, synthetic factors and/or altered cell suspensions, our platform begins with the patient’s own (autologous) tissue and those components, appendages and substrates we believe are necessary for the development of an expandable and self-propagating complete system.
 
With SkinTE, often within 24-48 hours of the initial skin harvest, our product is applied to the patient, whose body then provides a receptive environment and nutrients for controlled healing. By both preserving the tissue’s natural microenvironment and using the patient’s body as an intrinsic bioreactor—which means using the body’s own natural biological healing process rather than a manufactured or engineered environment to support the regenerative process—we believe a patient’s own tissue can be regenerated, along with its natural coloring and texture, layers and structure, hair and appendages. We have designed our technology platform to use the patient’s own healthy tissue, in part to increase the likelihood that the patient’s immune system will identify the regenerating tissue as its own so that our product is neither rejected nor reacted to adversely. We believe that our platform has the potential to transform tissue regeneration, including potential regeneration of multiple tissue substrates, such as skin, bone, muscle, fat, cartilage, nerves, and blood vessels. The harvest, deployment, and application of our platform technology in SkinTE is shown in the images below.

Our product pipeline focuses on the development of regenerative products for a variety of tissue types and organ systems which are commonly altered, injured or destroyed by a variety of diseases, pathologies, traumatic events and medical interventions. We believe that our biomaterials platform capabilities extend to applications across many indications, including bone, cartilage, muscle, blood vessels and neural elements as well as solid and hollow organ composite tissue systems. The key attributes of our platform technology include the following:
 

● | Patient-Generated Cell Source: The human body often identifies and rejects foreign cells, creating the potential for tissue rejection, additional surgery, and foreign or allogeneic body reactions like residual scarring. We address this by using healthy autologous tissue taken from the patient to regenerate cells that the body identifies as “self” rather than foreign. Our goal is to allow a recipient to receive our product and generate new tissue without triggering an allogeneic, or foreign tissue, rejection, wherein the patient’s immune system destroys the transplanted tissue.

● | Stem Cell Niche Utilization for Functional Tissue with Full Thickness and Layer Regeneration: We utilize techniques for capturing the “stem cell niche,” the microenvironment within a particular tissue that interacts with stem cells to signal cell growth, development, renewal and differentiation. While the stem cell niche historically has often been left behind by the commonly used split-thickness autograft methodology, we believe that it is necessary for the regeneration of functional tissue. Without the stem cell niche, we believe new tissue will form a scar and lose the functionality of the original tissue from which it was regenerated. By including the stem cell niche within the autologous tissue that is harvested, we believe the natural function of the small piece of tissue is preserved as it regenerates into a larger piece that can fill the patient’s wound. This is designed to minimize painful scarring, or lesions, that often accompanies autologous regeneration without the stem cell niche, to allow for the regeneration of the tissue’s normal layers and appendages, and to provide full-tissue coverage without relying on secondary surgery or in-growth of the surrounding tissue. We believe inclusion of the stem cell niche allows us to regenerate tissue with its naturally complex layers intact. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Polarity Maintenance and Enhancement to Harness Stem Cell Niche Regeneration: A cell’s polarity refers to its interactive communication with neighboring cells, including the direction in which a cell should grow. This enables cells and tissues to carry out specialized functions. Our platform carefully maintains and enhances the polarity of the stem cell niche in order to harness its regenerative capacity by mirroring the way tissue develops in the human body. By maintaining and enhancing the polarity of regenerating tissue, our platform is designed to preserve the natural cell and three-dimensional tissue structure, and thereby the functionality of regenerated tissues and appendages. 
● | Patient as Bioreactor: Instead of using a manufactured or engineered environment to support the regenerative process, our platform uses the human body as a bioreactor by applying our product to the patient and allowing regeneration to occur there. We believe this allows the patient’s own body to provide the ideal nutrients and extracellular environment for controlled healing of the regenerative tissue. This approach also reduces turnaround time back to the patient, as our manufacturing process does not involve growing cells in an industrial, synthetic bioreactor. 

Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe that our key competitive strengths include the following:
 
Novel Platform Technology. Our technology platform deploys activated MPFUs into a wound or other tissue defect with the goal of regenerating fully-functional, polarized tissues and hierarchically organized tissue structures, such as skin with all of its layers, hair and glands. We design the MPFUs to facilitate the expansion, proliferation and synthesis of the cells, materials, factors and systems that we believe are necessary for complete, full-thickness generation and regeneration across a spectrum of tissue substrates and organ systems. Rather than relying on a single stem cell, growth factor, or scaffold, we believe that complex tissue regeneration requires a dynamic composite cellular interface to engineer a complex tissue that is expected to integrate into living systems. We design our core tissue substrate materials to create complex functional living tissue systems in a way that mirrors natural healing in the body and is not seen as foreign by the immune system.
Proof of Concept Through FDA-Registered, Commercialized SkinTE Product. SkinTE is registered with the FDA and is our first commercially available product. In our preclinical animal studies, we observed favorable outcomes using SkinTE to aid skin regeneration compared to natural wound healing. In a natural, unaided setting, skin defects heal through a process of wound contraction and often scar formation. Although skin grafts may reduce contraction, they also often leave patients with scarring. In our preclinical animal studies, we observed that SkinTE reduced scar formation and regenerated full-thickness, hair-bearing skin within the wound bed. The following images from our preclinical animal studies show the SkinTE skin regeneration and native wound healing we observed in one of our preclinical animal studies.

Since November 2017, we have sold and provided SkinTE to multiple medical providers across the country who have treated patients for acute and chronic wounds, surgical reconstruction, burns, and removal of scarred and contracted skin grafts for replacement with SkinTE. Preliminary results from the initial human clinical applications of SkinTE are yielding results that are correlative with our preclinical observations.
 
Deep Pipeline of Additional Potential Applications. In addition to the regrowth of skin, we believe our platform’s capabilities can be extended across many indications, including bone, cartilage, muscle, blood vessels and neural elements, as well as solid and hollow organ composite tissue systems. For example, we believe there are currently unmet medical needs that can be addressed by the regeneration of cartilage for the treatment of osteoarthritis and facial reconstruction, the regeneration of fat-for-fat transfers during plastic surgery procedures, the regeneration of nerves following traumatic loss, the regeneration of blood vessels for vascular grafts, the regeneration of the urogenital epithelium and submucosa for urethral strictures and bladder reconstruction following tumor removal, the regeneration of liver tissue for liver fibrosis or failure, and the regeneration of bowel tissue to prevent leaking where the bowel is reconnected (prevention of anastomotic leak) or replaced due to excessive loss from trauma, surgery or congenital defects.
Shortened Product Development Timelines. Since our core “TE” product candidates all stem from a common platform technology, we believe we are able to accelerate research and development, pre-clinical model prototyping, and product development in a manner which is efficient and optimized across substrates.
Scalable Manufacturing and Distribution Capability. Because we believe our technology can be applied across a variety of tissue substrates, we believe we have the ability to prototype, model and develop products for commercialization relatively quickly. We have developed flexible manufacturing processes, systems and facilities that we believe can allow us to quickly respond to increases in demand and market forces. Because we believe we can apply our technology to many types of tissue and organ systems, we believe we can effectively scale and reproduce the manufacturing and distribution of multiple pipeline products at the same time. In addition, we believe we can leverage our platform technology to create a variety of substrate sub-platforms and related technology derivative arms, which can act either as additive technologies to core “TE” products, or as standalone products. We believe we may also be able to integrate our technology with other off-the-shelf products (e.g. to cellularize an acellular scaffold or function with existing dressings).
Efficient Regulatory Pathway. We believe our products and product candidates, including SkinTE, are appropriately regulated by the FDA as 361 HCT/Ps, which provides us with the potential to register and list products with the FDA, and begin commercializing quickly and efficiently. Unlike products regulated by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FD&C Act”) and/or the Public Health Service Act as drugs, devices, or biologics, which require multi-phase clinical trials and premarket approvals, our SkinTE product is regulated by the FDA as human cells or tissues intended for implantation. We are developing our additional pipeline candidates to be regulated as 361 HCT/Ps as well. 361 HCT/Ps do not require premarket approval or other premarket authorization and may be lawfully marketed for appropriate human use in the United States following registration with the FDA.
Experienced and Recognized Physician-Led Leadership Team. We believe our extensive experience and knowledge in cell-tissue and molecular biology, reconstructive surgery, regenerative medicine, biomedical engineering, biomedical manufacturing and clinical pragmatism arms us with the ability to effectively commercialize our regenerative technologies for unmet medical needs. We are a company run by physicians for patients and the physicians who care for them. Our management team has spent considerable time in the operating room gaining direct front-line experience with many of the products that comprise the existing regenerative medicine market, and working on ways to address the limitations of these products. Our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Denver Lough, and Chief Operating Officer, Dr. Edward Swanson, were Plastic Surgery Residents at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine prior to founding PolarityTE, and have hands-on experience working in wound care and tissue engineering. Dr. Michael W. Neumeister, our Chief Medical Officer, is Professor and Chairman of the Department of Surgery at Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, and Stephen Milner, our Chief Clinical Officer, was Professor of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery and Pediatrics at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and served as the Director of the Johns Hopkins Burn Center. We believe our front-line experience not only provides a deep understanding of the comparative standards of care for tissue regeneration, but also an understanding of the user experience and adoption mechanisms behind successful surgical products generally. We also benefit from the guidance of our Clinical Board of Advisors, which includes professors and directors of surgery at a number of medical institutions and former President of the American Burn Association and Chairman of the American Board of Plastic Surgery, Dr. Martin C. Robson.

Our Growth Strategy
 
Complete the full commercial launch of SkinTE and establish SkinTE as an improvement over the standard of care for skin tissue injuries, including wounds, burns and scars. We believe that SkinTE has the potential to supplant prevailing methods of wound and burn care because, unlike existing treatment options, it is designed to regenerate full-thickness skin using small samples of the patient’s own tissue. Rather than being limited by dimensions of the tissue received, SkinTE is designed to regenerate significantly beyond the sample size. Our initial limited commercial roll-out of SkinTE commenced in November 2017 and has focused on severe wounds and burn patients at key regional centers as, in our experience, these patients are often in critical need of large areas of skin regrowth and may have limited available healthy skin to use for skin grafts. However, we expect to make SkinTE commercially available to address the broader wound market, which is expected to exceed 250 million wounds worldwide by 2020. Along with the treatment of acute and chronic wounds, we intend to market SkinTE for other surgical reconstruction events, including cosmetic and elective surgeries, and for scar revision or the removal of dysfunctional events. We are leveraging the front-line experience of our leadership team to enhance adoption of SkinTE by physicians and patients by designing our products with a focus on simplicity, the user experience, reliability and ease of application. For SkinTE, and for each of our product candidates we plan to commercialize, we intend to conduct prospective clinical evaluations to compare the products to the standard of care, to bolster adoption and reimbursement with third-party payers.
 
Capitalize on our scalable manufacturing capabilities and the 361 HCT/P regulatory pathway to commercialize additional pipeline products quickly and efficiently. In addition to SkinTE, we are actively preparing and advancing our other core “TE” pipeline candidates for FDA registration using the 361 HCT/P pathway that does not require FDA approval prior to marketing, and for market entry. We currently expect to register our bone regeneration product candidate, OsteoTE, with the FDA and to begin commercial roll-out by the end of 2018. We are also developing numerous other regenerative products including CartTE™ (cartilage for osteoarthritis, facial reconstruction and more), AdipoTE™ (fat transfers for plastic surgery procedures), AngioTE™ (vascular grafts), NeuralTE™ (nerve repair), UroTE™ (urogenital epithelium and submucosa), LiverTE™ (liver tissue for liver fibrosis or failure) and BowelTE™ (bowel tissue). Our current expectation is to rely on the versatility of our platform technology, the 361 HCT/P regulatory pathway, and our scalable manufacturing capability to develop and launch multiple products concurrently.
 
Explore partnership or collaboration opportunities for pipeline candidates as well as potential acquisitions or in-licenses of complementary product candidates. We are actively exploring the possibility of partnership or collaboration opportunities with third parties, which we believe could be used to facilitate the commercial adoption of our pipeline candidates worldwide or in certain territories. We are selectively evaluating the formation of collaborative alliances, product licensure and distribution agreements and integrative product offerings, as well as opportunities to accelerate the commercialization and development of our products. In the future, we also expect to consider the acquisition or in-license of complementary product candidates.


Our Products and Product Candidates
 
The following chart summarizes our product development pipeline.

SkinTE 
 
Our first product, SkinTE, is registered with the FDA and is now commercially available for treatment of defects of the skin. SkinTE is created from a small piece of the patient’s own tissue, which is extracted, and then manufactured using our proprietary technology platform to expand and regenerate full-thickness, fully functional skin with what we believe to be the critical layers, including epidermis, dermis and hypodermis, and appendages including hair follicles and glands. Each package of SkinTE is patient-specific and designed for a single application. We believe SkinTE offers a compelling alternative to current standards of care for skin regeneration.
 
PolarityTE designed SkinTE for use by physicians and other healthcare professionals in the treatment of patients who have suffered from an event, disease, or process, or who have an acquired defect that has resulted in the functional loss or absence of the skin. Specifically, SkinTE is designed for the treatment of chronic wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers, acute wounds such as traumatic injuries, chronic burn wounds or scars, acute burn wounds, scars of the integument, and defects from medical or surgical resection or reconstruction events which require skin coverage. According to a 2015 report from MedMarket Diligence, LLC, more than 250 million wounds are expected globally by 2020. And according to Stratistics MRC’s 2016 Global Regenerative Medicine Market Outlook, the global market for regenerative medicine and tissue engineering is expected to grow to $101.3 billion by 2020.
 
SkinTE was registered as a 361 HCT/P with the FDA pursuant to Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and 21 CFR 1271. An HCT/P is defined as articles containing or consisting of human cells or tissues that are intended for implantation, transplantation, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. Products that qualify as 361 HCT/Ps are not subject to the FDA’s pre-market clearance or approval requirements, but rather can be immediately listed for commercial use with the FDA and are then subject to post-market regulatory requirements such as compliance with current good tissue practices (cGTP), adverse event and deviation reporting, and post-market inspections by the FDA. For more information on the 361 HCT/P regulatory pathway, please see “Government Regulation” and “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Registration and/or Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates and Other Government Regulations.”
 
Limitations of Current Wound Treatments
 
Current clinical standards and practice adhere to the concept that tissue should be replaced with like, or homologous, tissue. For example, skin should be replaced with skin whenever possible in settings where patients have suffered the loss of such tissue. Understanding this, medical professionals are left with a decision to attempt to temporize a wound bed with cadaveric skin (allograft), utilize the patient’s own skin (autograft), or apply a variety of skin substitutes in order to provide a skin-like barrier while the margin of the wound heals through secondary intention and contraction. Presently, harvest and placement of autologous full-thickness skin results in the best outcome within wound beds because it most closely resembles the full-thickness skin that was lost. Full-thickness harvest of skin, however, also inherently results in a full-thickness skin defect at the donor site, which requires primary closure (skin edge approximation and suturing) so as not to leave a gaping wound behind. There is a limit on how much autologous full-thickness donor skin can be harvested without leaving behind a non-closable wound. As a result, medical professionals can only harvest small, elliptically-shaped pieces of such skin from areas of redundancy, which are referred to as full-thickness skin grafts, or FTSGs.
 
Due to these limitations, medical professionals often rely on split-thickness skin grafts, or STSGs, which harvest only the top layer of the patient’s own skin as a means to get more skin for better coverage of voids. Following harvest of the top layer of skin for an STSG—which leaves behind the many necessary structures, cellular elements and tissue interfaces from the STSG donor site—patients are often left with an incomplete top layer of skin covering the initial defect (recipient site) and a remaining bottom layer at the donor site. In this setting, both donor and recipient sites contain incomplete skin, which can result in dysfunctional, painful scar tissues that can result in lifelong morbidities.
 
Because of the limitations of STSGs and FTSGs, medical professionals and companies have continued to investigate skin substitutes and skin alternatives for use in place of a patient’s own skin, such as a cultured form of manipulated autograft, allograft (cadaveric tissues), xenograft (animal tissues) and alloplast or synthetic materials. To our knowledge, no skin substitute has been able to replicate the appearance of native skin, or regenerate full-thickness skin or the cutaneous appendages (hair follicles, sweat glands, sebaceous glands, etc.), which are necessary for the development of full-thickness, functionally polarized, hierarchically organized skin. In its Local Coverage Determination for the Application of Skin Substitutes (L36466), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, acknowledges that “sufficient data is available to establish distinct inferiority [of current skin substitutes] to human skin autografts and preclude their designation as skin equivalence.” The CMS determination also finds that “without the component of the recipient’s own distinct epithelium and cellular skin elements, permanent skin replacement or coverage by the graft cannot be accomplished.”

Our Wound, Burn and Skin Reconstruction Treatment Solution – SkinTE
 
PolarityTE designed SkinTE to address the limitations from which current wound and burn treatment methods suffer. We designed SkinTE to combine the advantages of autologous STSGs with those of FTSGs. Notably, SkinTE is designed to provide not only the large surface area treatment capability of STSGs, but also the restoration and smaller, less morbid donor site associated with FTSGs. In essence, we believe our minimally manipulated SkinTE product can provide an expandable form of a FTSG.
 
SkinTE is composed of small viable cellular and tissue-based units, which we call MPFUs, that retain all of the components of skin that we believe are required to regenerate full-thickness skin. The initial processes underlying the function of SkinTE are analogous to those responsible for the healing of an autologous skin graft, namely imbibition, inosculation, and neo-vascularization. During imbibition, SkinTE, and the small cellular and tissue based units that comprise it, survive through the direct application of the SkinTE “paste” on the wound bed, exchanging nutrients and waste within the fluid of the wound bed. Inosculation is the stage in which the capillaries and blood vessels already present within the wound bed begin to align and connect with those present within the graft. Neovascularization marks the ingrowth of new blood vessels into the wound bed and out of the graft, with vasculogenesis describing the formation of new vessels from cellular precursors present within the wound and graft, and angiogenesis referring to the sprouting of new vessels from pre-existing ones. Due to their size and composition, we design the small cellular and tissue based units within SkinTE to have reduced metabolic demand and to be capable of surviving through diffusion, and to readily excrete metabolic waste, resulting in what we believe can be less ischemic damage when compared to FTSGs. Reduction in ischemic damage has the potential to decrease scar formation and provide a more functional result. Following completion of the initial stages of integrating and healing within the wound bed, the SkinTE product is designed to begin forming and organizing discrete areas of full-thickness skin. We have observed in preclinical animal testing that these regenerative centers of full-thickness skin then expand out radially across the wound, eventually coalescing with each other and the margins of the wound.
 
As compared to the currently marketed skin substitutes of which we are aware, each SkinTE tissue-product is derived entirely from the patient’s own skin and is not combined with any other tissue-engineered substitutes. We believe these differences allow SkinTE to regenerate all of the important layers of the skin as well as the necessary cutaneous appendages for the development of functionally-polarized, hierarchically organized autologous, homologous skin.


How SkinTE Works
 

SkinTE is designed as an all-in-one system to make the process as simple and efficient as possible for the user—whether that individual is a surgeon, medical doctor, physician assistant or nurse in an operating room, wound clinic, emergency department, doctor’s office or forward operating military facility. When a new clinical center or practice is activated to begin using our SkinTE product, we ship a supply of all-inclusive harvest boxes (see the image furthest to the left above) to the facility for convenient on-site, off-the-shelf storage for that user and facility. Each harvest box contains all the materials and instruments needed to perform the relatively standard skin excision procedure to obtain the tissue sample, and all of the pre-paid/pre-completed shipping labels, and a one-touch NanoCool® shipping box that maintains the temperature within the harvest box as it is delivered to a PolarityTE biomedical manufacturing facility.
 
At our manufacturing facility, we use proprietary techniques to create a paste-like product from the small piece of healthy patient tissue that preserves the original tissue’s microenvironment and allows new cells to integrate into existing, healthy cells, with similarly organized assembly and interface development. Following manufacturing at our facility, the SkinTE product is shipped back to the provider at a time that best suits the patient and provider’s scheduling and location needs (i.e. operating room, procedure clinic, in-patient bedside, out-patient doctor’s office). Our goal is to be able to return the ready-to-use SkinTE product to physicians as early as the same day. In our limited time selling SkinTE, we have observed that the majority of return requests have been for return within 24-72 hours from tissue harvest. At application time, once the patient wound bed is prepared per clinical guidelines, SkinTE is dispensed onto the surface of the wound bed (see the image in the middle above). The wound is dressed using a non-adherent, occlusive, non-absorbent dressing placed directly over the SkinTE product (see the image furthest to the right above), with recommended dressings that we include in the deployment box.

To assist physicians and other medical providers in using SkinTE, we developed a web application called the PolarityTE 24-Hour Real-Time Assistant, or the RTA, which permits experienced and medically trained PolarityTE physicians and staff to provide real-time support through a customer’s computer or smart phone. The RTA permits HIPAA-compliant direct calling, video chat, text, emails and data sharing. Through the RTA, our customers can also track their packages and submit forms. We also use the RTA to gain advanced visibility into daily manufacturing requirements and product flow.
 
Preclinical Studies
 
In preclinical models of full-thickness swine burns and wounds, we observed that SkinTE generated healing with reduced scarring, hair follicle growth, complete wound coverage, and the progressive regeneration of all skin layers including epidermis, dermis and hypodermal layers. We believe swine models of burns and wounds are predictive of results found in humans due to the similarities between swine and human skin. We have included images below of the SkinTE-generated swine wound healing we observed.
 

Stereoscopic Imaging of Progressively Healing Wounds. (a.) Representative progression of wound healing in excised full-thickness burn wound (untreated control) vs. excised full-thickness burn wound treated with SkinTE. Image sequence – left column: day 0; middle column day 2; right column day 50. (b.) Cross-section of healed tissue in untreated control wound. Pseudo-epithelium (PsE); Contracted Scar (CS). (c.) Cross-section of healed tissue in SkinTE treated wound. Black arrows indicate where SkinTE propagated and expanded into the residual burn scar that remained in addition to regenerating full-thickness, hair-bearing skin in the excised tissue void. Hair Follicle (HF); Epidermis (Ep); Epidermal-Dermal Junction (EDJ); Neo-dermis (ND); Hypodermal Fat (HDF). The 9 images in the 3x3 grid to the right represent progressive regeneration of cutaneous appendages which progressively develop and directly promote the regeneration of full-thickness, hierarchically organized skin.

Comparing Native Skin and Skin Grafts to SkinTE. Stereoscopic Imaging of Comparative Healed Burn Wounds. Comparative images depict a baseline burn wound control (untreated excised burn) on the upper left and untouched native skin to its right. The right sequence of images depicts three rows of excised full-thickness burns treated with: (upper row) full-thickness allograft skin; (middle row) full-thickness autologous skin graft; (bottom row) autologous, homologous SkinTE product. Images were captured at day 54 following treatment. Type of wound treatment is indicated at the left side of the image (allograft, autograft, SkinTE); (white arrow) indicates the margin of interface between the peri-wound native skin and SkinTE; and untreated native skin is indicated at the right side of the image. Sequential images are increasing zoom to identify the margin of linear interface. The images and data presented here are from pre-clinical studies.
 
The following image shows our observations of the wound edge and interface between native skin and SkinTE following regenerative healing.

The following images compare mid-stage healing burn wounds, showing the differences in tissue formation and scar contraction in the control wound as compared to SkinTE-regenerated tissue.
 

Comparing Mid-stage Healing Processes Between Native Wounds and Defects Treated with SkinTE. Stereoscopic Imaging of Comparative Mid-stage Healing Burn Wounds Representing the Different Mechanisms of Tissue Formation Between Scar Contraction in the Control Wound and Full-thickness Skin Regeneration with SkinTE. (Left panels) The native Mid-stage contracting wound represents typical wound contracture and scar formation subsequent to keratinocyte migration from the margin of the wound to form overlying pseudo-epithelium. (Right panels) Expanding SkinTE undergoes regenerative healing from within the wound which permits wound edge margins and propagating SkinTE elements to interact in a manner which promotes integrative full-thickness healing with augmented levels of cross interface angio and vasculogenesis, resulting in significantly less contraction and scar formation. The images and data presented here are from pre-clinical studies.
 
The following images from our preclinical studies show stereoscopic imaging of progressively healing full-thickness burn wounds following the application of SkinTE as compared against an untreated control wound. The image indicates where growth of hair follicles, neo-dermal expansion and neo-glandular development can be seen in the SkinTE-treated wound. Also depicted is a comparison between the contraction of the underlying neo-dermis of an untreated control wound as compared to a SkinTE-treated wound.

The images and data presented here are from pre-clinical studies.
 
In addition to the preclinical SkinTE animal results described above, we have conducted a series of ex vivo preclinical human tissue studies on full-thickness skin and the subsequent final tissue product, SkinTE, in order to identify potential variations between native skin and SkinTE. As described more fully below, in these studies we observed that the methods of harvest, processing and deployment necessary to produce SkinTE did not meaningfully alter viability and regenerative outcome of SkinTE in a treated wound.
 
Tissue Product Viability: In order to assess a variety of cell and tissue functional abilities, including cell viability, we utilized CellInsight CX7 High-Content Screening (HCS) systems in our R&D facilities. This high-content platform is a plate-based confocal imaging system with multi-assay integration to assess both relative and quantitative values within comparative specimens in real-time.
 
The results of our HCS Analytics on the impact of time, temperature and processing of SkinTE under commercial protocol simulation conditions are illustrated below.

High Content Screening Analytics on the Impact of Time, Temperature and Processing of SkinTE™ under Commercial Protocol Simulation Conditions. (a.) Comparative percent relative viability (%RV) before and following standard processing of human full-thickness skin into SkinTE™. %RV of specimen at day 1: Pre-processed substrate (Skin: 89.67 ± SD 1.36); Post-processed product (SkinTE™: 97.11 ± SD 1.78). (b.) Daily %RV of SkinTE™ following post-processing production. Dotted lines indicate associated predictive 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI). Blue line indicates linear predictive correlative regression. Red line indicates semi-logarithmic predictive correlate for time impact on %RV. Correlation (R2: 0.9431); (P value 0.0012). (c.) Delay impact on %RV of skin and SkinTE™. Assumptions considered represent 1.) Late arrival for CGTP manufacturing (D2-D10:2-10 days) of pre-processed incoming full-thickness skin substrate [provider to PolarityTE]; 2.) Late receipt for clinical deployment (D2-D10:2-10 days) of outgoing full-thickness SkinTE™ construct. (d.) High temperature impact on %RV of pre-processed skin and post-processed SkinTE™ after 24 hours of exposure. P-values: (*)0.05; (**)0.001. Study (n) = 120.
 
From the viability studies described above, we observed the following:
 

● | A delay in transport of the harvested, pre-processed full-thickness skin to a PolarityTE facility for processing resulted in minimal changes in cell/tissue viability, and subsequently did not impact regenerative outcomes of skin; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Our cGTP processing to manufacture SkinTE improved the relative cell/tissue viability of the tissue product compared to native skin, a common outcome in allograft skin processing; 
● | A delay in transport of SkinTE following processing back to the provider/patient resulted in minimal changes in cell/tissue viability, and subsequently did not meaningfully impact regenerative outcomes of skin; and 
● | SkinTE maintained higher levels of viability when compared to native skin when exposed to extreme temperature (37°C) during transport, which we believe resulted from the heightened metabolic rate and less oxygen diffusion of full-thickness skin compared to SkinTE. 

 
Human Tissue Expression Profile: In order to assess a variety of cell/tissue expression profiles across genes related to proliferation, cell stress, apoptosis, necrosis and cellular potency, we conducted focused gene tests on the same tissues analyzed in the human tissue viability tests describe above.
 
The results of these human gene expression tests evaluating the impact of time, temperature and processing of SkinTE under commercial protocol simulation conditions are illustrated in the comparative heat maps below.

Relative gene expression (84 gene stem cell array) across the same 10 patient samples under the same specific conditions described above. No statistical significance was found across the replicates.

From these expression profile studies, we observed that:
 

1. | The cGTP methods used to create SkinTE from full-thickness significantly increases the relative viability while reducing pro-apoptosis and pro-necrosis pathways following process manufacturing. This is commonly seen in allograft skin processing as full-thickness skin is thinned to create STSG allograft. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Full-thickness native skin and the autologous-homologous SkinTE tissue product have similar apoptosis and stem cell profiles after 5 days of storage in +4OC crystalloid, suggesting storage over a period of time does not significantly alter biophysical properties or regenerative tissue functional outcomes. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
To date, preliminary results from the initial human clinical applications of SkinTE are correlative with the preclinical results previously observed.
 
OsteoTE
 
We are using our platform technology to develop OsteoTE, our autologous, homologous bone regeneration product. We are designing OsteoTE to utilize the patient’s own bone to target applications for bone repair, reconstruction, replacement, supplementation, and regeneration, including in the long bone (hard, dense bones that provide structure, strength and mobility such as the femur or humerus), craniomaxillofacial, spine, dental, hand, and foot/ankle markets. As with skin, we believe existing treatments for the repair of bone with autologous grafts suffer from significant limitations that we can address with OsteoTE. Below are preliminary images of OsteoTE bone regeneration in a preclinical model of a cranial defect.



Comparative Imaging of OsteoTE in Critical Sized Cranial Defect Model System. (a.) Three-dimensional (3-D) micro computed tomography (micro-CT) native cranial bone displaying pre-defect left parietal and right parietal bones of in vivo model system at timepoint TPDN. (b.)

Abbreviations: Pre-defect Native Timepoint (TPDN): timepoint at which native skull was imaged prior to creation of defect; Defect Native Timepoint (T0): timepoint at which complete (full-thickness) 8 mm critically sized defects were created in parietal skull regions; Post-procedure and intervention at 4 weeks timepoint (TPPI-4WK): timepoint at which 4 weeks have passed since the defects were created +/- treated with intervention.
 
Based on our internal analysis of the Truven Health Analytics Market Scan Research Database, there were approximately 1.9 million addressable orthopedic cases in the United States, including patients suffering from pathology of the femur, radius, ulna, tibia, fibula, and/or humerus. (Copyright © 2017 Truven Health Analytics LLC, an IBM Company, All Rights Reserved). According to Markets and Markets, the global spinal fusion and implant market is expected to reach $17.3 billion by 2021, the global craniomaxillofacial implants market is expected to reach $2.5 billion by 2021, and the dental market is expected to reach $35.4 billion by 2021. We are targeting FDA registration of OsteoTE as a 361 HCT/P by the end of 2018, with commercial launch to take place soon thereafter into each of the markets listed above, in addition to hand and foot/ankle surgery.
 
CartTE
 
With our CartTE product candidate, we are aiming to deliver on a long-imagined product—one that is able to tackle the highly prevalent and debilitating process of osteoarthritis in an attempt to delay or prevent the need for more invasive procedures, such as prosthetic joint replacement and reconstruction. Furthermore, we believe the autologous cartilage construct delivered with CartTE can be utilized in a variety of other applications, including facial reconstruction, facial aesthetics, hand reconstruction, as well as wrist reconstruction.

Osteoarthritis of the hip or knee is estimated to affect 9% of the US population greater than 30 years of age, with costs of treatment totaling $28.6 billion in 2013, according to a review by Grande et al. Market projections by Krutz et al. in 2007 predict that the demand for primary (first-time) total hip and knee replacements will grow to 572,000 and 3.48 million procedures per year by 2030 in the US, respectively. In contrast to the staggering number of patients suffering from osteoarthritis and those pursuing joint replacement, the cartilage repair and regeneration market is only estimated to reach $6.7 billion by 2025, according to a Cartilage Repair/Regeneration Market Analysis report by Grand View Research. This lopsided market, in which cartilage repair and regeneration only captures a small fraction of the patient population that could benefit from articular cartilage regeneration, demonstrates a significant opportunity for our autologous cartilage regeneration product, CartTE, to displace the current trends and standards of care, delivering the regenerative medicine product that has remained elusive until now.


Additional Core “TE” Product Candidates
 
In addition, we intend to continue developing:
 

● | AdipoTE™ to optimize the delivery of autologous fat beyond the capabilities of current fat transfer techniques utilized in procedures on, among others, the breast, buttocks, and face; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | AngioTE™ to address vascular regeneration including microscopic capillary networks all the way up to great vessel replacement; 
● | NeuralTE™ for peripheral nerve injuries of the extremities, as well as for patients with neuromas and/or chronic compression due to joint replacements, migraines, craniofacial injuries, carpal tunnel syndrome, and those who have undergone hernia or abdominal-based procedures; 
● | UroTE™ targeting the delivery of autologous urogenital epithelium and submucosa across a spectrum of diseases and processes, including urethral strictures, urethral creation, bladder reconstruction, and ureter reconstruction; 
● | LiverTE™ to address numerous causes of liver failure, including NASH, fibrosis/cirrhosis, surgical resection of the liver; and 
● | BowelTE™ to deliver an optimized autologous construct to aid in the regeneration of bowel tissue. 

 
We intend to pursue the marketing of each of the product candidates described above via the 361 HCT/P regulatory pathway. If we successfully register and list a product with the FDA using the 361 HCT/P pathway, we plan to deploy a commercialization strategy that is similar to that for SkinTE.
 
Manufacturing
 
We do not separately engineer individual manufacturing processes around each individual tissue product. Rather, we design, develop and adapt our core “TE” products and product candidates to a common manufacturing process which we believe we can utilize across our product pipeline in order to establish fast, effective and cost-efficient systems, enhance our production capacity and expansion strategy, and at the same time potentially reduce our cost of goods sold.
 
We have designed and developed manufacturing processes and quality systems that allow us to receive a specimen, qualify the incoming tissue, and process and manufacture the cell/tissue product proficiently and perform outgoing quality control and quality assurance work prior to expedited return shipping—often during the same day in which a sample is received.
 
We believe that our ultra-clean dual-barrier system, which involves clean room structures containing fully-isolated and air-locked internal ISO 4 containment systems, allows us to move specimen and product in an efficient manner, while maintaining protective quality systems.
 
We have designed our scalable manufacturing process to allow us to be flexible and agile in real-time, while allowing us to shift resources on a daily basis to meet acute production needs as well as respond to larger factors including market forces, multi-facility buildouts, and changes in rapidly evolving technology platforms. In designing our products and systems, we focused both on being able to meet market demand and to scale manufacturing. We believe that we have designed our manufacturing clean dual-barrier system to be efficient in flow processes, column production, and in repeated scalability in local, national and international arenas. In compliance with ISO standards and cGTP/cGMP, our repeating clean manufacturing column systems and fully-isolated and air-locked internal ISO 4 containment units are engineered and designed with scalable production in mind. We currently are expanding our manufacturing to have two separate product manufacturing facilities in the United States, which together comprise over 200,000 ft2, and which we are continuing to build out for our commercially available SkinTE tissue product, and as we plan for the expected registration, listing, and commercial launch of our OsteoTE tissue product.

Suppliers
 
As part of our strategy of ensuring timely delivery of our products, we have avoided relying on any third-party supplier as a sole source vendor for any element of our production process. We aim to maintain multiple back-up suppliers for every item in the chain, with validated lead times allowing us to trigger alternative options at the first sign of constraint.
Reimbursement
 
We understand that coverage and reimbursement by third-party payers is critical for product adoption. As a result, we are focusing significant resources on understanding the coverage and reimbursement landscape for the application of SkinTE. Payment to us for SkinTE, including associated purchasing contracts, is derived from transactions between PolarityTE and those healthcare facilities, medical practices, and physicians utilizing the product for their patients, whereas payer reimbursement generally would be requested and made by the providers and medical practices. We believe our SkinTE customers may be able to use existing billing codes established in the Current Procedural Terminology (“CPT®”), Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (“HCPCS”), or International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Procedural Coding System (“ICD-10-PCS”) code sets, to our products and related services on claims for reimbursement submitted to third-party payers. Because we only recently began selling SkinTE, our first commercial-stage product, the reimbursement landscape for SkinTE is uncertain at this time and we cannot guarantee that our customers will be able to successfully obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement, or whether they can rely on existing billing codes to report SkinTE and/or the related services. For more information on risks associated with coverage and reimbursement, please see “Risk Factors” including but not limited to the information under the heading “Our revenues from our regenerative medicine business will depend upon adequate reimbursement from public and private insurers and health systems.”


Government Regulation 
 
Government authorities and/or laws and regulations in the United States and other countries regulate the manufacturing, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, and promotion of products such as those we have developed and are developing. Any product we are developing must comply with the standards required for the product category under which the product is classified by such government authorities and/or laws.
 
FDA Regulation of Tissue-Based Products
 
The FDA has specific regulations governing human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products, or HCT/Ps. An HCT/P is a product containing or consisting of human cells or tissue intended for transplantation into a human patient. In the United States, HCT/Ps are subject to varying degrees of regulation by the FDA, depending on if they fall solely within the scope of Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (the “PHS Act”) (42 U.S.C. § 264) or if they are regulated as drugs, devices, and/or biological products under Section 351 of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. § 262) and/or the FD&C Act.
 
If an HCT/P meets the criteria for regulation solely under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (so-called “361 HCT/Ps”), no premarket FDA review for safety and effectiveness under a drug, device, or biological product marketing application is required. However, the processor of the tissue is required to register and list its products with the FDA, comply with regulations regarding labeling, record keeping, donor eligibility and screening and testing, process the tissue in accordance with established current Good Tissue Practices (cGTP), and investigate and, in certain circumstances, report adverse events or deviations.
 
To be a 361 HCT/P, a product generally must meet all four of the following criteria:
 

1) | It must be minimally manipulated; 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | It must be intended for homologous use; 
3) | Its manufacture must not involve combination with another article, except for water, crystalloids or a sterilizing, preserving or storage agent, provided the addition of such article does not raise new clinical safety concerns; and 
4) | It must not have a systemic effect and must not be dependent upon the metabolic activity of living cells for its primary function (unless the product is intended for reproductive use, autologous use, or use in a first- or second-degree blood relative). 

 
We believe that SkinTE qualifies as a 361 HCT/P, and believe that our core “TE” products in development (e.g., OsteoTE) will qualify as 361 HCT/Ps. Other products we are developing are being evaluated with respect to regulatory classification, and we will prepare for any pathway of manufacturing or regulation that is required.
 
All establishments that manufacture 361 HCT/Ps must register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (“CBER”) within five days after commencing operations. In addition, establishments are required to update their registration annually in December or within 30 days of certain changes, and submit changes in HCT/P listing at the time of or within six months of such change. Establishments that manufacture 361 HCT/Ps will know that they are registered in compliance with 21 C.F.R. § 1271.10(a) when they receive a validated form with the registration number (“FEI#”) after submitting the Form FDA 3356 (registration form). Current Good Tissue Practice (“cGTP”) requirements govern, as may be applicable, the facilities, controls, and methods used in the manufacture of HCT/Ps, including without limitation, recovery, donor screening, donor testing, processing, storage, labeling, packaging, and distribution of 361 HCT/Ps. FDA inspection and enforcement with respect to establishments described in 21 C.F.R. § 1271 includes inspections conducted, as deemed necessary, to determine compliance with the applicable provisions and may include, but is not limited to, an assessment of the establishment’s facilities, equipment, finished and unfinished materials, containers, processes, HCT/Ps, procedures, labeling, records, files, papers, and controls required to be maintained under 21 C.F.R. § 1271. Such inspections can occur at any time with or without written notice at such frequency as is determined by the FDA in its sole discretion.

If we fail to comply with the FDA regulations and laws applicable to our operation or tissue products, the FDA could take enforcement action, including, without limitation, pursuing any of the following sanctions, among others:
 

● | Untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, product seizures, and civil penalties; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Orders for product retention, recall, and/or destruction; 
● | Operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of operations; 
● | Refusing any requests for product clearance or approval; 
● | Withdrawing or suspending any applications for approval or approvals already granted; and/or 
● | Criminal prosecution. 

 
For more information on this regulatory risk, please see the discussion below, “Risk Factors,” including but not limited to the information under the heading, “Risks Related to Registration and/or Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates and Other Government Regulations.”
 
Fraud, Abuse and False Claims
 
We are directly and indirectly subject to various federal and state laws governing relationships with healthcare providers and other potential referral sources for our products pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback, false claims, and similar laws. In addition, federal and state laws are also sometimes open to interpretation. The Company could potentially face legal risks if our interpretation differs from those of enforcement authorities. Further, from time to time the Company may find itself at a competitive disadvantage if the Company’s interpretation differs from that of its competitors.
 
In particular, the federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration (in cash or in kind), directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for, or recommending of, a good or service for which payment may be made in whole or part under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. In implementing the statute, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“OIG”) has issued a series of regulations, known as the “safe harbors.” These safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all their applicable requirements are met, except certain remuneration and remunerative arrangements from violating the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable element of a safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by Government enforcement authorities, such as the OIG. Many states have laws similar to the federal law.
 
Also, the federal civil False Claims Act (“FCA”) imposes civil liability on any person or entity that submits, or causes the submission of, a false or fraudulent claim to the U.S. government. Damages under the FCA can be significant, and consist of the imposition of fines and penalties. The FCA also allows a private individual or entity (i.e., a whistleblower) with knowledge of past or present fraud against the federal government to sue on behalf of the government and to be paid a portion of the government’s recovery, which can include both civil penalties and up to three times the amount of the government’s damages (usually the amount reimbursed by federal healthcare programs). The DOJ takes the position that the marketing and promotional practices of life sciences product manufacturers, including the off-label promotion of products, the provision of inaccurate or misleading reimbursement guidance, or the payment of prohibited kickbacks, may cause the submission of improper claims to federal and state healthcare entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid by health care providers that use the manufacturer’s products, which results in a violation of the FCA. In certain cases, manufacturers have entered into criminal and civil settlements with the federal government under which they entered into plea agreements, paid substantial monetary amounts and entered into corporate integrity agreements (“CIAs”) that require, among other things, substantial government oversight, as well as reporting and remedial actions going forward


If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be subject to enforcement actions, including but not limited to:
 

● | Multi-year investigations by federal and state governments; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Criminal and civil fines and penalties; 
● | Obligations under settlement agreements, such as CIAs or Deferred Prosecution Agreements; and/or 
● | Exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs. 

 
For more information on this fraud, abuse, and false claim risk, please see the discussion below, “Risk Factors,” including but not limited to the information under the heading, “We are subject to numerous federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, and a failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete in the marketplace.”
 
Environmental Matters
 
Our tissue preservation activities generate some chemical and biomedical wastes, consisting primarily of diluted alcohols and acids, and human and animal pathological and biological wastes, including human and animal tissue and body fluids removed during laboratory procedures. The chemical and biomedical wastes generated by our tissue processing operations are placed in appropriately constructed and labeled containers and are segregated from other wastes. We contract with third parties for transport, treatment, and disposal of waste. We strive to remain compliant with applicable laws and regulations promulgated by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and similar state agencies.

Reimbursement
 
In the United States, demand for access to any medical product will depend in large part on both the availability and the amount of reimbursement from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid), and commercial healthcare insurers, including managed care organizations and other private health plans. Third-party payers have complex rules and requirements for coverage and reimbursement of healthcare products and services. Even the applications to such third-party payers to be eligible for reimbursement for product or services are complex and can be lengthy and time consuming. For new technologies coming to market, these payers are increasingly examining the clinical evidence supporting medical necessity and cost effectiveness decisions in addition to safety and efficacy, which can result in barriers to early coverage reimbursement, or denial of coverage and reimbursement altogether. Accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the availability of coverage and reimbursement status for new medical products. If third-party payer reimbursement is unavailable to our customer hospitals, physicians, and providers, our sales may be limited and we may not be able to realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development.
 
Payers often set payment rates depending on the site of service and many use the Medicare program as a benchmark for their own payment methodologies. In the hospital inpatient setting, Medicare payment generally is set at pre-determined rates for all products and services provided during a particular patient stay, and is based on such factors as the patient diagnosis, procedures performed, patient age, and complications. In the physician office or clinic setting, Medicare payment generally is based on a fee schedule, with payment rates set for each procedure performed and product used, although the schedule may in some instance bundle the product into the payment for the procedure. In some outpatient settings, such as in the case of the hospital outpatient clinic setting, Medicare payment rates generally are premised on classifications of services that have similar clinical characteristics and similar costs.


In order to better track utilization, we have applied for a product-specific billing code for SkinTE. Our application was submitted to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), the agency that administers the Medicare program and establishes new codes under the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (“HCPCS”) code set. If our application for a new HCPCS code is successful, we expect that the code could go into effect as early as the 2019 calendar year. In the interim, we believe SkinTE used in the office or clinic setting may be reported using an existing “not otherwise specified” HCPCS code.
 
Reimbursement policies depend in part on legislation designed to regulate the healthcare industry and federal and state governments continue to propose and pass new healthcare legislation and government agencies revise or change their regulations and policies from time to time. We cannot predict whether or how such reform measures and policy changes would affect reimbursement rates and demand for our products.

Patient Privacy 
 
HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, mandates, among other things, the adoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, which require the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. Since we do not submit claims electronically to payers, we are not a covered entity under HIPAA; however, at present, it is unclear if we would be considered a business associate subject to HIPAA based on our business activities and service offerings. Because our products use autologous tissue sources that are tracked and reapplied to the same individual patient from which the tissue was harvested, our business maintains substantial amounts of patient identifiable health information. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities and business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties.
Transparency Laws 
 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, through the enactment of the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, imposes, among other things, new annual reporting requirements for covered manufacturers for certain payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. We do not believe that we are a covered manufacturer under the Sunshine Act because our products are neither regulated as pharmaceuticals, biologics, nor medical devices by FDA, and 361 HCT/P autologous tissue sources are not expressly addressed by this law.
Intellectual Property
 
We do not own any granted patents. We have three pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications relating to methods for development and use of minimally polarized function cell micro-aggregate units in tissue applications using LGR4, LGR5 and LGR6 expressing epithelial stem cells. Each of these applications claims priority to a U.S. provisional application filed on December 2, 2014. We have one PCT International Patent Application and national phase applications have been entered in OAIP, ARIPO, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Eurasia, Europe, Great Britain, Israel, India, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, Ukraine, Vietnam.
 
In striving to protect and enhance proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, we currently rely heavily on trade secrets relating to our proprietary technology platform and on know-how. We enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
 
Our objective is to continue to expand our portfolio of patents and patent applications, in conjunction with our trade secrets and know-how, in order to further protect our regenerative medicine platform and derivative technologies, as well as the manufacturing and deployment processes of those technologies.
 
Competition
 
The wound care industry, including the regenerative medicine industry, is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. To our knowledge, SkinTE is the only fully autologous, homologous skin regeneration product available for the treatment of wounds and functional losses of the skin of human patients. We face competition from providers of FTSGs and STSGs, as well as other companies developing and selling skin substitutes and other regenerative medicine products. We also face substantial competition from academic research institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions.
 
We are aware of several companies focused on the wound market, including Integra LifeSciences, Wright Medical Group, MiMedx, Osiris, Organogenesis, Allosource, MTF and Vericel. Any advances in regenerative medicine by a competitor may be used to develop therapies competing against SkinTE or one of our product candidates.
 
Many of our current or potential competitors, either alone or with their collaboration partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.

Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours (if required), which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers.

Legal Proceedings
 
On February 26, 2015, a complaint for patent infringement was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas by Richard Baker, an individual residing in Australia, against Microsoft, Nintendo, Majesco Entertainment Company (“Majesco DE”), and a number of other game publisher defendants. The complaint alleged that the Zumba Fitness Kinect game infringed plaintiff’s patents in motion tracking technology. The plaintiff is representing himself pro se in the litigation and is seeking monetary damages in the amount of $1.3 million. The case was subsequently transferred to the Western District of Washington. On June 16, 2017, final judgment was entered in favor of the defendants. The plaintiff has appealed that decision to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The appeal is currently pending. On June 23, 2017, as part of a purchase agreement, liabilities and claims relating to this litigation were transferred to Zift Interactive LLC.
