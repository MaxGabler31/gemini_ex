ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a cloud-based technology platform and distributor of affordable health and life insurance products that meet the demands and needs of our consumers. These products include individual and family health insurance plans (“IFP”) which include short-term medical (“STM”) insurance plans and health benefit insurance plans ("HBIP"). We also offer supplemental products which include a variety of additional insurance and non-insurance products that are frequently purchased as supplements to IFPs. We work in concert with carriers to help them develop products for our target markets. We are not an insurer and do not process or pay claims. The health insurance products we help develop are underwritten by third-party insurance carriers with whom we have no affiliation apart from our contractual relationships. We assume no underwriting, insurance or reimbursement risk.
We market products to individuals through e-commerce and other licensed-agent distribution channels, consisting of both our internal distribution network, and an external distribution network of independently owned and operated distributors. For a majority of the products we offer, we collect money and manage the members’ non-claims related experience for the IFPs, non-insurance products, and supplemental products.
STM plans feature a streamlined underwriting process offering immediate purchase options. STM plans offer qualifying individuals, under the age of 65, insurance benefits for fixed durations. STM plans generally provide health insurance coverage with an open-provider network and a wide range of deductible and copay levels.
On August 3, 2018, the Departments of Health and Human Services, Treasury, and Labor ("Departments") published a rule that changed the way that STM is regulated. The new rule, that went into effect October 2, 2018, extended the maximum duration of these plans from three months to less than 12 months, allowing for renewal or extensions for up to 36 months, subject to each state’s insurance laws. The new rule includes updated notice requirements. The Departments noted in the new rule that issuers and brokers of STM will benefit from its changes and we believe that the new rule makes STM a more practical and flexible form of coverage than it had been previously. Additionally, as of January 1, 2019, the tax penalty for individuals not maintaining minimum essential coverage under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”) is reduced to $0. We believe eliminating the tax penalty removes a barrier that may have prevented certain consumers from previously purchasing STM.
HBIPs are insurance products which include both guaranteed-issue and underwritten plans that pay fixed cash benefits, and additional benefits for certain plans, for covered procedures and services for individuals under the age of 65. These highly customizable products are generally on an open-provider network without copayments or deductibles and do not have defined policy term lengths.
We also provide numerous affordable supplemental insurance and non-insurance products, including life insurance policies, dental plans, vision plans, cancer/critical illness plans, deductible and gap protection plans, and pharmacy benefit cards, that are frequently purchased as supplements to IFPs. These supplemental insurance and non-insurance products typically do not have defined policy term lengths and are not affected by regulation relating to maximum duration or renewal of STM products.
Our scalable, proprietary, and web-based technology platform facilitates the enrollment process for our distribution. Members can tailor product selections to meet their personal insurance and budget needs, buy policies and print policy documents and identification cards in real-time. Our technology platform uses online applications, some with health questionnaires, to provide an immediate "accept or reject" decision using rules and criteria determined by the carriers for the products we offer. Once an application is accepted, individuals can use our automated payment system to complete the enrollment process and obtain instant electronic access to their policy fulfillment documents, including the insurance policy, benefits schedule and identification cards. We receive credit card and Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) payments directly from members at the time of sale. Our technology platform provides scalability and, on a per-policy-basis, reduces the costs associated with marketing, selling, and other obligations. Our online enrollment process allows us to aggregate and analyze consumer data and purchasing habits to track market trends and drive product innovation.

We manage member relations via email, through our online member portal, which is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and via telephone. In 2018, the Company launched MyBenefitsKeeper® ("MBK"), the next generation online platform to simplify and improve the member experience by providing members a "one-stop-shop" to manage benefits and purchase products. With MBK members have the ability to:

• purchase products from web application; | • access identification cards from application; 
• view and download documents; | • chat with customer service; 
• get notifications to reapply, if applicable; | • receive answers to frequently asked questions;
• find and call a doctor from the app; | • change billing or view history. 

Our sales of IFP and supplemental products focus on the under-penetrated segment of the U.S. population who are uninsured or underinsured. These respective classes include, but are not limited to, individuals not covered by employer-sponsored insurance plans, such as the self-employed, small business owners and their employees, individuals who are unable to afford the rising cost of individual major medical ("IMM") premiums, underserved “gap populations” that require insurance due to changes caused by life events, such as new graduates, divorcees, early retirees, military discharges, the unemployed, part-time and seasonal employees and potential members seeking health insurance between the open enrollment periods created under the PPACA.
We also provide consumers with access to health insurance information search and comparison technology through our website, HealthPocket.com. This website allows consumers to easily and clearly compare and rank health insurance plans available for an individual, family or small business, empowering consumers to make informed health plan decisions.
The Company also has a direct-to-consumer insurance website that allows consumers to research health insurance trends, comparison shop, and purchase IFPs under the AgileHealthInsurance® brand. AgileHealthInsurance.com (“Agile”) is one of the few internet sites dedicated to helping consumers understand the benefits of STM and HBIP.
We are a Delaware corporation, and we were incorporated on October 26, 2012.
Health Insurance Industry and Market Opportunity

In recent years there have been major changes to health insurance laws. Some of these changes were implemented under PPACA and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (“HCERA”), which we collectively refer to as “Healthcare Reform.” Healthcare Reform imposed requirements on a broad segment of the population, including, through December 31, 2018, a mandate that most individuals carry health insurance or face tax penalties (the “Individual Mandate Penalty”); tax credits and subsidies for the policy premium costs of IMM plans for qualifying individuals; the establishment of a mandatory set of ten Essential Health Benefits for IMM plans; a mandate that certain employers offer most of their employees group health insurance coverage or face tax penalties; prohibitions against insurance companies that offer IMM insurance plans using pre-existing health conditions as a reason to deny an application for health insurance; and medical loss ratio (“MLR”) requirements that require each health insurance carrier to spend a certain percentage of its IMM premium revenue on reimbursement for clinical services and activities that improve healthcare quality.

Healthcare Reform has, among other things, contributed to a dramatic increase in the unsubsidized average premium for IMM plans, caused carriers to narrow networks available under IMM plans and restricted the availability (except in limited circumstances) of open enrollment periods. Our IFP plans’ affordable premium prices, wide acceptance among healthcare providers and year-round availability provide value to the consumer that may not be available under PPACA health plans. Our IFP products are not subject to narrow networks and are exempt from the minimum MLR thresholds, pre-existing condition provision restrictions, and Essential Health Benefits requirements under Healthcare Reform, allowing us to provide health insurance products with average premium cost typically more affordable than unsubsidized PPACA health plans. We believe that these dynamics in the health insurance industry present an opportunity to increase our market share in the individual health insurance market.
Ongoing changes in the health insurance industry have expanded and reshaped our target market and we believe the market will continue to evolve. We intend to continue to pursue opportunities to help meet consumers’ needs for affordable health insurance. We believe that our technology platform, product focus, and industry expertise will allow us to gain an increasing share of this dynamic market.

Our Strategy

Our objective is to leverage our technology to efficiently deliver innovative affordable health insurance solutions to consumers combined with an outstanding member experience. Our principal strategies to meet this objective are:

• | Data-Driven Product Innovation. We utilize vast amounts of data to constantly enhance and diversify our product portfolio to provide consumers with more robust choices for their health insurance needs.


• | Outstanding Member Experience. We have invested significant resources and strive to be market leaders in our member services leveraging our new member portal, MBK.


• | Maximize E-commerce Opportunity. We believe that e-commerce is an efficient and compliant distribution channel that we see as a continued investment opportunity. We will continue to expand our direct to consumer web presence with continued focus on its profitability.


• | Expand Compliant Distribution. The extensive traditional distribution network we access includes independently owned and operated internet distributors and licensed-agent call centers to sell insurance products. The technology platform and other support that we provide, and the terms on which we trade with our distribution network, motivates distributors to work with us. We provide the distributors with training, audit and other support, and monitoring, and we continue to improve our distributor compliance. By offering highly competitive terms, we believe we will continue to attract new distributors as the insurance marketplace continues to evolve, and we intend to continue to grow our relationships with traditional distributors.


• | Increased Consumer Awareness. We believe that increased consumer awareness will enhance consumer choice and increase understanding of products that are available in the health insurance market. Through our enhanced member experience, targeted marketing campaigns, and collaboration with regulatory and government entities, we will continue to drive awareness and education in the market.


• | Focus on Scalability and Leverage. We believe that continuing to invest in technology will improve our scalability and on a per-policy basis, reduces the costs associated with marketing, selling, and other obligations.


• | Strategic Acquisitions and Other Transactions. We may acquire, or invest in, companies, products or technologies that complement our current products, enhance our market coverage, technical capabilities or production capacity, or offer growth opportunities.

Our Competitive Strengths

Proprietary, Web-Based, Direct-to-Consumer Technology Platforms
Our business is based on a unique and scalable proprietary, web-based technology platform. Our technology represents a distinct competitive advantage as it reduces the need for member support agents, the time associated with quoting, billing, underwriting, fulfillment, sale and marketing, and provides significant operating leverage as we add members and product offerings.
Our Core Technology

Our core technology platform processes and combines data that is used in insurance plan and product design, sales and distribution of our products, member services, business and regulatory compliance, and general reporting. Key elements of our core technology platform include:

• | Quote-Buy-Print. Individuals access our technology platform through our distributors and can quote products and buy and print their policy documents and identification cards at anytime.


• | Automated Underwriting. The entire underwriting process is handled by our core technology platform through the use of health questionnaires approved by the insurance carriers. Because our IFP products are largely targeted to individuals who do not have significant pre-existing conditions and our HBIP are guaranteed-issue, we do not have a traditional underwriting department. Underwriting for IFP products is an immediate accept or reject decision based on a prospective member’s answers to an abbreviated online health-related questionnaire.

• | Multiple Value-Added Products. Consumers are able to complement our IFP offerings with supplemental products such as pharmacy benefit cards, dental plans, vision plans, and cancer/critical illness plans. Our technology platform makes it possible for us to instantly offer these bundled products to fit member needs.


• | Turn-Key Solution. Our technology platform is a turnkey solution, allowing distributors to tailor their offering to meet member needs and can be customized to enhance the experience of an affinity group or employer.


• | Payment. Through our online platform, we receive credit card and ACH payments directly from members at the time of sale and automatically process recurring payments.


• | Member Services. Members have the ability to log-in and change payment information and print new identification cards, all without the need of a customer service representative.


• | Verification and Compliance. We have incorporated eSign technology from Adobe Sign, part of Adobe Inc., on our platform to streamline compliance by providing real-time verification to our members’ mobile devices. This technology has allowed us to further automate our compliance program, enhancing quality while minimizing overhead.


• | Integration with AgileHealthInsurance®. Our core technology platform integrates directly with our direct to consumer AgileHealthInsurance.com platform.

MyBenefitsKeeper® (“MBK”)
The addition of MBK has further enhanced our technological advantage by simplifying and improving the member experience by allowing members to manage benefits and purchase products via our online platform.
Established Long-Standing Insurance Carrier Relationships

One of our core strengths is long-standing relationships with some of the leading insurance carriers in the United States. This enables us to offer a broad range of IFP and supplemental products on our technology platform. We have entered into written contracts with each of these carriers pursuant to which we sell the carriers’ health plans and supplemental products and manage the member experience in exchange for the payment of commissions that vary by carrier and by plan.

Our management team has developed close relationships with the senior management teams of many of our insurance carriers. We believe that the nature of our relationships with our insurance carriers, combined with our product knowledge and technology platform, allow us to provide value-added products to our members. Our relationships with highly rated insurance carriers include Federal Insurance Company ("CHUBB"), AXIS Insurance Company, Everest Reinsurance Company, Standard Life and Accident Insurance Company, Aspen Insurance, and AFLAC, among others. We also continue to develop relationships with new carriers to help us expand our product portfolio.

Long-Term Relationships with Licensed Insurance Distributors

Our scalable technology platforms, our relationships with multiple insurance carriers, our focus on compliance, and our product expertise make us a partner of choice for our distributors. We leverage our long-standing insurance carrier relationships to access highly competitive products which are desirable to distributors. Our management team has built a broad distribution network and continuously adds new compliant third-party licensed independent distributors.
Seasoned Management Team

Our management team has substantial experience and long-standing relationships developed over long periods in the insurance and risk management industries. Our management team draws on its broad industry experience to identify opportunities to expand our business and collaborate with insurance carriers and distributors to help develop products and respond to market trends.
Sales and Marketing

Our sales and marketing initiatives primarily consist of hiring experienced sales professionals to strengthen our relationships with existing and potential third-party distributors, implementing marketing campaigns, attending industry-sponsored events, and direct-to-consumer via the internet.

We derive a significant portion of our AgileHealthInsurance® website traffic through contractual marketing relationships with online businesses. These marketing relationships include online advertisers, content providers and insurance lead aggregators. We also attract website traffic from consumers who search for health insurance through internet search engines. A critical factor in attracting consumers to our website is whether we are prominently displayed in response to internet searches broadly relating to health insurance topics. As part of this marketing strategy, we employ both algorithmic listings and paid advertisements to attract consumers to our website.

Seasonality

The marketing of IFP and supplemental plans is subject to seasonal fluctuations that we believe have been largely impacted by Healthcare Reform. Beginning in 2013, under Healthcare Reform, open enrollment periods were created. During these periods, individuals can enroll in individual insurance policies. During the times that these open enrollment periods are closed, we have the capability to sell our IFP products as health insurance to consumers who are unable to enroll in plans under PPACA. During the six open enrollment periods to date, we have experienced significant fluctuations in sales. Other seasonality trends may develop and the existing seasonality and consumer behavior that we have experienced to date may change as legislative and/or regulatory changes to Healthcare Reform continue and our markets change.
Competition

The market for selling insurance products is highly competitive and the sale of health insurance over the internet is rapidly evolving. We compete with individuals and entities that offer and sell health insurance products utilizing traditional distribution channels, as well as the internet. Our current and potential competitors include:

Traditional Local Insurance Agents. There are thousands of local insurance agents across the United States who sell health insurance products in their communities. We believe that the vast majority of these local agents offer health insurance without significantly utilizing the internet or technology other than simple desktop applications such as word processing and spreadsheet programs. Some traditional insurance agents, however, utilize general agents that offer online quoting services and other tools to obtain quotes from multiple carriers and prepare electronic benefit proposals to share with their potential members. These general agents typically offer their services only for the small and mid-sized group markets (not the individual and family markets) and operate in only a limited geographic region. Additionally, some local agents use the internet to acquire new consumer referrals from companies that have expertise in internet marketing. These “lead aggregator” companies utilize keyword search, primarily paid keyword search listings on various online search engines and other forms of internet advertising, to drive internet traffic to the lead aggregator’s website. The lead aggregator then collects and sells consumer information to agents and, to a lesser extent, to carriers, both of whom endeavor to close the referrals through traditional offline sales methods.

Health Insurance Carriers’ “Direct-to-Member” Sales. Some carriers directly market and sell their plans and products to consumers through call centers and their own websites. Although we offer health insurance plans and products for many of these carriers, they also can compete with us by offering their products directly to consumers. Most of these carriers have brand recognition, extensive marketing budgets and significant financial resources to influence consumer preferences for searching and buying health insurance online. 

Online Agents. There are a number of agents that operate websites and provide an online shopping experience for consumers interested in purchasing health insurance (e.g., online quoting of health insurance product prices). Some online agents also sell non-health insurance products such as auto insurance, life insurance and home insurance.

Exchanges. Government and privately-administered Exchanges have been established under Healthcare Reform where individuals can select and purchase health insurance plans.

National Insurance Brokers. Although insurance brokers have traditionally not focused on the affordable IFP market, they may enter our markets and could compete with us. These large agencies may have relationships with some large carrier companies, could be licensed nationwide and have large customer bases and significant financial, technical and marketing resources to compete in our markets. Some of these large agencies and financial services companies have worked with us in order to offer our services to their customer and member bases.

We believe the principal factors that determine our competitive advantage in the online distribution of health insurance include the following:

• | affordable, value added IFP, supplemental, and related products;

9


• | proprietary, web-based technology platform;


• | strength of carrier relationships and depth of technology integration with carriers;


• | data-driven product design;


• | highly automated compliance program;


• | strength of distribution relationships; and


• | seasoned management.

 Intellectual Property

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology, and to operate our business without infringing or violating the intellectual property or proprietary rights of others. We rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, domain names, trade secrets, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights (including confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements), including our proprietary technology. However, these intellectual property rights may not prevent others from creating a competitive online platform or otherwise competing with us.

For more information see Item 1A. Risk Factors—“We rely on third-party vendors to develop, host, maintain, support and enhance our technology platform” and Item 1A. Risk Factors—“Our failure to obtain, maintain and enforce the intellectual property rights on which our business depends could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.”

Healthcare Laws and Regulations

Our business is subject to extensive, complex and rapidly changing federal and state laws and regulations. Various federal and state agencies have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce healthcare laws. While we believe we comply in all material respects with applicable healthcare laws and regulations, these regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and interpretation of existing laws and regulations may change. Federal and state legislatures also may enact various legislative proposals that could materially impact certain aspects of our business. The following are summaries of key federal and state laws and regulations that impact our operations:
Healthcare Reform

In March 2010, Healthcare Reform was signed into law. Healthcare Reform contains provisions that have changed and will continue to change the health insurance industry in substantial ways. For example, Healthcare Reform includes a mandate requiring individuals to be insured or face tax penalties for years ending on or before December 31, 2018; a mandate that employers with over 50 employees offer their employees group health insurance coverage or face tax penalties; prohibitions against insurance companies that offer IMM plans using pre-existing health conditions as a reason to deny an application for health insurance; MLR requirements that require each health insurance carrier to spend a certain percentage of their premium revenue on reimbursement for clinical services and activities that improve healthcare quality; establishment of Exchanges to facilitate access to, and the purchase of, health insurance; and subsidies and cost-sharing credits to make health insurance more affordable for those below certain income levels.

Healthcare Reform amended various provisions in many federal laws, including the Internal Revenue Code, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Public Health Services Act. Healthcare Reform has been implemented by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Labor and the Department of Treasury. Many of the PPACA regulations became effective on or before January 1, 2014, but regulatory changes continue. Through these regulations, the federal government and its implementing agencies may regulate or otherwise impose restrictions upon all types of health insurance including the IFP products that we sell. Although the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Healthcare Reform’s mandate requiring individuals to purchase health insurance in 2012, the Tax Act has eliminated the Individual Mandate Penalty for individuals who do not purchase such health insurance beginning in 2019, and there is continuing uncertainty about whether other parts of Healthcare Reform or PPACA regulations will remain in effect or be further amended, with the possibility of future litigation with respect to certain provisions as well as legislative efforts to repeal and defund portions of Healthcare Reform or Healthcare Reform in its entirety. We cannot predict the outcome of any future legislation or litigation related to Healthcare Reform. As described under “Item 1. Business—Health Insurance Industry and Market Opportunity,” Healthcare Reform has resulted in profound changes to the individual health insurance market and our business, and we expect these changes to continue.

Short-Term, Limited-Duration Insurance: Final Rule

On October 12, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order promoting healthcare choice and competition across the United States which called for expanded availability of short-term, limited-duration insurance, such as STM, to consider allowing such insurance to cover longer periods and be renewed by the consumer. On August 3, 2018, the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and Treasury, published the rule that changed the way that short-term, limited duration insurance coverage is regulated. The new rule, effective October 2, 2018, extended the maximum duration of these plans from three months to less than 12 months, allowing for renewal or extensions for up to 36 months, subject to state law. The new rule includes updated notice requirements and makes STM a more practical and flexible form of coverage than it had been previously. Additionally, as of January 1, 2019, the tax penalty for individuals not maintaining minimum essential coverage is reduced to $0. This removes another obstacle that may have prevented certain consumers from previously purchasing STM.

Anti-Kickback Laws

In the United States, there are federal and state anti-kickback laws that generally prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration given with the intent to induce the referral of patients or other health-care program related business. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it unlawful for individuals or entities to knowingly and willfully offer, pay, solicit, or receive any remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or reward referrals of items or services reimbursable by a federal healthcare program. Where remuneration is paid purposefully to induce or reward referrals of items or services payable by a federal healthcare program, the Anti-Kickback Statue is violated. For purposes of the Anti-Kickback Statute, “remuneration” includes the transfer of anything of value, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind. There are also state law corollaries to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment, and possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs.

Federal Civil False Claims Act and State False Claims Laws

The federal civil False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The “qui tam” or “whistleblower” provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. There are also state law corollaries to the federal False Claims Act. Our future activities relating to the manner in which we sell and market our services may be subject to scrutiny under these laws.
HIPAA, Privacy Laws and Data Security Regulations

By processing data on behalf of our clients and members, we are subject to specific compliance obligations under privacy and data security-related laws, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (the “HITECH Act”), and related state laws. We are also subject to federal and state security breach notification laws, as well as state laws regulating the processing of protected personal information, including laws governing the collection, use and disclosure of social security numbers and related identifiers.

The regulations that implement HIPAA and the HITECH Act establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of individually identifiable health information maintained or transmitted by healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, all of which are referred to as “covered entities,” and their “business associates” (which includes anyone who performs a service on behalf of a covered entity involving the use or disclosure of protected health information and is not a member of the covered entity’s workforce). Our carrier companies’ and our clients’ health plans generally will be covered entities, and as their business associate, we may be asked to contractually comply with certain aspects of these standards by entering into requisite business associate agreements with the covered entities. Under the HIPAA implementing regulations, business associates and covered entities can each be held individually responsible for privacy and data security breaches.

11

State Privacy Laws
In addition to federal regulations issued under HIPAA, some states have enacted privacy and security statutes or regulations, or State Privacy Laws, that govern the use and disclosure of a person’s medical information or records and, in some cases, are more stringent than those issued under HIPAA. These State Privacy Laws include regulation of health insurance providers and agents, regulation of organizations that perform certain administrative functions such as utilization review or third-party administration, issuance of notices of privacy practices, and reporting and providing access to law enforcement authorities. In those cases, it may be necessary to modify our operations and procedures to comply with these more stringent State Privacy Laws. If we fail to comply with applicable State Privacy Laws, we could be subject to additional sanctions.
Consumer Protection Laws

Federal and state consumer protection laws are being increasingly enforced by the United States Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”), and the various states’ attorneys general to regulate the collection, use, storage and disclosure of personal or patient information, through websites or otherwise, and to regulate the presentation of website content and to regulate direct marketing, including telemarketing and telephonic communication. Courts may also adopt the standards for fair information practices promulgated by the FTC, concerning consumer notice, choice, security and access.

As part of the payment-related aspects of our business, we may also undertake security-related obligations arising out of the USA Patriot Act, Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Payment Card Industry guidelines applicable to card systems. These requirements generally require safeguards for the protection of personal and other payment related information.

State Insurance Laws

Some of the states in which we operate have laws prohibiting unlicensed persons or business entities, including corporations, from making certain direct and indirect payments or fee-splitting arrangements with licensed insurance agents and brokers. Possible sanctions for violation of these restrictions include loss of license and civil penalties. These statutes vary from state to state, are often vague, and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies.

State insurance laws also require us to maintain any combination of insurance agency, broker, and third-party administrator licenses in each state in which we transact health insurance business and adhere to sales, documentation and administration practices specific to that state. Where there is any ambiguity or uncertainty in statutes as to whether we require a particular type of license in a state, we seek to obtain that license. In addition, each of our employees who solicits, negotiates, sells or transacts health insurance business for us must maintain an individual insurance agent or broker license in one or more states. Because we transact business in the majority of states, compliance with health insurance-related laws, rules and regulations is difficult and imposes significant costs on our business.

In certain states, some of our products may only be available as a group association plan. In these states, members must enroll in group programs or associations in order to access certain of our insurance products, benefits and services. We have entered into relationships with such associations in order to provide individuals access to our products. For example, we have an agreement with Med-Sense Guaranteed Association (“Med-Sense”), a non-profit association that provides membership benefits to individuals and gives members access to certain of our products. Under the agreement, we primarily market membership in the association and collect certain fees and dues on its behalf. In return, we have sole access to its membership list, Med-Sense exclusively endorses the insurance products that we offer, and we receive compensation for our services. Our agreement with Med-Sense is automatically renewable for one-year terms, unless terminated on 120 days written notice by either party. The agreement is also terminable on 15 days’ written notice by either party under certain circumstances, such as in the case of a breach.

Employees

As of December 31, 2018, we had 222 employees. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our employee relations to be good. None of our employees are represented by a labor union.
