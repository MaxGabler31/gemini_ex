ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General Information

EMERALD DATA INC. was incorporated in the State of Nevada as a for-profit company on August 15, 2014 and established a fiscal year end of August 31.

Prior to takeover by new management on July 5, 2017, we were a development-stage company formed to develop and distribute our product to the furniture industry. We have had limited operations, but had executed contracts with J and K Industrial Limited, LINHAI FEELWAY LEISURE PRODUCTS CO., Magic Style International Co., Ltd., Ningbo Grand Ocean International CO., Ltd., NINGBO JIADA LEISURE PRODUCTS CO., LTD. and Patio Design. These companies were engaged as independent contractors for the specific purpose of developing, manufacturing and supplying products for us. We had purchased products from LINHAI FEELWAY LEISURE PRODUCTS CO. for the sales revenue generated during past periods. Our sales to date had been to one customer, Furniture Direct. 

Then on July 5th, 2017, Janis Kalnins, the Company's Director and CEO, completed a transaction with New Million Global Holdings Limited, by which they acquired 3,310,000 shares of common stocks, representing 66% ownership of the Company. New Million Global Holdings Limited paid $255,623.00 in cash. On the same date, Mr. Kalnins resigned from his official positions as Director and CEO of the Company, and again on the same day the shareholders of the Corporation voted Mr. Michael Veng Kun Lun as Director, and CEO, and Mr. Teck Sion Lim as Director and CFO.

Products

Before July 5, 2017, EMERALD DATA INC. executed contracts with J and K Industrial Limited, LINHAI FEELWAY LEISURE PRODUCTS CO., Magic Style International Co., Ltd., Ningbo Grand Ocean International CO., Ltd., NINGBO JIADA LEISURE PRODUCTS CO., LTD. and Patio Design. All are manufacturing companies having principal offices in China. These companies were engaged as independent contractors for the specific purpose of developing, manufacturing and supplying products for us. EMERALD DATA INC. was then to distribute these Outdoor, Wicker, Patio, Garden Rattan Furniture to our clients “off the shelf” to very popular outdoors in restaurants, resorts, private homes. Later we were going to design, develop and produce our own furniture lines according to our market research. 

After new management took control on July 5, 2017, they made the decision to change the business model to food blogging. Although initially growing at a fast rate, we were not able to convert the growth momentum into a revenue stream. Within weeks we had more than 800 subscribers to several food blogs, but realized that viable sponsorship income could not be derived from covering low end Hong Kong and Macao foods places.

We then adjusted the strategy in early 2018 to cover fine dining bars, restaurants and wine places in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, as research had shown relevant sophisticated buying power and thus higher sponsorship potential from high-end restaurants there. During our 6-months roll-out period we realized increased interest from potential business clients to pay for block chain and utility token related marketing offers and promotional services, leading us to investing into block chain technology research and development of the respective relationships to introduce new promotional methods for restaurants and bars to use token and block chain technology to promote their business to the block chain community and to users. 

In June 2018 management entered into talks with an online boat sales platform under development by Mr. Yves Toelderer, evaluating the creation of an additional business line operating a global online boat market place. Upon Toelderer providing evidence of a minimum viable product (“MVP”) for the boat sales platform, definitive agreements were negotiated and the BOATIM platform was acquired. Integrating the BOATIM project into our product range reflects an important part of the Company´s strategic business development. This way EMRD´s established relationships and reach within the Asian online community and our e-commerce marketing capabilities are to be combined with the rolling subscription for service model of BOATIM and leveraged to establish steady revenue streams. Our contacts to the online world in Asia as well as our presence in the new Florida head offices will be of substantial benefit when developing and eventually rolling out our additional online product.

Equally, with the BOATIM platform scheduled to attract thousands of boat owners, sellers and lovers, we are creating a big social and commercial community around the subject of boats. This will be both globally and locally at the same time.

Since, our business model is two sided. Side one devotes our efforts mostly to advertisement and sponsored content. The second side is to offer the promotional services of a sales platform with integrated sales communication processes for the boating community and industry.
