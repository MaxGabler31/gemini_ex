On December 17, 2017, the Company entered into agreements to sell subsidiary businesses in Europe, Belgium and Asia Pacific (the "Sale Transactions"). The subsidiaries to be sold represent divisions of the Company that specialize in providing recruitment and talent management services to customers. The sales exclude the assets of the subsidiary's Recruitment Process Outsourcing Business ("RPO Business"). The closing of each Sale Transaction will be contingent upon the closing of each other Sale Transaction. The sales, taken together, constitute a sale of substantially all of the Company’s assets under the Delaware General Corporation Law, and, as such, the Company is seeking stockholder approval of the sale of substantially all of the Company’s assets pursuant to the agreements. Subject to receipt of stockholder approval and satisfaction of the customary closing conditions, the Company expects to close the transactions at the end of March 2018.
On June 15, 2015, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of the assets (excluding working capital) of its Hudson Information Technology (US) business (the "US IT business") to Mastech, Inc. As a result, the Company no longer has an Americas' Information Technology contracting practice. The Company also completed the sale of its Netherlands business to InterBalanceGroup BV effective April 30, 2015. 
On November 7, 2014, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of the assets and liabilities of its Legal eDiscovery business in the United States and United Kingdom. As a result, the Company no longer has operations in the Legal eDiscovery business. In addition, the Company ceased direct operations in Sweden during the third quarter of 2014.

COMPETITION
The markets for the Company's services and products are highly competitive. There are few barriers to entry, so new entrants occur frequently, resulting in considerable market fragmentation.
