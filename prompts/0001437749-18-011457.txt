We are a leading branded licensor, wholesaler and retailer of products marketed under our Nathan’s Famous brand, including our popular Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs. What began as a nickel hot dog stand on Coney Island in 1916 has evolved into a highly recognized brand throughout the United States and the world. Our innovative business model seeks to maximize the points of distribution for and the consumption of Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs, crinkle-cut French fries and our other products across a wide-range of grocery retail and foodservice formats. Our products are currently marketed for sale in approximately 58,000 locations, including supermarkets, mass merchandisers and club stores, selected foodservice locations and our Company-owned and franchised restaurants throughout the United States and in sixteen foreign territories and countries. The Company considers itself to be in the foodservice industry, and has pursued co-branding initiatives within other foodservice environments. Our major channels of distribution are as follows:
 

● | Our licensing program contracts with certain third parties to manufacture, distribute, market and sell a broad variety of Nathan’s Famous branded products including our hot dogs, sausage and corned beef products, frozen French fries and additional products through retail grocery channels and club stores throughout the United States. As of March 25, 2018, packaged Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs continued to be sold in approximately 43,000 supermarkets, mass merchandisers and club stores including Kroger, Publix, ShopRite, Walmart, Target, Sam’s Club, Costco and BJ’s Wholesale Club located in all 50 states. We earn revenue through royalties on products sold by our licensees.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Branded Product Program (“BPP”) provides foodservice operators in a variety of venues the opportunity to capitalize on our Nathan’s Famous brand by marketing and selling certain Nathan’s Famous hot dog products. We believe that the program has broad appeal to foodservice operators due to its flexibility to deliver our products to a wide variety of distribution channels. In conjunction with the program, operators are granted a limited use of the Nathan’s Famous trademark, as well as Nathan’s point of purchase materials. Unlike our licensing and franchise programs, we do not generate revenue from royalties, but rather by selling our hot dog products either directly to foodservice operators or to various foodservice distributors who resell the products to foodservice operators.

● | Operating quick-service restaurants featuring Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs, crinkle-cut French fries, and a variety of other menu offerings, which operate under the name “Nathan’s Famous,” the name first used at our original Coney Island restaurant which opened in 1916.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our franchised restaurant operations are comprised predominately of our Nathan’s Famous concept, which features a menu consisting of Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs, crinkle-cut French fries and beverages as well as other items. We earn royalties on restaurant sales at these franchise locations. In addition to our traditional franchised restaurants, we enable approved foodservice operators to offer a Nathan’s Famous menu of Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs, crinkle-cut French fries, proprietary toppings and a limited menu of other Nathan’s products through our Branded Menu Program (“BMP”). We earn royalties on Nathan’s products purchased by our BMP franchise operators.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We also own, through our subsidiary NF Treacher’s Corp., the Arthur Treacher’s brand and trademarks. We use the Arthur Treacher’s brand, products and trademarks as a branded seafood menu-line extension for inclusion in certain Nathan’s Famous restaurants. Currently, we operate seven Arthur Treacher’s BMP locations.
 
Our brand is widely recognized by virtue of our long history and broad geographic footprint, which allows us to enjoy high consumer awareness in the United States and abroad and the ability to grow in markets and channels where the brand is known but has not yet achieved optimal market penetration. We believe that our highly visible brand and reputation for high quality products have allowed us to expand our food offerings beyond our signature hot dogs and command a price premium across our portfolio of products. Over time, we have expanded menu options so that our Company-owned restaurants and franchisees can supplement their core menu of Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs, crinkle-cut French fries and beverages with a variety of other quality menu choices. We have also developed a portfolio of licensed products for sale at retail and grocery locations. We seek to maintain the same quality standard with each of our supplemental menu items and licensed products as we do with our core hot dog and French fries menu. We intend to continue to leverage our highly recognized global brand and iconic products to introduce new products into our existing distribution network, open new points of distribution and grow our overall sales. We believe that there is great potential to increase our sales by converting existing sales of non-branded products to Nathan’s branded products throughout the foodservice industry.
 
In recent years, our primary focus has been to expand the market penetration of the Nathan’s Famous brand. Specifically, we have sought to increase the number of points of brand representation and grow product sales throughout our various channels of distribution. In this regard, we have concentrated our efforts on:
 

● | expanding the number of foodservice locations and distributors participating in the Nathan’s Famous Branded Product Program;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expanding the number of domestic franchised Nathan’s Famous restaurant units through the opening of new and innovative types of locations, including the Branded Menu Program, as well as continuing to develop master franchising programs in foreign countries;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expanding our licensing programs for packaged Nathan’s Famous products through new product introductions and geographic expansion; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | continuing to profitably operate our iconic Company-owned restaurants, and opportunistically invest in Company-owned restaurant expansion.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As a result of our efforts to expand the Nathan’s Famous brand, as of March 25, 2018:
 

● | our Nathan’s Famous restaurant system consisted of 276 franchised units and five Company-owned units (including one seasonal unit) located in 20 states and 12 foreign countries;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our Nathan’s Famous Branded Product Program distributes our Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs throughout all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Canada, the US Virgin Islands, Guam and Mexico;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Nathan’s Famous packaged hot dogs and other products were offered for sale within approximately 43,000 supermarkets and club stores in all 50 states.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our revenues are generated primarily from sales of products sold through our Branded Product Program and within our Company-owned restaurants, as well as royalties from our retail licensing activities and the royalties, fees and other sums we earn from our restaurant franchising activities.
 
We plan to expand the scope and market penetration of our Branded Product Program, further develop the restaurant operations of existing Nathan’s Famous franchised and Company-owned outlets, open new Nathan’s Famous franchised outlets in traditional or captive market environments and expand the Nathan’s Famous retail licensing programs. We also plan to further expand our international presence through our franchise, and retail licensing programs. We may also selectively consider opening new Company-owned restaurants.
 
We were incorporated in Delaware on July 10, 1992 under the name “Nathan’s Famous Holding Corporation” to act as the parent of a Delaware corporation then-known as Nathan’s Famous, Inc. On December 15, 1992, we changed our name to Nathan’s Famous, Inc., and our Delaware subsidiary changed its name to Nathan’s Famous Operating Corp. The Delaware subsidiary was organized in October 1989 in connection with its re-incorporation in Delaware from that of a New York corporation named “Nathan’s Famous, Inc.” The New York Nathan’s was incorporated on July 10, 1925, as a successor to the sole-proprietorship that opened the first Nathan’s restaurant in Coney Island in 1916. On July 23, 1987, Equicor Group, Ltd. merged with and into the New York Nathan’s in a “going private” transaction. The New York Nathan’s, the Delaware subsidiary and Equicor may all be deemed to be our predecessors.
 
Restaurant Operations
 
Currently, our restaurant operations are comprised of 281 Nathan’s Famous restaurants, which have been co-branded with Arthur Treacher’s and Kenny Rogers Roasters menu items in 35 and 16 units, respectively.Nathan’s Famous Concept and Menus
 
Our Nathan’s Famous concept is scalable, offering a wide range of facility designs and sizes, suitable to a vast variety of locations, featuring a core menu consisting of Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs, crinkle-cut French fries and beverages. Nathan’s menu is designed to take advantage of site-specific market opportunities by adding complementary food items to the core menu. The Nathan’s concept is suitable to stand-alone or can be co-branded with other nationally recognized brands.
 
Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs are flavored with its secret blend of spices provided by Ida Handwerker in 1916, which historically have distinguished Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs. Our hot dogs are prepared and served in accordance with procedures which have not varied significantly since our inception over 100 years ago in our Company-owned and franchised restaurants. Our signature crinkle-cut French fries, cooked in 100% trans-fat-free oil, are featured at each Nathan’s restaurant. We believe the majority of sales in our Company-owned units consist of Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs, crinkle-cut French fries and beverages.
 
Individual Nathan’s restaurants supplement their core menu of Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs, crinkle-cut French fries and beverages with a variety of other quality menu choices including: char-grilled hamburgers, crispy chicken tenders, crispy chicken and char-grilled chicken sandwiches, Philly cheese steaks, selected seafood items, a breakfast menu and assorted desserts and snacks. We use the Arthur Treacher’s brand, products and trademarks as a branded seafood menu-line extension for inclusion in certain Nathan’s Famous restaurants. While the number of supplemental menu items carried varies with the size of the unit, the specific supplemental menus chosen are tailored to local food preferences and market conditions. Each supplemental menu option consists of a number of variations; for example, the hamburger menu may include char-grilled bacon cheeseburgers, double-burgers and super cheeseburgers. We seek to maintain the same quality standard with each of Nathan’s supplemental menus as we do with Nathans’ core hot dog and French fries menu. Thus, for example, hamburgers and sandwiches are prepared to order and not pre-wrapped or kept warm under lights. Nathan’s also has a “Kids Meal” program in which various menu alternatives are combined with toys designed to appeal to the children’s market. Soft drinks, iced tea, coffee and old fashioned lemonade and orangeade are also offered. The Company continually evaluates new products. In the course of its evaluations, the Company seeks to respond to changing consumer trends, including a trend toward perceived “healthier” products. In addition to its well-established, signature products, the Company offers for sale in many of its restaurants up to seven chicken products, six fish products, and five salad and soup products.

Nathan’s restaurant designs are available in a range of sizes from 300 to 4,000 square feet. We have also developed various Nathan’s carts, kiosks, mobile food carts, trucks and modular units. Our smaller units may not have customer seating areas, although they may often share seating areas with other fast food or quick service outlets in food court settings. Other units generally provide seating for 45 to 125 customers. Carts, trucks, kiosks and modular units generally carry only the core menu. This menu is supplemented by a number of other menu selections in our other restaurant types.
 
We believe that Nathan’s carts, kiosks, modular units and food court designs are particularly well-suited for placement in non-traditional sites, such as airports, travel plazas, stadiums, schools, convenience stores, entertainment facilities, military facilities, business and industry foodservice, within larger retail operations and other captive markets. Many of these settings may also be appropriate for our expanding Branded Menu Program or Branded Product Program. All of these units feature the Nathan’s logo and utilize a contemporary design.
 
Franchise Operations
 
At March 25, 2018, our Nathan’s franchise system, including our Branded Menu Program, consisted of 276 units operating in 20 states and 12 foreign countries.
 
Our franchise system includes among its 142 franchisees such well-known companies as HMS Host, Compass Group USA, Inc., Gourmet Dining Services, Inc., CulinArt, National Amusements, Inc., Hershey Entertainment & Resorts Company, and Bruster’s Real Ice Cream. We continue to market our franchising programs to larger, experienced and successful operators with the financial and business capability to develop multiple franchise units, as well as to individual owner-operators with evidence of restaurant management experience, net worth and sufficient capital.
 
During the fiscal 2018 period, no single franchisee accounted for over 10% of our consolidated revenue. At March 25, 2018, HMS Host operated 13 franchised outlets, including two units at airports, 10 units within highway travel plazas and one unit within a mall. Additionally, at March 25, 2018, (i) HMS Host operated 48 locations featuring Nathan’s products pursuant to our Branded Product Program, (ii) 35 mobile carts were operating in New York, NY, and (iii) 16 Bruster’s Real Ice Cream shops and four Kmart locations were selling Nathan’s products under our Branded Menu Program.
 
Nathan’s Standard Franchise Program
 
Franchisees are required to execute a standard franchise agreement prior to opening each Nathan’s Famous unit. Our current standard Nathan’s Famous franchise agreement provides for, among other things, a one-time $30,000 franchise fee payable upon execution of the agreement, a monthly royalty payment based on 5.5% of restaurant sales and the expenditure of up to 2.0% of restaurant sales on advertising. We may offer alternatives to the standard franchise agreement, having to do with franchise royalties, fees or advertising requirements. The initial term of the typical franchise agreement is 20 years, with a 15-year renewal option by the franchisee, subject to conditions contained in the franchise agreement.
 
Franchisees are approved on the basis of their business background, evidence of restaurant management experience, net worth and capital available for investment in relation to the proposed scope of the development agreement.
 
We provide numerous support services to our Nathan’s Famous franchisees. We assist in and approve all site selections. Thereafter, we provide architectural plans suitable for restaurants of varying sizes and configurations for use in food court, in-line and free standing locations. We also assist in establishing building design specifications, reviewing construction compliance, equipping the restaurant and providing appropriate menus to coordinate with the restaurant design and location selected by the franchisee. We typically do not sell food, equipment or supplies to our standard franchisees.
 
We offer various management-training courses for management personnel of Company-owned and franchised Nathan’s Famous restaurants. A restaurant manager from each restaurant must successfully complete our mandated management-training program. We also offer additional operations and general management training courses for all restaurant managers and other managers with supervisory responsibilities. We provide standard manuals to each franchisee covering training and operations, products and equipment and local marketing programs. We also provide ongoing advice and assistance to franchisees. We meet with our franchisees to discuss upcoming marketing events, menu development and other topics, each of which is designed to provide individual restaurant and system-wide benefits.

Franchised restaurants are required to be operated in accordance with uniform operating standards and specifications relating to the selection, quality and preparation of menu items, signage, decor, equipment, uniforms, suppliers, maintenance and cleanliness of premises and customer service. All standards and specifications are developed by us to be applied on a system-wide basis. We regularly monitor franchisee operations and inspect restaurants. Franchisees are required to furnish us with monthly sales or operating reports which assist us in monitoring the franchisee’s compliance with its franchise agreement. We make both announced and unannounced inspections of restaurants to ensure that our practices and procedures are followed. We have the right to terminate a franchise if a franchisee does not operate and maintain a restaurant in accordance with the requirements of its franchise agreement, including for non-payment of royalties, sale of unauthorized products, bankruptcy or conviction of a felony. During the fiscal 2018 period, franchisees opened 40 new Nathan’s Famous franchised units in the United States (including 19 Branded Menu Program units), and 16 units internationally.
 
A franchisee who desires to open multiple units in a specific territory within the United States may enter into an area development agreement under which we would expect to receive an area development fee based upon the number of proposed units which the franchisee is authorized to open. With respect to our international development, we generally grant exclusive territorial rights in foreign countries for the development of Nathan’s units based upon compliance with a predetermined development schedule. Additionally, we may further grant exclusive manufacturing and distribution rights in foreign countries, and we may require an exclusivity fee to be conveyed for such exclusive rights.
 
Nathan’s Branded Menu Program
 
Our Nathan’s Famous Branded Menu Program enables qualified foodservice operators to offer a Nathan’s Famous menu of Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs, crinkle-cut French fries, proprietary toppings, and a limited menu of other Nathan’s products. Under the Branded Menu Program, the operator may use the Nathan’s Famous trademarks on signage and as part of its menu boards. Additionally, the operator may use Nathan’s Famous paper goods and point of sale marketing materials. Nathan’s also provides architectural and design services, training and operation manuals in conjunction with this program. The operator provides Nathan’s with a fee and is required to sign a 10-year agreement. Nathan’s does not collect a royalty based on the operator’s sales and the operator is not required to report sales to Nathan’s as required by the standard franchise arrangements. Instead, the Branded Menu Program operator is required to purchase products from Nathan’s approved distributors; we earn our royalties from such purchases.
 
As of March 25, 2018, the Nathan’s Branded Menu Program was comprised of 122 outlets, which included 35 units operated by Move Systems, Inc. in New York, NY and 16 Nathan’s Famous Branded Products within Bruster’s Real Ice Cream shops, a premium ice cream franchisor headquartered in western Pennsylvania and four locations operating within K-Mart.

Arthur Treacher’s
 
Arthur Treacher’s Fish-n-Chips, Inc. was originally founded in 1969. Arthur Treacher’s main product is its “Original Fish-n-Chips,” consisting of fish fillets coated with a special batter prepared under a proprietary formula, deep-fried golden brown, and served with English-style chips and corn meal “hush puppies.” Full menu restaurants emphasize the preparation and sale of batter-dipped fried seafood and chicken dishes served in a quick-service environment.
 
We are the sole owner of all rights to the Arthur Treacher’s brand and the exclusive franchisor of the Arthur Treacher’s restaurant system (subject to a limited license granted to PAT Franchise Systems, Inc. (“PFSI”)) in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, (“the PFSI Markets”). Pursuant to the license, PFSI has no obligation to pay fees or royalties to us in connection with its use of the Arthur Treacher’s intellectual property within the PFSI Markets. As a result of PFSI’s failure to satisfy the Development Schedules for each of the territories, all future development rights have reverted to Nathan’s.

As of March 25, 2018, Arthur Treacher’s, as a co-brand, was included within 35 Nathan’s Famous restaurants. Our primary intention was to continue including co-branded Arthur Treacher’s operations within our Nathan’s Famous restaurants and explore alternative distribution channels for Arthur Treacher’s products. We may seek to expand the opportunity for an Arthur Treacher’s Branded Menu Program in the future. Currently we operate seven Arthur Treacher’s BMP locations.
 
Kenny Rogers Roasters 
 
We have the right to use the Kenny Rogers Roasters trademarks for the continued sale of the Kenny Rogers Roasters products in the Nathan’s Famous restaurants existing at April 23, 2008, where the Kenny Rogers products had already been introduced. As of March 25, 2018, the Kenny Rogers brand was being sold within 16 Nathan’s restaurants.
Company-owned Nathan’s Restaurant Operations
 
As of March 25, 2018, we operated five Company-owned Nathan’s units, including one seasonal location, in New York. Since 2012, we have invested significantly in our Company-owned restaurants. In March 2012, we relocated our seasonal Coney Island Boardwalk restaurant to a more prominent location. Our Coney Island flagship location was rebuilt and re-opened on May 20, 2013 after suffering severe damage as a result of Superstorm Sandy on October 29, 2012. Our Yonkers location was down-sized, relocated and re-opened on November 18, 2013 pursuant to its new lease, and our Oceanside restaurant was also relocated and downsized and re-opened on March 25, 2015. Four of our Company-owned restaurants range in size from approximately 2,650 square feet to 10,000 square feet and have seating to accommodate between 60 and 125 customers. These restaurants are open seven days a week on a year-round basis and are designed to appeal to consumers of all ages. We have established high standards for food quality, cleanliness, and service at our restaurants and regularly monitor the operations of our restaurants to ensure adherence to these standards. We have entered into an agreement to sell the Company-owned restaurant, including the real estate, in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, NY in July 2018, which we expect to continue operating through September 2018, before it ceases operations.
 
Three of our Company-owned restaurants have contemporary service areas, seating, signage, and general decor. Our Coney Island restaurant, which first opened in 1916, remains unique in its presentation and operations.
 
Our Company-owned restaurants typically carry a broader selection of menu items than our franchise restaurants and generally attain sales levels higher than the average of our newer franchise restaurants. The non-core menu items at the Company-owned restaurants, tend to have lower margins than the core menu.

International Development
 
As of March 25, 2018, Nathan’s Famous franchisees operated 53 units in 12 foreign countries. During the fiscal 2018 period we opened 16 new units internationally, including our first three units in Latvia pursuant to a new development agreement. Additionally, we opened four units in Russia, three units each in Kazakhstan and Australia, and one unit each in Malaysia, Philippines and Dominican Republic, pursuant to existing development agreements.
 
We will seek to continue granting exclusive territorial rights for franchising and for the manufacturing and distribution rights in foreign countries, and we expect to require that an exclusivity fee be conveyed for these rights. We plan to develop the restaurant franchising system internationally through the use of master franchising agreements based upon individual or combined use of our existing restaurant concepts and for the distribution of Nathan’s products.

Branded Product Program
 
Through the Branded Product Program, Nathan’s provides qualified foodservice operators in a variety of venues the opportunity to capitalize on Nathan’s valued brand by marketing and selling primarily Nathan’s Famous hot dog products. We believe that the program is unique in its flexibility and broad appeal. Hot dogs are offered in a variety of sizes and additional specialty products are available to satisfy consumer needs. In conjunction with the program, the operators are granted a limited use of the Nathan’s Famous trademark, as well as Nathan’s point of purchase materials. We earn income by selling our products either directly to the end users or to various foodservice distributors who resell the products to specific operators.
 
As of March 25, 2018, the Branded Product Program distributed product in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Canada, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and Mexico. During the fiscal 2018 period, we continued to open many new locations offering Nathan’s branded products. Today, Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs are being offered in national restaurant chains such as Auntie Anne’s, Hot Dog On A Stick, Johnny Rockets, national movie theater chains such as Regal Entertainment and National Amusements, casino hotels such as Foxwoods Casino in Connecticut, the Grand Casino in Minnesota and convenience store chains such as Race Trac, Holiday Station stores, and the Cinemex movie chain in Mexico. The Branded Products Program also distributes product in professional sports arenas with Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs now being served in stadiums and arenas that host the New York Yankees, New York Mets, Brooklyn Nets, New York Islanders, Dallas Cowboys, Miami Marlins, Washington Nationals and Colorado Rockies.
 
Additionally, our products are offered in numerous other foodservice operations including cafeterias, snack bars and vending machines located in many different types of foodservice outlets and venues, including airports, highway travel plazas, colleges and universities, gas and convenience stores, military installations and Veteran’s Administration hospitals throughout the country.

Nathan’s expects to continue to seek out and evaluate a variety of alternative environments designed to maximize the value of our Branded Product Program.
 
Expansion Program
 
We expect that our retail licensing program will continue to grow centered around our licensing program with John Morrell & Co. John Morrell & Co. brings superior sales and marketing resources to our brand through its national scale, broad distribution platform, strong retail relationships and research and development infrastructure capable of developing and introducing attractive new products. As a result of our partnership with John Morrell & Co., we expect Nathan’s Famous products to further penetrate the grocery, mass merchandising and club channels by expanding points of distribution in targeted, underpenetrated regions and through the development of new products. John Morrell & Co. expects to leverage this relationship with continued full-scale marketing efforts, both inside and outside of stores, highlighted by exciting customer events and brand representation and support at numerous Hot Dog Eating Contest Qualifying Events. Nathan’s through its relationship with John Morrell & Co. has been named the official hot dog of Major League Baseball for the 2017 and 2018 seasons. Additionally, John Morrell & Co. will continue its mobile marketing tour throughout 2018, whereby merchandising trucks will visit numerous supermarkets and community events throughout the country, and select Hot Dog Eating Contests to bring the Nathan’s / Coney Island experience to new markets, emphasizing our relationship with Major League Baseball.
 
We expect to continue the growth of our Branded Product Program through the addition of new points of sale. We believe that the flexible design of the Branded Product Program makes it well-suited for sales to all segments of the broad foodservice industry. We intend to keep targeting sales to a broad line of food distributors, which we believe complements our continuing focus on sales to various foodservice retailers. We continue to believe that as consumers look to assure confidence in the quality of the food that they purchase, there is great potential to increase our sales by converting existing sales of non-branded products to Nathan’s branded products throughout the foodservice industry.
 
We will seek to market our franchise restaurant program to large, experienced and successful operators with the financial and business capability to develop multiple franchise units, as well as to individual owner-operators with evidence of restaurant management experience, net worth and sufficient capital.
 
 11



We also expect to continue opening Nathan’s Famous franchised units individually and on a co-branded basis, expanding product distribution through various means such as branded products and retail licensing arrangements, developing master franchising programs in foreign countries and including our Arthur Treacher’s signature products both within our restaurant system and as a separate Branded Menu Program. We may selectively consider opening new Company-owned Nathan’s units on an opportunistic basis. We may consider new opportunities in both traditional and captive market settings.
 
We believe that our international development efforts will continue to garner a variety of interest as a result of the unique product distribution opportunities that we offer. Because of the scalability of our concept and menu offerings, we believe that there are also opportunities to co-brand our restaurant concept and/or menu items with other restaurant concepts internationally. We believe that in addition to restaurant franchising, we could further increase revenues by continuing to offer master development agreements to qualified persons or entities allowing for the operation of franchised restaurants, sub-franchising of restaurants to others, licensing the manufacture of our signature products, selling our signature products through supermarkets or other retail venues and further developing our Branded Product Program. Qualified persons or entities must have satisfactory foodservice experience managing multiple units, the appropriate infrastructure and the necessary financial resources to support the anticipated development of the business.
 
Co-branding
 
We believe that there is a continuing opportunity for co-branding of our restaurant concept and/or menu items with other restaurant concepts, as well as within our restaurant system as new franchise opportunities are developed. Franchisees that have co-branded a Nathan’s Famous restaurant with our other brands received a then-current Uniform Franchise Offering Circular (“UFOC”) or Franchise Disclosure Document (“FDD”) and executed a participation agreement as a rider to their franchise agreement. We initially implemented our co-branding strategy within the Nathan’s Famous restaurant system by adding the Arthur Treacher’s and Kenny Rogers Roasters brands into Nathan’s Famous restaurants. Upon the sale of Kenny Rogers Roasters in April 2008, we discontinued co-branding that brand within new restaurants in the Nathan’s Famous system. We have continued our co-branding effort with the Arthur Treacher’s brand with new and existing Nathan’s Famous franchisees and expect to do so in the future. We may seek to further explore opportunities to co-brand the Arthur Treacher’s brand to other multi-unit foodservice operators in the future.
 
We believe that our diverse brand offerings complement each other, which has enabled us to market franchises of co-branded units and continue co-branding within our franchised units. We also believe that our various restaurants’ products provide us with strong lunch and dinner day-parts as well as snacking occasions.
 
We believe that a multi-branded restaurant concept offering strong lunch and dinner day-parts is appealing to both consumers and potential franchisees. Such restaurants are designed to allow the operator to increase sales and leverage the cost of real estate and other fixed costs to provide superior investment returns as compared to many restaurants that are single branded. We have successfully co-branded Nathan’s with numerous business partners that were not Nathan’s franchisees because of our adaptability of our menu, to be limited or extensive, and the uniqueness of our signature hot dog product.
 
Licensing Program
 
Pursuant to an Agreement expiring in March 2032, John Morrell & Co., a subsidiary of Smithfield Foods, Inc., has been granted, among other things, (i) the exclusive right and obligation to manufacture, distribute, market and sell “Nathan’s Famous” branded hot dog, sausage and corned beef products in refrigerated consumer packages to be resold through retail channels (e.g., supermarkets, groceries, mass merchandisers and club stores) within the United States, (ii) a right of first offer to license any other “Nathan’s Famous” branded refrigerated meat products in consumer packages to be resold through retail channels within the United States, on terms to be negotiated in good faith, (iii) the right and obligation to manufacture “Nathan’s Famous” branded hot dog and sausage products in bulk for use in the food service industry within the United States, and (iv) the non-exclusive right and obligation to supply “Nathan’s Famous” natural casing and skinless hot dogs in bulk for use in the “Nathan’s Famous” restaurant system within the United States. The Agreement provides for royalties on packaged products sold to supermarkets, club stores and grocery stores, payable on a monthly basis to the Company equal to 10.8% of net sales, subject to minimum annual guaranteed royalties of at least $10 million in the first year of the term and which minimum guaranteed royalties increase annually throughout the term. Nathan’s earned royalties of approximately $19,445,000 in fiscal 2018 and $17,073,000 in fiscal 2017 representing 18.7% and 17.7% of total revenues, respectively. We believe our future operating results will continue to be substantially impacted by the terms and conditions of the agreement with John Morrell & Co., but there can be no assurance thereof (See Item 1A - “Risk Factors”). Since 2002, John Morrell & Co. has licensed from us the right to manufacture and sell branded hot dogs and sausages to selected foodservice accounts.  Pursuant to this arrangement, we earned royalties of $1,388,000 and $1,351,000 during the fiscal 2018 period and fiscal 2017 period, respectively.  The majority of these royalties were earned from one account.  As of March 25, 2018, packaged Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs continued to be sold in approximately 43,000 supermarkets, mass merchandisers and club stores including Kroger, Publix, ShopRite, Walmart, Target, Sam’s Club, Costco and BJ’s Wholesale Club located in all 50 states.  We believe that the overall exposure of the brand and opportunity for consumers to enjoy the Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dog in their homes helps promote “Nathan’s Famous” restaurant patronage. Royalties earned from this agreement were approximately 90.5% of our fiscal 2018 period license revenues.

We license the manufacture of the proprietary spices which are used to produce Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs to Saratoga Specialties. During fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, we earned $1,062,000 and $870,000, respectively, from this license. Through this agreement, we control the manufacture of all Nathan’s hot dogs.
 
During fiscal 2018, our licensee Lamb Weston, Inc., continued to produce and distribute Nathan’s Famous frozen French fries and onion rings for retail sale pursuant to a license agreement. These products were distributed within 37 states, primarily on the East Coast and in the South-West and West Coast during fiscal 2018. During fiscal 2018 and 2017, we earned royalties of $518,000 and $482,000, respectively, under this agreement. For the contract year ended in July 2017, we earned royalties of $128,000 in excess of the annual minimum. Lamb Weston, Inc. continues to seek to further expand its market penetration in the Eastern United States and in the Mid-West. Lamb Weston, Inc. exercised its third option to extend the license agreement through July 2023, pursuant to which the minimum royalties will increase 4% annually.
 
During fiscal 2018, we continued to license the right to manufacture and sell miniature bagel dogs, franks-in-a-blanket and other hors d’oeuvres through club stores, supermarkets and other retail food stores. Royalties earned under this agreement were approximately $227,000 during fiscal 2018 and $231,000 during fiscal 2017.
 
We also have licensing agreements with Hermann Pickle Packers, Inc., Gold Pure Food Products Co., Inc. and others. These companies licensed the “Nathan’s Famous” or “Arthur Treacher’s” name for the manufacture and sale of various products including mustard, salsa, sauerkraut and pickles. These products have been distributed on a limited basis. Fees and royalties earned from all of these products were approximately $319,000 during fiscal 2018 and $311,000 during fiscal 2017.
 
We have a license agreement, which currently expires on December 31, 2019, with Inventure Foods, Inc. for the manufacture and sale of Nathan’s branded potato chips and other salty snack products. Royalties earned under this agreement were approximately $60,000 during fiscal 2018 and $50,000 during fiscal 2017.
 
Provisions and Supplies 
 
Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs are primarily manufactured by John Morrell & Co. for sale by our Branded Product Program, our restaurant system, and at retail. John Morrell & Co. and other hot dog manufacturers supply the hot dogs for our Company-operated and franchise-operated restaurants. All hot dogs are manufactured in accordance with Nathan’s recipes, quality standards and proprietary spice formulations. Nathan’s believes that it has reliable sources of supply; however, in the event of any significant disruption in supply, management believes that alternative sources of supply are available. (See Item 1A- “Risk Factors”).  Saratoga Specialties produces Nathan’s proprietary spice formulations and we have, in the past, engaged Newly Weds Foods, Inc. as an alternative source of supply. Our frozen crinkle-cut French fries have been produced exclusively by Lamb Weston, Inc. McCain Foods USA is a secondary source of supply of our frozen French fries for our restaurant system. During fiscal 2018, McCain Foods USA provided approximately 18.5% of our frozen crinkle-cut French fries. Most other Company provisions are purchased from multiple sources to prevent disruption in supply and to obtain competitive prices. We approve all products and product specifications. We negotiate directly with our suppliers on behalf of the entire system for all primary food ingredients and beverage products sold in the restaurants in an effort to ensure adequate supply of high quality items at competitive prices.
 
 13



We currently utilize a cooperative distribution system pursuant to an agreement with UniPro Foodservice, Inc., the Multi-Unit Group, which is comprised of institutional food and non-food distributors organized to procure, distribute and market food service and non-food merchandise for the distribution needs of our domestic restaurant system. Our former distribution agreement with US Foodservice, Inc. was due to expire on July 31, 2018. This new arrangement allows for more flexibility in expanding into new markets throughout the U.S., as well as proves to be more cost efficient for our current franchisees. The strategic distribution partners under this new agreement include: DiCarlo Distributors, Inc., Tapia Brothers Co., Cheney Brothers, Inc., Feesers, Inc., Lipari Foods, LLC and Chain Distribution Services LLC. Our branded products are delivered to our ultimate customers throughout the country by numerous distributors, including US Foodservice, Inc., SYSCO Corporation, Vistar / PFG, McLane and DOT Foods.
 
Marketing, Promotion and Advertising
 
Nathan’s believes that an integral part of its brand marketing strategy is to continue to build brand awareness through its complimentary points of distribution strategy of selling its signature products through restaurants, the Branded Product Program, the Branded Menu Program, within supermarkets and club stores. We believe that as we continue to build brand awareness and expand our reputation for quality and value, we have further penetrated the markets that we serve and have also entered new markets. We also derive further brand recognition from the Nathan’s Famous Hot Dog Eating Contests. In 2017, we hosted 19 regional contests at a variety of high profile locations such as New York New York Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas, NV, and Citi Field, Queens, NY, as well as within the cities of Boston, MA, Nashville, TN, San Antonio and Fort Worth, TX, St. Louis, MO, Charlotte, NC, Syracuse, NY, Norfolk, VA and Washington, DC. In 2018, we are again holding contests at the Great American Ballpark, Cincinnati, OH, Busch Stadium, St Louis, MO and Dutch Wonderland, Lancaster, PA and other cities across the U.S. Our first 2018 regional contest took place in Florida on March 31st. In total we will host 15 regional contests. These regional contests culminate on July 4th as the regional champions converge at our flagship restaurant in Coney Island, NY, to compete for the coveted “Mustard Yellow Belt.” We also have a women’s-only Hot Dog Eating Contest at Coney Island which includes the top finishing female competitor from each qualifying regional contest. The regional contests typically garner significant amounts of local publicity and the national championship contest that is held on July 4th generates significant brand exposure across major broadcast and cable networks nationally. The national championship contest has been aired nationally on ESPN since 2004.
 
Nathan’s Famous continues to look to sports sponsorships as a strategic marketing opportunity to further brand recognition. In addition to the branded signage opportunity, Nathan’s sells its Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dog and crinkle-cut French fries. In many venues, Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs and crinkle-cut French fries are sold at Nathan’s Famous trade-dressed concession stands and as menu items that are served in suites and throughout seating areas. Nathans’ current sports sponsorships include:
 

● | Professional Baseball: Yankee Stadium – New York Yankees, Citi Field – New York Mets; Marlins Park – Miami Marlins; Nationals Park – Washington Nationals; Coors Field – Colorado Rockies; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Professional Basketball and Hockey: The Barclays Center – Brooklyn Nets and NY Islanders; the Nassau Veteran’s Memorial Coliseum; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Professional Football: AT&T Stadium – Dallas Cowboys.
--+------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe that the Company’s overall sales and exposure have also been complemented by the sales of Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs and other Nathan’s products through the publicity generated by our Hot Dog Eating Contests and our affiliation with a number of high profile sports arenas. In addition to marketing our products at these venues, the Nathan’s Famous brand has also been televised regionally, nationally and internationally.
 
We maintain an advertising fund for local, regional and national advertising under the Nathan’s Famous Systems, Inc. Franchise Agreement. Nathan’s Famous franchisees are generally required to spend on local marketing activities or contribute to the advertising fund up to 2.0% of restaurant sales for advertising and promotion. Franchisee contributions to the advertising fund for national marketing support are generally based upon the type of restaurant and its location. The difference, if any, between 2.0% and the contribution to the advertising fund must be expended on local programs approved by us as to form, content and method of dissemination. Certain franchisees, including those operating pursuant to our Branded Menu Program were not obligated to contribute to the advertising fund during fiscal 2018. Vendors that supply products to the Company and our restaurant system also contribute to the advertising fund based upon purchases made by our franchisees and at Company-owned restaurants.

Throughout fiscal 2018, Nathan’s primary restaurant marketing emphasis focused on local store marketing campaigns featuring a value-oriented strategy supplemented with promotional “Limited Time Offers.” We anticipate that near-term marketing efforts for Nathan’s will continue to emphasize local store marketing activities.
 
Nathan’s marketing efforts include the use of free-standing inserts with coupons in Sunday newspapers. During fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, our marketing activities continued with the use of free-standing inserts and use of a localized newsprint campaigns. These newsprint campaigns typically reach more than eight million homes per insertion in the area surrounding approximately 100 Nathan’s company-owned and franchised restaurants. These programs usually feature discounted offers that are designed to attract customers to our restaurants. We monitor the results of these campaigns and have committed to additional campaigns in fiscal 2019.
 
We continue to market to and broaden Nathan’s brand exposure with the younger generation. The goal is to increase brand awareness and seek to make the brand relevant with younger customers via social media platforms.
 
The objective of our Branded Product Program has historically been to seek to provide our foodservice operator customers with value-added, high quality products supported with meaningful point of sale materials and other forms of operational support.
 
During fiscal 2018, Nathan’s marketing efforts for the Branded Product Program concentrated primarily on participation in national industry trade shows, and regional, local distributor trade events. We have also advertised our products in distributor and trade periodicals and initiated distributor sales incentive contests. Most of the sales of new restaurant franchises to franchisees are achieved through the direct effort of Company personnel. New arrangements with Branded Product Program points of sale are achieved through the combined efforts of Company personnel and a network of foodservice brokers and distributors who also are responsible for direct sales to national, regional and “street” accounts.
 
During the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019 (“fiscal 2019”), we may seek to further expand our internal marketing resources along with our network of foodservice brokers and distributors. We may attempt to emphasize specific venues as we expand our broker network, focus management and broker responsibilities on a regional basis and expand the use of sales incentive programs. We are currently continuing the process of upgrading our social media platforms by enhancing our corporate website and Facebook page and expanding the use of Twitter.
 
Government Regulation           
 
We are subject to Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) regulation and several states’ laws that regulate the offer and sale of franchises. We are also subject to a number of state laws which regulate substantive aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship.
 
The FTC’s “Trade Regulation Rule Concerning Disclosure Requirements and Prohibitions Concerning Franchising and Business Opportunity Ventures” (the “FTC Rule”) requires us to disclose certain information to prospective franchisees. Fifteen states, including New York, also require similar disclosure. While the FTC Rule does not require registration or filing of the disclosure document, 14 states require franchisors to register the disclosure document (or obtain exemptions from that requirement) before offering or selling a franchise. The laws of 17 other states require some form of registration (or a determination that a company is exempt or otherwise not required to register) under “business opportunity” laws, which sometimes apply to franchisors such as the Company. These laws have not precluded us from seeking franchisees in any given area.
 
Laws that regulate one or another aspect of the franchisor-franchisee relationship presently exist in 24 states as well as Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. These laws regulate the franchise relationship by, for example, requiring the franchisor to deal with its franchisees in good faith, prohibiting interference with the right of free association among franchisees, limiting the imposition of standards of performance on a franchisee, and regulating discrimination among franchisees. Although these laws may also restrict a franchisor in the termination of a franchise agreement by, for example, requiring “good cause” to exist as a basis for the termination, advance notice to the franchisee of the termination, an opportunity to cure a default, and repurchase of inventory or other compensation, these provisions have not had a significant effect on our operations. Our international franchise operations are subject to franchise-related and other laws in the jurisdictions in which our franchisees operate. These laws in the U.S. and overseas have not precluded us from enforcing the terms of our franchise agreements, and we do not believe that these laws are likely to significantly affect our operations.
 
 15



We are not aware of any pending franchise legislation in the U.S. that we believe is likely to significantly affect our operations.
 
Each Company-owned and franchised restaurant is subject to regulation as to operational matters by federal agencies and to licensing and regulation by state and local health, sanitation, safety, fire and other departments.
 
We are subject to the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act and various other federal and state laws that govern minimum wages, overtime, working conditions, mandatory benefits, health insurance, and other matters. Other regulatory interpretations (such as the NLRB’s review of joint employment standards under the National Labor Relations Act, the Labor Department’s review of the Fair Labor Standards Act, the SBA’s review of independence standards applicable to reviewing franchisee loan applications, etc.) may have an impact on our overall business as well, although we do not believe that these will significantly affect our operations. We are also subject to federal and state environmental regulations, which have not had a material effect on our operations. More stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations. In addition, the Federal Americans with Disabilities Act applies with respect to the design, construction and renovation of all restaurants in the United States.
 
Each company that manufactures, supplies or sells our products is subject to regulation by federal agencies and to licensing and regulation by state and local health, sanitation, safety and other departments.
 
We are also subject to the requirement that our restaurants post certain calorie content information for standard menu items, pursuant to Section 4205 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. Some of our restaurants are subject to similar requirements that are imposed by certain localities around the country.
 
Alcoholic beverage control regulations require each restaurant that sells such products to apply to a state authority and, in certain locations, county and municipal authorities, for a license or permit to sell alcoholic beverages on the premises. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of the daily operations of the restaurants, including minimum age of customers and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling, storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. Two of our Company-owned restaurants offer beer or wine coolers for sale.  Each of these restaurants has current alcoholic beverage licenses permitting the sale of these beverages. We have never had an alcoholic beverage license revoked.
 
We may be subject in certain states to “dram-shop” statutes, which generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment which wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to such person. We carry liquor liability coverage as part of our existing comprehensive general liability insurance and have never been named as a defendant in a lawsuit involving “dram-shop” statutes.
 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules promulgated thereunder by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the Nasdaq Stock Market have imposed substantial new or enhanced regulations and disclosure requirements in the areas of corporate governance (including director independence, director selection and audit, corporate governance and compensation committee responsibilities), equity compensation plans, auditor independence, pre-approval of auditor fees and services and disclosure and internal control procedures. We are committed to industry best practices in these areas.
 
We believe that we operate in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing our operations, including the FTC Rule and state franchise laws.
 
Employees          
 
At March 25, 2018, we had 205 employees, 43 of whom were corporate management and administrative employees, 25 of whom were restaurant managers and 137 of whom were hourly full-time and part-time foodservice employees. We generally employ approximately 300-400 seasonal employees during the summer months. Foodservice employees at three Company-owned locations are currently represented by Local 1102 RWSDU UFCW AFL-CIO, CLC, Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, under an agreement that expires on June 30, 2020.  Employees at a fourth location are represented by the same union pursuant to a different agreement that expires November 30, 2019. We consider our employee relations to be good and have not suffered any strike or work stoppage for more than 44 years. 

 16



We provide a training program for managers and assistant managers of our Company-owned and new franchised restaurants. Hourly food workers are trained on site by managers and crew trainers following Company practices and procedures outlined in our operating manuals.
 
Trademarks
 
We hold trademark and/or service mark registrations for NATHAN’S, NATHAN’S FAMOUS, NATHAN’S FAMOUS and design, NATHAN’S and Coney Island design, SINCE 1916 NATHAN’S FAMOUS and design, THE ORIGINAL SINCE 1916 NATHAN’S FAMOUS and design, SINCE 1916 NATHAN’S FAMOUS THIS IS THE ORIGINAL, THE ORIGINAL NATHAN’S FAMOUS, THE ORIGINAL NATHANS FAMOUS 100TH ANNIVERSARY and design in color, and NATHAN’S FAMOUS EXPRESS within the United States, with some of these marks holding corresponding foreign trademark and service mark registrations in 80 international jurisdictions, including Canada and China. We also hold various related marks, FRANKSTERS, FROM A HOT DOG TO AN INTERNATIONAL HABIT, MORE THAN JUST THE BEST HOT DOG! and design, and Mr. Frankie design, for restaurant services and some food items.
 
We hold trademark and/or service mark registrations for the marks ARTHUR TREACHER’S (stylized), ARTHUR TREACHER’S FISH & CHIPS (stylized), KRUNCH PUP and ORIGINAL within the United States. We hold service mark registrations for ARTHUR TREACHER’S in China and Japan. We also hold service mark registrations for ARTHUR TREACHER’S FISH & CHIPS and design in Canada and Mexico and ARTHUR TREACHER’S FISH & CHIPS and design in Colombia, Costa Rica, Kuwait, Malaysia, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates.
 
Our trademark and service mark registrations were granted and expire on various dates. We believe that these trademarks and service marks provide significant value to us and are an important factor in the marketing of our products and services. We believe that we do not infringe on the trademarks or other intellectual property rights of any third parties. We also have licenses to use the Kenny Rogers trademarks and service marks in the then-existing Nathan’s restaurants existing on April 23, 2008.
 
Seasonality
 
Our business is affected by seasonal fluctuations, including the effects of weather and economic conditions. Historically, sales from our Company-owned locations, principally at Coney Island, and franchised restaurants from which franchise royalties are earned and the Company’s earnings have been highest during our first two fiscal quarters, with the fourth fiscal quarter typically representing the slowest period. This seasonality is primarily attributable to weather conditions in the marketplace for our Company-owned and franchised Nathan’s restaurants, which is principally the Northeast. Additionally, revenues from our Branded Product Program and retail licensing program generally follow similar seasonal fluctuations, although not to the same degree. We believe that future revenues and profits will continue to be highest during our first two fiscal quarters, with the fourth fiscal quarter representing the slowest period.
Competition
 
The fast food restaurant industry is highly competitive and can be significantly affected by many factors, including changes in local, regional or national economic conditions, changes in consumer tastes, consumer concerns about the nutritional quality of quick-service food and increases in the number of, and particular locations of, competing restaurants.
 
Our restaurant system competes with numerous restaurants and drive-in units operating on both a national and local basis, including major national chains with greater financial and other resources than ours. We also compete with local restaurants and diners on the basis of menu diversity, food quality, price, size, site location and name recognition. There is also active competition for management personnel, as well as for suitable commercial sites for owned or franchised restaurants.
 
 17



We believe that our emphasis on our signature products and the reputation of these products for taste and quality set us apart from our major competitors. Many fast food companies have adopted “value pricing” and/or deep discount strategies. Nathan’s markets our own form of “value pricing,” selling combinations of different menu items for a total price lower than the usual sale price of the individual items and other forms of price sensitive promotions. Our value pricing strategy may offer multi-sized alternatives to our value-priced combo meals.
 
We also compete with many restaurant franchisors and other business concepts for the sale of franchises to qualified and financially capable franchisees.
 
Our Branded Product Program competes directly with a variety of other nationally-recognized hot dog companies and other food companies; many of these entities have significantly greater resources than we do. Our products primarily compete based upon price, quality and value to the foodservice operator and consumer. We believe that Nathan’s reputation for superior quality, along with the ability to provide operational support to the foodservice operator, provides Nathan’s with a competitive advantage.
 
Our retail licensing program for the sale of packaged foods within supermarkets competes primarily on the basis of reputation, flavor, quality and price. In most cases, we compete against other nationally-recognized brands that may have significantly greater resources than those at our disposal.
