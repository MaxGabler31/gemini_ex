ITEM 1. Business
General
Newpark Resources, Inc. was organized in 1932 as a Nevada corporation. In 1991, we changed our state of incorporation to Delaware. We are a geographically diversified supplier providing products, rentals and services primarily to the oil and gas exploration and production (“E&P”) industry. We operate our business through two reportable segments: Fluids Systems and Mats and Integrated Services. Our Fluids Systems segment provides drilling fluids products and technical services to customers in the North America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), Latin America and Asia Pacific regions. Our Mats and Integrated Services segment provides composite mat rentals, site construction and related site services to customers in various markets including oil and gas exploration and production, electrical transmission & distribution, pipeline, solar, petrochemical and construction across the U.S., Canada and Europe. We also sell composite mats to customers outside of the U.S. and to domestic customers outside of the E&P market.

Industry Fundamentals
Historically, several factors have driven demand for our products and services, including the supply, demand and pricing of oil and gas commodities, which drive E&P drilling and development activity. Demand for most of our Fluids Systems’ products and services is also driven, in part, by the level, type, depth and complexity of oil and gas drilling. Historically, drilling activity levels in North America have been volatile, primarily driven by the price of oil and natural gas. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014 and continuing through early 2016, the price of oil declined dramatically from the price levels in previous years. As a result, E&P drilling activity significantly declined in North America and many global markets over this period. While oil prices and drilling activity have improved from the lows reached in early 2016, both oil price and activity levels remain significantly lower than pre-downturn levels. The most widely accepted measure of activity for our North American operations is the Baker Hughes Rotary Rig Count. The average North America rig count was 1,083 in 2017, compared to 639 in 2016, 1,170 in 2015, and 2,241 in 2014. 
The declining E&P drilling activity levels in 2015 and 2016 reduced the demand for our services, negatively impacted customer pricing and resulted in elevated costs associated with workforce reductions, all of which negatively impacted our profitability. Further, due to the fact that our business contains substantial levels of fixed costs, including significant facility and personnel expenses, North American operating margins in both operating segments were negatively impacted by the lower customer demand during this period.
Outside of North America, drilling activity is generally more stable, as drilling activity in many countries is based upon longer term economic projections and multiple year drilling programs, which tend to reduce the impact of short-term changes in commodity prices on overall drilling activity. While drilling activity in certain of our international markets (including Brazil and Australia) has declined in recent years, as a whole, our international activities have remained relatively stable. This stability is primarily driven by new contract awards, which include geographical expansion into new markets as well as market share gains in existing markets.
In addition to our ongoing activity in the E&P industry, our Mats and Integrated Services segment is continuing to expand into other industries in North America, including electrical transmission & distribution and pipeline construction and maintenance. The demand for our composite matting systems from customers in these industries, is driven in part, by the level of construction and maintenance activity associated with the electrical transmission & distribution grid, as well as the oil and natural gas pipeline infrastructure within the U.S.

Reportable Segments
Fluids Systems
Our Fluids Systems business provides drilling fluids products and technical services to customers in the North America, EMEA, Latin America, and Asia Pacific regions. We offer customized solutions for highly technical drilling projects involving complex subsurface conditions such as horizontal, directional, geologically deep or drilling in deep water. These projects require increased monitoring and critical engineering support of the fluids system during the drilling process. In addition, our Fluids Systems offering is expanding into adjacent areas to drilling fluids, including completion and stimulation chemistry, which are typically utilized by customers following the drilling process.
We also have industrial mineral grinding operations for barite, a critical raw material in drilling fluids products, which serve to support our activity in the North American drilling fluids market. We grind barite and other industrial minerals at four facilities, including locations in Texas, Louisiana and Tennessee. We use the resulting products in our drilling fluids business, and also sell them to third party users, including other drilling fluids companies. We also sell a variety of other minerals, principally to third-party industrial (non-oil and gas) markets.
Raw Materials — We believe that our sources of supply for materials and equipment used in our drilling fluids business are adequate for our needs, however, we have experienced periods of short-term scarcity of barite ore, which have resulted in significant cost increases. Our specialty milling operation is our primary supplier of barite used in our North American drilling fluids business. Our mills obtain raw barite ore under supply agreements from foreign sources, primarily China and India. We obtain other materials used in the drilling fluids business from various third party suppliers. We have encountered no serious shortages or delays in obtaining these raw materials. 
Technology — Proprietary technology and systems are an important aspect of our business strategy. We seek patents and licenses on new developments whenever we believe it creates a competitive advantage in the marketplace. We own patent rights in a family of high-performance water-based fluids systems, which we market as Evolution® and DeepDrill® systems, which are designed to enhance drilling performance and provide environmental benefits. We also rely on a variety of unpatented proprietary technologies and know-how in many of our applications. We believe that our reputation in the industry, the range of services we offer, ongoing technical development and know-how, responsiveness to customers and understanding of regulatory requirements are of equal or greater competitive significance than our existing proprietary rights.
Competition — We face competition from larger companies, including Halliburton and Schlumberger, which compete vigorously on fluids performance and/or price. In addition, these companies have broad product and service offerings in addition to their drilling fluids. We also have smaller regional competitors competing with us mainly on price and local relationships. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our businesses include a combination of technical proficiency, reputation, price, reliability, quality, breadth of services offered and experience. We believe that our competitive position is enhanced by our proprietary products and services.
Customers — Our customers are principally major integrated and independent oil and gas E&P companies operating in the markets that we serve. During 2017, approximately 51% of segment revenues were derived from the 20 largest segment customers, of which the largest customer represented 10% of our segment revenues. The segment also generated 55% of revenues domestically during 2017. Typically, in North America, we perform services either under short-term standard contracts or under “master” service agreements. Internationally, some customers issue multi-year contracts, but many are on a well-by-well, or project basis. As most agreements with our customers can be terminated upon short notice, our backlog is not significant. We do not derive a significant portion of our revenues from government contracts. See “Note 12 – Segment and Related Information” in our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on financial and geographic data.
Mats and Integrated Services
Our Mats and Integrated Services segment provides composite mat rentals, site construction and related site services to customers in various markets including oil and gas exploration and production (“E&P”), electrical transmission & distribution, pipeline, solar, petrochemical and construction across North America and Europe. We also sell composite mats to customers outside of the U.S. and to domestic customers outside of the E&P market. Following our efforts in recent years to diversify our customer base, Mats and Integrated Services segment revenues from non-E&P markets represented approximately two-thirds of our segment revenues in 2017.
We manufacture our DURA-BASE® Advanced Composite Mats for use in our rental operations as well as for third-party sales. Our mats provide environmental protection and ensure all-weather access to sites with unstable soil conditions. In order to support our efforts to expand our markets globally, we completed an expansion of our mats manufacturing facility in 2015 which nearly doubled our manufacturing capacity and significantly expanded our research and development capabilities. We continue to expand our product offerings, which now include the EPZ Grounding System™ for enhanced safety and efficiency for contractors working on power line maintenance and construction projects and the T-REX™ automated mat cleaning system to provide customers with a cost effective system to clean composite mats on site.

In November 2017, we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Well Service Group, Inc. and Utility Access Solutions, Inc. (together, “WSG”). Since 2012, WSG has been a strategic logistics and installation service provider for our Mats and Integrated Service segment, offering a variety of complementary services to our composite matting systems, including access road construction, site planning and preparation, environmental protection, fluids and spill storage/containment, erosion control, and site restoration services. The completion of the WSG acquisition expanded our service offering as well as our U.S. geographic footprint across the Northeast, Midwest, Rockies, and West Texas regions of the U.S. 
Raw Materials — We believe that our sources of supply for materials used in our business are adequate for our needs. We are not dependent upon any one supplier and we have encountered no serious shortages or delays in obtaining any raw materials. The resins, chemicals and other materials used to manufacture composite mats are widely available. Resin is the largest material component in the manufacturing of our composite mat products.
Technology — We have obtained patents related to the design and manufacturing of our DURA-BASE mats and several of the components, as well as other products and systems related to these mats (including the connecting pins and the EPZ Grounding System™). Using proprietary technology and systems is an important aspect of our business strategy. We believe that these products provide us with a distinct advantage over our competition. While we continue to add to our patent portfolio, two patents related to our DURA-BASE matting system will expire in May of 2020, and competitors may begin offering mats that include features described in those patents. We also believe that our reputation in the industry, the range of services we offer, ongoing technical development and know-how, responsiveness to customers and understanding of regulatory requirements also have competitive significance in the markets we serve.
Competition — Our market is fragmented and competitive, with many competitors providing various forms of site preparation products and services. The mat sales component of our business is not as fragmented as the rental and services segment with only a few competitors providing various alternatives to our DURA-BASE mat products, such as Signature Systems Group and Checkers Group. This is due to many factors, including large capital start-up costs and proprietary technology associated with this product. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our businesses include product capabilities, price, reputation, and reliability. We also believe that our competitive position is enhanced by our proprietary products, services and experience.
Customers — Our customers are principally infrastructure construction and oil and gas E&P companies operating in the markets that we serve. Approximately 63% of our segment revenues in 2017 were derived from the 20 largest segment customers, of which, the largest customer represented 15% of our segment revenues. The segment generated 91% of its revenues domestically during 2017. As a result of our efforts to expand beyond our traditional oilfield customer base, revenues from non E&P customers represented approximately 67% of segment revenues in 2017. Typically, we perform services either under short-term contracts or rental service agreements. As most agreements with our customers are cancelable upon short notice, our backlog is not significant. We do not derive a significant portion of our revenues from government contracts. See “Note 12 - Segment and Related Information” in our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on financial and geographic data.
Employees
At January 31, 2018, we employed approximately 2,400 full and part-time personnel none of which are represented by unions. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
Environmental Regulation
We seek to comply with all applicable legal requirements concerning environmental matters. Our business is affected by governmental regulations relating to the oil and gas industry in general, as well as environmental, health and safety regulations that have specific application to our business. Our activities are impacted by various federal and state regulatory agencies, and provincial pollution control, health and safety programs that are administered and enforced by regulatory agencies.
Additionally, our business exposes us to environmental risks. We have implemented various procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable regulations and reduce the risk of damage or loss. These include specified handling procedures and guidelines for waste, ongoing employee training, and monitoring and maintaining insurance coverage.
We also employ a corporate-wide web-based health, safety and environmental management system (“HSEMS”), which is ISO 14001:2004 compliant. The HSEMS is designed to capture information related to the planning, decision-making, and general operations of environmental regulatory activities within our operations. We also use the HSEMS to capture the information generated by regularly scheduled independent audits that are done to validate the findings of our internal monitoring and auditing procedures.
