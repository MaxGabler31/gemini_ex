Company Overview
Our platform, The Digital Forge, is an intuitive additive manufacturing platform powering engineers, designers and manufacturing professionals globally. The Digital Forge combines precise & reliable 3D printers and metal and composite proprietary materials with its cloud-based learning software offering to empower manufacturers to create more resilient and agile supply chains. Founded in 2013 by two MIT-educated engineers, Markforged is based in greater Boston, Massachusetts, where we have our own in-house manufacturing facility and where we design all of our industrial 3D printers, software and metal and composite proprietary materials.
Designed to scale into the future, our software-enabled platform delivers clear value today to thousands of customers (including both direct customers and customers of our value added resellers that have purchased one or more of our products) around the world. Our customers have printed millions of parts, meeting customer needs across the entire product development lifecycle, including prototyping, tooling, production and aftermarket spares and replacement parts as well as mid-volume and high-volume production parts. Blue chip customers in leading-edge industries such as aerospace, military and defense, industrial automation, space exploration, healthcare and automotive rely on our platform for mission-critical, end-use parts on-demand and at the point-of-need.
Our portfolio of rugged 3D printers include: (i) desktop printers that produce quality parts in settings where space is limited, (ii) industrial composite printers that provide powerful, predictable functionality through their software, sensors, materials and print modes and (iii) metal printers that can fabricate strong, complex metal parts in a variety of advanced metals. Across all our models, our powerful yet easy-to-use platform, and our industrial-grade materials, enable engineers to make functional parts for manufacturing environments and other demanding applications.
Our software platform was developed alongside our first printers and shipped as a fully integrated solution. As we have grown, we have continued to develop and scale our software, providing a single platform to interact with each of our hardware devices and driving consistent reliability for our customers. From simple file storage and versioning to accessible live telemetry, our products are designed to address the unseen minutiae that can inhibit manufacturers’ productivity. In a manufacturing ecosystem inundated with non-intuitive user experiences, the simplicity and power of our software drives adoption of our platform with higher customer satisfaction and retention rates.
Today, manufacturers face many limitations from idea generation to finished industrial goods. Part design is inherently limited by traditional subtractive manufacturing methods, such as Computer Numerically Controlled (“CNC”) machining. In addition, in many cases, the existing manufacturing workforce does not have the necessary skills to meet the demands of the next generation of manufacturing, which is embracing digital technologies.
We envision a different future where smart 3D printers distributed in networks that extend directly to the point-of-need can overcome these limitations. We are working to make this future a reality today. For example, a military customer stations Markforged printers in combat zones to create digital supply chains, producing parts in the field, on-demand. A state government customer recently sponsored a pandemic-readiness project that distributed 300 Markforged printers across the state to create a large emergency alert system for manufacturing physical parts on demand. As a further example, a global consumer products company has utilized Markforged printers in more than 30 factories to optimize assembly line production. As we continue to innovate with faster, larger and more precise machines capable of reliably printing more specific materials, we expect to see examples like these scale in both the value they deliver our customers and the impact of additive technology on the broader manufacturing industry.
   In 2014, we first commercialized our patented Continuous Fiber Reinforcement (“CFR”), which is a process that uses continuous strands of composite fibers to make parts as strong as and capable of replacing aluminum. In 2018, we released the Metal X system, which is now capable of printing 17-4 PH Stainless Steel, Copper, H13 Tool Steel, Inconel 635, and A2 and D2 Tool Steel in a shop or office environment. These products connect to our secure cloud infrastructure and are controlled via web browser, providing a single, simple digital workflow for printing both carbon fiber and metal for organizations that scale from one user to thousands. We have the ability to leverage data from our existing global fleet of printers connected to cloud architecture to enhance our research and development capabilities for the future benefit of our customers. The data generated by our fleet of thousands of connected printers flows into Blacksmith, an AI-powered, closed-loop manufacturing solution, which is currently offered as a software subscription.
For the years 2012 to 2020, according to the Wohlers Report 2021, the additive manufacturing industry grew at a CAGR of 24%, from $2 billion in 2012 to $12 billion in 2020. The Wohlers Report 2021 projects that for the 10 year period of 2020 to 2030, the additive manufacturing industry will grow at a similar CAGR of 25%, reaching $115 billion in 2030. As additive manufacturing technology adoption spreads across the $13 trillion global manufacturing industry, we believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of these trends due to our industry-leading materials, broad portfolio of products, and a cloud architecture that continually learns and will improve our global fleet of industrial printers.
The Markforged team combines cutting-edge technical expertise with industry experience in commercializing new technologies. Shai Terem, our President and Chief Executive Officer, is a veteran of the digital printing technology industry previously serving as President of the Americas at Kornit, where he led an aggressive and successful restructuring of the region and, prior to that, as Americas VP of Finance & Operations for Stratasys, where he held several operational responsibilities within the company. Mark Schwartz, our Chief Financial Officer, has extensive experience as a public company Chief Financial Officer as well as leading capital market transactions and as part of management teams at high-growth hardware manufacturing and SaaS and AI companies.
Industry Background
Traditional Manufacturing Faces Many Limitations.
Engineers and product developers are constrained by the physical parameters of conventional manufacturing processes. These parameters define the design possibilities, adding cost and lead time to manufacturing programs and placing firm boundaries on the performance of parts and products. Additive manufacturing lifts many of these limitations, opening up new design capabilities that allow engineers to harness and sustain measurable advantages in durability, weight and customizability.
Traditional manufacturing faces significant limitations that impact profitability and market responsiveness. In mature economies, like the United States, manufacturers find it increasingly difficult to hire the skilled technicians required to operate the legacy equipment that powers a majority of manufacturing operations. According to a 2020 report from The Economist, the generation of specialized tool and die makers that are exiting the labor market and the emerging workforce that is replacing these individuals are trained on completely different educational foundations built on information technology and digital aptitude.
We believe this phenomenon will intensify the struggle to find skilled technicians for businesses that fail to adopt modern manufacturing technologies.
Traditional manufacturing equipment and labor conditions require complex networks of supply sources or “nodes”, connected to one or more manufacturing hubs. These manufacturing hubs rely on intricate chains of logistics and distribution to deliver their products to the market and into the hands of end customers. Each supply node, manufacturing site and logistics bridge represents a single point of failure that has the potential to compromise business continuity and customer relationships in the event of disruptions. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic caused plant shutdowns, shipping port closures, labor strikes and myriad unforeseen changes in operating conditions. Digital manufacturing decouples part production from these complex and vulnerable supply chains, empowering individual “makers” and large, global businesses alike to position fabrication capabilities as close to the point of need as possible.
This flexibility also allows modern manufacturers to adapt to changing demand signals with greater responsiveness. As an example, in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, the collective 3D printing community was able to quickly produce early batches of face shields and other personal protective equipment. In contrast, many traditional manufacturers struggled in the face of global supply chain disruptions and significant spikes in demand for key products.
According to a Forbes article published on October 18, 2019, approximately 20% of every dollar in manufacturing is wasted. Additionally, the complex web of logistics and transportation required to convert raw material into goods in end customers’ hands add many wasteful steps. These factors increase costs to manufacturing programs and incur substantial carbon footprints. As modern
   businesses seek opportunities to reduce their ecological impacts, both due to proactive and conscientious attitudes as well as government regulations and emissions penalties, we believe that digital manufacturing solutions like The Digital Forge present a viable means of producing products more sustainably and at a lower cost.
Additive Manufacturing has the Potential to Overcome Many of these Limitations.
Additive manufacturing as a category has the potential to overcome many of the limitations of conventional manufacturing. The new design capabilities provide significant possibilities for superior products that drive higher performance and more closely match customer preferences. The simple, empowering interfaces used to operate our printers are more applicable to an emerging workforce that consists of digital natives trained in IT educational foundations. With additive manufacturing technology, manufacturers may now combat supply chain constraints, allowing them to respond more quickly to sharp changes in demand signals. Machines the size of microwave ovens that require no skilled labor can now help manufacturers circumvent expensive and time-consuming supply chains by printing parts when and where they are needed.
Most 3D Printing Solutions Today are Focused on Design and Prototyping Applications.
Despite the apparent benefits of additive manufacturing relative to conventional manufacturing, it has taken the industry nearly four decades to arrive at a solution that is widely adopted for applications beyond one-offs and prototypes. Part of the reason for such slow adoption is that before Markforged, there were only two limited categories of 3D printers available. On one end of the cost spectrum, there were relatively inexpensive machines that printed in brittle plastic, only suitable for concept models or mock-ups. On the other end of the cost spectrum, there were complicated, potentially hazardous systems that cost in excess of $1 million to implement and required highly skilled technicians to operate. Additionally, both categories were engineered as point solutions for a single factory, making distributed digital manufacturing across a network of printers cumbersome or infeasible. For these reasons, neither of these choices was appropriate for the manufacturing floor or distributed manufacturing at scale.
Markforged is Delivering the Promise of Additive Manufacturing Today.
We invented The Digital Forge, a platform designed to overcome both the constraints of conventional manufacturing as well as the limitations of legacy 3D printing solutions. Manufacturers can produce parts that are functionally applicable for the most demanding engineering applications on affordable machines roughly the size of a microwave or conventional oven. The parts printed on The Digital Forge are based in continuous carbon fiber, a high-strength material that empowers engineers to use the parts for applications that were previously reserved for metal parts. Moreover, the software that powers The Digital Forge was designed to be cloud-first. In contrast to legacy additive solutions, Markforged’s printers can be accessed and controlled from anywhere in the world and entire libraries of part inventory can be digitized and printed only when needed. This smart, simple, empowering and robust platform is designed to give engineers, designers and manufacturing professionals the power to solve their manufacturing problems today and build anything they imagine.
Our Growth Strategy
Our future growth is driven by five key strategies:
•Continue to Fuel Integrated Platform with Software Solutions. Our integrated platform is designed to scale in both capability and size over time. As we invest additional resources into the feature set of our platform, we expect to be able to solve more customer problems and applications. As we solve more problems, customers will print more parts. As we print more parts, more data will be generated, making our premium software solutions, including Blacksmith and enterprise-grade fleet management, smarter. As our premium software solutions get smarter, we will be able to print better, more accurate parts. As we print better parts, more customers will adopt our premium software solutions, which will continue to drive this growth and improvement cycle more rapidly. 
 •Expand Customer Use Cases and Applications. As we develop printers that are faster, larger and more precise, and add new industrial materials to our capabilities, we continually expand the possible use cases for our customers. We regularly release new printers, software functionality and materials that customers may apply to a variety of new problems and use cases. 
 •Drive Deeper, More Efficient Go-To-Market Coverage. As we grow our global distribution footprint and drive optimizations in our go-to-market model, we will grow our sales. For example, in the last year, we formed partnerships with global distributors, such as DesignPoint, Hawk Ridge Systems, LLC, GovSmart, Inc., MLC CAD Systems, LLC, Mark3D UK Limited, Würth Additive Group, Phillips Corporation and others, providing the opportunity to scale and access to hundreds of thousands of potential manufacturing customers across the world. 

   •Expand Position as a Trusted Brand. Due to the innovative technology that we have invented, which is addressing significant global problems in manufacturing, we have the opportunity to invest resources to build a meaningful industrial technology brand. As our brand grows, we expect to generate more organic interest in our products, lowering our cost-to-acquire customers, which will facilitate our growth and improvement cycle and help expand our business. 
 •Target Strategic M&A Opportunities. We expect to grow inorganically by acquiring companies with technologies and people to complement our platform and team. 
 Our Competitive Strengths
•Markforged delivers accessible, industrial-strength parts. We offer a range of proprietary composite and metal materials that address numerous industrial applications. We invented and patented the CFR composite additive manufacturing process. The capabilities that CFR enables are unmatched by our competitors, and a significant portion of our customers use our CFR materials today to replace traditionally manufactured steel and aluminum parts. In addition, we have designed and optimized the Metal X printer, a loose powder-free metal device that can be purchased for approximately $100,000. Conventional metal 3D printing solutions have MSRPs starting at $250,000 and those that exceed $1,000,000. The lower acquisition cost for the Metal X broadens the potential market for these machines and presents a more compelling path to value. 
 •Markforged offers customers a clear and tangible ROI. We provide simple, cost-effective and reliable solutions to manufacture mission critical parts. With The Digital Forge platform, our customers can realize significant cost and time savings, relative to conventional manufacturing, which in turn drives purchases of incremental printers and further development of new applications. For example, one global consumer products customer that purchased its first printer in 2019 realized 45 times cost savings on a key application tool for its automated assembly line. Since the initial purchase, that customer has purchased more than 30 printers primarily focused on this application. 
 •Markforged’s integrated, modern software platform drives faster innovation. We built our entire platform on cloud-based architecture, bringing benefits traditionally confined to Software as a Service (“SaaS”) space to hardware. This architecture connects us to our customer’s printers in the field, creating a fleet of connected printers generating data to power our AI-learning algorithms that in turn guides the future development of our 3D printers with each part printed. 
 •Visionary and experienced management team. Our leadership team is passionate about the future of manufacturing. Shai Terem, our President and Chief Executive Officer, has extensive operational experience in additive manufacturing and digital printing. Our Chief Financial Officer, Mark Schwartz, has spent much of his career delivering complex contract manufacturing services to hardware OEMs. Our SVP of Sales, Ken Clayton, has spent his career partnering with hardware resellers to provide CAD solutions.

3D Printers
We offer a rugged line of 3D printers all designed around one goal - putting functional parts in our customers’ hands. Our machines combine high build quality, intuitive user experience and broad platform connectivity. Featuring unibody aluminum frames and precision mechanical components, our printers produce reliable, repeatable results.
   We offer three principal categories of 3D printers and systems:
•Desktop: Our Desktop 3D Printers are precision-built professional machines designed to reliably print quality parts. These printers deliver precise results with a smaller form factor, making them ideal when space is at a premium. 
 •Industrial: Our Industrial 3D Printers provide best-in-class predictability and functionality through sensors, software, materials and print modes. 
 •Metal: Our Metal 3D Printers fabricate complex metal parts in a variety of advanced metals. 
 In November 2021, we debuted the FX20 industrial 3D printer which is capable of printing high-temperature thermoplastics reinforced with continuous carbon fiber. This is the largest and most precise machine we have produced to date.
 We also offer the Onyx Pro, Onyx One, Mark Two desktop composite printers, the X3, X5, X7 industrial composite printers, a ruggedized X7 Field Edition composite printer, and the Wash-1, Sinter-1, and Sinter-2 which are components of the Metal X system.
Materials
We offer the only industrial 3D printing family for fabricating Composite, Continuous Fiber and Metal parts on the same platform. All the materials available for printing on The Digital Forge are safe and easy to handle and offer a high degree of flexibility for part design and manufacturing. Our 3D printers are simple to use and do not require intensive buildouts or trained technicians. We currently offer the following materials:
•Composite: Onyx, Onyx FR, Onyx FR-A, Onyx ESD, ULTEM 9085 Filament, Nylon, and Precise PLA.
 •Continuous Fiber: Carbon Fiber, Carbon Fiber FR, Carbon Fiber FR-A, Aramid Fiber (Kevlar®), HSHT Fiberglass, and Fiberglass.
 •Metal: 17-4 PH Stainless Steel, Copper, Inconel 625, H13 Tool Steel, and A2 and D2 Tool Steel. 
 Our customers can print the right material for the right applications. If a customer requires strength and low weight, composites can replace metal parts and accelerate production times. If customers need something to withstand high temperatures and provide wear resistance, metals can be utilized. In addition, customers can combine parts made of different materials for even higher-performing parts using the CFR process.
CFR augments traditional Fused Filament Fabrication (“FFF”) technology, enabling our printers to reinforce FFF parts with continuous fibers. A CFR-capable machine uses two extrusion systems for two unique materials: one for conventional FFF polymer filament, and a second for long strand continuous fibers. Continuous fibers are laid down in-layer, replacing FFF infill. As a result, a CFR-capable printer can print both traditional FFF-only parts or CFR parts (FFF parts reinforced with continuous fibers).
CFR represents a step-change improvement in part performance for only an incremental increase in effort. CFR parts are significantly stronger (up to 25 times stronger than ABS plastics) and can replace machined aluminum parts. The process is inherently flexible: simple enough for anyone to use and powerful enough to enable deep customization of part mechanical properties. This means that an engineer can reinforce a part with continuous fibers with two clicks of a button and customize reinforcement on a layer-by-layer basis on the same platform. With five available fibers and multiple reinforcement techniques that can be granularly configured, parts can be highly customized for applications. We believe the capabilities that CFR enables are unmatched by current alternatives.
Software
Our software pairs advanced 3D printing software with the first connected additive manufacturing platform. Our software is an integrated platform designed to help customers get from design to part quickly. It empowers users to take control of their manufacturing workflow in three ways:
•Advanced part slicing and printing. Our software is an integrated, connected platform designed to take customers from CAD to functional part quickly. The browser-based workflow is secure, fast and intuitive. Users can design parts for printing with a single click, or drill deeply into part settings to specially optimize part properties. Our software fully integrates with all of Markforged’s 3D printers, enabling customers to create builds, print parts, and monitor prints in a seamless workflow. 

   •Integrated cloud part repository. A secure part library enables customers to dynamically manage engineering projects of any size. Our software’s part files are securely stored and can be versioned, edited and printed anywhere. Easy-to-use filters and folders enable customers to quickly store and find the parts they need when they need it. 
 •Real time enterprise-grade fleet management accessible through premium software subscriptions. Our premium software subscription provides a single place to manage our customers’ printer fleets in real time, whether in one spot or worldwide.

This includes allowing our employees to work remotely as appropriate, while implementing significant safety measures designed to protect the health of all those working in and entering our facilities.
Intellectual Property
 
Our ability to drive innovation in the additive manufacturing market depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights, both in the United States and abroad, through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as through contractual provisions and restrictions on access to our proprietary technology which includes nondisclosure and invention assignment agreements with our consultants and employees and through non-disclosure agreements with our vendors and business partners. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in both general and product-specific terms of use. Unpatented research, development, know-how and engineering skills make an important contribution to our business, but we pursue patent protection when we believe it is possible and consistent with our overall strategy for safeguarding intellectual property.
 As of December 31, 2021, we own 50 issued United States patents, 36 issued foreign patents and have 109 pending or allowed patent applications. Our patents and patent applications are directed to, among other things, additive manufacturing and related technologies.
    We have 2 issued United States trademarks and 20 issued foreign trademarks, including “Markforged” in the European Union, Australia, Canada, China, Israel, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. We have no pending United States trademark applications and 3 pending foreign applications.
 Government Regulations
We are subject to various laws, regulations and permitting requirements of federal, state and local authorities, including related to environmental, health and safety; anti-corruption and export controls. We believe that we are in material compliance with all such laws, regulations and permitting requirements.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to domestic and foreign environmental laws and regulations governing our operations, including, but not limited to, emissions into the air and water and the use, handling, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances. A certain risk of environmental liability is inherent in our production activities. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, the generation, use, storage, registration, handling and disposal of chemicals and waste materials, the presence of specified substances in electrical products, the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air or water, the cleanup of contaminated sites, including any contamination that results from spills due to our failure to properly dispose of chemicals and other waste materials and the health and safety of our employees. We are required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain operations.
The export of our products internationally from our production facilities subjects us to environmental laws and regulations concerning the import and export of chemicals and hazardous substances such as the United States Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”) and the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical Substances (“REACH”). These laws and regulations require the evaluation and registration of some chemicals that we ship along with, or that form a part of, our systems and other products.
Export and Trade Matters
We are subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations imposed by governments around the world with jurisdiction over our operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, as well as the laws of the countries where we do business. We are also subject to various trade restrictions, including trade and economic sanctions and export controls, imposed by governments around the world with jurisdiction over our operations. For example, in accordance with trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control and the U.S. Department of Commerce, we are prohibited from engaging in transactions involving certain persons and certain designated countries or territories. In addition, our products are subject to export regulations that can involve significant compliance time and may add additional overhead cost to our products. In recent years, the United States government has a renewed focus on export matters related to additive manufacturing. Some of our products are already more tightly controlled for export, and other of our products may in the future become more tightly controlled for export. For example, the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 and regulatory guidance thereunder have imposed additional controls and may result in the imposition of further additional controls, on the export of certain “emerging and foundational technologies.” Our current and future products may be subject to these heightened regulations, which could increase our compliance costs.
