Overview
We are a clinical stage biotechnology company developing therapeutics which target immunomodulatory receptors present on immune effector cells involved in allergy, inflammatory and proliferative diseases. Activating these immunomodulatory receptors allows us to directly target cells involved in disease pathogenesis and, in the setting of allergy and inflammation, has the potential to result in broad inhibition of inflammatory cells. In the setting of proliferative diseases, blocking the inhibitory function of the receptors could restore the immune cell’s ability to identify and kill proliferative cells. Our most advanced antibodies are lirentelimab (AK002) and AK006. Lirentelimab selectively targets both mast cells and eosinophils, two types of white blood cells that are widely distributed in the body and play a central role in the inflammatory response. Inappropriately activated mast cells and eosinophils have been identified as key drivers in a number of severe diseases affecting the gastrointestinal tract, eyes, skin, lungs and other organs. We are developing lirentelimab for the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis (“EoE”), eosinophilic gastritis (“EG”), eosinophilic duodenitis (“EoD”), atopic dermatitis, chronic spontaneous urticaria and potentially additional indications. Lirentelimab has received orphan disease status for EG, EoD, and EoE from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”).
AK006 targets Siglec-6, an inhibitory receptor expressed selectively on mast cells. AK006 appears to have the potential to provide deeper mast cell inhibition than lirentelimab and, in addition to its inhibitory activity, reduce mast cell numbers. We plan to begin human studies with AK006 in the first half of 2023.
To date, lirentelimab has completed a Phase 2 study (ENIGMA 1) and Phase 3 study (ENIGMA 2) in patients with EG and/or EoD, a Phase 2/3 study in patients with EoE (KRYPTOS), as well as proof of concept studies in chronic spontaneous urticaria, severe allergic conjunctivitis, and indolent systemic mastocytosis.
 The Phase 2 EG and/or EoD study with lirentelimab (ENIGMA 1) met all prespecified primary and secondary endpoints when compared to placebo and results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine. More recently, the ENIGMA 2 study met the histologic co-primary endpoint but failed to meet the symptomatic co-primary endpoint when compared to placebo. Similarly, the KRYPTOS study met the histologic co-primary endpoint but failed to meet the symptomatic co-primary endpoint when compared to placebo. After conducting post-hoc analyses, we believe that the trials missed their symptomatic co-primary endpoints due to the inclusion of mild patients and/or patients who had not failed standard of care. Although post-hoc analyses cannot be used to establish efficacy, these analyses can be helpful in generating hypothesis for future clinical studies. Based on these analyses, we believe that lirentelimab may have potential to treat the more severe EG/EoD and EoE patient populations. As a result, we plan to conduct additional studies with lirentelimab in these indications after discussions with the FDA.
 EoE is a severe orphan gastrointestinal disease characterized by dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) resulting from inflammation caused by elevated and inappropriately activated mast cells and eosinophils. The estimated prevalence of EoE in the United States is approximately 150,000-200,000 patients and there are no treatments currently approved specifically for this disease.
 EG and/or EoD are chronic, often severe, inflammatory diseases characterized by persistent gastrointestinal symptoms and elevated and activated eosinophils in the stomach and/or duodenum, respectively. Emerging data suggests that activated mast cells also contribute to disease pathogenesis. Common symptoms of the diseases include abdominal pain, nausea, bloating, cramping, early satiety and loss of appetite. There are no treatments approved specifically for these diseases. Treatment with systemic steroids can provide symptomatic improvement, but long-term treatment with steroids is generally not possible due to the numerous side effects. Published literature reports the prevalence of EG and EoD in the United States to be approximately 50,000 people. However, we believe that these diseases may be significantly underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed as other gastrointestinal diseases.
 Beyond EoE, EG and EoD, additional lirentelimab clinical testing is ongoing or planned. Allakos initiated a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of subcutaneous (SC) lirentelimab in adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. The company also announced plans to initiate a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of SC lirentelimab in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria in the middle of 2022. Both diseases are complex, chronic inflammatory skin diseases believed to be driven by activated eosinophils and mast cells.


Atopic dermatitis is a chronic pruritic inflammatory condition that is characterized by dry, red, itchy patches of skin. Atopic dermatitis affects approximately 16.5 million (7.3%) adults in the U.S., of which around 6.6 million (40%) have moderate-to-severe disease. Chronic urticaria is an often-debilitating skin condition characterized by frequent and unpredictable eruption of hives, severe itching and swelling. Chronic urticaria affects up to 3.5 million patients in the U.S., of which half are refractory to standard-of-care antihistamines.
 
Figure 1: Expected Development Timeline
 


Lirentelimab has shown activity in open label clinical studies in indolent systemic mastocytosis (“ISM”, see Indolent Systemic Mastocytosis for clinical results), severe allergic conjunctivitis (“SAC”, see severe allergic conjunctivitis for clinical results), and mast cell gastrointestinal disease (“MGID”, see mast cell gastritis clinical results). In addition, patients in clinical studies with atopic comorbidities such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, and allergic rhinitis experienced improvements in these conditions. The activity observed in these studies suggests that lirentelimab could provide significant benefit to patients suffering from these diseases and highlights the potential of lirentelimab to broadly inhibit mast cells and deplete eosinophils in different disease settings.
Figure 2: Allakos Pipeline
 


To date, lirentelimab has been administered intravenously in our completed clinical efficacy studies. Lirentelimab has generally been well-tolerated in each of our clinical trials. The most common adverse event with

intravenous lirentelimab has been the occurrence of mild to moderate infusion related reactions, consisting of flushing, feeling of warmth, headache, nausea or dizziness, which occurred mostly during the first infusion and diminished or did not occur on subsequent infusions.
We have also developed a formulation of lirentelimab for subcutaneous (“SC”) administration which will be used in all current and future studies. SC lirentelimab has completed a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of SC lirentelimab (for additional information, see “Lirentelimab Clinical Development–Subcutaneous Lirentelimab”). SC lirentelimab provided prolonged eosinophil depletion and was well tolerated; there were no serious adverse events, no injection site reactions, and no injection-related reactions.
    Understanding the Foundation of Our Approach
 
Background on Mast Cells, Eosinophils, Siglec-8 and Siglec-6
 Mast cells and eosinophils are involved in many inflammatory conditions and therefore represent attractive drug targets. Mast cells and eosinophils can respond to signals from allergens, tissues, bacteria, viruses and also cells of the innate and adaptive immune system. In response, they release a large variety of mediators which can result in tissue damage, fibrosis and the recruitment and activation of other innate and adaptive immune cells. The ability to respond to signals from multiple cell types and the diverse array of mediators that they produce place mast cells and eosinophils in the center of multiple aspects of the inflammatory response.
 Eosinophils are normally present in the blood and tissues, especially in the mucosal linings of the respiratory and lower gastrointestinal tract. However, they can be recruited to any site of the body in the setting of inflammation. Mast cells reside within tissues and all vascularized organs, often located in close proximity to blood vessels, nerves and lymphatics. Sites include the dermis, gut mucosa and submucosa, conjunctiva and pulmonary alveoli and airways. As a result of their widespread location and potent inflammatory activity, mast cells and eosinophils have been identified as key drivers in a number of severe diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, eyes, skin and lungs as well as diseases which affect multiple organ systems.
 Siglec-8 is an inhibitory receptor selectively expressed on eosinophils and mast cells. Because Siglec-8 is expressed in high abundance only on mast cells and eosinophils, it presents a novel way to selectively target these important immune cells. Siglec-6 is an inhibitory receptor that our research shows is selectively expressed on mast cells. As inhibitory receptors, the natural function of Siglec-8 and Siglec-6 is to counteract activating signals within mast cells and eosinophils that lead to an inflammatory response.

Mast cells and Eosinophils are Effector Cells That are Central to Initiating and Maintaining Inflammatory Responses
 Mast cells and/or eosinophils respond to a variety of activating signals including those from cell-cell contact, allergens bound to IgE, neuropeptides (such as Substance P), cytokines including IL-33, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (“TSLP”), IL-5, IL-4 and IL-13 and viruses through Toll-Like Receptors. In response to these and other activating signals, mast cells and eosinophils produce a broad range of inflammatory mediators that cause tissue damage and contribute to acute and chronic inflammation. These mediators include vasoactive amines, bioactive lipids, proteases, chemokines and cytokines. The mediators, their functions and their contribution to disease pathogenesis are described in more detail below.
 •Mast cells play an important role in inflammation as the main producer of histamine. Histamine causes vasodilation and produces intense itching. It is believed to contribute to increased gastrointestinal peristalsis (diarrhea), the skin symptoms of urticaria and ISM, the diffuse vasodilation of anaphylaxis and bronchospasm in asthma.
 •Proteases secreted from mast cells and eosinophils are the key cause of tissue damage and contribute to tissue fibrosis. Eosinophil and mast cell secretions are toxic to surrounding cells and break down tissues, resulting in fibrosis and tissue remodeling.
 •Mast cells and eosinophils drive inflammation by signaling to other cells of the immune system. Mast cells and eosinophils release lipid mediators and a large variety of cytokines including TNFa, IL-1, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-9, IL-13, MCP-1, CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CCL17, TGFa, TGFb and 


granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, that attract and activate cells of the innate and adaptive immune system, such as neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, basophils, B-cells, T-cells and dendritic cells, as well as other mast cells and eosinophils.
 
Figure 3. Mast Cell and Eosinophil Functions
 




   Due to their ability to respond to signals from multiple cell types and elicit responses from others, mast cells and eosinophils mediate the immediate hypersensitivity and late phase responses responsible for allergies and many innate and adaptive immune responses.
Siglec-8 is an Attractive Target for Mast Cell and Eosinophil Driven Diseases
 Siglec-8 (sialic acid immunoglobulin-like lectin 8) is a constitutively expressed inhibitory receptor that is restricted to eosinophils, mast cells and to a lesser extent, basophils (approximately 1/100 the level on mast cells and eosinophils). The physiological function of Siglec-8 is to provide an inhibitory signal to mast cells and eosinophils. Siglec-8 exerts these effects through an intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (“ITIM”) and ITIM-like motif. In contrast to approaches which block a single activating cytokine or receptor, targeting the ITIM signaling cascade (via Siglec-8) has the potential to counteract a broad array of activating signals, which could allow for the treatment of multiple diseases. Antibodies to Siglec-8 have been shown to trigger antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (“ADCC”) of blood eosinophils and apoptosis of tissue eosinophils and to inhibit the release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells.
Figure 4. Siglec-8 Triggers Apoptosis of Eosinophils and Inhibition of Mast Cells
 


Lirentelimab (AK002) Binds to Siglec-8
 Lirentelimab was designed to take advantage of the selective expression pattern and inhibitory function of Siglec-8, an inhibitory receptor found on eosinophils and mast cells. Lirentelimab is a humanized antibody that binds to Siglec-8 with high affinity (bivalent binding avidity KD = 17 pM, determined by surface plasmon resonance analysis). Binding of lirentelimab to Siglec-8 on mast cells and eosinophils triggers apoptosis of eosinophils and inhibition of mast cells. Lirentelimab is a non-fucosylated IgG1 antibody engineered to have potent ADCC. ADCC is a mechanism whereby the binding of an antibody like lirentelimab to a target cell in the blood, such as an eosinophil, triggers a natural killer (“NK”) cell, to bind to the Fc portion of the antibody bound to the target cell, thereby destroying the antibody-bound cell. This provides lirentelimab with an additional mechanism to deplete eosinophils present in blood. As a result of these dual modes of action, lirentelimab has been shown to deplete eosinophils in blood and tissue, and to inhibit the release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells.
Siglec-6 is an Attractive Target for Mast Cell Driven Diseases
 Siglec-6 (sialic acid immunoglobulin-like lectin 6) is a constitutively expressed inhibitory receptor that is selectively expressed on mast cells. The physiological function of Siglec-6 is to provide an inhibitory signal to mast cells. Siglec-6 exerts these effects through an intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (“ITIM”) and ITIM-like motif. In preclinical studies, AK006, our humanized antibody to Siglec-6 reduces mast cell numbers and has been shown to have broader and deeper inhibition of mast cell activity than lirentelimab, including the ability to inhibit c-KIT activation. The increased inhibitory activity could give AK006 increased therapeutic activity while avoiding toxicities associated with less selective mast cell targeting drugs.

Our Strategy
 
Lirentelimab has shown activity in human clinical studies as well as activity in a broad array of animal disease models of mast cell and eosinophil driven diseases. We have prioritized our lirentelimab development efforts based on our assessment of the probability of clinical and regulatory success, unmet medical need and potential market opportunity. We have assembled a team with a proven track record and deep experience in antibody discovery and in clinical development, operations and finance.
The key elements of our strategy are to:
 •Advance lirentelimab through clinical development in Eosinophilic Gastrointestinal Diseases (“EGIDs”). Lirentelimab has secured orphan drug designation for the treatment of EoE, EG and EoD from the FDA. Despite positive results from the Phase 2 EG and/or EoD study with lirentelimab (ENIGMA 1), the ENIGMA 2 failed to meet the symptomatic co-primary endpoint when compared to placebo. Similarly, the KRYPTOS study met the histologic co-primary endpoint but failed to meet the symptomatic co-primary endpoint when compared to placebo. After conducting post-hoc analyses, we believe that the trials missed their symptomatic co-primary endpoints due to the inclusion of mild patients and/or patients who had not failed standard of care. Based on these analyses, we believe that lirentelimab may have potential to treat the more severe EG/EoD and EoE patient populations. As a result, we plan to conduct additional studies with SC lirentelimab in these indications after discussions with the FDA.
 •Evaluate additional eosinophilic and mast cell driven conditions. We have an ongoing Phase 2 trial in patients with AD and a planned Phase 2b trial in patients with CSU. These diseases are believed to be driven by activated eosinophils and mast cells. We have also completed trials in patients with MGID, CU, ISM, and SAC and will continue to evaluate potential commercial opportunities in these, as well as other indications.
 •Build therapeutic pipeline. Our research is focused on immunomodulatory receptors present on immune effector cells involved in allergy, inflammatory and proliferative diseases. Activating these immunomodulatory receptors allows us to directly target cells involved in disease pathogenesis and, in 


the setting of allergy and inflammation, has the potential to result in broad inhibition of inflammatory cells. In the setting of proliferative diseases, blocking the inhibitory the function of the receptors could restore the immune cell’s ability to identify and kill proliferative cells. Following this approach, we have developed lirentelimab and AK006 and have research programs directed at other immunomodulatory targets.
 
Lirentelimab Clinical Development
To date, lirentelimab has completed a Phase 2 study (ENIGMA 1) and Phase 3 study (ENIGMA 2) in patients with EG and/or EoD, a Phase 2/3 study in patients with EoE (KRYPTOS), as well as proof of concept studies in chronic spontaneous urticaria, severe allergic conjunctivitis, and indolent systemic mastocytosis. In addition, phase 2 clinical studies are being conducted or planned in atopic dermatitis and chronic spontaneous urticaria.
 The Phase 2 EG and/or EoD study with lirentelimab (ENIGMA 1) met all prespecified primary and secondary endpoints when compared to placebo and results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine. More recently, the ENIGMA 2 study met the histologic co-primary endpoint but failed to meet the symptomatic co-primary endpoint when compared to placebo. Similarly, the KRYPTOS study met the histologic co-primary endpoint but failed to meet the symptomatic co-primary endpoint when compared to placebo. After conducting post-hoc analyses, we believe that the trials missed their symptomatic co-primary endpoints due to the inclusion of mild patients and/or patients who had not failed standard of care. Although post-hoc analyses cannot be used to establish efficacy, these analyses can be helpful in generating hypothesis for future clinical studies. Based on these analyses, we believe that lirentelimab may have potential to treat the more severe EG/EoD and EoE patient populations. As a result, we plan to conduct additional studies with SC lirentelimab in these indications after discussions with the FDA.
    Subcutaneous Lirentelimab
 To date, lirentelimab has been administered intravenously in our completed clinical efficacy studies. We have developed a formulation of lirentelimab for SC administration which will be used in all current and future studies. SC Lirentelimab completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single dose, dose ranging Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of SC lirentelimab. Administration of SC lirentelimab resulted in extended eosinophil suppression at all dose levels tested. At dose levels of 3.0 and 5.0 mg/kg and with the fixed dose of 300 mg, SC lirentelimab resulted in eosinophil suppression in all subjects through Day 85. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results suggest that SC lirentelimab may be given monthly or potentially less frequently. SC lirentelimab was well tolerated, and there were no serious adverse events, no injection site reactions, and no injection-related reactions with SC lirentelimab.
Eosinophilic Gastrointestinal Diseases (“EGIDs”)
 EGIDs are a collection of chronic inflammatory disorders that share a similar eosinophilic driven inflammation that occurs along different segments of the gastrointestinal (“GI”) tract. Based on the site of eosinophilic infiltration, EGIDs are categorized into EoE (esophagus), EG (stomach), EoD (duodenum), and eosinophilic colitis (colon). There are no treatments currently approved specifically for these diseases and lirentelimab has secured orphan drug designation for EG, EoD, and EoE from the FDA.
It is believed that EGIDs arise in some patients from food allergies or other allergens that cause a hypersensitivity reaction that leads to recruitment of eosinophils to the GI tract. Mast cells are also elevated and activated and are believed to play a significant role. The gastrointestinal symptoms are believed to be due to the release of inflammatory mediators from activated eosinophils and mast cells. Elevated serum immunoglobulin E (“IgE”) levels and food-specific IgE are correlated with EG in some patients and provide evidence for the allergy hypothesis and mast cell involvement. We have demonstrated that in biopsies of patients with symptomatic EG, mast cells are present in elevated numbers compared to normal controls and that the mast cells are also in an increased activation state, providing additional evidence for a pathogenic role of mast cells in EGIDs.
     
Figure 6. Mast Cells and Eosinophils are Elevated in EGIDs
 


Because lirentelimab has the potential to directly deplete eosinophils and broadly inhibits mast cells, we believe it has the potential to overcome limitations of other agents acting only on one cell type or pathway.

Eosinophilic Esophagitis
 EoE is an orphan disease characterized by eosinophil and mast cell driven inflammation of the esophagus. Common symptoms of EoE include dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), food impaction, nausea and vomiting. Diagnosis is established based on clinical presentation (dysphagia) combined with increased tissue eosinophils in biopsy specimens from the esophagus without any other cause for the eosinophilia. The presence of greater than 15 eosinophils per HPF in an esophageal biopsy identifies the presence of EoE. The estimated prevalence of EoE in the United States is approximately 150,000-200,000 patients.
Eosinophilic Gastritis and Eosinophilic Duodenitis
 EG and EoD are diseases characterized by chronic inflammation due to infiltration of eosinophils and mast cells into layers of the stomach and duodenum. Symptoms commonly include abdominal pain, nausea, early satiety, loss of appetite, abdominal cramping, bloating, malnutrition and weight loss. EG and EoD can occur with eosinophilia isolated to the stomach or duodenum, or often in combination. Diagnosis is established based on clinical presentation (gastrointestinal symptoms) combined with increased tissue eosinophils in biopsy specimens from the stomach and/or duodenum without any other cause for the eosinophilia. The presence of greater than or equal to 30 eosinophils per high-powered field (“HPF”) in 5 HPFs in the stomach indicates the presence of EG, and the presence of greater than or equal to 30 eosinophils per HPF in 3 HPFs in the duodenum indicates the presence of EoD. Based on ICD-9 codes, the prevalence of EG and EoD in the United States has previously been reported in the literature to be approximately 50,000 patients. However, we believe these diseases may be significantly under-diagnosed, or mis-diagnosed as other gastrointestinal diseases (such as irritable bowel syndrome or functional dyspepsia), based on observations from the ENIGMA study, ENIGMA 2 study as well as results of a prevalence study we conducted to assess the prevalence of EG and EoD in patients with chronic gastrointestinal symptoms.
Current Therapies and Limitations
 There are no FDA-approved treatments for EG, EoD or EoE. Current therapies and disease management strategies include restricted/elemental diets and systemic or topical corticosteroids. Restricted/elemental diets are designed to avoid foods which trigger symptoms. Unfortunately for most patients the restricted/elemental diets are only partially effective and mainly used as a strategy to provide nutrition despite continuing symptoms. Corticosteroids, systemic or topical, can provide symptom relief, but are not appropriate for long-term treatment due to their numerous side effects.


ENIGMA Study: Phase 2 Study in Patients with EG and/or EoD
 
Study Design
 The ENIGMA study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study of lirentelimab enrolled patients with active, biopsy-confirmed EG and/or EoD. Patients were required to be moderately to severely symptomatic based on a patient reported symptom questionnaire and to subsequently have biopsy confirmed eosinophilia of the stomach (≥ 30 eosinophils/HPF in 5 HPFs) and/or duodenum (≥ 30 eosinophils/HPF in 3 HPFs). Qualifying patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive: (a) 0.3 mg/kg of lirentelimab for the first month followed by three doses of 1.0 mg/kg given monthly, (b) 0.3 mg/kg of lirentelimab for the first month followed by 1.0 mg/kg, 3.0 mg/kg and 3.0 mg/kg given monthly, or (c) a monthly placebo. Disease symptoms were measured daily using a patient reported symptom questionnaire that scored 8 symptoms on a scale from 0 to 10 (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, early satiety, loss of appetite, abdominal cramping, bloating, and diarrhea). Endpoints were assessed per protocol in a prespecified hierarchical order using biopsies collected at the end of study and symptom questionnaires collected over the last two weeks of study prior to biopsy. The primary endpoint was the percent change from baseline in the number of tissue eosinophils obtained from gastric or duodenal biopsies. The secondary endpoints were (1) proportion of patients with a greater than 75% reduction in tissue eosinophil counts from biopsies and a greater than 30% reduction in Total Symptom Score (“TSS”) from the patient reported questionnaire and (2) the percent change from baseline in the TSS.
Study Results
 Lirentelimab showed a statistically significant benefit when compared to placebo on all primary and secondary endpoints for each of the high dose, low dose, and combined high/low dose lirentelimab groups. The data demonstrate that lirentelimab produced histological resolution of gastrointestinal tissue eosinophilia and improved disease symptoms, and that these benefits occurred in the same individuals. Results from this study were published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

Safety
 Lirentelimab was generally well tolerated. The only treatment emergent adverse event occurring more frequently on lirentelimab than on placebo was mild to moderate IRRs, such as flushing, feeling of warmth, headache, nausea, and/or dizziness, which occurred in 60% of patients receiving lirentelimab versus 23% of patients receiving placebo. There was 1 drug-related serious adverse event (“SAE”) in the study, consisting of an infusion-related reaction (“IRR”) that resolved within 24 hours. Treatment emergent SAEs occurred in 9% of patients receiving lirentelimab versus 14% of patients receiving placebo.
 Results in Patients with EoE
 Esophageal eosinophil counts and dysphagia improved in patients with comorbid eosinophilic esophagitis.

Steroid Use
 All allowed baseline medications remained constant throughout the baseline period and study. Acute steroids could be used at the physician’s discretion to prevent or treat IRRs. Acute steroid use was balanced between lirentelimab and placebo groups with 28% and 35% of patients in the lirentelimab and placebo group receiving acute steroids, respectively. Statistically significant results were also observed on all primary and secondary endpoints in the subgroup of patients who did not receive acute steroids.
 ENIGMA 2: Phase 3 Study in Patients with EG and/or EoD
 Study Design
 The ENIGMA 2 study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial of intravenous lirentelimab enrolled 180 patients with EG and/or EoD. Patients were required to be moderately to severely symptomatic based on a patient reported symptom questionnaire and have biopsy-confirmed eosinophilia of the stomach (≥30 eosinophils/HPF in 5 HPFs) and/or duodenum (≥30 eosinophils/HPF in 3 HPFs). Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive: 1.0 mg/kg of lirentelimab for the first month followed by five doses of 3.0 mg/kg given monthly or (b) a monthly placebo. Disease symptoms were measured daily using a patient reported symptom questionnaire that scored 6 symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, bloating, early satiety, abdominal cramping, loss of appetite) each on a scale from 0 to 10 (TSS). Co-primary endpoints were (1) proportion of responders with ≤4 eosinophils/hpf in 5 HPFs in the stomach and/or ≤15 eosinophils/HPF in 3 HPFs in the duodenum at the end of week 24 and (2) absolute change from baseline in TSS at weeks 23-24.
Study Results
 Lirentelimab showed a statistically significant benefit when compared to placebo on the histology co-primary endpoint but failed to meet the symptomatic co-primary endpoint when compared to placebo.

A responder is a patient achieving the following peak eosinophil counts: eosinophil count ≤4 cells per HPF in 5 gastric HPFs and/or eosinophil count ≤15 cells per HPF in 3 duodenal HPFs. Endpoint assessed at end of Week 24.
 TSS-6 is daily patient reported symptom questionnaire assessing 6 symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, bloating, early satiety, abdominal cramping, and loss of appetite) on a scale from 0 to 10. Endpoint assessed as mean change from baseline to Weeks 23-24.
 

Post-hoc Analyses
 Although post-hoc analyses cannot be used to establish efficacy, these analyses can be helpful in generating hypothesis for future clinical studies. After conducting post-hoc analyses, we believe that the trial missed its symptomatic co-primary endpoint due to the inclusion of mild patients and/or patients who had not failed standard of care. In the study, the overall demographics, baseline characteristics, and disease burden as assessed by TSS-6 were well balanced across treatment groups and placebo. However, despite using similar inclusion criteria, our post-hoc analysis indicated that patients enrolled in the Phase 3 study (ENIGMA 2) had notably lower levels of tissue eosinophils, blood eosinophils, IgE, and history of prior EG/EoD diagnosis when compared to ENIGMA.
A post hoc analyses identified that new sites utilized in the conduct of the Phase 3 studied enrolled a high proportion of patients with low levels of tissue eosinophils, blood eosinophils, IgE, and prior history of EG/EoD, whereas sites previously participating in the Phase 2 study enrolled more severe patients with higher levels of these characteristics.
Figure 10: Baseline Demographics & Patient Characteristics: Post-hoc Site Comparison
 


In a post hoc analyses of symptom improvement, sites with more severe patients with higher levels of tissue eosinophils, blood eosinophils, IgE levels, and prior history of EG/EoD, reported greater improvements on lirentelimab relative to placebo. The results suggest that future studies with lirentelimab should focus on more severe populations with higher levels of these characteristics.

Safety
 The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with previously reported lirentelimab studies. No new safety signals were observed. Mild to moderate infusion-related reactions (including flushing, feeling of warmth, headache, nausea, and/or dizziness etc.) occurred in 34% of lirentelimab-treated patients and 13% of placebo-treated patients.
 

Phase 3 EoD Study (EoDyssey)
 We have a Phase 3 study in patients with EoD without EG ongoing and expect to report topline data in the third quarter of 2022. In this study, in addition to the duodenum, we plan to examine eosinophil and mast cell levels in the terminal ileum and colon before and after lirentelimab treatment. Evaluation of the terminal ileum and colon will help characterize EoD patients and could provide insights for further development of lirentelimab in colonic conditions such as eosinophilic colitis and ulcerative colitis. As of December 31, 2021, the study was fully enrolled and baseline characteristics of patients enrolled in this study are likely to be similar to those in ENIGMA 2. As a result, the EoDyssey trial could fail to meet the symptomatic co-primary endpoint when compared to placebo.
    Future Studies in EG/EoD
 We believe encouraging signs of efficacy were observed in the ENIGMA 1 study. In addition, post hoc analyses of ENIGMA 2 suggest that future studies with lirentelimab should focus on more severe populations with higher levels of tissue eosinophil counts, peripheral blood eosinophil counts, IgE levels with a prior history of EG/EoD. After completion of the EoDyssey study we plan to discuss our findings with the FDA to determine the design of a Phase 3 study using SC lirentelimab.
    KRYPTOS: Phase 2/3 Study in Patients with EoE
 
Study Design
 The KRYPTOS study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 trial of intravenous lirentelimab enrolled 276 patients with dysphagia and biopsy-confirmed EoE (≥15 eosinophils in 1 HPF). Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive: 1.0 mg/kg of lirentelimab for the first month followed by five doses of 3.0 mg/kg given monthly (b) monthly 1.0 mg/kg of lirentelimab (c) a monthly placebo. Disease symptoms were measured daily using a patient reported symptom questionnaire that assessed difficulty swallowing. Co-primary endpoints were (1) proportion of responders with ≤6 eosinophils in 1 HPF in the esophagus and (2) absolute change in dysphagia symptom questionnaire from baseline.
Study Results
 Lirentelimab showed a statistically significant benefit when compared to placebo on the histology co-primary endpoint but failed to meet the symptomatic co-primary endpoint when compared to placebo.

Co-Primary Endpoints | Placebo(n=92) | | Lirentelimab Low Dose(n=93) | | | Lirentelimab High Dose(n=91) | 
Histology Endpoint: Proportion of responders (eos ≤6 /hpf) as determined by esophageal tissue eosinophil counts | 10.9% | | 92.5% | | | 87.9% | 
p-value | | — | | <0.0001 | | | <0.0001
 | DSQ Baseline:34.2 | | DSQ Baseline:36.4 | | | DSQ Baseline:35.2 | 
Symptom Endpoint: Absolut mean change in patient reported Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ) | | -14.6 | | | -11.9 | | | -17.4
p-value | | — | | | 0.247 | | | 0.237

 
A responder is a patient achieving the following peak eosinophil counts: ≤6 eosinophils (eos) / high powered field (HPF) in 1 HPF in the esophagus. Endpoint assessed at end of Week 24.
 DSQ is patient reported symptom questionnaire assessing difficulty swallowing. Endpoint assessed as absolute mean change from baseline to Weeks 23-24.
 
Post-hoc Analyses
 After conducting post-hoc analyses, we believe that the trial missed its symptomatic co-primary endpoint due to the inclusion of mild patients and/or patients who had not failed standard of care. Although post-hoc analyses cannot be used to establish efficacy, these analyses can be helpful in generating hypothesis for future clinical

studies. In the study, the overall demographics, baseline characteristics, and disease burden as assessed by DSQ were well balanced across treatment groups and placebo. However, in reviewing the data with key opinion leaders (“KOL”), they noted that the percentage of patients with a history of esophageal dilatations and prior standard of care steroid and proton pump use was lower than expected, as was the mean peak eosinophil counts, IgE levels and duration of EoE history, indicating that the study enrolled a number of mild EoE patients and/or patients with eosinophilia not caused by EoE. Based on KOL input and medical literature indicating that a single peak eosinophil count of greater than 24 eos/hpf avoids mild EoE patients and patients with eosinophilia not caused by EoE, we conducted a post-hoc analysis of demographics and symptoms improvements using this threshold.
Patients with tissue biopsies containing greater than 24 eos/hpf had higher blood eosinophils, tissue eosinophils and IgE levels as well as more prior use of topical steroids and proton pump inhibitors, consistent with this threshold identifying more severe patients. In contrast, patients with less than 24 eos/hpf had lower levels of these characteristics. In the more severe patients with above 24 eos/hpf, improvements in dysphagia symptoms were observed in the high dose lirentelimab group relative to placebo. The results suggest that future studies with lirentelimab should focus on more severe populations with higher tissue eosinophil levels, IgE levels and more prior use of steroid and proton pump inhibitors.

Safety
 The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with previously reported lirentelimab studies. No new safety signals were observed. Mild to moderate infusion-related reactions (including flushing, feeling of warmth, headache, nausea, and/or dizziness etc.) occurred in 39% of high dose lirentelimab- treated patients, 26% of low dose lirentelimab-treated patients and 12% of placebo-treated patients.
 
Future Studies in EoE
 We believe encouraging signs of efficacy were observed in post hoc analyses of the KRYPTOS study, although post hoc analyses cannot be used to demonstrate efficacy. The post hoc analyses suggest that future studies with lirentelimab should focus on more severe populations with higher tissue eosinophil levels, IgE levels and more prior use of steroid and proton pump inhibitors. We are planning to discuss our finding with the FDA with the goal of initiating a Phase 3 study in EoE with SC lirentelimab in 2022.
   Mast Cell Gastrointestinal Disease
During the enrollment phase of the ENIGMA study, we identified a group of patients who were symptomatic but upon biopsy had ≥ 30 stomach and/or duodenal mast cell counts in the absence of elevated eosinophils (<30 eosinophils/HPF). The presence of elevated mast cell counts and lack of elevated eosinophils or other cell type suggests that these patients may suffer from mast cell driven gastrointestinal symptoms. We refer to this condition as Mast Cell Gastrointestinal Disease (“MGID”). As detailed above, we conducted a prospective prevalence study examining the rates of elevated eosinophil and mast cell levels in 556 patients with chronic unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms or FGIDs such as IBS and FD. 73% (405 of 556) of patients screened underwent endoscopy with biopsy. Of the patients biopsied, 50% (204 of 405) met the histologic criteria for MGID, representing 37% (204 of 556) of patients screened. The results suggest that a large number of patients meet the criteria we established for MGID.
 We have conducted a proof of concept Phase 1 study with lirentelimab in patients with MGID. The open-label, multi-dose, 6-month, Phase 1 study of lirentelimab consisted of seven patients with moderate to severe gastrointestinal symptoms and elevated mast cells (≥30 mast cells/HPF in at least 5 HPFs in the stomach and/or ≥30 mast cells/HPF in at least 3 HPFs in the duodenum) who did not have >30 eosinophils/HPF. Patients received 0.3 mg/kg of lirentelimab for the first dose, followed by 1.0 mg/kg the following month, then monthly doses of 3.0 mg/kg for four additional months. Disease symptoms were assessed using the patient reported outcome (“PRO”) questionnaire used in our Phase 2 (ENIGMA) and Phase 3 EG and/or EoD studies (Total Symptom Score TSS-8:

abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, early satiety, loss of appetite, abdominal cramping, bloating, and diarrhea). Six-month treatment with lirentelimab resulted in a 64% mean reduction in TSS-8 compared to baseline and five of seven (71%) patients had >50% reduction in TSS-8. The treatment effect of lirentelimab in this open label study was similar to that observed with lirentelimab in patients with EG and/or EoD in the Phase 2 ENIGMA Study.
 
Chronic Urticaria
 
Disease Overview
 Chronic urticaria (“CU”) is a group of mast cell driven skin conditions which are characterized by recurrent transient pruritic wheal and flare type skin reactions and, in roughly 40% of patients, angioedema. Symptoms include hives, itching, redness, burning, warmth, tingling and irritation of the skin. Patients with CU are often severely impaired in their quality of life, with negative effects on sleep, daily activities, school/work life and social interactions. Urticaria symptoms are caused by degranulation of dermal mast cells, with IgE signaling believed to contribute to mast cell activation in many cases. The most common forms of CU are chronic spontaneous urticaria (“CSU”), cholinergic urticaria and symptomatic dermatographism.
Despite sharing similar inflammatory pathology, the various forms of urticaria differ in the triggers that elicit the inflammatory response and symptoms. Patients with cholinergic urticaria typically develop symptoms a few minutes after exercise or passive warming in a bath or shower. In some cholinergic patients, emotional stress or hot and spicy food or beverages can also elicit symptoms. Symptomatic dermatographism is characterized by hives and pruritis following a minor stroking pressure, rubbing or scratching of the skin. In CSU, pruritic wheal-and-flare-type skin reactions spontaneously appear on the skin at any time of the day or night. In most CSU patients, an underlying cause of CSU cannot be identified making a causal and/or curative treatment difficult. We estimate that approximately 200,000-500,000 patients with severe CSU, cholinergic urticaria and symptomatic dermatographism could be candidates for therapy with lirentelimab in the United States.
Current Therapies and Limitations
 The current treatment guidelines for the management of all forms of urticaria recommend the use of non-sedating oral H1-antihistamines as first-line therapy. For patients who do not respond to standard doses of H1-antihistamines, doses are increased to as high as four times the standard dose. Though this can increase the response rates, side effects also increase, including sedation and anticholinergic effects, such as dry mouth, blurred vision, urinary retention and constipation. Patients who do not respond to or are unable to tolerate high dose antihistamines have few options. For cholinergic urticaria and symptomatic dermatographism patients, it is recommended that they avoid target triggers such as overheated spaces, hot baths/showers, exercise, specific food allergens and excessive contact. For antihistamine refractory patients with CSU, the only currently approved treatment is Xolair, a monoclonal anti-IgE antibody. Unfortunately, approximately 60% of CSU patients continue to have symptoms despite treatment with Xolair.
Phase 2 Study Design and Results
 We conducted an open-label Phase 2 study with lirentelimab in patients with uncontrolled CU despite treatment with H1 antihistamines at up to 4x the labeled dose. The study enrolled four cohorts consisting of 13 Xolair naïve patients with CSU, 11 Xolair refractory patients with CSU (average duration of Xolair treatment 10 months at doses as high as 600mg/month), 11 patients with cholinergic urticaria, and 10 patients with symptomatic dermographism. Baseline symptom scores, as measured by Urticaria Control Test (“UCT”) and Urticaria Activity Score (“UAS7”) were collected over a 4-week screening period. Patients with baseline UCT scores of less than 12, indicative of poorly controlled urticaria, were enrolled in the study and treated with up to 6 doses of lirentelimab given once monthly. Patients received an initial dose of 0.3 mg/kg at baseline, followed by a dose of 1.0 mg/kg on day 28, and then received monthly doses of either 1.0 or 3.0 mg/kg for a total of 6 doses. The primary endpoint of the trial was patient-reported symptoms measured by the UCT. Secondary endpoints include safety and tolerability, as well as patient-reported symptoms as measured by UAS7 (CSU patients only), pulse controlled ergometry (cholinergic urticaria patients only), and Fric testing (symptomatic dermographism patients only).
 Results for each cohort are shown in Figure 15. Patients in all cohorts reported high levels of disease control and some patients experienced complete resolution of symptoms while receiving lirentelimab. Importantly, lirentelimab also produced high levels of response in patients that were refractory to Xolair.

Intravenous lirentelimab was generally well tolerated in the Phase 2 CU study. The most common adverse event was the occurrence of mild to moderate IRRs such as flushing, feeling of warmth, headache, nausea or dizziness, which occurred in 34% of first infusions and 4% of subsequent infusions.
Current and Future Studies
 Based on the results from the Phase 2 CU study, we plan to initiate a Phase 2b study in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria. The planned Phase 2b study in chronic spontaneous urticaria will be a multicentered, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients who are naïve to omalizumab and refractory to antihistamines. The primary end point of the trial will be the change from baseline in UAS7 at week 12.

Atopic Dermatitis
 Disease Overview
 Atopic dermatitis (“AD”) is a chronic pruritic inflammatory condition that is characterized by dry, red, itchy patches of skin. Multiple mechanisms contribute to the disease, including epithelial barrier impairment, systemic immune dysregulation, neuroinflammation, fibrotic remodeling and dysbiosis of skin microbiota. Crosstalk between eosinophils, mast cells, and sensory neurons has been shown to drive inflammation and chronic itch in atopic dermatitis via IgE, IL-4, IL-13, IL-33, and MRGPRX2. The disease affects approximately 16.5 million (7.3%) adults in the United States (US), of which approximately 6.6 million (40%) have moderate-to-severe disease.
Current Therapies and Limitations
 Atopic dermatitis is treated with oral antihistamines, topical moisturizers and emollients and topical steroids. Unfortunately, many patients continue to have lesions and symptoms despite these treatments and many of the drugs are not suitable for long-term treatment due to undesirable side effects. For patients who do not respond to these options or for more serious patients, FDA approved therapies include dupilumab (anti-IL-4 and IL-13 antibody), tralokinumab (anti IL-13 antibody), ruxolitinib (topical JAKi), abrocitinib (JAKi small molecule) and upadacitinib (JAKi small molecule). The IL-4 & IL-13 class was initially approved in 2017 for patients with moderate-to-severe AD. The JAKi class was initially for AD in 2021 however these drugs come with a boxed warning for serious infections, mortality, malignancies, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and thrombosis. There remains a need for novel mechanisms of action to treat patients with AD.
Preclinical Data Showing Mast Cell and Eosinophil in Atopic Dermatitis Skin Lesions
 In atopic dermatitis skin lesions, eosinophils and mast cells are elevated in number and mast cells are activated with high levels of surface-bound IgE. These cells have further been shown to induce chronic inflammation and itch via the wide array of activating receptors expressed on their cell surface, and through crosstalk with sensory neurons and other cell types.
Moreover, mast cells and eosinophils are major sources of IL-4 and IL-13, cytokines that have been shown to be clinically relevant mediators of inflammation and fibrosis.

Figure 17: Mast Cells and Eosinophils Are Elevated in Atopic Dermatitis Skin Lesions
    

Observations in Patients with Atopic Dermatitis in Lirentelimab Clinical Studies
 Evidence of activity was observed in two separate clinical studies of lirentelimab in patients with comorbid atopic dermatitis. In the EG/EoD Phase 3 study (ENIGMA 2), patients with comorbid atopic dermatitis were assessed using a daily questionnaire for the global disease severity and reported a decrease in disease severity of 63% compared to 12% on placebo (n=9). In a single-arm, Phase 1b severe allergic conjunctivitis study, patients with comorbid atopic dermatitis reported a 56% decrease in disease severity (n=11).
Figure 18: Improvement in Concomitant Atopic Dermatitis
    

Biomarker data from Phase 1b Severe Allergic Conjunctivitis Study
 In the Phase 1b study in patients with Severe Allergic Conjunctivitis, clinically-relevant cytokines of atopic dermatitis were measured. These cytokines were measured via tear ducts to understand ocular inflammation and included IL-4, IL-13, CCL26/Eotaxin-3 as well as CCL/MIP-α. Upon lirentelimab dosing, these biomarkers showed meaningful decreases. Moreover these cytokines rebounded to baseline levels following study conclusion.
Current and Future Studies
 We initiated a Phase 2 study in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. The Phase 2 study in atopic dermatitis is a 14-week, multicentered, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that will enroll approximately 120 adult patients with moderate-to-severe disease who are inadequately controlled by topical treatments. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive a dose of subcutaneous 300mg lirentelimab every two weeks or placebo. The primary endpoint will be the proportion of patients who achieve eczema area and severity index (EASI)-75 at week 14.

Severe Allergic Conjunctivitis
 Disease Overview
 Atopic keratoconjunctivitis (“AKC”), vernal keratoconjunctivitis (“VKC”) and perennial allergic conjunctivitis (“PAC”) are a set of allergic ocular conjunctival diseases primarily associated with an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction. We are focused on SAC, the severe forms of these collective diseases. These conditions are often caused by airborne allergens, such as grass and tree pollens, coming into contact with the eyes, which induces IgE mediated mast cell degranulation and allergic inflammation. The inflammatory mediators released by the mast cell result in inflammation and the infiltration of eosinophils, neutrophils and other immune cells. Eosinophils and mast cells are believed to be the main effector cells, with protease secretions directly damaging the

conjunctiva, and play a key role in triggering and maintaining the inflammatory response. Symptoms include itching, hyperemia, light sensitivity (or “photophobia”), pain, eye discharge and the sensation of having a foreign body in the eye. These symptoms can affect quality of life and daily activities, such as reading, driving and being in bright outdoor environments. In addition, patients with untreated disease, in particular those with VKC and AKC, can experience remodeling of the ocular surface tissues that can lead to vision loss. In addition to the primary symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis, a high correlation of allergic rhinitis, allergic asthma and atopic dermatitis comorbidities occur in this patient population. We believe that approximately 50,000-150,000 patients in the United States suffer from SAC and could be candidates for treatment with lirentelimab.
 Current Therapies and Limitations
 PAC is treated with topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers. More serious forms are treated with topical and systemic corticosteroids, cyclosporine and other immunomodulatory drugs. There are no drugs approved for AKC and VKC, and as a result, patients are typically treated similarly to patients with PAC. Unfortunately, many patients continue to have symptoms despite these topical and/or systemic treatments and many of the drugs are not suitable for long-term treatment due to undesirable side effects.
Study Design and Results
 We conducted an open-label Phase 1 study with lirentelimab in patients with SAC. The trial was open-label, multi-dose, six-month study and enrolled 29 total SAC patients. Of the 29 patients, 13 patients had AKC, 15 patients had PAC, and one patient had VKC. Patients received a 0.3 mg/kg dose of lirentelimab for the first month, followed by a 1 mg/kg dose the next month, then monthly doses of 1 or 3 mg/kg for four additional months. The primary endpoint of the trial was safety and tolerability. Key secondary endpoints included patient-reported symptom measures of ocular itch, pain, lacrimation, photophobia and foreign body sensation. Patients administered lirentelimab reported a 78% median improvement in ocular symptoms by ACS and a 71% median improvement in physician assessed signs and symptoms using the OSS. In addition, a number of patients enrolled in the trial also had concomitant allergic rhinitis, asthma, and atopic dermatitis. Patients suffering from comorbid atopic dermatitis, asthma and allergic rhinitis, despite treatment with currently available therapies, reported improvements in their symptoms while receiving lirentelimab.
Intravenous lirentelimab was generally well tolerated. The most common adverse event was mild to moderate IRRs, such as flushing, feeling of warmth, headache, nausea, dizziness, which occurred mostly during the first infusion.

Indolent Systemic Mastocytosis
 Disease Overview
 Indolent systemic mastocytosis (“ISM”) is a rare disease characterized by the clonal proliferation and accumulation of mast cells in the bone marrow, respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, and organs such as the skin, liver, spleen and brain. Common symptoms include pruritus, flushing, headache, cognitive impairment, fatigue, diarrhea, gastrointestinal cramps, hypotension and skin lesions, as well as an increased risk for osteoporosis and anaphylaxis, which in some cases can be life threatening. The symptoms of ISM are attributed to mast cell activation and the systemic release of mediators. Approximately 30,000 patients in the United States suffer from ISM. Lirentelimab has received orphan drug designation from the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) for the treatment of ISM.
Current Therapies and Limitations
 There are currently no drugs approved for the treatment of ISM by the FDA or EMA. ISM is treated with drugs targeting mast cell mediators, including antihistamines, cromolyn sodium and leukotriene blocking agents. Most patients’ symptoms remain poorly controlled by these treatments. Glucocorticoids can provide temporary relief in some cases; however long-term treatment with steroids is not appropriate due to their many side effects.
Study Design and Results
 Lirentelimab has been evaluated in an open-label, single and multiple ascending dose Phase 1 study in patients with ISM. The single dose portion of this trial was completed during the second quarter of 2017, with subsequent completion of the six-month multi-dose portion in the first quarter of 2019. The primary endpoints of the trial were safety and tolerability. Key secondary endpoints were the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of lirentelimab, including peripheral counts of eosinophils and patient-reported mastocytosis disease symptoms including itching, hives, skin flushing, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue, headache, difficulty concentrating and muscle and joint pain. In the single dose portion, 13 patients received single escalating doses of 0.0003 to 1.0 mg/kg, including three patients receiving 0.3 mg/kg and three patients receiving 1.0 mg/kg of lirentelimab. Five out of six patients receiving 0.3 or 1.0 mg/kg reported to the study investigators that they had improvements in symptoms, including diarrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue, pruritus, difficulty concentrating and headaches.
 In the multi-dose portion of the trial, 6 patients received six doses of 1.0 mg/kg of lirentelimab given monthly and 5 patients received 1.0 mg/kg for the first month and then monthly doses of 3.0 to 10 mg/kg of lirentelimab for the five months thereafter. Depletion of eosinophils was observed for all patients throughout the dosing period with lirentelimab. ISM symptoms and quality of life were assessed using the Mastocytosis Questionnaire (“MSQ”), an internally developed Patient Reported Outcome (“PRO”) instrument, the Mastocytosis Questionnaire (“MSQ”), as well as two published questionnaires, the Mastocytosis Activity and Symptom Severity questionnaire (“MAS”) and the Mastocytosis Quality of Life questionnaire (“MC-QoL”). The MSQ is a proprietary daily PRO Mastocytosis Questionnaire that we developed based on published guidance from the FDA on the development of PRO instruments and is expected to be used to help determine safety and efficacy in future clinical trials. The MSQ consists of nine symptom assessments, with each symptom being scored on a 0-10 scale with higher values representing greater symptom burden. Total score for the MSQ ranges from 0-90 points. For each PRO, baseline scores were collected over 14 to 28 days and compared to scores at Weeks 21 to 22, two weeks after the final dose of lirentelimab. PRO data obtained from patients in the multidose portion of the trial are presented in Figure 21. Consistent with the improvements reported in the single ascending dose study, lirentelimab produced clinically meaningful improvement in patient symptoms for multiple symptoms across all three PROs used in the study.

Intravenous lirentelimab was generally well tolerated in the Phase 1 ISM study. The most common adverse event was the occurrence of mild to moderate IRRs, such as flushing, feeling of warmth, headache, nausea or dizziness, which occurred mostly during the first infusion.
 
AK006 Preclinical Data
 AK006 targets Siglec-6, an inhibitory receptor expressed selectively on mast cells. In preclinical studies, AK006, our humanized antibody to Siglec-6 reduces mast cell numbers and has been shown to have broader and deeper inhibition of mast cell activity than lirentelimab, including the ability to inhibit c-KIT activation. The increased inhibitory activity could give AK006 increased therapeutic activity while potentially avoiding toxicities associated with less selective mast cell targeting drugs.
    AK006 induces potent mast cell inhibition in ex vivo human tissues
 We developed an IgE-mediated mast cell activation assay in human tissue. In this assay, mast cells are activated via FceRI using an agonistic anti-FceRI antibody and mast cell activation is evaluated using CD63 expression by flow cytometry. CD63 is a activation marker found on mast cell granules and upon activation fuses with the plasma membrane making CD63 accessible to detection by flow cytometry. While AK002 showed potent mast cell inhibition, AK006 was able to provide deeper levels of inhibition.
     
Figure 22: IgE-mediated mast cell activation in human tissue
    
   
AK006 inhibits KIT-mediated mast cell activation in vivo
 AK006 also has been show to inhibit KIT activation of mast cells in vivo. Administration of stem cell factor (SCF), a potent KIT activator, to Siglec-6 transgenic mice induces mast cell activation and inflammation. AK006 reduced KIT-mediated mast cell activation as assessed by CD63 expression compared to sham treated mice (mice that did not receive SCF). In addition, AK006 treated mice displayed reduced levels of inflammatory mediators (TNF and IL-6) compared to isotype control mice.
   Figure 23: KIT-mediated mast cell activation and inflammation in Siglec-6 transgenic mice
 


AK006 reduces mast cells in ex vivo human tissue
 In human tissue processed into single cell suspensions and cultured overnight with or without human macrophages activated with IFNg, AK006 significantly reduced human tissue mast cells in the presence of activated macrophages relative to an isotype control mAb (“ISO”). In contrast, AK002 does not reduce mast cells in the presence or absence of activated macrophages, suggesting AK006 has unique activity that reduces mast cells in the presence of activated effector cells, such as macrophages.
     
Figure 24: Mast cell numbers in ex vivo cultured human tissue
 


The above data suggests that AK006 selectively targets mast cells and has the potential to induce broad inhibition of mast cell activation and reduce mast cell numbers. This profile could give AK006 increased therapeutic activity while potentially avoiding toxicities associated with less selective mast cell targeting drugs.
 We plan to begin human studies with AK006 in the first half of 2023.
Other Pipeline Programs
 
We are developing additional antibodies targeting novel inhibitory receptors expressed on key disease-driving immune cells. These antibodies have demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity in murine models and are being evaluated for further development.
Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid technological advancement, significant competition and an emphasis on intellectual property. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with current therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. We believe that the key competitive factors affecting the success of any of our product candidates will include efficacy, safety profile, convenience, cost, level of promotional activity devoted to them and intellectual property protection.
 We are not aware of any other company or organization that is conducting clinical trials of a product candidate that targets both mast cells and eosinophils, including any product candidate that specifically targets Siglec-8. The competition we may face with respect to each of the indications we are targeting with lirentelimab includes:
 •EG, EoD and EoE. Currently, there are no therapies that have been approved by the FDA specifically for EG, EoD or EoE. Several companies, including but not limited to, Regeneron (dupilumab), AstraZeneca (benralizumab), Bristol Myers Squibb (cendakimab), Shire (oral budesonide), and Dr. Falk Pharma (oral budesonide) have or are conducting studies in these indications. 
 •ISM. We are not aware of any FDA-approved treatments for ISM. Blueprint Medicines is developing avapritinib in smoldering systemic mastocytosis and ISM.
 •CU. Omalizumab (Roche and Novartis) is an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of CSU. We are not aware of any FDA-approved treatment options for cholinergic urticaria or symptomatic dermatographism. Companies conducting studies in chronic spontaneous urticaria include: Novartis 


(ligelizumab), Roche / Genentech (fenebrutinib), Regeneron (dupilumab), Celldex (CDX-0159) and Third Harmonic (THB001).
 •AD. Dupilumab (Regeneron), tralokinumab (Leo Pharma), ruxolitinib (Incyte), abrocitinib (Pfizer) and upadacitinib (Abbvie) are FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of AD. Several companies, including but not limited to, Eli Lilly (baricitinib & lebrikizumab), Bristol Myers (branebrutinib), Sanofi (rilzabrutinib), Pfizer (etrasimod) and AstraZeneca (benralizumab) have or are conducting studies in this indication.
 •SAC. The products that are currently available for treatment of SAC only provide temporary relief for most patients and have little effect on moderate to severe cases. Companies conducting studies in SAC include Aldeyra (reproxalap).
 Many of the companies against which we may compete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 Our commercial potential could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer or more effective, have fewer or less severe adverse events, and are more convenient or less expensive than products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we can, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market or could otherwise make our development more complicated.
 Sales and Marketing
 In light of our stage of development, we currently have limited marketing and sales capabilities. We hold worldwide commercialization rights to all of our product candidates. We intend to retain the rights to our compounds in key geographic markets for the time being, and plan to build our own focused, specialty sales force to commercialize approved products in the United States. We intend to build the necessary infrastructure and capabilities over time for the United States, and potentially other regions, following further advancement of our product candidates. Clinical data, the size of the addressable patient population, and the size of the commercial infrastructure and manufacturing needs may all influence or alter our commercialization plans. The responsibilities of the marketing and sales organization would include developing educational initiatives with respect to approved products and establishing relationships with researchers and practitioners in relevant fields of medicine.
Manufacturing
 We must manufacture drug product for clinical trial use in compliance with cGMP regulations. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our product candidates must meet cGMP requirements and FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority’s satisfaction before any product is approved and our commercial products can be manufactured. Our third-party manufacturers will also be subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other foreign authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations.
 We do not currently have the infrastructure or internal capability to manufacture our product candidates for use in clinical development and commercialization, and we currently have no plans to establish any manufacturing facilities. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third-party manufacturers for the production, packaging, labeling, storage, and distribution of our product candidates for pre-clinical testing and in compliance with cGMP requirements for clinical trials under our guidance. In the case of lirentelimab, to date we have relied on a single third-party manufacturer and we are currently in the process of developing alternative manufacturing capabilities. We expect to continue to rely on third-party manufacturers for the commercial supply of any of our product candidates if any of our product candidates obtain marketing approval. We have personnel with significant technical,

manufacturing, analytical, quality, regulatory, cGMP and project management experience to oversee our third-party manufacturers and to manage manufacturing and quality data and information for regulatory compliance purposes.
Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including warning letters, the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and civil and criminal penalties. Contract manufacturers often encounter difficulties involving production yields, quality control and quality assurance, as well as shortages of qualified personnel. Any of these actions or events could have a material impact on the availability of our products.
 In-Licensing Agreements
We have entered into two in-licensing agreements with third-parties for the development, manufacturing and commercialization of our products including lirentelimab. The specific terms of the individual agreements are discussed in further detail below.
Exclusive License Agreement with The Johns Hopkins University
 We have exclusively licensed intellectual property from The Johns Hopkins University (“JHU”) in a license agreement dated December 20, 2013 and amended and restated September 30, 2016. In December 2013, we entered into an agreement with JHU for an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize for the treatment and prevention of disease products covered by the JHU licensed patent rights or derived from materials provided by JHU. In September 2016, we and JHU amended and restated the license agreement to an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize in all fields products covered by the licensed patent rights, or derived from materials provided by JHU.
 Under the license agreement we are obligated to make payments to JHU for therapeutic products aggregating up to $4.0 million based on achieving specified development and regulatory approval milestones. We will also pay single-digit royalties to JHU based on net sales of each licensed therapeutic product by us and our affiliates and sublicensees and have up to a low six-digit dollar minimum annual royalty payment. In addition, in the event we sublicense the JHU intellectual property, we are obligated to pay JHU a specified portion of income we receive from sublicensing.
 Our royalty obligation with respect to each licensed product in a country extends until the later of the expiration of the last-to-expire patent licensed from JHU covering the licensed product in the country or the expiration of a specified number of years after the first commercial sale of any licensed product in any country. The last expiration date of patents licensed under the agreement was 2021 in all applicable countries, in the absence of any patent extensions that may be available for such patents
 Non-Exclusive License Agreement with BioWa Inc. and Lonza Sales AG
 We have licensed on a non-exclusive basis intellectual property from BioWa Inc. (“BioWa”) and Lonza pursuant to a license agreement dated October 31, 2013. The agreement grants Allakos a non-exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize certain products manufactured in a particular mammalian host cell line for the prevention, diagnosis or treatment of human disease.
 Under the license agreement, we are obligated to pay BioWa an annual commercial license fee of $40,000 until such time as BioWa receives royalty payments. We may also become obligated to make payments to BioWa aggregating up to $41.0 million based on achieving specified milestones, and to pay low single-digit royalties to BioWa based on net sales of licensed product by us and our affiliates and sublicensees. Our royalty obligation to BioWa with respect to each licensed product in a country extends until the later of the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent covering the licensed product in the country or the expiration of either regulatory exclusivity or a specified number of years after the first commercial sale of the licensed product in the country, whichever is later.


We may also pay low single-digit royalties to Lonza based on net sales of each licensed product by us and our affiliates and sublicensees. We will be required to pay an annual license fees to Lonza if we (or our strategic partner) manufactures a particular product using the particular cell line, or if we utilize a third party CMO to manufacture a product using such system. Our royalty obligation to Lonza with respect to each licensed product in a country extends until the later of the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent covering the licensed product in the country or a specified number of years after the first commercial sale of the licensed product in the country, whichever is later. The latest possible expiration date of patents licensed under the agreement is 2021 or 2023, depending on the country, in the absence of any patent extensions that may be available for such patents.
 Total Royalty Burden
 In aggregate, we anticipate our total royalty obligation on lirentelimab from our in-licensing agreements will be a mid-single digit percentage of net sales by us and our affiliates and sublicensees.
Government Regulation
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug and biological products. Generally, before a new drug or biologic can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
U.S. Drug Development
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and its implementing regulations, and biologics under the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”) and their implementing regulations. Both drugs and biologics also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 Any future product candidates must be approved by the FDA through either a BLA or New Drug Application (“NDA”) process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process generally involves the following:
 •completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including nonclinical laboratory and animal tests that must be conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice (“GLP”), requirements;
 •submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
 •approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”), or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice (“GCP”), requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
 •submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA and payment of user fees, if applicable;


•a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to accept the filing for review;
 •satisfactory completion of a FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug or biologic will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug or biologic’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
 •satisfactory completion of FDA audit of the preclinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
 •FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug or biologic in the United States; and
 •compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”), and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
 The data required to support an NDA or BLA are generated in two distinct developmental stages: preclinical and clinical. The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for any future product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or at all.
 Preclinical Studies and IND
 The preclinical development stage generally involves laboratory evaluation of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to evaluate toxicity, assess potential safety and efficacy, assess the potential for adverse events, support subsequent clinical testing, and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
 Clinical Trials
 The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Investigators must also provide information to the clinical trial sponsors to allow the sponsors to disclose any financial interests and arrangements to the FDA that could affect the reliability or integrity of data submitted. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. The manufacture of investigational drugs for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to cGMP requirements.


A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA or BLA. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the trial was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
 Clinical trials in the United States generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3, and may be combined or overlap.
 •Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected subjects who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, tolerability and safety of the drug.
 •Phase 2 clinical trials involve studies in disease-affected subjects to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further PK and PD information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.
 •Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of subjects at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling and approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.
 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA. The results of Phase 4 trials may confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and may provide important safety information.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug or biologic, findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
 Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug or biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug or biologic as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, companies must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that our product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life. We may also be required to develop and implement additional clinical trial policies and procedures as a result of the COVID-19

pandemic. For example, FDA has issued guidance documents on protecting subjects from the COVID-19 virus and cGMP considerations for responding to COVID-19 infection in employees in product manufacturing.
 NDA/BLA Review Process
 Following completion of the preclinical testing and clinical trials, data are analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. In short, the NDA or BLA is a request for approval to market the drug or biologic for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of safety and efficacy for a drug or safety, purity and potency for a biologic. The application may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of FDA. FDA approval of an NDA or BLA must be obtained before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States.
 The submission of an NDA requires payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA, unless otherwise exempted, such as in the case of an NDA for a drug with orphan drug designation. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), as amended, each NDA or BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA’s fee schedule, for the FDA’s fiscal year 2022, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as an NDA or BLA, is $3.12 million. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for human drugs and biologics of $0.3 million. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs or BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
 The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs and BLAs before it accepts them for filing, and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA or BLA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA or BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA or BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has ten months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of a new molecular-entity NDA or original BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of a new molecular-entity NDA or original BLA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs or BLAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates an NDA or BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA,

addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
 Orphan Drugs
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
 Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will be receiving orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety or providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. Competitors, however, may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication but that could be used off-label in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking approval, or if a product candidate is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If one of our products designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits.
 Expedited Development and Review Programs
 The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, accelerated approval and Priority Review designation, which are intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biologics that meet certain criteria.
The purpose of these programs is to ensure that therapies for serious conditions are approved and available to patients as soon as it can be concluded that the therapies’ benefits justify their risks. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a Fast Track drug concurrent with, or after, the IND submission for the drug candidate, but ideally no later than the pre-NDA meeting because many of the features of Fast Track designation will not apply after that time. To be eligible for a Fast Track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and nonclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product has the potential to fill a medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or the condition is not adequately addressed by current available therapy. Fast Track designation provides additional opportunities for interaction with the FDA’s review team and rolling review of NDA components before the completed application is submitted. For rolling submission, the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. The FDA may decide to rescind the Fast Track designation if it determines that the qualifying criteria no longer apply, and a sponsor may also withdraw Fast Track designation if the designation is no longer supported by emerging data or the drug development program is no longer being pursued.


Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast-track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. A sponsor may request Priority Review designation of an NDA for a drug that is intended to treat a serious condition at the time of the original NDA (or efficacy supplement) submission. FDA may assign a Priority Review designation if FDA determines that the product, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness or any supplement that proposes a labeling change pursuant to a report on a pediatric study. A Priority Review designation means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) goals. Under the current PDUFA performance goals, these six- and ten-month review periods are measured from the 60-day filing date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities (“NME”), which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review from the date of submission.
 A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval, if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies. In addition, it must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (“IMM”), that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit(i.e., an intermediate clinical endpoint), taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. Failure to conduct required post approval studies or confirm a clinical benefit during post marketing studies may lead to the FDA withdrawing the drug from the market. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated approval regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. If the FDA concludes that a drug or biologic shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it may require such post-marketing restrictions, as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the product.
 Additionally, a drug or biologic may be eligible for designation as a Breakthrough Therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of Breakthrough Therapy designation include the same benefits as Fast Track designation, plus intensive guidance from the FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program, organizational commitment to the development and review of the product, including involvement of senior managers. Like Fast Track products, Breakthrough Therapy products are also eligible for rolling review of the NDA. A designation may be rescinded if a product candidate no longer meets the qualifying criteria for breakthrough therapy. A sponsor may also withdraw breakthrough therapy designation if the designation is no longer supported by the emerging data or the drug development program is no longer being pursued.
 Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and Breakthrough Therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process.


Abbreviated Licensure Pathway of Biological Products as Biosimilar or Interchangeable
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (“BPCIA”), created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be highly similar to an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The BPCIA attempts to minimize duplicative testing, and thereby lower development costs and increase patient access to affordable treatments. An application for licensure of a biosimilar product must include information demonstrating biosimilarity based upon the following, unless the FDA determines otherwise:
 •analytical studies demonstrating that the proposed biosimilar product is highly similar to the approved product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components;
 •animal studies (including the assessment of toxicity); and
 •a clinical trial or trials (including the assessment of immunogenicity and PK or PD) sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity and potency in one or more conditions for which the reference product is licensed and intended to be used.
 In addition, an application must include information demonstrating that:
 •the proposed biosimilar product and reference product utilize the same mechanism of action for the condition(s) of use prescribed, recommended or suggested in the proposed labeling, but only to the extent the mechanism(s) of action are known for the reference product;
 •the condition or conditions of use prescribed, recommended or suggested in the labeling for the proposed biosimilar product have been previously approved for the reference product;
 •the route of administration, the dosage form and the strength of the proposed biosimilar product are the same as those for the reference product; and
 •the facility in which the biological product is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure that the biological product continues to be safe, pure and potent.
 Biosimilarity means that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components; and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity and potency of the product. In addition, the law provides for a designation of “interchangeability” between the reference and biosimilar products, whereby the biosimilar may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product. The higher standard of interchangeability must be demonstrated by information sufficient to show that:
 •the proposed product is biosimilar to the reference product;
 •the proposed product is expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient; and
 •for a product that is administered more than once to an individual, the risk to the patient in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the biosimilar and the reference product is no greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch.
 FDA approval is required before a biosimilar may be marketed in the United States. However, complexities associated with the large and intricate structures of biological products and the process by which such products are manufactured pose significant hurdles to the FDA’s implementation of the law that are still being worked out by the FDA. For example, the FDA has discretion over the kind and amount of scientific evidence—laboratory, preclinical and/or clinical—required to demonstrate biosimilarity to a licensed biological product.
 The FDA intends to consider the totality of the evidence, provided by a sponsor to support a demonstration of biosimilarity, and recommends that sponsors use a stepwise approach in the development of their biosimilar products. Biosimilar product applications thus may not be required to duplicate the entirety of preclinical and clinical testing used to establish the underlying safety and effectiveness of the reference product. However, the FDA may refuse to approve a biosimilar application if there is insufficient information to show that the active ingredients are the same or to demonstrate that any impurities or differences in active ingredients do not affect the safety, purity

or potency of the biosimilar product. In addition, as with BLAs, biosimilar product applications will not be approved unless the product is manufactured in facilities designed to assure and preserve the biological product’s safety, purity and potency.
 The submission of a biosimilar application does not guarantee that the FDA will accept the application for filing and review, as the FDA may refuse to accept applications that it finds are insufficiently complete. The FDA will treat a biosimilar application or supplement as incomplete if, among other reasons, any applicable user fees assessed under the Biosimilar User Fee Act of 2012 have not been paid. In addition, the FDA may accept an application for filing but deny approval on the basis that the sponsor has not demonstrated biosimilarity, in which case the sponsor may choose to conduct further analytical, preclinical or clinical studies and submit a BLA for licensure as a new biological product.
 The timing of final FDA approval of a biosimilar for commercial distribution depends on a variety of factors, including whether the manufacturer of the branded product is entitled to one or more statutory exclusivity periods, during which time the FDA is prohibited from approving any products that are biosimilar to the branded product. The FDA cannot approve a biosimilar application for twelve years from the date of first licensure of the reference product. Additionally, a biosimilar product sponsor may not submit an application for four years from the date of first licensure of the reference product. A reference product may also be entitled to exclusivity under other statutory provisions. For example, a reference product designated for a rare disease or condition (an “orphan drug”) may be entitled to seven years of exclusivity, in which case no product that is biosimilar to the reference product may be approved until either the end of the twelve-year period provided under the biosimilarity statute or the end of the seven-year orphan drug exclusivity period, whichever occurs later. In certain circumstances, a regulatory exclusivity period can extend beyond the life of a patent, and thus block biosimilarity applications from being approved on or after the patent expiration date. In addition, the FDA may under certain circumstances extend the exclusivity period for the reference product by an additional six months if the FDA requests, and the manufacturer undertakes, studies on the effect of its product in children, a so-called pediatric extension.
 The first biological product determined to be interchangeable with a branded product for any condition of use is also entitled to a period of exclusivity, during which time the FDA may not determine that another product is interchangeable with the reference product for any condition of use. This exclusivity period extends until the earlier of: (1) one year after the first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable product; (2) 18 months after resolution of a patent infringement against the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product, based on a final court decision regarding all of the patents in the litigation or dismissal of the litigation with or without prejudice; (3) 42 months after approval of the first interchangeable product, if a patent infringement suit against the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product is still ongoing or (4) 18 months after approval of the first interchangeable product if the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product has not been sued.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping requirements, requirements to report adverse experiences and comply with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug or biologic, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA/BLA or NDA/BLA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.


The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 •restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
 •fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications;
 •applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs and biologics may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 Other U.S. Regulatory Matters
 Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments.
 For example, in the United States, sales, marketing and scientific and educational programs also must comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws. These laws include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Moreover, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.


Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 The distribution of biologic and pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
 The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.
 Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
 U.S. Patent-Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of any future product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the “Hatch-Waxman Act”). The Hatch-Waxman Act permits restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA or BLA.
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of a NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”), or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for a NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.


A reference biological product is granted twelve years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity or potency. Therefore, one must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the “first licensure” of a biological product is determined on a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the sponsor.
 European Union Drug Development
 As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.
 Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority (“NCA”), and one or more Ethics Committees (“ECs”). Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
 The EU clinical trials legislation currently is undergoing a transition process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining clinical-trial authorization, simplifying adverse-event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency. Clinical Trials Regulation EU No 536/2014 ensures that the rules for conducting clinical trials in the EU will be identical. In the meantime, Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC continues to govern all clinical trials performed in the EU.
European Union Drug Review and Approval
 In the European Economic Area (“EEA”), which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the European Union (including Norway and excluding Croatia), Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (“MA”). There are two types of marketing authorizations.
 •The Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”), of the EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.
 •National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time 


of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State (“RMS”). The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics (“SPC”), and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned).
 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. In the United States no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug or biological products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
 The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of general controls and measures, coupled with the tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceutical drugs.
 The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price (“AMP”), to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), have proposed to expand Medicaid rebate liability to the territories of the United States as well.
 The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”), established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be

developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
 For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children’s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. In addition, as 340B drug prices are determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase.
 As noted above, the marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. An increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
 Human Capital
 We believe we must attract, develop, motivate and retain exceptional employees to achieve our objectives. To accomplish this, we offer competitive compensation, promote diversity and inclusion, and focus on employee health, safety and well-being. Our board of directors engages regularly with management on human capital matters. As of December 31, 2021, we had 192 full-time employees, 132 of whom were engaged in research and development activities. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered under a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be strong based on engagement scores, employee comments and modest turnover.
 Due to the clinical study results released in December 2021, our Board of Directors approved in February 2022, and we began implementing, a reorganization plan (the “Reorganization Plan”) to reduce operating costs and better align our workforce with the new clinical development plans of our business. Under the Reorganization Plan, we are reducing our workforce by approximately 35%.
The management team and the Board of Directors and the Company consulted with outside compensation advisors to develop severance packages appropriate to the market conditions for similar situations and companies. At the time of departure from the Company, impacted employees are eligible to receive severance benefits and Company funded COBRA premiums. Additionally, the Company is providing job placement assistance and other services to help transitioning employees.


In addition, the Board of Directors approved, and management has implemented an employee retention program consisting of cash payments as well as grants of time-based RSUs and performance-based RSUs to the Company’s employees not impacted by the reduction in force. Refer to Note 12 “Subsequent Events” to our financial statements for additional information.
 Company Culture and Employee Development
 We continue to build a culture that is both high performing and personally rewarding. We do this by clearly establishing a set of values to guide each of us.. We also look for opportunities to recognize employees fostering the culture as a way to reinforce these behaviors. Recognition is a key component in ensuring employee contributions are both seen and appreciated. We have developed several employee recognition programs to support that goal.
We support the growth of our employees through educational programs that enhance technical skills as well as leadership capabilities. We have developed a course for leaders at all levels to hone their skills in key aspects of what teams in today’s environment need to thrive. The programs are conducted virtually so employees in all locations can participate equally. We have also developed an educational grant policy which supports employees in developing the skills relevant to their work at Allakos.
Health, Safety, and Wellness
 The health, safety, and wellness of our employees is a priority in which we have always invested. These investments and the prioritization of employee health, safety, and wellness took on particular significance in 2020 and 2021 in light of COVID-19. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of innovative, flexible, and convenient health and wellness programs. Program benefits are intended to provide protection and security, so employees can have peace of mind concerning events that may require time away from work or that may impact their financial well-being. Additionally, we provide programs to help support employee physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status, encourage engagement in healthy behaviors, and offer choices where possible so they are customized to meet their needs and the needs of their families.
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, in compliance with government regulations. This included having the vast majority of our employees work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing to work on-site. To protect and support our essential team members, we have implemented health and safety measures that included providing personal protective equipment (PPE), instituting mandatory screening before accessing buildings and implementing protocols to address actual and suspected COVID-19 cases and potential exposure.
 Compensation and Benefits
 We provide compensation and benefits to help meet the needs of our employees. We benchmark our pay annually to ensure it is fair in comparison to local market conditions. In addition to base compensation, our employee programs include annual bonuses, stock incentive awards, an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, 401(k) matching, healthcare insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off and family leave.
Ensuring fair and equitable pay is integral to our commitment to our employees. Our executive team and Board of Directors strongly support this commitment.
Facilities
 Our corporate headquarters are currently located in Redwood City, California (the “Redwood City Lease”), where we lease 25,136 square feet of office, research and development and laboratory space. The Redwood City Lease will expire on April 30, 2022. On December 4, 2019, we entered into a lease agreement for approximately 98,000 square feet of office space to be constructed in San Carlos, California (the “San Carlos Lease”). These premises were delivered in November 2020, and we expect to move into this new headquarters in March 2022. The lease term will expire on October 31, 2031. Since commencement of the lease term, we have been responsible for

monthly base rent payments of $5.75 per rentable square foot. We provided a security deposit in the form of a letter of credit in the amount of $1.5 million. This lease agreement includes an option to extend the term for an additional period of five years and provides us a right of first refusal for certain additional office space. We believe that these facilities will be adequate for our near-term needs. If required, we believe that suitable additional or alternative space would be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms.
 Legal Proceedings
 For information on our legal proceedings, see Item 3, Legal Proceedings, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, pursuing and obtaining patent protection in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. Our patent portfolio is intended to cover our product candidates and components thereof, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, our proprietary reagents and assays and any other inventions that are commercially important to our business. We also rely on trade secret protection of our confidential information and know-how relating to our proprietary technology, platforms and product candidates.
 We believe that we have substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to our technology and product candidates. Our patent portfolio as of February 15, 2022 contains eight issued and unexpired U.S. patents and seven pending U.S. utility patent applications that are solely owned or exclusively licensed by us and numerous foreign counterparts of these patents and patent applications.
 We have exclusively licensed from JHU four issued and unexpired U.S. patents and also foreign counterparts, with claims granted in Europe and Japan. The JHU licensed patent rights include issued U.S. patents with claims that recite anti-Siglec-8 antibodies comprising the CDRs of a particular antibody and methods of use a class of antibodies that bind to Siglec-8 for treating particular diseases. We own four granted U.S. patents that claim the active component of lirentelimab, an anti-Siglec-8 antibody, pharmaceutical compositions comprising lirentelimab, and methods for the treatment of particular diseases using antibodies to Siglec-8, with a projected expiration date in 2035 in the absence of patent extensions. Similar patents are issued in Europe, Japan and other territories. We have twelve further pending families of patent applications that include U.S. and foreign applications relating to methods of treatment for treating particular diseases using antibodies to Siglec-8, methods of delivering antibodies to Siglec-8, and formulations for antibodies to Siglec-8. We have also filed patent applications with claims pending relating to antibodies in preclinical development and methods for treating cancer with these antibodies. We also have a non-exclusive license to intellectual property from BioWa and Lonza regarding the expression and manufacturing of monoclonal antibodies in particular mammalian host cell lines.
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the United States, a patent’s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date of a U.S. patent as partial compensation for the length of time the drug is under regulatory review while the patent is in force. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended.


Similar provisions are available in the European Union and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our product candidates, including lirentelimab, receive approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those products, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each drug and other factors. Expiration dates referred to above are without regard to potential patent term extension or other market exclusivity that may be available to us.
 We also rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.

 Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business
 The pandemic caused by an outbreak of a novel coronavirus causing a disease known as COVID-19 (“COVID-19”) has resulted, and is likely to continue to result, in significant national and global economic disruption and may have an adverse impact on our operations, supply chains and distribution systems or those of our contractors, and increase our expenses, including as a result of impacts associated with preventive and precautionary measures that are being taken, such as restrictions on travel, quarantine polices and social distancing. For example, the ability of our employees or those of our contractors to work has been and is likely to continue to be adversely affected. Moreover, we and our contractors have and are likely to continue to experience disruptions in supply of items that are essential for our research and development activities, including, for example, raw materials and other consumables used in the manufacturing of our product candidates or medical and laboratory supplies used in our clinical trials or preclinical studies, in each case, for which there are or may be shortages because of ongoing efforts to address the outbreak. In particular, pursuant to the U.S. Defense Production Act, as amended (the “Defense Production Act”), the U.S. federal government can require domestic industries to provide essential goods and services needed for the national defense, and they have begun to use it in the context of COVID-19 to divert supplies and materials to vaccine producers, and this has and likely will continue to cause delays with some of our suppliers. In addition, enrollment for our clinical studies may be adversely affected and the completion of such studies may be delayed. Also, the spread of COVID-19 has disrupted the United States’ healthcare and healthcare regulatory systems which could divert healthcare resources away from, or materially delay, FDA approval or any applicable foreign regulatory approval with respect to our product candidates. Furthermore, our clinical trials may be negatively affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. Given the daily evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak and the response to curb its spread, currently we are not able to estimate the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak to our results

of operations or financial condition. For additional information, see “Risk Factors–Risks Related to the Discovery, Development and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates–Our business may be adversely affected by health epidemics, including the recent coronavirus outbreak.”
