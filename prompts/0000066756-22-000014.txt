Item 1. Business 
Overview.
ALLETE is a leader in the nation’s clean-energy transformation. Our businesses and dedicated employees deliver sustainable energy solutions that mitigate climate change, build thriving communities, help customers reach their sustainability goals and drive value for shareholders. ALLETE’s largest business, Minnesota Power, recently reached a milestone of providing 50 percent renewable energy, and envisions delivering 100 percent carbon-free energy to customers by 2050—a vision grounded in a steadfast commitment to climate, customers and community through its EnergyForward strategy. ALLETE Clean Energy, our second-largest business, is positioned at the heart of society’s clean-energy transformation and owns, operates and is developing more than 1,300 megawatts of wind energy generation across eight states – helping some of the largest companies in the country reduce their carbon footprint.
In February 2021, Minnesota Power filed its latest IRP with the MPUC, which outlines its clean-energy transition plans through 2035. These plans include expanding its renewable energy supply to 70 percent by 2030, achieving coal-free operations at its facilities by 2035, and investing in a resilient and flexible transmission and distribution grid. Minnesota Power has also set a target to achieve an 80 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2035 compared to 2005 levels. As part of these plans, Minnesota Power anticipates adding approximately 400 MW of new wind and solar energy resources, retiring Boswell Unit 3 by 2030 and transforming Boswell Unit 4 to be coal-free by 2035. Minnesota Power’s plans recognize that advances in technology will play a significant role in completing its transition to carbon-free energy supply, reliably and affordably. A final decision on the IRP is expected in second half of 2022.
In recent years, Minnesota Power has transformed its energy supply from more than a 95 percent reliance on coal to become a leader in the nation’s clean-energy transformation. Since 2013, the company has closed or converted seven of its nine coal-fired units and added nearly 900 megawatts of renewable energy sources. Additionally, Minnesota Power has been a leader in energy conservation, surpassing the state’s conservation goals each year for the past decade. 
ALLETE is also committed to earning a financial return that rewards our shareholders, allows for reinvestment in our businesses, and sustains growth. ALLETE is predominately a regulated utility through Minnesota Power, SWL&P, and an investment in ATC. ALLETE’s strategy is to remain predominately a regulated utility while also investing in ALLETE Clean Energy and our Corporate and Other businesses to complement its regulated businesses, balance exposure to the utility’s industrial customers, and provide potential long-term earnings growth.
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in widespread impacts on the global economy and on our employees, customers, contractors, and suppliers. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the length of time for which COVID-19 will continue, if new variants will emerge or the extent and duration of measures to try to contain the virus. Additional disclosures in this Form 10-K regarding the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic are located in Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Regulated Operations includes our regulated utilities, Minnesota Power and SWL&P, as well as our investment in ATC, a Wisconsin-based regulated utility that owns and maintains electric transmission assets in portions of Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota and Illinois. Minnesota Power provides regulated utility electric service in northeastern Minnesota to approximately 150,000 retail customers. Minnesota Power also has 15 non-affiliated municipal customers in Minnesota. SWL&P is a Wisconsin utility and a wholesale customer of Minnesota Power. SWL&P provides regulated utility electric, natural gas and water service in northwestern Wisconsin to approximately 15,000 electric customers, 13,000 natural gas customers and 10,000 water customers. Our regulated utility operations include retail and wholesale activities under the jurisdiction of state and federal regulatory authorities. (See Note 4. Regulatory Matters.)
ALLETE Clean Energy focuses on developing, acquiring, and operating clean and renewable energy projects. ALLETE Clean Energy currently owns and operates, in seven states, more than 1,300 MW of nameplate capacity wind energy generation that is contracted under PSAs of various durations. In addition, ALLETE Clean Energy currently has approximately 200 MW of wind energy facilities under contract to be sold to others. ALLETE Clean Energy also engages in the development of wind energy facilities to operate under long-term PSAs or for sale to others upon completion.

Industrial Customers. In 2021, industrial customers represented 47 percent of total regulated utility kWh sales. Our industrial customers are primarily in the taconite mining, paper, pulp and secondary wood products, and pipeline industries.
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental responses has led to a disruption of economic activity, and could result in an extended disruption of economic activity. This disruption resulted in reduced sales and revenue from industrial customers in 2020 as many industrial customers operated at reduced levels or were temporarily closed or idled during 2020. Sales to our industrial customers in 2021 were similar to levels prior to the COVID-19 pandemic; however, further disruption of economic activity or an extended disruption of economic activity may lead to additional adverse impacts on our industrial customers including reduced production or the temporary idling or indefinite shutdown of facilities, which would result in lower sales and revenue from these customers.

Six taconite facilities served by Minnesota Power made up approximately 80 percent of 2020 iron ore pellet production in the U.S. according to data from the Minnesota Department of Revenue 2021 Mining Tax Guide. These taconite facilities were owned by Cliffs and USS Corporation at the end of the 2021. (See Large Power Customer Contracts.) Sales to taconite customers represented 5,281 million kWh, or 73 percent of total industrial customer kWh sales in 2021. Taconite, an iron‑bearing rock of relatively low iron content, is abundantly available in northern Minnesota and an important domestic source of raw material for the steel industry. Taconite processing plants use large quantities of electric power to grind the iron-bearing rock, and agglomerate and pelletize the iron particles into taconite pellets. 
Minnesota Power’s taconite customers are capable of producing approximately 41 million tons of taconite pellets annually. Taconite pellets produced in Minnesota are primarily shipped to North American steel making facilities that are part of the integrated steel industry, which continue to lead the world in environmental performance among steelmaking countries. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, steel production in the U.S. is the most energy efficient of any major steel producing country. Steel produced from these North American facilities is used primarily in the manufacture of automobiles, appliances, tubular applications for all industries, and in the construction industry. Steel is also a critical component of the clean energy transformation underway today. The demand for more renewable energy and the need for additional infrastructure to transport green energy from the point of generation to the end user both require steel. Historically, less than 10 percent of Minnesota taconite production has been exported outside of North America.

There has been a general historical correlation between U.S. steel production and Minnesota taconite production. The American Iron and Steel Institute, an association of North American steel producers, reported that U.S. raw steel production operated at approximately 82 percent of capacity in 2021 (68 percent in 2020 and 80 percent in 2019). The World Steel Association, an association of steel producers, national and regional steel industry associations, and steel research institutes representing approximately 85 percent of world steel production, projected U.S. steel consumption in 2022 will increase by approximately 6 percent compared to 2021. 
The following table reflects Minnesota Power’s taconite customers’ production levels for the past ten years:

* Preliminary data from the Minnesota Department of Revenue. 

Minnesota Power’s taconite customers may experience annual variations in production levels due to such factors as economic conditions, short-term demand changes or maintenance outages. We estimate that a one million ton change in Minnesota Power’s taconite customers’ production would impact our annual earnings per share by approximately $0.04, net of expected power marketing sales at current prices. Changes in wholesale electric prices or customer contractual demand nominations could impact this estimate. Minnesota Power proactively sells power in the wholesale power markets that is temporarily not required by industrial customers to optimize the value of its generating facilities. Long-term reductions in taconite production or a permanent shut down of a taconite customer may lead Minnesota Power to file a general rate case to recover lost revenue.
In addition to serving the taconite industry, Minnesota Power serves a number of customers in the paper, pulp and secondary wood products industry, which represented 702 million kWh, or 10 percent of total industrial customer kWh sales in 2021. Minnesota Power also has an agreement to provide steam for one paper and pulp customer for use in the customer’s operations. The four major paper and pulp mills we serve reported operating at lower levels in 2021 compared to 2020. Verso Corporation indefinitely idled its paper mill in Duluth, Minnesota, which it subsequently sold to ST Paper in May 2021. (See Outlook – Regulated Operations – Industrial Customers and Prospective Additional Load – Paper, Pulp and Secondary Wood Products – Verso Corporation and ST Paper.)
Large Power Customer Contracts. Minnesota Power had eight Large Power Customer contracts as of December 31, 2021, each serving requirements of 10 MW or more of customer load; however, Minnesota Power and Verso Corporation mutually agreed to resolve the outstanding commitments under the contract in January 2022. The customers as of December 31, 2021 consisted of six taconite facilities owned by Cliffs and USS Corporation as well as four paper and pulp mills. Certain facilities with common ownership are served under combined contracts.
ALLETE, Inc. 2021 Form 10-K


REGULATED OPERATIONS (Continued)
Large Power Customer Contracts (Continued)
Large Power Customer contracts require Minnesota Power to have a certain amount of generating capacity available. In turn, each Large Power Customer is required to pay a minimum monthly demand charge that covers the fixed costs associated with having this capacity available to serve the customer, including a return on common equity. Most contracts allow customers to establish the level of megawatts subject to a demand charge on a three to four-month basis and require that a portion of their megawatt needs be committed on a take-or-pay basis for at least a portion of the term of the agreement. In addition to the demand charge, each Large Power Customer is billed an energy charge for each kWh used that recovers the variable costs incurred in generating electricity. Five of the Large Power Customer contracts have interruptible service which provides a discounted demand rate in exchange for the ability to interrupt the customers during system emergencies. Minnesota Power also provides incremental production service for customer demand levels above the contractual take-or-pay levels. There is no demand charge for this service and energy is priced at an increment above Minnesota Power’s cost. Incremental production service is interruptible.
All contracts with Large Power Customers continue past the contract termination date unless the required advance notice of cancellation has been given. The required advance notice of cancellation varies from two to four years. Such contracts reduce the impact on earnings that otherwise would result from significant reductions in kWh sales to such customers. Large Power Customers are required to take all of their purchased electric service requirements from Minnesota Power for the duration of their contracts. The rates and corresponding revenue associated with capacity and energy provided under these contracts are subject to change through the same regulatory process governing all retail electric rates. (See Regulatory Matters – Electric Rates.)
Minnesota Power, as permitted by the MPUC, requires its taconite-producing Large Power Customers to pay weekly for electric usage based on monthly energy usage estimates. These customers receive estimated bills or make weekly prepayments based on Minnesota Power’s estimate of the customer’s energy usage, forecasted energy prices and fuel adjustment clause estimates. Minnesota Power’s taconite‑producing Large Power Customers have generally predictable energy usage on a week-to-week basis and any differences that occur are trued-up the following month.

Residential and Commercial Customers. In 2021, residential and commercial customers represented 16 percent of total regulated utility kWh sales. 
Municipal Customers. In 2021, municipal customers represented 4 percent of total regulated utility kWh sales. 
Minnesota Power’s wholesale electric contracts with 15 non-affiliated municipal customers in Minnesota have termination dates ranging from 2024 through 2037, with a majority of contracts effective through 2029. Two of the wholesale contracts include a termination clause requiring a three-year notice to terminate. (See Note 4. Regulatory Matters.)
Other Power Suppliers. The Company also enters into off-system sales with Other Power Suppliers. These sales are at market‑based prices into the MISO market on a daily basis or through bilateral agreements of various durations.
Our PSAs are detailed in Note 8. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies, with additional disclosure provided in the following paragraphs.
Basin PSAs. Minnesota Power had an agreement to sell 100 MW of capacity and energy to Basin for a ten-year period which expired in April 2020. Minnesota Power has two additional agreements to sell capacity to Basin at fixed prices. (See Note 8. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.)
Minnkota Power PSA. Minnesota Power has a PSA with Minnkota Power where Minnesota Power is selling a portion of its entitlement from Square Butte to Minnkota Power, resulting in Minnkota Power’s net entitlement increasing and Minnesota Power’s net entitlement decreasing until Minnesota Power’s share is eliminated at the end of 2025. Of Minnesota Power’s 50 percent output entitlement, it sold approximately 28 percent to Minnkota Power in 2021 (28 percent in 2020 and in 2019). Minnkota Power’s net entitlement increases to approximately 32 percent in 2022, 37 percent in 2023, 41 percent in 2024, 46 percent in 2025 and 50 percent in 2026. (See Power Supply – Long-Term Purchased Power.) 
Silver Bay Power PSA. In 2016, Minnesota Power and Silver Bay Power entered into a PSA through 2031. Silver Bay Power supplies approximately 90 MW of load to Northshore Mining, an affiliate of Silver Bay Power, which had previously been served predominately through self-generation by Silver Bay Power. Minnesota Power now supplies the full energy requirements for Silver Bay Power.
Seasonality
The operations of our industrial customers, which make up a large portion of our electric sales, are not typically subject to significant seasonal variations. (See Electric Sales / Customers.) As a result, Minnesota Power is generally not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations in electric sales; however, Minnesota Power and SWL&P electric and natural gas sales to other customers may be affected by seasonal differences in weather. In general, peak electric sales occur in the winter and summer months with fewer electric sales in the spring and fall months. Peak sales of natural gas generally occur in the winter months. Additionally, our regulated utilities have historically generated fewer sales and less revenue when weather conditions are milder in the winter and summer.
Power Supply
In order to meet its customers’ electric requirements, Minnesota Power utilizes a mix of its own generation and purchased power. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 50 percent of Minnesota Power’s power supply was provided by renewable energy sources. This was enabled by the completion of the 250 MW Nobles 2 wind energy facility in December 2020 and the GNTL in June 2020, which is used to deliver 250 MW of hydroelectric energy from Manitoba Hydro. Minnesota Power’s remaining operating coal-fired facilities are Boswell Units 3 and 4, which Minnesota Power proposed in its latest IRP to retire by 2030 and be coal-free by 2035, respectively. (See Regulatory Matters.) The following table reflects Minnesota Power’s generating capabilities as of December 31, 2021, and total electrical supply for 2021. Minnesota Power had an annual net peak load of 1,557 MW on July 26, 2021.

Power Supply (Continued)
Fuel. Minnesota Power purchases low-sulfur, sub-bituminous coal from the Powder River Basin region located in Montana and Wyoming. Coal consumption in 2021 for electric generation at Minnesota Power’s coal-fired generating stations was 2.7 million tons (2.2 million tons in 2020; 2.5 million tons in 2019). As of December 31, 2021, Minnesota Power had coal inventories of 0.4 million tons (0.8 million tons as of December 31, 2020). Minnesota Power has coal supply agreements providing for the purchase of a significant portion of its coal requirements through December 2022. In 2022, Minnesota Power expects to obtain coal under these coal supply agreements and in the spot market. Minnesota Power continues to explore other future coal supply options and believes that adequate supplies of low-sulfur, sub-bituminous coal will continue to be available.
Minnesota Power also has coal transportation agreements in place for the delivery of a significant portion of its coal requirements through December 2024. The costs of fuel and related transportation costs for Minnesota Power’s generation are recoverable from Minnesota Power’s utility customers through the fuel adjustment clause.

Average Price per Ton | $39.51 | | $34.94 | $35.31
Average Price per MBtu | $2.18 | | $1.93 | $1.94 

Long-Term Purchased Power. Minnesota Power has contracts to purchase capacity and energy from various entities, including output from certain coal, wind, hydro and solar generating facilities. 
Our PPAs are detailed in Note 8. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies, with additional disclosure provided in the following paragraph.
Square Butte PPA. Under the PPA with Square Butte that extends through 2026, Minnesota Power is entitled to 50 percent of the output of Square Butte’s 455 MW coal-fired generating unit. (See Note 8. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.) BNI Energy mines and sells lignite coal to Square Butte. This lignite supply is sufficient to provide fuel for the anticipated useful life of the generating unit. Square Butte’s cost of lignite consumed in 2021 was approximately $1.94 per MBtu ($1.75 per MBtu in 2020; $1.88 per MBtu in 2019). (See Electric Sales / Customers – Minnkota Power PSA.)
Manitoba Hydro. Minnesota Power has three long-term PPAs with Manitoba Hydro. Under the first PPA, Minnesota Power is purchasing surplus energy through April 2022. This energy-only agreement primarily consists of surplus hydro energy on Manitoba Hydro’s system that is delivered to Minnesota Power on a non-firm basis. Under this agreement, Minnesota Power will purchase at least one million MWh of energy over the contract term. The second PPA provides for Minnesota Power to purchase 250 MW of capacity and energy from Manitoba Hydro through May 2035. The third PPA provides for Minnesota Power to purchase up to 133 MW of energy from Manitoba Hydro through June 2040.
Transmission and Distribution
We have electric transmission and distribution lines of 500 kV (232 miles), 345 kV (241 miles), 250 kV (466 miles), 230 kV (715 miles), 161 kV (43 miles), 138 kV (130 miles), 115 kV (1,248 miles) and less than 115 kV (6,390 miles). We own and operate 159 substations with a total capacity of 10,086 megavoltamperes. Some of our transmission and distribution lines interconnect with other utilities.
Great Northern Transmission Line. As a condition of the 250 MW long-term PPA entered into with Manitoba Hydro, construction of additional transmission capacity was required. As a result, Minnesota Power constructed the GNTL, an approximately 220‑mile 500-kV transmission line between Manitoba and Minnesota’s Iron Range that was proposed by Minnesota Power and Manitoba Hydro in order to strengthen the electric grid, enhance regional reliability and promote a greater exchange of sustainable energy. In June 2020, Minnesota Power placed the GNTL into service with project costs of approximately $310 million incurred by Minnesota Power. Total project costs, including those costs contributed by a subsidiary of Manitoba Hydro, totaled approximately $660 million. The 250 MW PPA with Manitoba Hydro commenced when the GNTL was placed into service.

Investment in ATC
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, ALLETE Transmission Holdings, owns approximately 8 percent of ATC, a Wisconsin-based utility that owns and maintains electric transmission assets in portions of Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota and Illinois. We account for our investment in ATC under the equity method of accounting. As of December 31 2021, our equity investment in ATC was $154.5 million ($149.0 million as of December 31, 2020). (See Note 5. Equity Investments.) 
ATC’s authorized return on equity is 10.02 percent, or 10.52 percent including an incentive adder for participation in a regional transmission organization, based on a 2020 FERC order that granted rehearing of a 2019 FERC order. These FERC orders are subject to various outstanding legal challenges related to the refund period ordered by the FERC. If these legal challenges are successful, ATC may be required to provide refunds to its customers of up to approximately $65 million of which our share would be approximately $5 million pre-tax. In addition, the FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in April 2021 proposing to limit the 50 basis point incentive adder for participation in a regional transmission organization to only the first three years of membership in such an organization. If this proposal is adopted, our equity in earnings from ATC would be reduced by approximately $1 million pre-tax annually. 
ATC’s 10-year transmission assessment, which covers the years 2021 through 2030, identifies a need for between $3.5 billion and $4.2 billion in transmission system investments. These investments by ATC, if undertaken, are expected to be funded through a combination of internally generated cash, debt and investor contributions. As opportunities arise, we plan to make additional investments in ATC through general capital calls based upon our pro rata ownership interest in ATC.
Properties
Our Regulated Operations businesses own office and service buildings, an energy control center, repair shops, electric plants, transmission facilities and storerooms in various localities in Minnesota, Wisconsin and North Dakota. All of the electric plants are subject to mortgages, which collateralize the outstanding first mortgage bonds of Minnesota Power and SWL&P. Most of the generating plants and substations are located on real property owned by Minnesota Power or SWL&P, subject to the lien of a mortgage, whereas most of the transmission and distribution lines are located on real property owned by others with appropriate easement rights or necessary permits from governmental authorities. WPPI Energy owns 20 percent of Boswell Unit 4. WPPI Energy has the right to use our transmission line facilities to transport its share of Boswell generation. (See Note 3. Jointly-Owned Facilities and Assets.)
Regulatory Matters
We are subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory authorities and other organizations. Regulatory matters and proceedings are detailed in Note 4. Regulatory Matters, with a summary included in the following paragraphs.
Electric Rates. All rates and contract terms in our Regulated Operations are subject to approval by applicable regulatory authorities. Minnesota Power and SWL&P design their retail electric service rates based on cost of service studies under which allocations are made to the various classes of customers as approved by the MPUC or the PSCW. Nearly all retail sales include billing adjustment clauses, which may adjust electric service rates for changes in the cost of fuel and purchased energy, recovery of current and deferred conservation improvement program expenditures and recovery of certain transmission, renewable and environmental investments.
Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. The MPUC has regulatory authority over Minnesota Power’s retail service area in Minnesota, retail rates, retail services, capital structure, issuance of securities and other matters. Minnesota Power’s current retail rates are based on a 2018 MPUC retail rate order that allows for a 9.25 percent return on common equity and a 53.81 percent equity ratio. The resolution of Minnesota Power’s 2020 general rate case did not change the allowed return on equity or equity ratio. (See 2020 Minnesota General Rate Case.) As authorized by the MPUC, Minnesota Power also recognizes revenue under cost recovery riders for transmission and renewable investments.
2020 Minnesota General Rate Case. In November 2019, Minnesota Power filed a retail rate increase request with the MPUC seeking an average increase of approximately 10.6 percent for retail customers. The rate filing sought a return on equity of 10.05 percent and a 53.81 percent equity ratio. On an annualized basis, the requested final rate increase would have generated approximately $66 million in additional revenue. In December 2019 orders, the MPUC accepted the filing as complete and authorized an annual interim rate increase of $36.1 million beginning January 1, 2020.
ALLETE, Inc. 2021 Form 10-K


REGULATED OPERATIONS (Continued)
Regulatory Matters (Continued)
In April 2020, Minnesota Power filed a request with the MPUC that proposed a resolution of Minnesota Power’s 2020 general rate case. Key components of our proposal included removing the power marketing margin credit in base rates and reflecting actual power marketing margins in the fuel adjustment clause effective May 1, 2020; refunding to customers interim rates collected through April 2020; increasing customer rates 4.1 percent compared to the 5.8 percent increase reflected in interim rates; and a provision that Minnesota Power would not file another rate case until at least November 1, 2021, unless certain events occur. In a June 2020 order, the MPUC approved Minnesota Power’s petition and proposal to resolve and withdraw the general rate case. Effective May 1, 2020, customer rates were set at an increase of 4.1 percent with the removal of the power marketing margin credit from base rates. Actual power marketing margins will be reflected in the fuel adjustment clause. Reserves for interim rates of $11.7 million were recorded in the second quarter of 2020 and refunded in the third and fourth quarters of 2020.
2022 Minnesota General Rate Case. On November 1, 2021, Minnesota Power filed a retail rate increase request with the MPUC seeking an average increase of approximately 18 percent for retail customers. The rate filing seeks a return on equity of 10.25 percent and a 53.81 percent equity ratio. On an annualized basis, the requested final rate increase would generate approximately $108 million in additional revenue. In orders dated December 30, 2021, the MPUC accepted the filing as complete and authorized an annual interim rate increase beginning January 1, 2022, with approximately $80 million expected to be collected in cash and approximately $8 million of interim rates for residential customers deferred with a final determination on recovery at the end of the rate case.
Minnesota Power Land Sales. In August 2020, Minnesota Power filed a petition with the MPUC for approval to sell land that surrounds several reservoirs on its hydroelectric system and is no longer required to maintain its operations. The land has an estimated value of approximately $100 million, and Minnesota Power proposed to credit ratepayers the net proceeds from the sales in a future rate case or through its renewable resources rider to mitigate future rate increases. In an order dated November 18, 2021, the MPUC authorized the land sales and directed the net proceeds to be refunded to ratepayers subject to certain conditions and required compliance filings.
2021 Integrated Resource Plan. On February 1, 2021, Minnesota Power filed its latest IRP with the MPUC, which outlines its clean-energy transition plans through 2035. These plans include expanding its renewable energy supply to 70 percent by 2030, achieving coal-free operations at its facilities by 2035, and investing in a resilient and flexible transmission and distribution grid. Minnesota Power has also set a target to achieve an 80 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2035 compared to 2005 levels. As part of these plans, Minnesota Power anticipates adding approximately 400 MW of new wind and solar energy resources, retiring Boswell Unit 3 by 2030 and transforming Boswell Unit 4 to be coal-free by 2035. Minnesota Power’s plans recognize that advances in technology will play a significant role in completing its transition to carbon-free energy supply, reliably and affordably. A final decision on the IRP is expected in the second half of 2022.
Minnesota Power has a vision to deliver 100 percent carbon-free energy to customers by 2050, continuing its commitment to climate, customers and communities through its EnergyForward strategy. This vision builds on Minnesota Power’s recent achievement of now providing 50 percent renewable energy to its customers.
Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. The PSCW has regulatory authority over SWL&P’s retail sales of electricity, natural gas and water, issuances of securities and other matters. SWL&P’s current retail rates are based on a December 2018 order that allows for a return on equity of 10.4 percent and a 55.0 percent equity ratio. The PSCW had directed SWL&P to file its next general rate case in 2020; however, the PSCW granted an extension request made by SWL&P to delay filing its next general rate case until on or before December 20, 2022. SWL&P requested the extension primarily due to impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
North Dakota Public Service Commission. The NDPSC has jurisdiction over site and route permitting of generation and transmission facilities in North Dakota.
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The FERC has jurisdiction over the licensing of hydroelectric projects, the establishment of rates and charges for transmission of electricity in interstate commerce, electricity sold at wholesale (including the rates for Minnesota Power’s municipal and wholesale customers), natural gas transportation, certain accounting and record‑keeping practices, certain activities of our regulated utilities and the operations of ATC. FERC jurisdiction also includes enforcement of NERC mandatory electric reliability standards. Violations of FERC rules are subject to enforcement action by the FERC including financial penalties up to $1 million per day per violation.
ALLETE, Inc. 2021 Form 10-K


REGULATED OPERATIONS (Continued)
Regional Organizations
Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. Minnesota Power, SWL&P and ATC are members of MISO, a regional transmission organization. While Minnesota Power and SWL&P retain ownership of their respective transmission assets, their transmission networks are under the regional operational control of MISO. Minnesota Power and SWL&P take and provide transmission service under the MISO open access transmission tariff. In cooperation with stakeholders, MISO manages the delivery of electric power across 15 states and the Canadian province of Manitoba.
North American Electric Reliability Corporation. The NERC has been certified by the FERC as the national electric reliability organization. The NERC ensures the reliability of the North American bulk power system. The NERC oversees six regional entities that establish requirements, approved by the FERC, for reliable operation and maintenance of power generation facilities and transmission systems. Minnesota Power is subject to these reliability requirements and can incur significant penalties for non‑compliance.
Midwest Reliability Organization (MRO). Minnesota Power and ATC are members of the MRO, one of the six regional entities overseen by the NERC. The MRO's primary responsibilities are to: ensure compliance with mandatory reliability standards by entities who own, operate or use the interconnected, international bulk power system; conduct assessments of the grid's ability to meet electricity demand in the region; and analyze regional system events. The MRO region spans the Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba, and all or parts of 16 states. 
Minnesota Legislation
Renewable Energy. Minnesota law requires 25 percent of electric utilities’ applicable retail and municipal energy sales in Minnesota to be from renewable energy sources by 2025. Minnesota law also requires Minnesota Power to meet interim milestones including 20 percent by 2020. The law allows the MPUC to modify or delay meeting a milestone if implementation will cause significant ratepayer cost or technical reliability issues. If a utility is not in compliance with a milestone, the MPUC may order the utility to construct facilities, purchase renewable energy or purchase renewable energy credits. Minnesota Power has exceeded the interim milestone requirements to date. 
As of December 31, 2021, approximately 50 percent of Minnesota Power’s power supply was provided by renewable energy sources. (See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Outlook – EnergyForward.) 
Minnesota Solar Energy Standard. Minnesota law requires at least 1.5 percent of total retail electric sales, excluding sales to certain customers, to be generated by solar energy. At least 10 percent of the 1.5 percent mandate must be met by solar energy generated by or procured from solar photovoltaic devices with a nameplate capacity of 40 kW or less and community solar garden subscriptions. Minnesota Power has met both parts of the solar mandate to date.
Competition
Retail electric energy sales in Minnesota and Wisconsin are made to customers in assigned service territories. As a result, most retail electric customers in Minnesota do not have the ability to choose their electric supplier. Large energy users of 2 MW and above that are located outside of a municipality are allowed to choose a supplier upon MPUC approval. Minnesota Power served 8 Large Power Customers under contracts of at least 10 MW in 2021, none of which have engaged in a competitive rate process. (See Electric Sales / Customers.) No other large commercial or small industrial customers in Minnesota Power’s service territory have sought a provider outside Minnesota Power’s service territory. Retail electric and natural gas customers in Wisconsin do not have the ability to choose their energy supplier. In both states, however, electricity may compete with other forms of energy. Customers may also choose to generate their own electricity, or substitute other forms of energy for their manufacturing processes.
In 2021, 4 percent of total regulated utility kWh sales were to municipal customers in Minnesota. These customers have the right to seek an energy supply from any wholesale electric service provider upon contract expiration. Minnesota Power’s wholesale electric contract with the Nashwauk Public Utilities Commission was extended in 2020 and is effective through December 31, 2037. Minnesota Power’s wholesale electric contracts with 14 non-affiliated municipal customers are effective through varying dates ranging from 2024 through 2029. (See Electric Sales / Customers.)
ALLETE, Inc. 2021 Form 10-K


REGULATED OPERATIONS (Continued)
Competition (Continued)
The FERC has continued with its efforts to promote a competitive wholesale market through open-access electric transmission and other means. As a result, our electric sales to Other Power Suppliers and our purchases to supply our retail and wholesale load are made in a competitive market.
Franchises
Minnesota Power holds franchises to construct and maintain an electric distribution and transmission system in 95 cities. The remaining cities, villages and towns served by Minnesota Power do not require a franchise to operate. SWL&P serves customers under electric, natural gas or water franchises in 1 city and 14 villages and towns.
ALLETE CLEAN ENERGY
ALLETE Clean Energy focuses on developing, acquiring, and operating clean and renewable energy projects. ALLETE Clean Energy currently owns and operates, in seven states, more than 1,300 MW of nameplate capacity wind energy generation that is contracted under PSAs of various durations. In addition, ALLETE Clean Energy currently has approximately 200 MW of wind energy facilities under contract to be sold to others. ALLETE Clean Energy also engages in the development of wind energy facilities to operate under long-term PSAs or for sale to others upon completion. (See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Outlook – ALLETE Clean Energy.)
ALLETE Clean Energy believes the market for renewable energy in North America is robust, driven by several factors including environmental regulation, tax incentives such as the extension of production tax credit and investment tax credits, societal expectations and continual technology advances. State renewable portfolio standards, state or federal regulations to limit GHG emissions and the extension of production tax credit and investment tax credits are examples of environmental regulation or public policy that we believe will drive renewable energy development.
ALLETE Clean Energy’s strategy includes the safe, reliable, optimal and profitable operation of its existing facilities. This includes a strong safety culture, the continuous pursuit of operational efficiencies at existing facilities and cost controls. ALLETE Clean Energy generally acquires facilities in liquid power markets and its strategy includes the exploration of PSA extensions upon expiration of existing contracts, production tax credit requalification of existing facilities or the sale of facilities.
ALLETE, Inc. 2021 Form 10-K


ALLETE CLEAN ENERGY (Continued)
ALLETE Clean Energy manages risk by having a diverse portfolio of assets, which includes PSA expiration, technology and geographic diversity. The current operating portfolio is subject to typical variations in seasonal wind with higher wind resources typically available in the winter months. The majority of its planned maintenance leverages this seasonality and is performed during lower wind periods. ALLETE Clean Energy’s current operating portfolio is as follows:

Region | Wind Energy Facility | Capacity MW | PSA MW | PSA Expiration

 | South Peak | 80 | 100% | 2035 

(a)The PSA expiration assumes the exercise of four one-year renewal options that ALLETE Clean Energy has the sole right to exercise.
The majority of ALLETE Clean Energy’s wind operations are located on real property owned by others with easement rights or necessary consents of governmental authorities. One of ALLETE Clean Energy’s wind energy facilities is encumbered by liens against its assets securing financing. ALLETE Clean Energy’s Glen Ullin, South Peak, Diamond Spring and Caddo wind energy facilities are subject to tax equity financing structures. (See Note 1. Operations and Significant Accounting Policies.)
U.S. WATER SERVICES
U.S. Water Services provided integrated water management for industry by combining chemical, equipment, engineering and service for customized solutions to reduce water and energy usage, and improve efficiency. In March 2019, the Company sold U.S. Water Services to a subsidiary of Kurita Water Industries Ltd. pursuant to a stock purchase agreement for approximately $270 million in cash, net of transaction costs and cash retained. The Company recognized a gain on the sale of U.S. Water Services of $13.2 million after-tax in 2019. ALLETE used the proceeds from the sale of U.S. Water Services to reinvest in growth initiatives at our Regulated Operations and ALLETE Clean Energy. 
CORPORATE AND OTHER
BNI Energy
BNI Energy is a supplier of lignite coal in North Dakota, producing approximately 4 million tons annually and has an estimated 650 million tons of lignite coal reserves. Two electric generating cooperatives, Minnkota Power and Square Butte, consume virtually all of BNI Energy’s production of lignite under cost-plus fixed fee coal supply agreements extending through December 31, 2037. (See Item 1. Business – Regulated Operations – Power Supply – Long-Term Purchased Power and Note 8. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.) The mining process disturbs and reclaims between 200 and 250 acres per year. Laws require that the reclaimed land be at least as productive as it was prior to mining. As of December 31, 2021, BNI Energy’s total reclamation liability is estimated at $70.7 million and is included in Other Non-Current Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These costs are included in the cost-plus fixed fee contract, for which an asset reclamation cost receivable was included in Other Non-Current Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The asset reclamation obligation is guaranteed by surety bonds and a letter of credit. (See Note 8. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.)
ALLETE, Inc. 2021 Form 10-K


CORPORATE AND OTHER (Continued)
Investment in Nobles 2
Our subsidiary, ALLETE South Wind, owns a 49 percent equity interest in Nobles 2, the entity that owns and operates a 250 MW wind energy facility in southwestern Minnesota pursuant to a 20-year PPA with Minnesota Power. As of December 31, 2021, our equity investment in Nobles 2 was $163.5 million ($152.2 million at December 31, 2020). (See Note 5. Equity Investments.)
South Shore Energy
South Shore Energy, ALLETE’s non-rate regulated, Wisconsin subsidiary, is developing NTEC, an approximately 600 MW proposed combined-cycle natural gas-fired generating facility to be built in Superior, Wisconsin, which will be jointly owned by Dairyland Power Cooperative, Basin and South Shore Energy. Minnesota Power is expected to purchase approximately 20 percent of the facility's output starting in 2025 pursuant to a capacity dedication agreement. Construction of NTEC is subject to obtaining additional permits from local, state and federal authorities. The total project cost is estimated to be approximately $700 million, of which South Shore Energy’s portion is expected to be approximately $150 million. South Shore Energy’s portion of NTEC project costs incurred through December 31, 2021, is approximately $5 million.
On October 1, 2021, South Shore Energy sold a portion of its undivided ownership interest in NTEC for approximately $20 million representing reimbursement of current costs plus a fee for prior development costs and risks incurred. Following the transaction, South Shore Energy now owns a 20 percent undivided ownership interest in NTEC, Basin owns a 30 percent undivided ownership interest in NTEC and Dairyland Power Cooperative continues to own a 50 percent undivided ownership interest in NTEC. The closing of the transaction resulted in the recognition of an approximately $8.5 million after-tax gain recorded in Corporate and Other in the fourth quarter of 2021, related to prior development costs and risks incurred.
ALLETE Properties
ALLETE Properties represents our legacy Florida real estate investment. ALLETE Properties’ major project in Florida is Town Center at Palm Coast, which consists of approximately 500 acres of land as well as various residential units and non-residential square footage. In addition to the Town Center at Palm Coast project, ALLETE Properties has approximately 500 acres of other land available for sale. (See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Outlook – Corporate and Other – ALLETE Properties.)
Seller Financing. ALLETE Properties occasionally provides seller financing to qualified buyers. As of December 31, 2021, outstanding finance receivables were $7.6 million, net of reserves, with maturities through 2026. These finance receivables accrue interest at market-based rates and are collateralized by the financed properties.
Regulation. A substantial portion of our development properties in Florida are subject to federal, state and local regulations, and restrictions that may impose significant costs or limitations on our ability to develop the properties. Much of our property is vacant land and some is located in areas where development may affect the natural habitats of various protected wildlife species or in sensitive environmental areas such as wetlands.
Non-Rate Base Generation and Miscellaneous
Corporate and Other also includes other business development and corporate expenditures, unallocated interest expense, a small amount of non-rate base generation, approximately 4,000 acres of land in Minnesota, and earnings on cash and investments.
As of December 31, 2021, non-rate base generation consists of 29 MW of natural gas and hydro generation at Rapids Energy Center in Grand Rapids, Minnesota, which is primarily dedicated to the needs of one customer, UPM Blandin.
ALLETE, Inc. 2021 Form 10-K


ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
Our businesses are subject to regulation of environmental matters by various federal, state and local authorities. A number of regulatory changes to the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and various waste management requirements have been promulgated by both the EPA and state authorities over the past several years. Minnesota Power’s facilities are subject to additional requirements under many of these regulations. Minnesota Power is reshaping its generation portfolio, over time, to reduce its reliance on coal, has installed cost-effective emission control technology, and advocates for sound science and policy during rulemaking implementation.
We consider our businesses to be in substantial compliance with currently applicable environmental regulations and believe all necessary permits have been obtained. We anticipate that with many state and federal environmental regulations and requirements finalized, or to be finalized in the near future, potential expenditures for future environmental matters may be material and require significant capital investments. Minnesota Power has evaluated various environmental compliance scenarios using possible outcomes of environmental regulations to project power supply trends and impacts on customers.
We review environmental matters on a quarterly basis. Accruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on current law and existing technologies. Accruals are adjusted as assessment and remediation efforts progress, or as additional technical or legal information becomes available. Accruals for environmental liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at undiscounted amounts and exclude claims for recoveries from insurance or other third parties. Costs related to environmental contamination treatment and cleanup are expensed unless recoverable in rates from customers. (See Note 8. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.)
HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The Company’s key human capital management objectives are to attract, recognize and retain high quality talent, align with strategic business objectives and support the Company’s values. To support these objectives, the Company’s programs are designed to develop talent; reward and support employees through competitive compensation programs and benefit plans; enhance the Company’s culture through efforts aimed at making the workplace more engaging, safe and inclusive; and acquire talent and leverage internal opportunities to create a high-performing, diverse workforce. Our management and Board of Directors play key roles in reviewing and overseeing our human capital practices.
As of December 31, 2021, ALLETE had 1,365 employees, of which 1,340 were full-time. Minnesota Power and SWL&P have an aggregate of 469 employees covered under collective bargaining agreements, of which most are members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 31. The current labor agreements with IBEW Local 31 expire on April 30, 2023 for Minnesota Power and January 31, 2024 for SWL&P. BNI Energy has 127 employees that are members of IBEW Local 1593. The current labor agreement with IBEW Local 1593 expires on March 31, 2023.
Integrity. Integrity is a foundational, shared value at ALLETE, is important to ALLETE’s business and operations, and enables our success. The Company has a written Code of Ethics that applies to all of our employees.
Health and Safety. The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. We continue to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic by taking steps to mitigate the potential risks to us posed by its transmission and have implemented company-wide business continuity plans in response to the pandemic. These plans guide our response, business continuity, and the precautionary measures we are taking on behalf of employees and the public.
ALLETE, Inc. 2021 Form 10-K


HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT (Continued)
Zero Injury Culture. Our journey to Zero Injury starts with a culture that is open and transparent. We encourage all employees to report injuries, near misses, and good catches, so that we can learn and share with others throughout the Company in an effort to improve safety performance. Leaders have regular safety conversations with employees, where the data learned from the conversations is examined, shared with the ALLETE safety strategy team and used to improve the Company’s safety programs. To monitor progress, the Company uses leading and lagging indicators to analyze injury trends, safety participation and other data to make better decision on safety practices. 
Talent Attraction, Retention and Development. For more than a century, ALLETE has been successful because of our ability to attract and retain high-quality people who demonstrate our shared values. We engage in workforce planning, and succession planning, while building a robust talent pipeline and monitoring turnover.
We recognize and support the growth and development of our employees and offer opportunities to participate in internal and external learning programs. Our internal talent development programs provide employees with the resources they need to develop proficiency in their role, help achieve their career goals and build leadership skills. We are focusing initiatives on programs to expand the diversity of new hires and updating on-the-job trainings—including apprenticeships and scholarships aimed at bridging opportunity gaps—as we recognize the importance of a strong talent pipeline. In addition to role specific training, targeted training also includes respect in the workplace, cyber awareness, safety, integrity and leadership development.
Compensation and Benefits. Our competitive compensation package gives employees flexibility, choices and opportunities. Competitive compensation is important for the Company to attract and retain a qualified workforce to successfully manage our business and achieve our business objectives. We also strive to ensure pay equity amongst diverse employees performing equal or substantially similar work. Periodically, we review the median pay of our male and female employees as well as employees from diverse backgrounds. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. Increasing staff diversity enriches our workforce culture at ALLETE. Our employees are operating in an increasingly diverse society. In order to be accountable to our employees and stakeholders, we strive to have a workforce that reflects the diversity of the communities we serve, promotes inclusivity and is equitable.
At ALLETE, we want to ensure that we have a workplace culture where we treat each other with fairness, dignity and respect. The Company has a respect in the workplace initiative, which includes education as well as ongoing discussions focused on building respectful relationships and managing bias. We continue our efforts in crafting a framework to strengthen ALLETE’s diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in the areas of: workforce, supply chain and ALLETE as a community citizen. In 2021, ALLETE took tangible steps toward advancing diversity, equity and inclusion by continuing to raise awareness, furthering intentional external relationships/partnerships, increasing supplier diversity, focus on underrepresented groups through grants/scholarships and other Company and employee giving.
Yellow Ribbon Program. ALLETE and its subsidiaries are dedicated to supporting veterans, military members and their families. An employee effort grew out of that spirit of commitment to veterans and led the state of Minnesota to designate ALLETE/Minnesota Power and ALLETE Clean Energy as Yellow Ribbon Companies. The mission of ALLETE’s Yellow Ribbon Program is to contribute to the Company’s unique culture by proactively recruiting and retaining the best and supporting an environment in which military-connected employees can thrive.
