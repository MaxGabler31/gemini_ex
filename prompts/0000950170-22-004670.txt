 Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 Prior to December 22, 2021, we were a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company organized for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. On December 21, 2021, we changed our jurisdiction of incorporation from the Cayman Islands to the State of Delaware by deregistering as an exempted company in the Cayman Islands and continuing and domesticating as a corporation, incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. On December 22, 2021, we completed the Business Combination pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement dated July 7, 2021 that we entered into with Legacy Hyperfine and Liminal. Upon the completion of the Business Combination, we changed our name to “Hyperfine, Inc.” and the business of Legacy Hyperfine and Liminal became our business.
 We are an innovative digital health business with a mission to provide affordable and accessible imaging and monitoring and through magnetic resonance imaging (“MRI”) to revolutionize healthcare for people around the world. Our Swoop® Portable Magnetic Resonance (“MR”) Imaging SystemTM (“Swoop scanner”) produces high-quality images at a lower magnetic field strength than conventional MRI systems, and can be used by healthcare professionals to make effective clinical diagnoses on a patient in a variety of settings where MRI devices have previously been inaccessible. The easy-to-use interface and portable design of our Swoop scanner make it accessible for use anywhere in a hospital, clinic or patient care site. We are working to realize our vision of providing affordable and accessible imaging of health conditions around the world.
 MRI is a medical imaging technique used in radiology to image the anatomy and the physiological processes of the human body. It is typically used in a variety of clinical settings for medical diagnosis, staging of disease and follow-up treatment. Unlike X-ray computed tomography (“CT”) or positron emission tomography (“PET”), MRI does not expose patients to harmful ionizing radiation. We believe MRI offers the most sensitive and objective measures of brain tissue and injury. Despite its advantages, many healthcare institutions throughout the world lack the facilities, qualified operators and capital necessary to acquire and maintain expensive MRI devices. For healthcare institutions that do have conventional MRI systems, disadvantages of conventional MRI systems include their high cost, facility requirements for a specialized MRI suite, and the scheduling delays, personnel resources and risk of adverse events that result from the need to transport critically ill patients to the MRI suite. The Swoop scanner is intended for use at the patient’s bedside in any hospital room or clinical setting, such as a physician’s office or a local urgent care facility. The demand for MRI has been augmented by the aging population and rising prevalence of cancer and cardiovascular, neurologic and orthopedic conditions. Healthcare professionals and insurers are recognizing imaging as a cost-effective and non-invasive diagnostic tool for evaluation and ongoing monitoring. Swoop is a next generation of these devices designed to drive costs down and expand the current $15.9 billion imaging market.
 We believe the adoption of the Swoop scanner by healthcare professionals has benefits across healthcare communities both in the high and low resource settings. Through our collaborations with the healthcare community, we have begun to optimize our software ecosystem to harness Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) to transform the system into a true bedside clinical decision support platform. These efforts seek to improve image quality, help users analyze images, and reduce time to diagnosis. Our technology allows us to provide decision support and rapid feedback for diagnostic insight for clinicians of various levels of expertise. In the future, we hope to develop an ecosystem of products, expanding the capabilities of our core MRI product platform while introducing a brain sensing platform, subject to regulatory authorization, to offer a more complete solution and increase access to lifesaving technology across the care continuum.
 Legacy Hyperfine received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in 2020 for its Swoop Portable MR Imaging System for producing images that display the internal structure of the head where full diagnostic examination is not clinically practical, in order to provide imaging information to trained physicians that may be useful in determining a diagnosis. The system is commercially available in the United States. In 2021, we also obtained a Medical Device License issued by Health Canada and expanded into the Canadian market. In addition, we are seeking necessary regulatory authorizations in other major markets, including the United Kingdom, Australia and other countries. We recently received regulatory authorization in New Zealand and Pakistan. We are building our direct commercial infrastructure in the


United States and also have plans to sell our products in other countries either through direct sales or through distributors. Furthermore, we possess a portfolio of 141 issued patents worldwide as well as 293 patents pending as of February 15, 2022.
 Legacy Hyperfine and Liminal were founded in 2014 and 2018, respectively, by Dr. Jonathan Rothberg, a serial entrepreneur who received the Presidential Medal of Technology & Innovation in 2016 for inventing a novel next generation DNA sequencing method and has founded more than 10 healthcare and technology companies, including 454 Life Sciences, Ion Torrent, CuraGen, Butterfly Network and Quantum-Si. Legacy Hyperfine has raised over $160 million in equity investments and partnership milestones from leading institutional investors, including GV (formerly Google Ventures), and grants, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (the "BMGF").
 Liminal was founded as a wholly-owned subsidiary of 4Bionics LLC ("4Bionics"). 4Bionics was an early startup incubator founded in 2018 and controlled by the Rothberg family, and was designed for the funding and development needs of seed stage companies. When Liminal was founded, Legacy Hyperfine was focused on developing its own products. As Liminal was developing its platform for non-invasive monitoring and sensing of key brain health vitals, Legacy Hyperfine was beginning to commercialize the Swoop scanner and expanded its vision to include intervention and sensing to cover the care continuum. We believe that the synergies between Legacy Hyperfine’s MRI platform and Liminal’s brain sensing technology provide Hyperfine with the potential to connect the care continuum from MRI imaging to sensing, and could ultimately provide patients with affordable care and healthcare practitioners with a single source access to brain scanning and monitoring.
 Our Competitive Strengths
 We believe that our competitive strengths include the following:
 •There is a large and growing MRI market and we have the potential to augment conventional MRI capacity and benefit patients around the world. We believe our solution addresses a vast unmet need across the global market by expanding accessibility to MRI and augmenting the existing capacity of conventional high-field MRI systems as imaging rates continue to increase across the population and the need for efficient utilization of MRI scanners increases. Our solution is designed to complement conventional MRI scanners currently used in the market, as it seamlessly integrates into relevant hospital systems. Our system was designed to allow users to upload images directly onto hospital systems, such as the picture archiving and communication system (“PACS”) or directly onto our cloud PACS, which then makes images available for diagnostic purposes.
 We believe the Swoop scanner can expand the existing $15.9 billion global imaging market (expected to grow at a 5.2% CAGR from 2021 to 2028) by making MRI available to a larger set of patients in both developed and emerging markets, as well as increase the utilization of conventional MRIs through decreased wait times and facilitation of patient flow. Our primary focus is to expand the availability of MRI globally and across the care continuum, particularly to patients who are in intensive care units and in the emergency department, where timeliness is critical and an MRI scan can be essential for diagnosis and urgent intervention. The Swoop scanner can be wheeled directly to a patient’s bedside and offers a prompt solution for those patients who require an MRI scan but are too critically ill to be transported for a conventional MRI scan, and who may otherwise be forced to forego a scan or wait until their condition stabilizes.
 We have also initiated a global research program supported by grant funding from the BMGF to assess the clinical feasibility of our Swoop scanner in providing immediate point-of-care brain imaging to infants between the ages of 0-24 months in low-medium income countries. We were awarded a $1.6 million grant from the BMGF for the provision and equipping of 20 sites with our portable point-of-care MRI system to enable the performance of a multi-site study focused on optimizing diagnostic image quality (the “Project”). During the third quarter of 2021, we were awarded an additional $3.3 million grant, of which $2.5 million was received from the BMGF in September 2021,with the remainder expected to be received by April 2022. Both of these grants are designed to support the deployment of a total of 25 Swoop devices and other services to investigators, which commenced in the spring of 2021, and is expected to fund the program for approximately two years. The ongoing investigation is designed to provide data to validate the use of our Swoop system in measuring the impact of maternal anemia, malnutrition, infection and birth related injury.



The Swoop scanner is designed to create value for stakeholders across the care continuum:
 


•Our innovative technology has the potential to markedly improve quality of care for patients worldwide. We believe our smaller, portable, low cost yet effective MRI scanner can broaden access to quality care, leading to improved health outcomes. In many cases, other imaging modalities, such as computerized tomography (“CT”) scanners, are used due to lack of availability of MRI scanners or their lower cost profile, even though CT provides lower soft tissue contrast for evaluating abnormalities in the brain. Our point of care Swoop scanner, however, has a significantly lower price point than both conventional MRI and CT scanners, making the Swoop scanner affordable for hospitals and care centers that are not financially able to acquire a conventional MRI or CT scanner. Compared to CT scans, MRI has a greater range of soft tissue contrast, depicts anatomy in greater detail and is more sensitive and specific for abnormalities within the brain itself. Our Swoop scanner is designed primarily for urgent cases, and it can benefit non-urgent cases as well. Among the neurological conditions for which the Swoop scanner can provide first-line diagnostic capability, we expect the Swoop scanner’s top three clinical use cases will continue to be: point-of-care MRI in acute mental change assessment and follow-up in an ICU setting; stroke workflow; and pediatric and adult point-of-care assessment of hydrocephalus, an abnormal buildup of fluid within the brain.
 Our solution has the potential to improve the diagnosis and lives of the approximately 15 million annual new stroke sufferers worldwide. The Swoop scanner does not emit ionizing radiation and therefore does not have the increased risk of cancer that comes with CT imaging. This is particularly important for conditions that require regular follow-up with multiple scans per year, such as hydrocephalus. In certain circumstances, such as in the management of patients with delirium or altered mental status, familiarity, or keeping the surrounding environment as similar as possible, can be critical, which we believe makes bedside scanners like our Swoop scanner particularly useful since patients do not need to be moved to often distant radiology suites for conventional MRI scans. Studies show that 37% of patients report anxiety-related reactions when moved to an isolated room for imaging. With our system, we can offer a quieter, calmer experience with the option of a family member or other caregiver to be present by the patient’s bedside during the scanning process.
 Our point of care scanner also helps avoid the risk of patient injury during transport through the ability to bring the scanner to the patient. By performing scans for urgent and critically ill patients at the bedside, we can help prevent the adverse incidents that occur to approximately 33% of critically ill patient cases during transport. The Swoop scanner also obviates the labor-intensive and high-risk process of transporting patients on ventilators or who are connected to other life-sustaining devices.
 •Our proprietary, disruptive and revolutionary product is designed with healthcare professionals in mind. We have commercially launched our Swoop scanner, a point of care MRI device capable of producing diagnostic quality images at a lower magnetic field strength than conventional MRI scanners. The use of an ultra-low magnetic field strength provides a significant reduction in safety concerns regarding projectiles and therefore should reduce the length of pre-safety checks typically conducted by healthcare professionals. We designed our product with the physician workflow in mind, reducing the on average 25.8 hour conventional MRI process to a total of 90 minutes of workflow time with our Swoop scanner. With a 94% reduction in total workflow time, physicians can reduce the time to diagnoses for timely treatment, which can result in improved health outcomes for the patient.
 For healthcare professionals who are already facing demanding time constraints, dealing with lengthy and sometimes confusing MRI protocols adds to their time spent on logistics rather than caring for patients. Additionally, conventional MRIs require specially trained technicians who are fully dedicated to operate those systems and increase the time and


cost related to nurses and porters transporting patients to the MRI unit. Our Swoop scanner is designed to simplify the image acquisition process. We have designed our scanner to be user-friendly and require minimal training to be operated. Our platform can be controlled by a tablet, smartphone or any other WiFi capable device. The Swoop scanner’s portability and accessibility at the bedside can further allow more time for healthcare professionals to focus on other important activities related to patient care, diagnosis and treatment.
 •Our state-of-the-art product provides an attractive return on investment for various care settings. We created the Swoop scanner not to replace conventional MRI devices but rather to supplement their existing capacity. By enabling imaging at the bedside, patients can be treated earlier and discharged sooner, potentially leading to increased hospital savings consistent with the growing shift to value-based care. In addition, by conducting more in-patient MRI scans at the bedside, our Swoop scanner can help free up capacity in the MRI suite for additional outpatient procedures, which generate higher revenues for hospitals or other healthcare facilities than in-patient imaging. In studies we have conducted in hospital settings, use of our Swoop scanner has helped to make capacity available that has resulted in 20% increased usage of the existing MRI suite for additional outpatient procedures.
 As healthcare costs continue to rise, we believe our Swoop scanner will allow for significant potential cost reductions that can benefit the entire imaging ecosystem. Our Swoop scanner has dramatically reduced hardware costs through design trade-off and compensation with the use of modern computational power and deep learning advances. The cost benefits of our Swoop scanner are not limited to a customer’s initial purchase of the scanner, as our customers continue to benefit by not having to spend on additional cooling, power and maintenance expenses throughout the lifetime of conventional MRI. Unlike conventional MRI systems, use of the Swoop scanner also does not require a specialized radio frequency (RF) room to safely house the MRI scanner, allowing space to be used for other important patient care activities. The use of the Swoop scanner in the ICU can also increase utilization by allowing critically ill patients to receive immediate access to an MRI instead of increasing congestion in the schedule of the conventional MRI systems due to complications in the patients’ condition and unexpected changes in their condition or treatment.

•Our validated platform and business model allows for potential widespread adoption. Over 41 conference presentations and publications have discussed the clinical benefits for point of care, low-field MRI for patients with stroke, hydrocephalus, hematoma, multiple sclerosis and tumor resection. We generate sales revenue by selling the Swoop scanner with subscription services including cloud based tools, repairs and maintenance, and, if and when available, upgrades. We also offer the opportunity to bundle the system within the subscription fees. We believe this makes a convenient and positive experience for our customers. As more healthcare professionals adopt our technology, we anticipate improvements in gross margin due to the recurring subscription base of the business.
 •We have a strong executive leadership team and experienced financial partner with deep expertise in Healthcare. The Founder of Legacy Hyperfine and Liminal, Dr. Jonathan Rothberg, has dedicated his career to enabling breakthrough technologies to revolutionize healthcare. He has founded more than 10 healthcare and technology companies and has received numerous awards, including the Presidential Medal of Technology & Innovation in 2016. He is supported by a world-class management team, including our executive officers and other senior management, with decades of cumulative experience in healthcare and consumer end-markets. We believe this leadership team positions us well to be a disruptive force in revolutionizing MRI.
 Our Strategies
 Our strategies include the following:
 •Engage the medical imaging market through strategic partnerships for accelerated international expansion. In line with our vision to democratize healthcare imaging by providing affordable and accessible imaging of health conditions around the world, we are building an international sales strategy that includes direct sales to customers and through distribution partners in target regions. Through our multi-factor market analysis of countries and regions, we analyze the market based on available MRIs per population base and plan to deploy a sales and distribution approach designed to maximize our potential for commercial success. In preparation for our commercial launch in a particular country or region, we plan to build out the foundations necessary for business and regulatory functions to support our commercialization strategy.
 In our plans for international commercial expansion, the countries in which we plan initially to commercialize our Swoop scanner include the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and Pakistan. Through grant funding from the BMGF, we are deploying Swoop scanners in these target areas for research and clinical settings. The utilization of our Swoop scanners as part of the programs will allow us to begin building relationship across key stakeholders in these


countries or regions to better understand and meet required regulatory hurdles in anticipation of filing for regulatory authorization and ultimately expand into clinical use with patients. In addition, we are considering commercial expansion into several of the larger European Union ("EU") countries following our initial international commercial expansion. We believe these countries have the market size, regulatory environment, commercial access, and mature healthcare systems necessary, subject to regulatory authorization, for a successful launch of our Swoop scanner.
 Our commitment to the vision of providing affordable and accessible imaging that enables earlier detection and remote management of health conditions around the world is in part made possible by grant funding from the BMGF. Through our engagement with nonprofit organizations, we aim to deploy the Swoop scanner to low-middle resource settings without readily-accessible MRI technology. The grants provided by the BMGF are designed to support the deployment of 25 Swoop scanners to investigators, which commenced in the spring of 2021, and are expected to fund the program for two years. The ongoing investigation is designed to provide data to validate the potential use of our Swoop scanner in measuring the impact of maternal anemia, malnutrition, infection and birth related injury.
 •Expand clinical validation data and publications. There are over 41 conference presentations and publications discussing the clinical benefits of our Swoop scanner. The Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA) published a detailed study conducted at the Yale New Haven Hospital on how the Swoop scanner successfully detected abnormal neuroimaging findings at the bedside of patients in the ICU, demonstrating the capability of low-field, point of care MRI to obtain neuroimaging at the bedside in intensive care settings. We also recently partnered with Penn Medicine in an ongoing study to examine the efficacy of the Swoop scanner in the care of patients with hydrocephalus and whether the Swoop scanner provides for a simple, safe and cost effective way to follow patients through their treatment.
 The Swoop scanner has been used for diagnoses across various neurological pathologies, and we believe that the Swoop scanner could ultimately enable a new paradigm in the standard of care for these diseases that could be lifesaving. We believe early diagnosis of these diseases has cost saving benefits for multiple stakeholders including patients, providers and payors, as it can lead to earlier intervention of treatment and fewer patient visits.
 Examples of use cases for our Swoop scanner include:
 •Acute changes in mental status, which in an ICU setting refers to the sudden onset of a change in cognitive function or level of consciousness. The incidence rate for acute changes in mental status in ICU patients is high, with a substantial portion developing into a coma.
 •Large vessel occlusion (“LVO”) stroke, which includes acute blockages of the intracranial internal carotid artery (“ICA”), proximal posterior, middle, anterior cerebral arteries, intracranial vertebral artery and basilar artery, leading to stroke. LVO stroke is responsible for between 24-46% of acute ischemic strokes (“AIS”) and leads to a 4.5 times increase in the risk of death from a future stroke.
 •Postoperative hematoma, which is the collection of blood due to an injury of one or more blood vessels and is a potentially severe complication of cranial surgery. It has an overall mortality rate of 32% after neurosurgical operation.
 •Hydrocephalus, which is the buildup of cerebrospinal fluid (“CSF”) in cerebral ventricles, which leads to an increase in size and subsequent intracranial pressure. It occurs in two of every 1,000 births in the United States or may develop in adults over time as a result of injury or disease with an incidence rate of 17 per 100,000 adult patients in the United States.
 •Focus on our customers through success programs. Our Swoop scanner is designed to make the customer experience as easy as possible through our integrated, easy-to-use interface that portrays images on a tablet device. In addition to this design, our team is focused on customer success programs to help integrate the Swoop scanner into any hospital or clinic workflow. We believe that the use of our Swoop scanner within hospitals will provide us with opportunities to cross sell our product and services across departments and reduce customer acquisition costs as customers become more accustomed to the use of our Swoop scanner across their facilities and observe the improved health outcomes and reduced costs that the use of our Swoop scanner may provide. We expect our customer success programs also to increase our customer referral rates across the medical imaging market as our product continues to become validated and supported by healthcare professionals in the field.
 Our customer success program is designed to ensure that our customers achieve their desired outcomes while using our Swoop scanner. Our team seeks to foster long-term relationships, highlight key product benefits and manage expectations with our customers. The program is designed to guide customers to achieve maximum utilization of the


product and enhance their experience through ongoing educational tools and opportunities. Our customer success team aims to ensure a smooth path to obtain customer loyalty and continue to grow our install base with subscription renewals, follow-up sales, and new Swoop scanner placements.
 •Demonstrate our commitment to continued technical innovation and leadership across the care continuum. Our advanced technology in imaging is supported by an internal team of scientists and engineers dedicated to continuous innovation. We believe that as the Swoop scanner becomes integrated into ICUs and sites across medical practices, we will gain more insights into our product’s usability and potentially develop automated analysis of images that we believe will lead to further efficiencies in patient diagnosis. We plan to continue developing our technology to expand into new imaging applications to enable us to reach the broader care continuum through diagnosis and treatment. In the future, we plan to introduce a further enhanced MRI system designed to conduct neuroimaging and imaging of other extremities for interventional procedures.
 Brain Sensing Platform
 In addition to our efforts to disrupt the MRI market, we see a significant opportunity to help patients in the neuromonitoring space. Current methods to monitor the brain directly include drilling a hole through the skull to insert sensors. This method introduces risk to the patient and is highly impractical outside of specialized hospitals, which severely limits access to critical information about a patient’s neurological health. We intend to develop non-invasive brain sensing technology that is more affordable, accessible, and safer, to enable healthcare professionals to more easily monitor key brain vital signs such as cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure throughout patient care. We expect this new form of neural monitoring will provide clinicians with valuable feedback and insight into various neurologic conditions such as altered mental status, stroke and traumatic brain injury. We expect this technology will be synergistic with our MRI platform as we connect the care continuum from MRI imaging to sensing.
Industry and Market
 MRI is a non-ionizing radiation risk imaging modality widely used by healthcare professionals across various clinical settings for medical diagnosis of a patient, staging of disease and continued assessment following treatment. MRI is noninvasive, and in some cases, eliminates the need for surgical intervention or invasive procedures when used correctly, and offers superior soft tissue contrast resolution compared to other imaging modalities like CT. It is a more sensitive and potentially objective measure of brain tissue and injury. MRI is used to examine central nervous system (“CNS”), musculoskeletal, and other diseases. The prevalence and incidence rates of these diseases has increased across the globe. According to a United Nations report, up to one billion people, nearly one in six of the world’s population, suffer from neurological disorders, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, migraine, brain injuries and neuroinfections, with some 6.8 million dying of these disorders each year.
 The demand for MRI has been augmented by the aging population and rising prevalence of cancer, cardiovascular, neurological and orthopedic conditions. Healthcare professionals and insurers are recognizing imaging as a cost-effective and non-invasive diagnostic for prevention and ongoing monitoring. Swoop is the next generation of these devices that we believe will drive costs down and expand the current $15.9 billion imaging market. Given the significant patient populations in need of diagnostic imaging, we have positioned ourselves in an underpenetrated market with substantial room for growth. In total, we estimate that the global imaging market will increase to a more than $20 billion opportunity across all of our potential use cases. This estimate includes over 100,000 hospitals and outpatient locations that we believe could serve as installation sites for our system. While the current imaging market is mainly limited to high-resource countries, we believe our scanner can help make MRI technology more accessible globally, leading to an increase in both MRI penetration rates and the size of the overall market opportunity.
 Market needs
 Despite MRI’s advantages to diagnose and monitor patients through treatment, access to MRI scanners can be problematic. Numerous challenges are associated with the use of conventional MRI devices:
 •High cost: The average cost of conventional MRI scanners is $1.2 million, and conventional MRIs can cost more than $3 million, significantly more than our Swoop scanner. In addition, conventional MRIs typically are not offered with our lower cost of entry subscription-based pricing model.
 •Complex site requirements and upgrades: Due to the use of strong (1.5−3.0 T) magnetic fields in conventional MRIs, there are various requirements and restrictions on radiation therapy ("RT") facilities size, location, and ongoing maintenance, including the need to build a specialized radio frequency room to safely house the MRI scanner.



•Scheduling delays: A high level of coordination is required between the MRI facility and the ICU to have patients scheduled for a conventional MRI scan. This is further complicated with patients who are unstable in the ICU and require multiple medical procedures in a timely manner.
 •Consumption of valuable personnel resources: Several personnel between departments within an institution are required to transport a patient across departments and additional personnel are required for transport a patient across facilities, including doctors, technicians, nurses, and emergency medical technicians.
 •Risk of adverse events during transportation: Adverse incidents occur to approximately 33% of critically ill patient cases during transport.
 •Maintaining connection to life support equipment: Patients in the ICU are often connected to life-sustaining devices that complicate the conventional MRI procedure and transportation to and from the conventional MRI scanner.
 Due to these challenges, adoption of conventional MRIs has been limited across medical settings in the United States and globally, especially in rural locations where many individuals only have access to small clinics. MRI systems also include additional charges of establishing an MRI suite, patient support areas, machine installation and servicing, software upgrading, and maintenance that burden hospitals and clinics with limited ongoing funding.
 There are significant benefits of diagnosing a disease in its early stages, which can reduce time to treatment and improve the quality of life for those patients. We have taken advantage of technological advances in electronics and computing to develop an MRI device that is not only portable, but also uses a very low magnetic field strength, 64 mT (0.064T), which is much lower than the 1.5T or higher field strength of conventional MRI scanners. Our advanced technology provides the ability for healthcare professionals to conduct an MRI scan at the patient’s bedside in the hospital or any clinical setting to begin early diagnosis, intervention and ongoing treatment. Many small- and medium-sized hospitals also consider leasing advanced MRI systems to provide MRI imaging services without undertaking the potentially more costly long-term commitment of purchasing an MRI system. Our Swoop scanner is available for purchase or subscription bundle by medical facilities in the United States with flexible payment options.
 According to a 2008 report from the World Health Organization, 90% of the world does not have access to MRI at all largely due to socio-economic factors. Many low-resource countries recognize the benefit of investing in their healthcare infrastructure and it is expected to cause a spur in growth for the global MRI market. For example, China is one of the fastest growing markets that is building their healthcare infrastructure in rural areas. The ability for these countries to build the facilities needed to house these large systems and train highly specialized personnel to operate conventional MRI systems presents a challenge.
 Potential market expansion
 Brain Sensing Platform
 One area for potential market expansion is non-invasive neural monitoring or sensing to assess critical brain health metrics such as cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure in any clinical, outpatient or home setting. Understanding the vital signs of the brain is paramount in the diagnosis and management of brain disorders yet current care has limited access to important measurements of brain health. Post-operative and general neurological conditions such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, hydrocephalus, removal of brain and spinal tumors, neural tube defects, seizures, CNS vascular anomalies and CNS infections, require extensive monitoring in the ICU and longer-term care to ensure the patient does not experience infection or worsening of their condition. Our technology currently in development has the potential to provide hospitals with real-time monitoring and continuous trend analysis to provide data-backed treatment. To accomplish this, we are building a flexible and extendable noninvasive brain-monitoring platform, creating access to critical brain vital signs throughout the patient care from diagnosis to full recovery. Our approach is to create the neurological equivalent of the stick-on electrocardiogram heart monitor that is a staple in virtually every medical environment. There is a large unmet need in the market for continuous monitoring of chronic neurological conditions. According to market research, the market for global non-invasive brain trauma monitoring devices is expected to grow from approximately $10.1 billion in 2019 to $18.3 billion by 2027, at a CAGR of 7.7%. In addition, we have the potential to ultimately expand our capability to diagnose and manage chronic conditions beyond acute neurological conditions. Our next generation device is expected to contain electroencephalography alongside hemodynamic assessment capabilities to improve quality of care for chronic conditions such as epilepsy, which affects around 50 million people of all ages worldwide. We are currently in product development of our brain sensing technology and hardware platform. We are working toward a clinical proof of concept to demonstrate the technological performance and have begun the process of engaging with the FDA to clarify the regulatory pathway.
Products and Services
 Our Swoop Portable MR Imaging System
 Our Swoop Portable MR Imaging System is designed to address an unmet need in point-of-care medical imaging through a unique combination of hardware and software services. Our hardware is powered by the use of modern computational power and deep learning advances. Our software addresses the traditional ease-of-use and integration challenges often presented by specialized medical technologies. Our system operates from a tablet, smartphone or other WiFi capable device and integrates with picture archiving and communication system (“PACS”) to enable fast and confident clinical decision-making.
Features
 Point-of-care neuroimaging - FDA cleared for MRI of the brain and head in patients of all ages
 Neuroimaging at the point of care has only been possible using CT, which delivers a significant amount of ionizing radiation. Exposing patients to radiation increases the risk of developing cancer, which limits CT’s use to critically ill patients and makes it particularly hazardous for pediatric patients. CT can visualize bones or blood vessels well when the patient is injected with a contrast agent but is not as sensitive as MRI at imaging the anatomy of the brain.
 The gold standard for neuroimaging is MRI, which can provide excellent high-resolution images of the soft tissues on the brain without being obscured by the skull. MRI can provide critical insight into trauma and disease in the brain but historically has simply not been available at the point of care. Because of their size, weight and safety issues, conventional MRI systems were only available in hospitals and major medical centers and outpatient imaging providers, and so patients typically must be transported to the MRI.
 We have developed a new category of medical imaging - point of care MRI - that is smaller, lighter weight, and lower cost than conventional MRI, yet maintains the soft tissue visualization capabilities that is critical for neuroimaging. Advanced neuroimaging is now available for patients of all ages at the point of care since we launched our FDA-cleared portable Swoop MRI system in 2020.
 


Low field system



To engineer this new category of point of care MRI, we made several significant design changes with respect to conventional MRI, particularly the magnetic field strength. Over the past 40 years, the goal for improving conventional MRI systems has been to attain higher magnetic field strength. In 2017, the FDA cleared the first 7T MRI, after 20 years of development to establish clinical relevance. It was noted that the added field strength allows for better visualization of smaller structures and subtle pathologies that may improve disease diagnosis. We have taken a different approach by developing our Swoop scanner to have a very low field magnet of 0.064T, which enables MRI to become portable because, unlike conventional MRIs, the field strength of the magnet in our system does not require a specialized radio frequency room to safely house the MRI scanner. This field strength comes from a unique optimization of the magnet size, weight, field uniformity and patented design of the permanent magnet structure that provides sufficient image clarity for diagnostic purposes.
 There are additional benefits of operating an MRI system with low field magnet, as it reduces the risk of iron-containing objects becoming projectile and injuring patients or operators, which is a typical concern of conventional MRI systems. Furthermore, the radiofrequency pulses used in conventional MRI are responsible for 55% of the FDA-reported adverse events from MRI, causing skin and internal burns in some patients. Operating at 0.064T means using lower energy radiofrequency pulses and significantly reduced associated safety risks.
 Motion correction
 Conventional MRI scans regularly suffer from quality problems due to patient motion, with approximately 30% of all scans from inpatient or emergency department exams having moderate or severe image quality issues. Portable MRI at the point of care can provide MRI insights to more critically ill patients than previously possible. We have developed a motion compensation technology to improve image quality in the most challenging and often most in need patients that we recently received FDA clearance for clinical use. We believe that with continued development, our technology can produce diagnostic scans without requiring the operator to make expert adjustments to the scanning procedure due to typical patient movements.
 Noise-cancellation technology
 Designing a low-field magnet is not sufficient to enable portable MRI. Portable MRI must also address the electromagnetic interference that surrounds us and makes effective conventional MRI outside of a shielded room impossible. Conventional MRI systems are permanently installed in a special room where the walls, floor and ceiling are encased in copper or aluminum to provide a special environment for conventional MRI machines to operate, in which all of the man-made and natural electromagnetic interference is prevented from entering. Installation of these shielded rooms typically costs more than $100,000.
 We have developed proprietary and patented noise cancellation technology to enable portable MRI. Our technology works by measuring the external electromagnetic interference and subtracting that from the interference that swamps the MRI signals. The image below shows one slice of an MRI image acquired a) outside a shielded room without noise cancellation, b) outside a shielded room with noise cancellation and c) inside a shielded room without noise cancellation.
 


Delivery of multiple sequences with tissue contrasts
 MRI has the unique capability of providing images with different soft tissue contrasts through a variety of different sequences that can highlight a range of pathologies clearly. Our Swoop portable MRI system generates images with contrast weightings with which physicians are most familiar and which are most clinically useful for the target use cases: T1-weighted, T2-weighted, Fluid-attenuated T2-weighted (T2-FLAIR), and diffusion-weighted (“DWI”) with apparent diffusion coefficient (“ADC”) map images. These contrasts are standard in conventional MRI and allow for differentiation of various tissue types aiding in establishing the diagnosis.
 Image quality



We deliver diagnostic quality images to healthcare professionals. The images from our Swoop portable MRI system are higher in contrast resolution than other portable medical neuroimaging systems, such as portable CT scanners. Our portable MRI system also delivers comparable image resolution at 1.5 mm x 1.5 mm x 5 mm relative to the typical image resolution of a conventional MRI at 1.0 mm x 1.0 mm x 5 mm. Our MRI signal is produced at 0.064-Tesla (“T”) compared to 1.5T or higher produced by conventional, fixed MRI scanners. We believe that Swoop provides the potential to improve the quality of care for patients who have limited to no accessibility to conventional MRI, which includes 90% of the world’s population.
 Controlled by an easy-to-use wireless tablet
 We believe it is important to consider usability when significantly changing the way in which a medical device is used, specifically in MRI where conventionally the operator is required to have several years of training. As we seek to reach new markets and new users with our Swoop scanner, we have sought to make the operation of the device as simple and easy to use as possible. We believe this is particularly important when used in emergency situations such as stroke, where time can be critical.
 The interfaces to the device are simple intuitive buttons, joystick controls to drive the scanner, and a familiar tablet controller for image acquisition and viewing. The user interface provided on the touch-screen display provides a playlist of protocols based on the use case that can be started, stopped and rearranged, as needed. In addition to being easy-to-use and the consequential acceleration of hospital workflows that can result, our system provides for standardized images across all placement sites due to our uniform manufacturing specifications and a consistent set of sequences that are not customized by individual operators. Conventional MRIs are sequenced by highly-trained technologists and can have variations in image resolution and contrast weighting across sites due to institutional policies and radiologist preferences. We believe the standardization of images across scanners and sites will greatly benefit the ability of radiologists and other healthcare professionals to efficiently read our images and to ultimately build a repository of homogenized image data from which to extract value using data mining and deep learning.
 Integration with picture archiving and communication system (PACS) and secure image upload to the Cloud
 Similar to many hospital medical devices, our product is designed to seamlessly integrate with the hospital informational technology (“IT”) infrastructure, such that scans can be ordered easily and sent to PACS to be read by a radiologist. For applications where access to such infrastructure is not available, we also offer our own secure cloud based PACS where healthcare professionals including teleradiology service providers can view images from anywhere in the world. We believe that the combination of portable MRI, where scans can be obtained outside the conventional MRI suite, and teleradiology can significantly improve patient care and increase access.
 Fully Automated MRI Post-Processing Software
 We received FDA clearance for BrainInsight, our first AI applications in January 2021. These applications for automatic labelling, spatial measurements, and volumetric quantification operate on images from our Swoop portable MRI system, automatically add additional insights and associate those insights to the images in the PACS. Using this approach, we intend to grow our portfolio of applications with internal and external development and leveraging the uniquely standardized (and fully anonymized) record of image data we plan to create with our portable MRI system. We believe that bringing the power of AI to MRI has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency of medical imaging in a wide array of use cases, which can benefit the patient by potentially helping to improve outcomes and result in shorter hospital stays.
 Design
 Location flexibility
 Despite the weight of our Swoop scanner being 1,400 lbs., its powered drive system means that it can be transported around the hospital with minimal effort. The Swoop scanner can be moved from bed-to-bed and easily positioned in tight spaces because it can be turned on the spot with a zero turn radius.
 Open layout designed to reduce patient anxiety
 For an MRI scan in a traditional setting, a patient arrives at the radiology department of a hospital and typically enters through a door covered with radiation warning and other hazard symbols. The patient then proceeds through to a waiting room where they undergo a lengthy safety questionnaire and are asked to remove all clothes and jewelry down to their underwear and put on a hospital gown. Wait times vary from a half hour to several hours before the patient enters the console room and then is led through a large metal door into the RF screen room by themselves. Typical conventional MRI systems


are long tubes where the patient is positioned on a motorized bed and RF coils are attached around the patient who has been instructed to lay still. The MRI technician uses the motorized bed to push the patient into the long tube of the large superconducting magnet, leaves the room, closes the metal door to the scan room and tells the patient over an intercom that the scan is about to start. The patient hears the steady mechanical thumping of the cryocooler in the magnet room until the scanning starts, which is then accompanied by often extremely loud acoustic noises. The conventional MRI procedure is often a daunting experience for the patient that can cause significant anxiety, especially for pediatric patients who are separated from their family during this time.
 Unlike conventional MRI, our Swoop portable MRI is entirely contained in a system that is just 55 inches tall and 34 inches wide and is designed to scan patients in their own beds. Parents, family, or caregivers can be close by the patient as they are scanned with just their head in the transparent head RF coil. The system is quiet enough to allow constant verbal contact with the patient, and which overall can create a considerably less distressing experience for the patient than conventional MRI.
 Powered by a standard wall outlet
 To be operable throughout any hospital environment, our Swoop scanner plugs into a standard wall outlet (100-230 VAC, 50/60 Hz, 15A) and uses less than 900W of electricity. This is achieved with low-power electronics, including efficient power supplies and power amplifiers, coupled with a zero-power consumption permanent magnet. Our Swoop scanner does not require many of the components of conventional MRI, including the liquid helium used in conventional MRI superconducting magnets or the associated safety and supporting infrastructure, the chilled water-cooling systems for the power electronics and gradient coils and the room air conditioning needed to extract the heat generated in the separate electronics machine room, or the special 480 V, 3-phase, 200A power supply.
 Services
 Unlimited training / support resources
 Through our subscription model, we offer a number of services to complement the advanced features of our product. As part of our subscription, we offer unlimited user training during the subscription period to make it as easy as possible for healthcare professionals to operate our system. We offer this support primarily as reassurance to our customers although we are confident our customers will be able to operate our user-friendly device with ease and efficiency; in our experience so far, the user training on the system is generally simple and only requires a few hours. Our subscription also provides for unlimited service and maintenance support during the subscription period to offer peace of mind for our customers. In addition to these support services, our subscription includes our Cloud PACS, an unlimited Cloud archive that users can use to upload images for storage purposes, and grants access to our future software upgrades. Recent upgrades include our FDA cleared motion correction technology that improves the quality of images in the presence of motion, as well as other potential future upgrades designed to improve the patient workflow and diagnosis.
Liminal Platform
 Liminal’s noninvasive platform is being developed, subject to regulatory authorization, to aid in the diagnosis and management of brain disorders. We believe that understanding the vital signs of the brain for diagnosis and treatment is essential, but the current standard of care is invasive, which limits access. Although there are some non-invasive techniques for measuring the brain such as transcranial doppler (TCD), which has been available since the 1980s, they require specialized technicians to obtain measurements, making them expensive and only available in specialized centers. We are in the early phases of creating our first AEGTM device through the development of novel acoustic sensing techniques and innovative algorithms for measuring key metrics of brain health. We are working to develop a way to monitor the brain and enable access to key brain vital signs, such as cerebral blood flow and intercranial pressure, more easily than currently available technologies. The device is designed to gather continuous data, and is intended to be easy to use and be applied without specialized training. This technology is designed to provide the clinician with valuable feedback and insight into many brain conditions. Its features are designed to increase the accessibility of key brain vitals which could allow clinicians to diagnose earlier, monitor more effectively and intervene.
 Similar to Legacy Hyperfine’s Swoop scanner, we expect the use of the AEGTM device will not require any specialized training and will expand access to real-time brain monitoring in patients across the care continuum. We are designing the AEGTM device to enable first responders in the field to use the sensors with ease and to enable healthcare practitioners to monitor the brain during triage, operations, treatment and recovery.
 




Our goal is to create an easy to use but powerful brain monitoring platform that can be used anytime, anywhere. We believe this technology will be synergistic with Legacy Hyperfine’s MRI platform in developing products for patients across the care continuum in sensing, imaging and intervention, in addition to further expanding the growth potential for both businesses in imaging and sensing. We are currently in product development of our brain sensing technology and hardware platform. We are working toward a clinical proof of concept to demonstrate the technological performance and have begun the process of engaging with the FDA to clarify the regulatory pathway. Liminal has not commercialized or obtained regulatory authorization for any of its products and its operations to date have been limited to developing its technology and products.

 Environmental, Social and Governance Practices
 As we work toward our mission, we are increasingly focused on providing transparency around our environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) practices and identifying risks related thereto. We are committed to human capital management, patient advocacy and community outreach efforts, corporate governance, and implementing environmental sustainability initiatives.
 Environmental Stewardship: We recognize the importance of taking measures to reduce our environmental footprint. As we grow our business, we have initiated certain projects to begin tracking our environmental impact, and where feasible, have taken measures to increase our sustainability efforts. Some of our efforts include our commitment to reduce, reuse or recycle where possible or appropriate and energy efficient projects to lower energy use within our office areas and laboratories.
 Human Capital Management: We believe that our people are the reason for our success and we have organized ourselves to maximize productivity and performance. We maintain a high bar for talent and actively work to build diversity within our workforce. Critical to achieving our strategic goals is our ability to build and retain an exceptional team in which each member plays a unique and important role. Employees of Legacy Hyperfine and Liminal continue as employees following the Business Combination.
 We recognize that maintaining an engaged and top-notch workforce and a connection with the communities we serve is critical to our success. Comradery and cohesion are at the core of who we are as a company and are integral facets of our human capital management strategy. We are inspired by each other and the possibilities of what we can achieve together. We understand that in order to drive innovation, we must continuously improve our human capital management strategies and find ways to foster engagement and growth within our organization. To this end, below are some of our initiatives:



Professional Development Programs and Opportunities: Our greatest asset is our employees and we aspire to provide them with opportunities so they can continue to grow and excel in their functions and our company. Professional growth of our employees leads to engagement, development and allows us to leverage opportunities so we can hire and promote key talent from within. Through development planning, we strive for employees at all levels to focus on strengthening the skills required in their current role and potentially their next role. We are focused on building a culture of continuous coaching, feedback and open communication between managers and their direct reports throughout the entire year. We provide managers and employees with training on how to conduct effective forward-looking performance conversations and to set effective goals that are realistic, measurable, attainable, relevant and timebound.
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion: Our commitment to maintaining a top-performing company means investing in and creating ongoing opportunities for employee development in a diverse and inclusive workplace. We believe that a diverse workforce not only positively impacts our performance, fosters innovation, inspires us to achieve greater results, increases our collective capabilities and strengthens our culture, but it also cultivates an essential pipeline of experienced leaders for management. Hiring for diversity of thought, background and experience, and diversity of personal characteristics such as gender, race and ethnicity is intentional and continues to be an area of focus as we build and grow our workforce.
 Compensation, Equity and Benefits: We have designed a broad-based compensation program that is designed to attract, retain and motivate our employees to deliver sustainable long-term value. We seek to deliver performance-driven, market competitive reward opportunities commensurate with company and individual performance. Many of our employees receive equity grants and cash bonuses in addition to base salaries and our benefits package. We believe that providing employees with an ownership interest in our company further strengthens the level of employee engagement. Furthermore, equity awards help align the interests of our employees with the long-term interests of our stockholders. We also offer employees a health insurance package.
 Governance, Ethics, and Compliance: Our board of directors is committed to robust corporate governance practices, risk oversight, stockholder rights, diversity, equity and inclusion, corporate sustainability, ethics and compliance in order to protect the long-term interests of our company, stockholders and the patients we serve. Our board of directors adopted corporate governance principles applicable to us, including responsible oversight and management of the Company, effective controls and processes, compliance with SEC and Nasdaq Stock Market rules and regulations, maintaining an engaged board of directors and a board structure that recognizes the importance of diversity, appropriate compensation practices, and succession planning, among other matters.
 We will continue to evolve and strengthen our human capital management strategies, increase our environmental efforts, maintain and continue to improve our corporate governance practices, and anticipate reporting on other corporate sustainability measures over time.
 Sales, Pricing and Marketing
 Marketing
 Our marketing efforts are focused on accelerating awareness of our products and capabilities in order to create a strong reputation with clinicians and healthcare administrators. Our go-to-market approach features a targeted sales organization complemented by an array of promotional activities including media coverage, tradeshow exhibition, advertising, and live product demonstration. We principally target acute care hospitals and health systems. In the future, we plan to leverage this approach for both our Swoop Scanner and our future products that have similar end markets.
 We recognize the role of education in accelerating clinical adoption of our products across the patient care pathway, including healthcare professionals who currently may not themselves be primary users of MRI technology. To support adoption of our product and in addition to our simplified product interface, we have developed training curriculum and tutorials and built a team of clinically trained customer success managers to guide and coach clinicians on the unique features of our device and on the specific clinical application of our technologies.
 Sales and Pricing
 The Swoop scanner is commercially available in the United States, and we are seeking necessary regulatory authorizations in other major markets, including the United Kingdom, Australia and other countries. We recently received regulatory authorization in New Zealand and Pakistan. We are building our direct commercial infrastructure in the United States and also have plans to sell our products in other countries either through direct sales or through distributors.


We are commercializing our device through two business models: (i) the subscription bundle model, and (ii) the subscription plus ownership model. For both models, we offer subscriptions with software upgrades for 36 or 60 months and an annual pre-payment discount. We have specifically selected these business models to create convenience and widespread adoption.
 Subscription bundle model: This model includes a 36-month subscription or a 60-month subscription. The subscription bundle model includes the use of a Swoop scanner and an off-the-shelf tablet for use with the scanner, plus the same subscription benefits provided in the subscription plus ownership model. The subscription fee is based on the term of the subscription, whether prepayment is made, and whether the Swoop scanner will be for commercial or research use.
 Subscription plus ownership model: This model provides for the sale of the Swoop scanner, along with an off-the-shelf tablet for use with the scanner, to the customer for an initial payment, which is substantially less expensive than the average cost of $1.2 million for conventional MRI scanners. In addition to purchasing ownership of the system, the customer purchases a 36-month subscription or a 60-month subscription. The subscription fee is based on the term of the subscription, whether prepayment is made, and whether the Swoop scanner will be for commercial or research use.
 We believe our subscription-based model has the potential to generate a more predictable recurring revenue stream while helping to foster an ongoing relationship with our customers. To help ensure our customers receive the highest level of customer service, we plan to continue to sell directly to customers and providing ongoing customer support. However, as we expand internationally subject to regulatory authorization in those countries, we may leverage distributors to sell our product depending on the commercial strategy for each country assessed on a country-by-country basis. Through our subscription-based model, we aim to provide MRI systems that are much less expensive than conventional MRI systems and achieve our vision of increasing accessibility to MRI worldwide.
 Suppliers and Manufacturing
 Our Swoop scanner is built using both custom-made and off-the-shelf components supplied by outside manufacturers and vendors located in the United States, Europe and Asia. One key custom-made component in our Swoop scanner is the magnet, which is manufactured by a single source supplier in Europe. The majority of the other components for the Swoop scanner are off-the-shelf or made using standard processes.
 We purchase some of our components and materials used in manufacturing, including magnets, field programmable gate arrays (“FPGAs”), central processing units (“CPUs”) and molded plastics, from single sources. Although we believe that alternative sources of these components and materials would be available, it would take time to identify and validate replacement components, which could negatively affect our ability to supply the Swoop scanner on a timely basis. We cannot give assurances that any alternative supplier would be able to recreate the manufacturing processes currently in use. To mitigate this risk, we typically carry a significant inventory of critical components. We also plan to work with our Swoop scanner device manufacturer, Benchmark Electronics, Inc. ("Benchmark"), to add an additional magnet supplier to the manufacturing process to mitigate the risk to supply of our magnets by the current use of a single supplier.
 All of our Swoop scanner devices are manufactured, tested, shipped and supported by Benchmark from its facilities in Nashua, NH. We believe that this manufacturing strategy is efficient and conserves capital. However, in the event it becomes necessary to utilize a different contract manufacturer for our Swoop products, we would experience additional costs, delays and difficulties in doing so, and our business could be harmed.
 Key Agreements
 Manufacture and Supply Agreement with Benchmark Electronics, Inc.
 In October 2018, Legacy Hyperfine entered into a Manufacture and Supply Agreement with Benchmark (the “MSA”). Under the MSA, Benchmark agreed to manufacture our products pursuant to binding purchase orders. Each month, we have agreed to provide Benchmark with a binding purchase order for a period specified by the MSA, as well as a non-binding forecast for each month within such period. If we do not provide the monthly purchase order and forecast update, then the first forecast month of the then-current forecast becomes binding so that a rolling binding commitment to purchase product for the specified period is maintained. The parties have agreed to meet periodically regarding any minimum order quantities of components under the MSA. We also have certain inventory related obligations, including the obligation to purchase excess and obsolete components from Benchmark. Excess components are determined based upon the amount of component inventory that exceeds the build plan for the specified period discussed above. We would be required to purchase such excess inventory and be credited back against future purchases of finished products as the inventory of components is reduced to the amount needed to meet the rolling build plan. Obsolete materials are immediately invoiced once identified. As of February 15, 2022, we have paid approximately $2.2 million for excess components.



Under the terms of the MSA, we granted Benchmark a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable, fully-paid, royalty-free license, without the right to sublicense, to use our technology solely to manufacture our products. The MSA provides that we will own any right, title and interest in any improvements or modifications to our technology made in the course of performance of Benchmark’s obligations under the MSA. We and Benchmark also agreed to indemnify each other against certain third-party claims.
 The MSA has an initial three-year term and will renew automatically for additional two-year terms unless either party gives 180 days’ prior written notice before the end of the then-current term to the other party electing not to renew the agreement. The MSA or any purchase order under the MSA may be terminated by either party for convenience upon 90 days’ prior written notice to the other party. The MSA may also be terminated by either party by written notice upon the occurrence of (i) a breach by the other party under the agreement which is not cured within 30 days after written notice by the terminating party, (ii) the other party becomes insolvent, dissolves, liquidates or ceases to conduct business or (iii) the occurrence of payment-related breaches. Benchmark may also terminate the agreement upon the filing of any petition against us under bankruptcy or similar laws, where such petition is not vacated within 10 days via court order.
 Competition
 Several large companies, such as General Electric, Siemens, Philips, Hologic, Varian, Fuji, Toshiba, Canon and Hitachi currently dominate the medical imaging market. High regulatory, distribution, manufacturing and service-related long-term contractual costs represent significant barriers to entry for any new player. We expect that the existing market participants will remain key players in the future.
 As a general matter, we view competition on two levels:
 •Conventional MRI systems with which the general public is familiar; and
 •The development of other portable MRI systems with the same or better attributes.
 The primary competition comes from established market participants offering conventional MRI systems. While in developing countries we are experiencing keen interest, the United States and other Western regions already have major market participants that are well entrenched in the market with strong political influence and the ability to delay deployment of our systems.
 We are not aware of any competing company that has achieved a portable MRI system. To our knowledge, there are several companies currently in the process of developing this technology, including Promaxo, Neuro42 and Huami.
Intellectual Property
 Protection of our intellectual property is a strategic priority for our business. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights protections and contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technologies.
 The patents owned and in-licensed by us are generally directed to the architecture of Legacy Hyperfine’s MRI systems and related technology, and Liminal’s non-invasive brain sensing and treatment devices and related technology. We have developed a portfolio of issued patents and pending patent applications directed to commercial products and technologies for potential development. We believe that our intellectual property is a core strength of our business, and our strategy includes the continued development of our patent portfolio.

In addition to patents, we also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how, and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property by generally


requiring our employees, consultants, contractors, suppliers, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors to execute non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements on commencement of their employment or engagement. Agreements with our employees also forbid them from using or incorporating the proprietary rights of third parties during their engagement with us. We also generally require confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials.
 License Agreements
 We have entered into licenses in the ordinary course of business relating to our technologies or other intellectual property rights or assets.
 Exclusive License Agreements with The General Hospital Corporation (d/b/a Massachusetts General Hospital)
 Legacy Hyperfine entered into an exclusive license agreement with The General Hospital Corporation (d/b/a Massachusetts General Hospital) (“MGH”) effective in May 2014 (the “May Agreement”) and an exclusive license agreement with MGH effective in June 2014 (the “June Agreement”), respectively, under each of which Legacy Hyperfine acquired an exclusive and worldwide license to specified patent rights owned by MGH relating to MRI technology. The licenses granted to us are subject to the right of MGH and not-for-profit academic, government and other not-for-profit institutions to make and to use the subject matter described or claimed in the rights granted under the licensed patents for research and educational purposes and, for any licensed patents that are supported by federal funding, the licenses granted to us are subject to certain rights, conditions and limitations imposed by U.S. law, including a royalty-free, non-exclusive license granted to the U.S. government and a requirement that any products used or sold in the United States must be manufactured substantially in the United States.
 Under the terms of each of the license agreements, we have agreed to pay MGH an annual maintenance fee and agreed to reimburse MGH for certain patent related fees and costs incurred by MGH, including past patent fees and costs. If we enter into a sublicense under either license agreement, we will be obligated to pay MGH a percentage in the mid-teens of certain consideration paid to us by the sublicensee. As of February 15, 2022, the aggregate amounts paid under the May Agreement and June Agreement were $25,522 and $19,762, respectively.
 We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products and licensed processes under each of the license agreements. In particular, we were required to achieve a specified development and commercialization milestone by a specified date.
 Under the terms of each of the license agreements, MGH has retained the right to practice the licensed patent rights within the licensed fields for research and educational purposes only.
 Each of the license agreements expires upon the expiration of the last to expire licensed patent, which is set to expire in 2035. We have the right to terminate either agreement for any reason by giving advance written notice to MGH. MGH has the right to terminate either agreement if we fail, subject to a specified cure period, to pay any amounts due and payable under either agreement to MGH, we otherwise materially breach either agreement and fail to cure such breach within a specified cure period, we fail to maintain insurance coverage as required under either agreement, we become insolvent, or make an assignment for the benefit of our creditors, or have a petition in bankruptcy filed for or against us, or we or a sublicensee challenges the licensed patent rights in a legal or administrative proceeding. Either agreement otherwise terminates upon the expiration or abandonment of all licensed patents and patent applications.
 Government Regulation
 Diagnostic and therapeutic medical devices like those we developed and distributed are subject to regulation by numerous regulatory bodies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and comparable international regulatory agencies. These agencies require developers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, marketing and distribution of medical devices. Devices are generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control, the most comprehensive of which requires that a clinical evaluation program be conducted before a device can be approved for marketing and commercial distribution. In addition, healthcare regulatory bodies in the United States and around the world impose a range of requirements related to paying for medical devices and the procedures in which they are used, including laws intended to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse of healthcare dollars.



U.S. Laws and Regulations
 In the United States, medical devices are subject to extensive regulation at the federal level by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and its implementing regulations. The laws and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, nonclinical and clinical testing, pre-market clearance, authorization or approval, establishment registration and product listing, product manufacturing, product packaging and labeling, product storage, advertising and promotion, product distribution, recalls and field actions, servicing and post-market clinical surveillance. A number of U.S. states also impose licensing and compliance regimes on companies that manufacture or distribute prescription devices into or within the state.
 Some of our products are also subject to the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act, administered by the FDA, which imposes performance standards and record keeping, reporting, product testing and product labeling requirements for electronic products that emit radiation, such as magnetic resonance imaging systems.
 In addition, the commercialization and use of our devices in the United States is subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and state agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of payment for healthcare items and services. Federal laws and regulations apply primarily in connection with government payer programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, but state laws apply more broadly, encompassing healthcare items and services covered by private payers. At the state and federal level, the government’s interest is in regulating the quality and cost of healthcare and protecting the independent clinical judgment of licensed healthcare providers.
 The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) also oversees the advertising and promotion of our products pursuant to broad authority to police deceptive advertising for goods or services within the United States. Under the Federal Trade Commission Act, the FTC is empowered, among other things, to (a) prevent unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce; (b) seek monetary redress and other relief for conduct injurious to consumers; and (c) gather and compile information and conduct investigations relating to the organization, business, practices, and management of entities engaged in commerce. In the context of performance claims for products such as our goods and services, compliance with the FTC Act includes ensuring that there is scientific data to substantiate the claims being made, that the advertising is neither false nor misleading, and that any user testimonials or endorsements we or our agents disseminate related to the goods or services comply with disclosure and other regulatory requirements. In addition, with respect to our commercial products and any future products that are marketed as clinical products, FDA’s regulations applicable to medical device products prohibit them from being promoted for uses not within the scope of a given product’s intended use(s), among other promotional and labeling rules applicable to products subject to the FDCA.
 Further, medical device systems that include wireless radio frequency transmitters and/or receivers are subject to equipment authorization requirements in the United States. The Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) requires advance clearance of all radio frequency devices before they can be sold or marketed in the United States. These clearances ensure that the proposed products comply with FCC radio frequency emission and power level standards and will not cause interference.
 When Liminal’s products are marketed for clinical monitoring or therapeutic uses, they will be regulated by the FDA as medical devices. It is presently unclear what level of risk the agency will assign to such products, what special controls may be imposed on such products (if any), and what regulatory requirements would be applicable to such products.



FDA Regulation of Medical Devices
 Medical devices must undergo pre-market review by and receive clearance, authorization, or approval from the FDA prior to commercialization, unless the device is of a type exempted from such review by statute, regulation, or an FDA exercise of enforcement discretion. The FDA classifies medical devices into three classes based on risk. Regulatory control increases from Class I (lowest risk) to Class III (highest risk). The FDA generally must clear or approve the commercial sale of most new medical devices that fall within product categories designated as Class II and III. Commercial sales of most Class II and III medical devices within the United States must be preceded either by pre-market notification and FDA clearance pursuant to Section 510(k) of the FDCA (Class II) or by the granting of a pre-market approval (“PMA”) (Class III), after a pre-market application is submitted. Both 510(k) notifications and PMA applications must be submitted to FDA with significant user fees (over $12,000 for a 510(k) and $374,000 for a PMA in FY 2022), although reduced fees for small businesses are available. Class I devices are generally exempt from pre-market review and notification, as are some moderate-risk Class II devices. Manufacturers of all classes of devices must comply with FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”), establishment registration, medical device listing, labeling requirements, and medical device reporting (“MDR”) regulations, which are collectively referred to as medical device general controls. Class II devices may also be subject to special controls such as performance standards, post-market surveillance, FDA guidelines, or particularized labeling. Some Class I and Class II devices may be exempted by regulation from the requirement of compliance with substantially all of the QSR.
 510(k) Clearance Pathway
 A 510(k) pre-market notification must contain information sufficient to demonstrate that the new device is substantially equivalent to a device commercially distributed prior to May 28, 1976 or to a device that has been determined by the FDA to be substantially equivalent to such a so-called “pre-amendments” device. To obtain 510(k) clearance for a non-exempt Class II device, the product developer must submit a pre-market notification to FDA demonstrating that its product is substantially equivalent to such a predicate device. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process generally takes from three to 12 months from the date the application is submitted, but it may take significantly longer if FDA has significant questions or needs more information about the new device or its manufacturing or quality controls.
 As part of the 510(k) notification process for Class II devices that have an existing classification regulation available for purposes of the regulatory filing, the FDA may require the following:
 •Development of comprehensive product description and indications for use.
 •Completion of extensive nonclinical tests and/or animal studies, performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”) regulations, as well as any performance standards or other testing requirements established by FDA through regulations or device-specific guidance.
 •Comprehensive review of one or more predicate devices and development of data supporting the new product’s substantial equivalence to such predicate devices.
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing, a detailed 510(k) notification is submitted to the FDA requesting clearance to market the product. This premarket notification includes all relevant data from pertinent nonclinical studies and clinical trials (if applicable), together with detailed information relating to the product’s manufacturing controls and proposed labeling, and other relevant documentation. The FDA evaluates all 510(k) submissions prior to filing for substantive review based on specific acceptance criteria and may issue a refuse-to-accept notification if the submission is deficient with respect to any of the established criteria. If the FDA determines that the applicant’s device is substantially equivalent to the identified predicate device(s), the agency will issue a 510(k) clearance letter that authorizes commercial marketing of the device for one or more specific indications for use. If the FDA determines that the applicant’s device is not substantially equivalent to the predicate device(s), the agency will issue a not-substantially-equivalent letter stating that the new device may not be commercially distributed.
 After a new medical device receives 510(k) clearance from the FDA, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require the submission of a PMA. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make the determination of whether a device modification requires a new 510(k) notification or PMA in the first instance, but the FDA may review any such decision. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s decision not to seek a new 510(k) clearance or PMA for a particular change, the FDA may retroactively require the manufacturer to submit a 510(k) pre-market notification or a PMA. The FDA may also require the manufacturer to cease U.S. marketing and/or recall any distributed units of the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval for the modification is obtained.



De Novo Classification
 If a previously unclassified new medical device does not qualify for the 510(k) pre-market notification process because no predicate device to which it is substantially equivalent can be identified, the device is automatically classified into Class III. However, if such a device would be considered low or moderate risk (in other words, it does not rise to the level of requiring the approval of a PMA), it may be eligible for the De Novo classification process. The De Novo classification process allows a device developer to request that the novel medical device be reclassified as either a Class I or Class II device, rather than having it regulated as a high-risk Class III device subject to the PMA requirements. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the classification request must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device.
 Under the FDCA, the FDA is required to classify a device within 120 days following receipt of the De Novo classification request from an applicant; however, the most recent FDA performance review goals state that in fiscal year 2022, FDA will attempt to issue a decision within 150 days of receipt on 70% of De Novo requests received during fiscal year 2022. De Novo classification requests are subject to user fees, unless a specific exemption applies (over $112,000 in FY 2022).
 As with the 510(k) pre-market notification process described above, any modification to a device authorized through the De Novo process that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of such device, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require the submission of a PMA.
 In October 2021, FDA issued a final rule that would formally codify requirements for the medical device De Novo process and the procedures and criteria for product developers to file a De Novo classification request (86 Fed. Reg. 54,826). Over the twenty years preceding the final rule, the De Novo process has been implemented by FDA pursuant to statutory authorities and somewhat organically through informal guidance and iterative changes by Congress. Although the final rule does not affect marketed products such as our marketed products, and likely will not be expected to impact products in current development, the FDA’s goals in promulgating the final rule are to create a predictable, consistent, and transparent De Novo classification process for innovative medical device developers.
 As an alternative to the De Novo classification process, a company could also file a reclassification petition seeking to change the automatic Class III designation of a novel post-amendment device under Section 513(f)(3) of the FDCA. FDA can also initiate reclassification of an existing device type on its own initiative. In December 2018, FDA issued a final rule to clarify the administrative process through which the FDA reclassifies a medical device. To reclassify a device under Section 513(e) of the FDCA, the FDA must first publish a proposed reclassification order that includes a summary of the valid scientific evidence that supports the reclassification; convene a device classification panel meeting; and consider comments to the public docket before it then publishes a final reclassification order in the Federal Register.
 Pre-market Approval Pathway
 Our point-of-care MRI systems have been classified and are regulated as Class II devices, although future products that we develop may be classified as Class III devices. Products classified by FDA as Class III generally require marketing approval via a PMA. A PMA application must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, nonclinical, clinical, manufacturing and labeling data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the device for its intended use(s). A PMA application also must include a complete description of the device and its components, a detailed description of the methods, facilities and controls used to manufacture the device, and proposed labeling. After a PMA application is submitted and found to be sufficiently complete, it is considered “filed” and the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information. During this substantive review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA. In addition, the FDA generally will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility to evaluate compliance with the QSR, which requires manufacturers to implement and follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures.
 FDA review of a PMA application is required to be completed within 180 days of the application’s filing date although the process generally takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer. The current user fee agreement between FDA and the medical device industry sets as a target for PMA reviews to be completed in under one year. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including:
 •the product may not be safe or effective for its intended use(s) to the FDA’s satisfaction;
 •the data from the applicant’s nonclinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support approval;



•the manufacturing process or facilities that the applicant uses may not meet applicable requirements; and
 •changes in FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data to demonstrate the safety or effectiveness of the device.
 If an FDA evaluation of a PMA application or manufacturing facilities is favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter, or approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions which must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA.
 When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of a device, subject to the conditions of approval and the limitations established in the approval letter. If the FDA’s evaluation of a PMA application or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. The FDA may also determine that additional trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and data is submitted in an amendment to the PMA. The PMA process can be expensive, uncertain and lengthy. PMA approval may also be granted with post-approval requirements such as the need for additional patient follow-up for an indefinite period of time.
 New PMA applications or PMA supplements may be required for modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling, device specifications, materials or design of a device that is approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the approved PMA application and may or may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.
 Clinical Investigations Using Devices in Development
 Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA application and are sometimes required for a De Novo classification request or 510(k) pre-market notification. In order to conduct a clinical investigation involving human subjects for the purpose of demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of a medical device, an investigator acting on behalf of the company must, among other things, apply for and obtain Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) approval of the proposed investigation. In addition, if the clinical study involves a “significant risk” (as defined by the FDA) to human health, the company sponsoring the investigation (referred to as the “sponsor”) must also submit and obtain FDA approval of an Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) application. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of study participants, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and eligible for abbreviated IDE requirements. Generally, clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent are approved by a duly-appointed IRB for clinical trial site. FDA’s IDE regulations govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion, and specify an array of Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) requirements, which include, among other things, recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. Clinical trials must further comply with the FDA’s regulations for IRB approval and for informed consent and other human subject protections. Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA. The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable or, even if the intended safety and efficacy success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA to grant approval or clearance of a product.
 The commencement or completion of any of our clinical trials may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support approval of a PMA application (or FDA’s grant of a De Novo classification request or clearance of a 510(k) notification, as applicable), for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:
 •the FDA, the IRB(s), or other regulatory authorities do not approve a clinical trial protocol or a clinical trial, or place a clinical trial on hold;
 •participants do not enroll in clinical trials at the expected rate;
 •participants do not comply with trial protocols;
 •participant follow-up is not at the expected rate;
 •patients experience adverse side effects;
 •participants die during a clinical trial, even though their death may not be related to the investigational products;



•IRBs and third-party clinical investigators may delay or reject the sponsor’s trial protocol;
 •third-party clinical investigators decline to participate in a trial or do not perform a trial on the sponsor’s anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, GCPs or other FDA requirements;
 •the sponsor or third-party organizations do not perform data collection, monitoring and analysis in a timely or accurate manner or consistent with the clinical trial protocol or investigational or statistical plans;
 •third-party clinical investigators have significant financial interests related to the sponsor or the study that the FDA deems to make the study results unreliable, or the sponsor or investigators fail to disclose such interests;
 •unfavorable regulatory inspections of the sponsor’s clinical trial sites or manufacturing facilities, which may, among other things, require the sponsor to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate the sponsor’s clinical trials;
 •changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions applicable to the sponsor’s trial protocols;
 •the interim or final results of the clinical trial are inconclusive or unfavorable as to safety or effectiveness; and
 •the FDA concludes that the results from the sponsor’s trial and/or trial design are inadequate to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of the product.
 Ongoing Post-Market Regulatory Requirements and FDA Enforcement
 In 2020, Legacy Hyperfine received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for its point-of-care MRI system. In addition, our proprietary BrainInsight product is fully automated MRI post-processing medical software that is regulated as a picture archiving and communications system, which may include both hardware and software components, and which is classified by FDA as a Class II medical device. BrainInsight received 510(k) marketing clearance in January 2021 for use in automatic labeling, spatial measurement, and volumetric quantification of brain structures from a set of low-field MR images and to return annotated and segmented images, color overlays, and reports. More recently, in November 2021, Legacy Hyperfine received 510(k) clearance for its new advanced image reconstruction technology using deep learning.
 After a medical device is authorized for marketing and placed in commercial distribution (or, for 510(k)-exempt products, placed into commerce without first obtaining FDA clearance or approval), numerous regulatory requirements apply. These general controls that must be met for all device classes include:
 •establishment registration and device listing;
 •the QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow design, testing, control, storage, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures;
 •labeling regulations, which govern the mandatory elements of the device labels and packaging (including Unique Device Identifier markings for certain categories of products);
 •FDA’s prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or “off-label” uses and other requirements related to promotional activities;
 •the MDR regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur;
 •voluntary and mandatory device recalls to address problems when a device is defective and/or could be a risk to health;
 •correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; and
 •post-market surveillance regulations, which apply to certain Class II or III devices when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.



FDA’s MDR requirements also extend to healthcare facilities that use medical devices in providing care to patients, or “device user facilities,” which include hospitals, ambulatory surgical facilities, nursing homes, outpatient diagnostic facilities, or outpatient treatment facilities, but not physician offices. A device user facility must report any device-related death to both the FDA and the device manufacturer, or any device-related serious injury to the manufacturer (or, if the manufacturer is unknown, to the FDA) within 10 days of the event. Device user facilities are not required to report device malfunctions that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur but may voluntarily report such malfunctions through MedWatch, the FDA’s Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program.
 To ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, medical device manufacturers are subject to market surveillance and periodic, pre-scheduled and unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state authorities. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may lead to any of the following sanctions:
 •Warning Letters or Untitled Letters that require corrective action;
 •fines and civil penalties;
 •unanticipated expenditures;
 •delays in approving/clearing or refusal to approve/clear any of our future products;
 •FDA refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export our products for sale in other countries;
 •suspension or withdrawal of FDA approval or clearance (as may be applicable);
 •product recall or seizure;
 •partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
 •operating restrictions;
 •injunctions or consent decrees; and
 •civil or criminal prosecution.
 We and any of our contract manufacturers, and some suppliers of components or device accessories, are required to manufacture medical device products in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements set forth in the QSR, unless explicitly exempted by regulation. The QSR requires a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and servicing of marketed devices, and includes extensive requirements with respect to quality management and organization, device design, buildings, equipment, purchase and handling of components or services, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, device evaluation, distribution, installation, complaint handling, servicing, and record keeping. The FDA evaluates compliance with the QSR through periodic pre-scheduled or unannounced inspections that may include registered manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. Following such inspections, FDA may issue reports known as Forms FDA 483 or Notices of Inspectional Observations, which list instances where the FDA inspector believes the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations and/or procedures. If the observations are sufficiently serious or the manufacturer fails to respond appropriately, the FDA may issue Warning Letters, which are notices of intended enforcement actions against the manufacturer. For less serious violations that may not rise to the level of regulatory significance, FDA may issue Untitled Letters. FDA may take more significant administrative or legal action if a manufacturer continues to be in substantial noncompliance with applicable regulations.
 For example, if the FDA believes we or any of our contract manufacturers or regulated suppliers are not in compliance with these requirements and patients are being subjected to serious risks, it can shut down manufacturing operations, require recalls of our medical device products, refuse to approve new marketing applications, initiate legal proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations, or assess civil and criminal penalties against us or our officers or other employees. Any such action by the FDA would have a material adverse effect on our business. We may be unable to comply with all applicable FDA regulations.



U.S. Fraud and Abuse Laws and Other Compliance Requirements
 Successfully commercializing a medical device or technology depends not on only FDA approval, but also on broad health insurance or third party payor coverage. Government and private payors institute coverage criteria to ensure the appropriate utilization of products and services and to control costs. Limited third party payor coverage for a technology or procedure may limit adoption and commercial viability, while broader coverage supports optimal market uptake. Favorable coverage decisions by government payors like Medicare or Medicaid is critical because private payors typically follow the government’s lead regarding reimbursement. However, manufacturers whose technology is reimbursed by government payors are subject to various U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse. These laws can be implicated by inappropriate sales and marketing arrangements with healthcare providers. Many commonly accepted commercial practices are illegal in the healthcare industry and violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, exclusion from participation in U.S. federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.
 Anti-kickback Laws. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging of a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including such items as gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, waiver of payments, and providing anything at less than its fair market value. The Department of Health and Human Services - Office of the Inspector General, has issued regulations, commonly known as safe harbors, which set forth certain provisions that, if satisfied in their entirety, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable safe harbor element may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities or invite litigation by private citizens under federal whistleblower laws. The Anti-Kickback law is broadly interpreted and aggressively enforced with the result that beneficial commercial arrangements can be criminalized in the healthcare industry because of the Anti-Kickback law.
 The penalties for violating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute include imprisonment for up to ten years, fines of up to $100,000 per violation and possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Many states have adopted prohibitions similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not only by the government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.
 Federal False Claims Act. The federal False Claims Act prohibits knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented a false claim or the knowing use of false statements or records to obtain payment from the federal government. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it must pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $11,181 and $22,363 for each separate false claim. Suits filed under the False Claims Act, known as “qui tam” actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals (known as “relators” or, more commonly, as “whistleblowers”) may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. In addition, certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act. Qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of healthcare companies to have to defend a false claim action, even before the validity of the claim is established and even if the government decides not to intervene in the lawsuit. Healthcare companies may decide to agree to large settlements with the government and/or whistleblowers to avoid the cost and negative publicity associated with litigation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act amended federal law to provide that a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Criminal prosecution is possible for knowingly making or presenting a false or fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government.
 Federal Physician Self-Referral Law. The Federal Physician Self-Referral Law, also referred to as the Stark Law, prohibits a physician (or an immediate family member of a physician) who has a financial relationship with an entity from referring patients to that entity for certain designated health services, including durable medical equipment and supplies, payable by Medicare, unless an exception applies. The Stark Law also prohibits such an entity from presenting or causing to be presented a claim to the Medicare program for such designated health services provided pursuant to a prohibited referral, and provides that certain collections related to any such claims must be refunded in a timely manner. Exceptions to the Stark Law include, among other things, exceptions for certain financial relationships, including both ownership and compensation arrangements. The Stark Law is a strict liability statute: to the extent that the statute is implicated and an exception does not apply, the statute is violated. In addition to the Stark Law, many states have implemented similar physician self-referral prohibitions that may extend to Medicaid, third party payors, and self-pay patients. Violations of the Stark Law must be


reported and unauthorized claims must be refunded to Medicare in order to avoid potential liability under the federal False Claims Act for avoiding a known obligation to return identified overpayments. Violations of the Stark Law, the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law and/or the federal False Claims Act can also form the basis for exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs.
 Civil Monetary Penalties Law. The Civil Monetary Penalties Law (“CMPL”) authorizes the imposition of substantial civil money penalties against an entity that engages in certain prohibited activities including but not limited to violations of the Stark Law or Anti-Kickback Statute, knowing submission of a false or fraudulent claim, employment of an excluded individual, and the provision or offer of anything of value to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the transferring party knows or should know is likely to influence beneficiary selection of a particular provider for which payment may be made in whole or part by a federal healthcare program, commonly known as the Beneficiary Inducement CMP. Remuneration is defined under the CMPL as any transfer of items or services for free or for less than fair market value. There are certain exceptions to the definition of remuneration for offerings that meet the Financial Need, Preventative Care, or Promoting Access to Care exceptions (as defined in the CMPL). Sanctions for violations of the CMPL include civil monetary penalties and administrative penalties up to and including exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.
 State Analogs of Federal Fraud and Abuse Laws. Many U.S. states have their own laws intended to protect against fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and more broadly. In some cases these laws prohibit or regulate additional conduct beyond what federal law affects. Penalties for violating these laws can range from fines to criminal sanctions.
 HIPAA. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and implementing regulations (“HIPAA”), created two new federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government sponsored programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 FCPA and Other Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Laws. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA would include interactions with certain healthcare professionals or organizations in many countries. Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other U.S. and foreign laws, rules and/or regulations.
 Physician Payment Sunshine Act. Manufacturers of U.S. FDA-regulated devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs are subject to the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers to track and annually report certain payments and other transfers of value made to U.S.-licensed physicians or U.S. teaching hospitals. As a manufacturer of U.S. FDA regulated devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs, we are subject to this law. We are also required to report certain ownership interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. In 2018, the law was extended to require tracking and reporting of transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and other mid-level practitioners. The law carries penalties of up to $1.15 million per year for violations, depending on the circumstances, and payments reported also have the potential to draw scrutiny on payments to and relationships with physicians, which may have implications under the Anti-Kickback Statute, Stark Law and other healthcare laws.
 In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments and other transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities. Similar to the federal law, certain states also have adopted marketing and/or transparency laws relevant to device manufacturers, some of which are broader in scope. Certain states also mandate that device manufacturers implement compliance programs. Other states impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation, and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities. The need to build and maintain a robust compliance program with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements, resulting in fines and penalties.
 U.S. and European Data Security and Data Privacy Laws
 HIPAA, as well as a number of other federal and state privacy-related laws, extensively regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, known as “protected health information” or “PHI.” HIPAA applies to health plans, healthcare providers who engage in certain standard healthcare transactions electronically, such as electronic billing, and healthcare clearinghouses, all of which are referred to as “covered entities” under HIPAA. State imposed health


information privacy and security laws typically apply based on licensure, for example, licensed providers or licensed entities are limited in their ability to use and share health information.
 Additionally, all states have enacted legislation protecting the privacy and security of “personal information” such as identifiable financial or health information, social security number and credit card information. These laws overlap and apply simultaneously with federal privacy and security requirements and regulated entities must comply with all of them. The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which went into effect January 1, 2020, is one of the most restrictive state privacy laws, protecting a wide variety of personal information and granting significant rights to California residents with respect to their personal information. In dealing with health information for the development of its technology or for commercial purposes, we will be indirectly affected by HIPAA and state-imposed health information privacy and security laws because these laws regulate the ability of our customers and research collaborators to share health information with us. Additionally, we must identify and comply with all applicable state laws for the protection of personal information with respect to employee information or other personal information that we collect.
 In the European Union, increasingly stringent data protection and privacy rules that have and will continue to have substantial impact on the use of personal and patient data across the healthcare industry became stronger in May 2018. The EU General Data Protection Regulation, (“GDPR”) applies across the European Union and includes, among other things, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and significant fines for non-compliance. The GDPR fine framework can be up to 20 million euros, or up to 4% of our total global turnover of the preceding fiscal year, whichever is higher. The GDPR sets out a number of requirements that must be complied with when handling the personal data of such European Union-based data subjects including: providing expanded disclosures about how their personal data will be used; higher standards for organizations to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent or have another legal basis in place to justify their data processing activities; the obligation to appoint data protection officers in certain circumstances; new rights for individuals to be “forgotten” and rights to data portability, as well as enhanced current rights (e.g. access requests); the principal of accountability and demonstrating compliance through policies, procedures, training and audit; and the new mandatory data breach regime. In particular, medical or health data, genetic data and biometric data where the latter is used to uniquely identify an individual are all classified as “special category” data under the GDPR and are afforded greater protection and require additional compliance measures. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines, penalties, data lockup or orders to stop noncompliant activities. We may be subject to GDPR if we undertake operations in the EU, offer products or services to individuals in the EU or monitor the behavior of individuals within the EU. Our research activities in the EU currently implicate the GDPR and if we undertake commercial operations in the EU, offer products or services to individuals in the EU or monitor the behavior of individuals within the EU, we will have additional compliance obligations.
 We could also be subject to evolving European Union laws on data export, for transfers of data outside the European Union to themselves, group companies or third parties. The GDPR only permits exports of data outside the European Union to jurisdictions that ensure an adequate level of data protection. The United States has not been deemed to offer an adequate level of protection, so in order for us to transfer personal data from the EU to the United States, we must identify a legal basis for data transfer (e.g., the European Union Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses). On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union or the CJEU, issued a landmark opinion in the case Maximilian Schrems vs. Facebook (Case C-311/18), called Schrems II. This decision (a) calls into question commonly relied upon data transfer mechanisms as between the European Union member states and the United States (such as the Standard Contractual Clauses) and (b) invalidates the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield on which many companies had relied as an acceptable mechanism for transferring such data from the EU to the United States. The CJEU is the highest court in Europe and the Schrems II decision heightens the burden on data importers to assess U.S. national security laws on their business and future actions of European Union data protection authorities are difficult to predict.
 Further, the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union, often referred to as Brexit, has created uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the United Kingdom. In particular, while the Data Protection Act of 2018 that “implements” and complements the GDPR achieved Royal Assent on May 23, 2018 and is now effective in the United Kingdom, it is still unclear whether transfer of data from the European Economic Area to the United Kingdom will remain lawful under GDPR.
 International Regulation of Medical Devices
 International marketing and distribution of medical devices are subject to regulation by foreign governments, and such regulations may vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain marketing authorization in a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the requirements may differ. There is


a trend towards harmonization of quality system standards among the European Union, United States, Canada and various other industrialized countries.
 The primary regulatory environment in Europe is that of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”), which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the European Union (the “EU”), Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. In the EEA, medical devices were previously required to comply with the Essential Requirements defined in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Directive (“MDD”) (applicable in the non-EU EEA Member States via the Agreement on the European Economic Area), a coordinated system for the authorization of medical devices. The directives and standards outlined in the MDD regulate the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive are entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout the EEA. The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third-party assessment by a “Notified Body,” an organization designated by an EU country to assess a product’s conformity with the applicable legal requirements. This third-party assessment may consist of an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system and specific testing of the manufacturer’s product. An assessment by a Notified Body of one country within the EU is required in order for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout the EU.
 In 2017, European Union regulatory bodies finalized a new Medical Device Regulation, which replaced the existing MDD framework and provided three years for transition and compliance, for a final effective date of May 26, 2020. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, the European Parliament voted in April 2020 to postpone implementation of the Medical Device Regulation by one year, giving the medical device industry and Notified Bodies until May 26, 2021 to come into compliance. The Medical Device Regulation changes several aspects of the existing regulatory framework for medical device marketing in Europe and is expected to result in increased regulatory oversight of all medical devices marketed in the EU, which may, in turn, increase the costs, time and requirements that need to be met in order to place an innovative or high-risk medical device on the European market. In particular, the new regulations, among other things:
 •strengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available;
 •establish explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;
 •improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number;
 •set up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU; and
 •strengthen the rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.
 European medical device manufacturers and distributors are currently benefiting from a grace period for legacy MDD certificates that lasts until May 26, 2024. For a product to qualify for the grace period, there must be no significant changes to such a legacy medical device as described in its existing MDD certificate; the recertification process under the Medical Device Regulation requires a demonstration that the performance and the safety of the currently marketed medical device has been maintained and that the system meets the new regulatory requirements.
 Outside of the European Union, regulatory authorization needs to be sought on a country-by-country basis in order for the company to market their products. Some countries have adopted medical device regulatory regimes, such as the Classification Rules for Medical Devices published by the Hong Kong Department of Health, the Health Sciences Authority of Singapore regulation of medical devices under the Health Products Act, and Health Canada’s risk classification system for invasive devices, among others. Each country may have its own processes and requirements for medical device licensing, approval/clearance, and regulation, therefore requiring the company to seek marketing authorizations on a country-by-country basis.
 In addition, as previously noted, the United Kingdom left the European Union on January 31, 2020, with a transitional period that expired on December 31, 2020. The United Kingdom and the European Union entered into a trade agreement known as the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (“TCA”), which came into effect on January 1, 2021. The TCA does not specifically refer to medical devices. However, as a result of Brexit, the Medical Device Regulation will not be implemented in the UK, and previous legislation that mirrored the Medical Device Regulation in the UK law has been revoked. The regulatory regime


for medical devices in the UK will continue to be based on the requirements derived from EU legislation as of January 21, 2020, and the UK may choose to retain regulatory flexibility or align with the Medical Device Regulation going forward. CE markings will continue to be recognized in the UK, and certificates issued by EU recognized Notified Bodies will be valid in the UK, until June 30, 2023. For medical devices placed on the UK market after this period, the UK Conformity Assessment (“UKCA”) marking will be mandatory. In contrast, UKCA marking and certificates issued by UK Notified Bodies will not be recognized on the EU market. The TCA does provide for cooperation and exchange of information in the area of product safety and compliance, including market surveillance, enforcement activities and measures, standardization related activities, exchanges of officials, and coordinated product recalls (or other similar actions). Depending on which countries products will ultimately be sold in, manufacturers may start seeking alternative sources for components if this would allow them to benefit from no tariffs. The rules for placing medical devices on the Northern Ireland market will differ from those in the UK.
 In addition, outside the United States, a range of anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, as well as some industry-specific laws and codes of conduct, apply to the medical device industry and interactions with government officials and entities and healthcare professionals. Such laws include, but are not limited to the UK Bribery Act of 2010. Further, the European Union member countries have emphasized a greater focus on healthcare fraud and abuse and have indicated greater attention to the industry by the European Anti-Fraud Office. Countries in Asia have also become more active in their enforcement of anti-bribery laws and with respect to procurement and supply chain fraud.
