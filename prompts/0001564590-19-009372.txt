Turkey 
 As of December 31, 2018, we held interests in five onshore exploration licenses and 18 onshore production leases covering a total of 443,268 gross (372,050 net) acres in Turkey. As of December 31, 2018, we had total net proved reserves of 9,976 Mbbl of oil and 2,440 Mmcf of natural gas, net probable reserves of 5,748 Mbbl of oil and 817 Mmcf of natural gas and net possible reserves of 6,204 Mbbl of oil and 938 Mmcf of natural gas in Turkey. During 2018, our average wellhead production was 3,355 net Boepd of oil and natural gas in Turkey. The following summarizes our core producing properties in Turkey: 
 Southeastern Turkey. During 2018, substantially all of our oil production was concentrated in Southeastern Turkey, primarily in the Arpatepe, Bahar, Goksu, Selmo, and Yeniev oil fields. These fields are located in the northwest region within the Turkish portion of the North Arabian Basin. The North Arabian Basin includes prolific oil trends that extend from Iran and Iraq into Turkey. 
 1


We hold a 100% working interest in the Selmo production lease, which expires in June 2025. We also hold a 100% working interest in the Selmo exploration license. The Selmo oil field is the second largest oil field in Turkey in terms of historical cumulative production and is responsible for a large portion of our current crude oil production. For 2018, our net wellhead production of crude oil from the Selmo field was 653,719 Bbls at an average rate of 1,791 Bbl/d. Turkiye Petrolleri Anonim Ortakligi (“TPAO”), a Turkish government-owned oil and natural gas company, and Türkiye Petrol Rafinerileri A.Ş. (“TUPRAS”), a privately-owned oil refinery in Turkey, purchase all of our crude oil production, which are transported by truck to their neighboring facilities. At December 31, 2018, we had 55 gross and net producing wells in the Selmo oil field. 
 We hold a 100% working interest in the Molla exploration license, which includes the Bahar and Cavuslu fields. We also hold a 100% working interest in each of the three Molla production leases, which includes the Goksu, Yeniev, West Yeniev, Pinar, Catak and Bati Yasince fields. In the Molla licenses, we target Bedinan, Dadas, Hazro, and Mardin formations, which produce on the licenses.  For 2018, our wellhead production of crude oil from the Molla area was 468,514 Bbls at an average rate of 1,284 Bbl/d. At December 31, 2018, we had 16 gross and net producing wells on the Molla licenses. 
 We hold a 50% working interest in our Arpatepe production lease. For 2018, our share of wellhead production of net crude oil from the Arpatepe field was 51,127 Bbls at an average rate of 140 Bbl/d. At December 31, 2018, we had five producing wells on the Arpatepe production lease. We have operated the Arpatepe production lease since December 2015.
 We hold a 50% working interest in the Bakuk production lease.  In 2017, our production was shut in due to security precautions and remained shut in during 2018.
 Northwestern Turkey. Substantially all of our natural gas production is concentrated in the Thrace Basin, which is one of Turkey’s most productive onshore natural gas regions. It is located in northwestern Turkey close to Istanbul province.  For 2018, our net wellhead production was 238,865 Mcf at an average rate of 645 Mcf/d from all of the gas fields.
Bulgaria
 As of December 31, 2018, we held interests in one production concession covering a total of 162,500 net undeveloped acres in Bulgaria. During 2018, we had no production or reserves in Bulgaria.  
Current Operations 
 Southeastern Turkey 
 Molla
 Yeniev Field. Both the Yeniev-1 and West Yeniev-1 wells continue flowing naturally with little water. In November 2018, we spud the East Yeniev-1 appraisal well to further delineate the structure. The well was drilled to a total measured depth of 9,900 feet and encountered hydrocarbon shows in the Mardin and Bedinan formations. Completion operations began in January 2019 and resulted in a discovery in the Mardin formation.
 Other. We spud the Blackeye-1 well in January 2019. The well was drilled to a total measured depth of 11,105 feet and encountered oil shows in the Hazro, Mardin, and Bedinan formations. Completion operations began in February 2019.
Selmo
 We have completed the initial phase of operations in the Selmo-1 well to re-enter and test the Permian formation, establishing the productivity of the Permian formation. During a short-term flow test of a previously untested interval, the Selmo-1 well tested 45.6 API condensate along with natural gas containing a high carbon dioxide percentage component. While the Selmo-1 well lies in what is interpreted as the gas cap of the structure, the positive test results warrant further testing lower on the structure.
Northwestern Turkey
 Thrace Basin BCGA
 We continue to evaluate our prospects in the Thrace Basin’s Basin Center Gas Accumulation (“Thrace Basin BCGA”) in light of the recent production test results at the Yamalik-1 exploration well operated by Valeura Energy Inc. (“Valeura”) with their partner Equinor ASA (formerly Statoil ASA) (“Equinor”). The Yamalik-1 exploration well is located on a license directly adjacent to our 
 2


120,000 net acres in the Thrace Basin of which we believe approximately 50,000 net acres (100% working interest, 87.5% net revenue interest) is in the Thrace Basin BCGA and analogous to the Valeura and Equinor acreage.
 Subsequent to drilling and testing of the Yamalik-1 well, the joint venture between Valeura and Equinor announced a three-well program. In the first quarter of 2019, Valeura and Equinor announced that they drilled and cased a second well in the Thrace Basin BCGA, the Inanli-1 well. According to Valeura and Equinor, the well was drilled to a total depth of 4,885 meters and encountered 1,615 meters of high net-to-gross sandstone, which they interpreted to contain over-pressured gas. Valeura and Equinor announced that they expect to complete the well in the first quarter of 2019. In the first quarter of 2019, Valeura and Equinor announced that they spud the Devepinar-1 appraisal well and drilled it to intermediate casing point at 3,375 meters. According to Valeura and Equinor, the Devepinar-1 appraisal well is designed as a 20-kilometer step-out well to test the lateral extent of the Thrace Basin BCGA.
 We expect to spud a shallow exploration well on our license in the Thrace Basin in the second quarter of 2019.
 Bulgaria
 We commenced the side-track and re-drilling of the Deventci R-1 well in December 2018, 
targeting the Ozirovu and Dolmi Dabnik formations. The well was drilled to a total depth of 16,450 feet. Although we encountered the targeted formations, tests did not indicate commercial quantities of reservoir quality rock. We are currently evaluating future activity in Bulgaria. 
Planned Operations 
 We expect our net field capital expenditures for 2019 to range between $25.0 million and $30.0 million. We expect net field capital expenditures during 2019 to include between $24.0 million and $29.0 million in drilling and completion expense for 10 planned wells and approximately $1.0 million for recompletions. We expect that cash on hand and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our 2019 net field capital expenditures.  If not, we will either curtail our discretionary capital expenditures or seek other funding sources. Our projected 2019 capital expenditure budget is subject to change.
Customers 
 
Oil. During 2018, 87.5% of our oil production, which is U.S. Dollar indexed, was concentrated in the Selmo and Bahar oil fields in Turkey. TUPRAS purchases substantially all of our oil production. During 2018, we sold $68.2 million of oil to TUPRAS, representing 96.4% of our total revenues. We sell all of our Southeastern Turkey oil to TUPRAS pursuant to a domestic crude oil purchase and sale agreement. Under the purchase and sale agreement, TUPRAS purchases oil produced by us and delivered to our TPAO Batman tanks and to the Boru Hatlari ile Petrol Tasima A.S. (“BOTAŞ”) Dörtyol plant. The price of the oil delivered pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement is determined under the Petroleum Market Law No. 5015 under the laws of the Republic of Turkey. The purchase and sale agreement automatically renews for successive one-year terms unless earlier terminated in writing by either party.  All payments for our oil production made by TUPRAS for the past nine years have been in full and on time.  No other purchasers of our oil accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues. 
 Natural Gas. During 2018, no purchasers of our natural gas production, which is indexed on the New Turkish Lira (“TRY”), accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues. 
 Competition 
 We operate in the highly competitive areas of oil and natural gas exploration, development, production and acquisition with a number of other companies, including U.S.-based and international companies doing business in each of the countries in which we operate. We face competition from both major and other independent oil and natural gas companies in each of the following areas seeking oil and natural gas exploration licenses and production licenses and leases and acquiring desirable producing properties or new leases for future exploration. 
 Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, managerial, technological and other resources than we do. To the extent competitors are able to pay more for properties than we are paying, we will be at a competitive disadvantage. Further, many of our competitors enjoy technological advantages over us and may be able to implement new technologies more rapidly than we can. Our ability to explore for and produce oil and natural gas prospects and to acquire additional properties in the future will depend upon our ability to successfully conduct operations, implement advanced technologies, evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment.

Fracture Stimulation Program 
 Oil and natural gas may be recovered from our properties through the use of fracture stimulation combined with modern drilling and completion techniques. Fracture stimulation involves the injection of water, and generally sand and/or chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the oil or gas formation by contacting greater surface area to stimulate production. We have successfully utilized fracture stimulation in our Thrace Basin, Molla, and Selmo licenses and production leases. 
 Fracture stimulations in Thrace Basin and Molla are conducted in a low permeability reservoir. These stimulations generally consist of injecting between 20,000 and 100,000 gallons of fluid that contain between 80,000 and 150,000 pounds of sand per stage. Fluids are generally a mixture of slickwater and gels, which is typical in stimulation. The size of fracture stimulation treatments is dependent on net pay thickness and stress barriers.
 Although the cost of each well will vary, on average approximately 10% to 60% of the total cost of completing a well in both Thrace Basin and Molla is associated with stimulation activities. We account for these costs as typical drilling and completion costs and include them in our capital expenditure budget.
 We diligently review best practices and industry standards in connection with fracture stimulation activities and strive to comply with all regulatory requirements in the protection of potable water sources. Protective practices include, but are not limited to, setting multiple strings of protection pipe across potable water sources, cementing surface casing from setting depth to surface and second string from setting depth up-well past multiple frac barriers above the formation and, in some cases, to surface, continuously monitoring the fracture stimulation process in real time, and disposing of all non-commercially produced fluids in certified disposal wells at depths below the potable water sources or at a certified water treatment plant. In Southeast Turkey, the base of potable water is generally 3,000 feet to 8,000 feet above the hydrocarbon zones.  There have not been any incidents, citations, or suits involving environmental concerns related to our fracture stimulation operations on our properties. 
 In the Thrace Basin, Selmo, and Molla, we have access to water resources which we believe will be adequate to execute any stimulation activities that we may perform in the future. We also employ procedures for environmentally friendly disposal of fluids recovered from fracture stimulation.
 For more information on the risks of fracture stimulation, please read “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Oil and Natural Gas Industry—Our oil and natural gas operations are subject to extensive and complex laws and government regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate and compliance with existing and future laws may increase our costs or impair our operations” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Oil and Natural Gas Industry—Legislative and regulatory initiatives and increased public scrutiny relating to fracture stimulation activities could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.” 
 Governmental Regulations 
 Government Regulations. Our current or future operations, including exploration and development activities on our properties, require permits from various governmental authorities, and such operations are and will be governed by laws and regulations concerning exploration, development, production, exports, taxes, labor laws and standards, occupational health, waste disposal, toxic substances, land use, environmental protection and other matters. Compliance with these requirements may prove to be difficult and expensive. Due to our international operations, we are subject to the following issues and uncertainties that can affect our operations adversely: 

• | the risk of expropriation, nationalization, war, revolution, political instability, border disputes, renegotiation or modification of existing contracts, and import, export and transportation regulations and tariffs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | laws of foreign governments affecting our ability to fracture stimulate oil or natural gas wells, such as the legislation enacted in Bulgaria in January 2012;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the risk of not being able to procure residency and work permits for our expatriate personnel;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | taxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | exchange controls, currency fluctuations and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over international operations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade, taxation and investment, including anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | the possibility of being subjected to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts in connection with legal disputes and the possible inability to subject foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts in the United States; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the possibility of restrictions on repatriation of earnings or capital from foreign countries.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Permits and Licenses. In order to carry out exploration and development of oil and natural gas interests or to place these into commercial production, we may require certain licenses and permits from various governmental authorities. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to obtain all necessary licenses and permits that may be required. In addition, such licenses and permits are subject to change and there can be no assurances that any application to renew any existing licenses or permits will be approved. 
 Repatriation of Earnings. Currently, there are no prohibitions on the repatriation of earnings or capital to foreign entities from Turkey or Bulgaria. However, there can be no assurance that any such prohibitions on repatriation of earnings or capital from the aforementioned countries or any other country where we may invest will not be imposed in the future. We may be liable for the payment of taxes upon repatriation of certain earnings from the aforementioned countries. 
 Environmental. The oil and natural gas industry is subject to extensive and varying environmental regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Environmental regulations establish standards respecting health, safety and environmental matters and place restrictions and prohibitions on emissions of various substances produced concurrently with oil and natural gas. In most instances, the regulatory requirements relate to the handling and disposal of drilling and production waste products and waste created by water and air pollution control procedures. These regulations can have an impact on the selection of drilling locations and facilities, and potentially result in increased capital expenditures. In addition, environmental legislation may require those wells and production facilities to be abandoned and sites reclaimed to the satisfaction of local authorities. Such regulation has increased the cost of planning, designing, drilling, operating and, in some instances, abandoning wells. We are committed to complying with environmental and operational legislation wherever we operate. 
 Such laws and regulations not only expose us to liability for our own negligence but may also expose us to liability for the conduct of others or for our actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. We may incur significant costs as a result of environmental accidents, such as oil spills, natural gas leaks, ruptures, or discharges of hazardous materials into the environment, including clean-up costs and fines or penalties. Additionally, we may incur significant costs in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations and may be forced to pay fines or penalties if we do not comply. 
 There has been an increase in interest among the media, government regulators and private citizens concerning the possible negative environmental and geological effects of fracture stimulation. Some have alleged that fracture stimulation results in the contamination of aquifers and may even contribute to seismic activity. In January 2012, the government of Bulgaria enacted legislation that banned the fracture stimulation of oil and natural gas wells in the Republic of Bulgaria and imposed large monetary penalties on companies that violate that ban.  There is a risk that Turkey could at some point impose similar legislation or regulations. Such legislation or regulations could severely impact our ability and the cost to drill and complete wells. We are committed to complying with legislation and regulations involving fracture stimulation wherever we operate. 
 Insurance 
 We currently carry general liability insurance and excess liability insurance, including pollution insurance, with a combined annual limit of $13.0 million per occurrence and $16.0 million in the aggregate. These insurance policies contain maximum policy limits and are subject to customary exclusions and limitations. Our general liability insurance covers us and our subsidiaries for third-party claims and liabilities arising out of lease operations and related activities. The excess liability insurance is in addition to, and is triggered if, the general liability insurance per occurrence limit is reached.  We also maintain control of well insurance. Our control of well insurance has a per occurrence and combined single limit of $25.0 million and is subject to deductibles ranging from $10,000 to $250,000 per occurrence.  In addition, we carry a political risk policy, which covers our scheduled production facilities in the event of an act of terrorism with an annual limit of $8.6 million. We will continue to monitor our insurance coverage and will maintain appropriate levels of insurance to satisfy applicable regulations, as well as maintain levels of insurance appropriate for prudent operations within the industry in which we operate.
 We require our third-party service providers to sign master service agreements with us pursuant to which they agree to indemnify us for the personal injury and death of the service provider’s employees as well as subcontractors that are hired by the service provider. Similarly, we generally agree to indemnify our third-party service providers against similar claims regarding our employees and our other contractors. 
 We also require our third-party service providers that perform fracture stimulation operations for us to sign master service agreements containing the indemnification provisions noted above. We do not currently have any insurance policies in effect that are intended to provide coverage for losses solely related to fracture stimulation operations. We believe that our general liability, excess 
 5


liability and pollution insurance policies would cover third-party claims related to fracture stimulation operations and associated legal expenses, in accordance with, and subject to, the terms of such policies. However, these policies may not cover fines, penalties or costs and expenses related to government-mandated environmental clean-up responsibilities. 
 Bermuda Tax Exemption 
 As a Bermuda exempted company and under current Bermuda law, we are not subject to tax on profits, income or dividends, nor is there any capital gains tax applicable to us in Bermuda. Profits can be accumulated, and it is not obligatory for us to pay dividends. 
 Furthermore, we have received an assurance from the Minister of Finance of Bermuda under the Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act 1966, as amended, that in the event that Bermuda enacts any legislation imposing tax computed on profits, income, any capital asset, gain or appreciation, we and any of our operations or our shares, debentures or other obligations shall be exempt from the imposition of such tax until March 31, 2035, provided that such exemption shall not prevent the application of any tax payable in accordance with the provisions of the Land Tax Act, 1967 or otherwise payable in relation to land in Bermuda leased to us. 
 We are required to pay an annual government fee (the “AGF”), which is determined on a sliding scale by reference to our authorized share capital and share premium account, with a minimum fee of $1,995 Bermuda Dollars and a maximum fee of $31,120 Bermuda Dollars. The Bermuda Dollar is treated at par with the U.S. Dollar. The AGF is payable each year on or before the end of January and is based on the authorized share capital and share premium account on August 31 of the preceding year. 
 In Bermuda, stamp duty is not chargeable in respect of the incorporation, registration, licensing of an exempted company or, subject to certain minor exceptions, on their transactions. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we employed 112 people in Turkey, 30 people in Addison, Texas and 6 people in Bulgaria. Approximately 36 of our employees at one of our subsidiaries operating in Turkey were represented by collective bargaining agreements with the Petroleum, Chemical and Rubber Workers Union of Turkey (“PETROL-IS”). We consider our employee relations to be satisfactory. 
Formation 
 We were incorporated under the laws of British Columbia, Canada on October 1, 1985 under the name Profco Resources Ltd. and continued to the jurisdiction of Alberta, Canada under the Business Corporations Act (Alberta) on June 10, 1997. Effective December 2, 1998, we changed our name to TransAtlantic Petroleum Corp.
