Overview
 
U.S. Energy Corp. is a Wyoming corporation organized in 1966. We are an independent energy company focused on the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas producing properties in the continental United States.
 
We have historically explored for and produced oil and natural gas through a non-operator business model, however, during 2020 we acquired operated properties in North Dakota, New Mexico, Wyoming and the Texas Gulf Coast, and on January 5, 2022, we closed the acquisitions of certain oil and gas properties from three separate sellers, representing a diversified portfolio of primarily operated, producing, oil-weighted assets located across the Rockies, West Texas, Eagle Ford, and Mid-Continent.
 
Our business strategy going forward is to enhance the value of our acquired operated assets through evaluation of certain properties with the goal of increasing production and reserves. We plan to deploy our capital in a conservative and strategic manner and pursue value-enhancing transactions and expect to continuously evaluate strategic alternative opportunities that we believe will enhance shareholder value.

Office Location

Oil and Natural Gas Operations
 
During 2021 we actively pursued acquisitions of exploration, development and production-stage oil and natural gas properties or companies. This resulted in the acquisition of certain oil and gas properties described below, which closed on January 5, 2022. We participate in oil and natural gas projects as both a non-operating working interest owner through exploration and development agreements with various oil and natural gas exploration and production companies and as an operator. Our working interest varies by project and may change over time based on the terms of our leases and operating agreements. These projects may result in numerous wells being drilled over the next three to five years depending on, among other things, commodity prices and the availability of capital resources required to fund the expenditures. We are also actively pursuing potential acquisitions of exploration, development and production-stage oil and natural gas properties or companies. Key attributes of our oil and natural gas properties include the following:

● | Estimated proved reserves of 1,344,626 barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) (76% oil and 24% natural gas) as of December 31, 2021, with a standardized measure value of $19.2 million. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | As of December 31, 2021, our oil and natural gas leases covered 89,846 gross acres and 5,757 net acres. 
● | 146 gross (35.3 net) producing wells as of December 31, 2021. 
● | 337 BOE per day average net production for 2021. 

Recent Events
 
Acquisition of Properties
 
On January 5, 2022 (the “Closing Date”), we closed the acquisitions (the “Closing”) contemplated by those certain three separate Purchase and Sale Agreements (as amended to date, the “Purchase Agreements”), previously entered into by the Company on October 4, 2021, with each of (a) Lubbock Energy Partners LLC (“Lubbock”); (b) Banner Oil & Gas, LLC, Woodford Petroleum, LLC and Llano Energy LLC (collectively, “Banner”), and (c) Synergy Offshore LLC (“Synergy”, and collectively with Lubbock and Banner, (the “Sellers”).
 
Pursuant to the Purchase Agreements, we acquired certain oil and gas properties from the Sellers, representing a diversified, portfolio of primarily operated, producing, oil-weighted assets located across the Rockies, West Texas, Eagle Ford, and Mid-Continent. The acquisition also included certain wells, contracts, technical data, records, personal property and hydrocarbons associated with the acquired assets (collectively with the oil and gas properties acquired, the “Acquired Assets”).
 
The purchase price for the Acquired Assets was (a) $125,000 in cash and 6,568,828 shares of our common stock, as to Lubbock; (b) $1,000,000 in cash, the repayment of $3.3 million in liabilities (which were repaid with funds borrowed under the Credit Agreement discussed and defined below), and 6,790,524 shares of common stock, as well as the novation of certain hedges which had a mark to market loss of approximately $3.1 million as of the Closing Date, as to Banner (which were evidenced by the Master Agreement and Schedule, discussed and defined below); and (c) $125,000 in cash and 6,546,384 shares of common stock, as to Synergy. The aggregate purchase price under all the Purchase Agreements was $1.25 million in cash, 19,905,736 shares of common stock (the “PSA Shares”), the repayment of $3.3 million in debt, as well as the novation of the hedges discussed above. The initial base purchase price remains subject to customary working capital and other adjustments following the Closing.
 
Each Purchase Agreement required the Company to place a $500,000 deposit into escrow ($1.5 million in aggregate)(the “Deposits”). The Deposits were released at the closing to pay a portion of the purchase price and closing adjustments for the Acquired Assets.
 
In connection with the Closing of the acquisition of the Acquired Assets, and on January 5, 2022, we entered into various related agreements with the Sellers as discussed below:

Registration Rights Agreement
 
Immediately prior to the Closing, on January 5, 2022, each Seller and the Company entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the “RRA”). Pursuant to the RRA, we agreed:

● | To use our commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and file an initial shelf registration statement under the Securities Act covering the resale of all of the shares of common stock issuable to the Sellers, on or before the 30th day after the date the RRA was entered into and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such initial shelf registration statement to become effective no later than 60 days following the filing date (or, in the event of a “full review” by the Commission, the 90th day following the filing date), provided that the filing of the required registration statement may be delayed pending the finalization of required financial statements associated with the acquisition which are required to be included in the registration statement; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | To provide the Sellers certain piggy-back registration and participation rights associated with future registration statements and/or future registered offerings we may undertake in the future, subject to certain exclusions and exceptions. 

 
We agreed to bear the full costs of such registration statements and to keep them effective indefinitely, as long as any Seller holds any shares of common stock included thereunder.
 
Nominating and Voting Agreement
 
Separately, at Closing, we and each of the Sellers entered into a Nominating and Voting Agreement. Pursuant to the Nominating and Voting Agreement, we were required to (a) increase the number of directors on the Board of Directors (the “Board”) from five to seven, (b) cause the resignation or removal of a member from the Board, and (c) cause to be appointed to the Board one person designated by each of Lubbock, Synergy and Banner (each a “Nominating Party”), with the result that, as of the Closing Date, the Board was required to be comprised of: (i) one person designated by each Nominating Party (each a “Seller Nominated Person”) and (ii) four current members of the Board, all of which such required actions under the Nominating and Voting Agreement were taken prior to or contemporaneously with the Closing.
 
The Nominating and Voting Agreement also provides that each Nominating Party will have the right to designate for nomination to the Board two nominees (for so long as such Nominating Party holds at least 15% of the Company’s outstanding common stock) and one nominee (for so long as such Nominating Party holds at least 5% of the Company’s common stock), for appointment at any stockholder meeting or via any consent to action without meeting of the stockholders of the Company. The Nominating and Voting Agreement also requires the Board to include such nominees in the slate of directors up for appointment at each meeting of stockholders where directors will be appointed, and take other actions to ensure that such persons are elected to the Board by the stockholders of the Company.
 
If any Nominating Party’s Seller Nominated Party ceases for any reason to serve on the Board, such Seller Nominated Party will be provided the right to appoint another person to the Board, who shall be appointed to the Board pursuant to the power to fill vacancies given to the Board without a stockholder vote, by the Bylaws of the Company.
 
Notwithstanding the above, no person is required to be included as a nominee for election or appointment to the Board in the event such person is a Disqualified Person. A “Disqualified Person” is a person for whom the Board reasonably determines that the nomination, election or appointment of, or retention of such person on the Board, as applicable, would (a) violate the listing rules of Nasdaq or the rules and regulations of the SEC, (b) due to such person’s past, affiliations or otherwise, negatively affect the reputation of the Company, negatively affect the Company’s ability to complete future transactions, or disqualify the Company from undertaking any offering under applicable securities laws, or (c) violate the fiduciary duties that the Board owes to the Company or its stockholders; provided, however, that if the Board reasonably determines that any person is unfit for service on the Board for the reasons set forth above, then the applicable Nominating Party is entitled to designate an alternative or replacement person.

Further notwithstanding the above, the non-Nominating Party directors and Nominating Party directors are required to be apportioned between ‘independent’ and non-’independent’ directors as required by the rules of Nasdaq such that the Company continues in compliance with applicable Nasdaq rules.
 
At all times when Lubbock holds at least 5% of the Company’s outstanding common stock and its appointee is John A. Weinzierl, each Seller is required to instruct its appointee on the Board to vote in favor of appointing Mr. Weinzierl as Chairman of the Board.
 
During the term of the Nominating and Voting Agreement, each Seller agreed to vote all securities of the Company which they hold in any manner as may be necessary to nominate and elect (and, if applicable, maintain in office) as a member of the Company’s Board, each of the Seller Nominated Persons and further to not remove any Seller Nominated Persons, unless such person is a Disqualified Person.
 
The agreement continues in effect from the Closing Date until the earlier of (a) the date mutually agreed by all the parties (the Company and each of the Sellers); and (b) the date that no Seller owns at least 5% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company; subject to certain rights and obligations which survive termination. Once a Seller’s ownership drops below 5% of the Company’s outstanding common stock, it no longer has any right to nominate any person under the Nominating and Voting Agreement, even if such Seller’s ownership increases above 5% of the Company’s common stock in the future.
 
Transition Services Agreement
 
On the Closing Date, the Company entered into a Transition Services Agreement (“TSA”) with Banner, for Banner to provide services in connection with the assets acquired from Banner (“Services”), including (i) land and lease administration services; (ii) revenue and expense accounting services, accounts payable payment services, accounts receivable collection services, division order services, marketing services, and related records services; (iii) information technology services, including all supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and other field data capture, collection and reporting systems, and computer networks and other technology systems related to, or necessary in the operation of, the assets; (iv) tax services; and (v) other transition services and cooperation sufficient to enable the Company to set up its operations and assume the operation of the assets acquired from Banner.
 
The transition services are to be provided to the Company on an independent contractor basis. The TSA will remain in place for six months (through June 30, 2022), extendable on a month-to-month basis thereafter at the Company’s request, subject to the terms of the agreement, and the Company will pay Banner $90,000 per month during the duration of the TSA, and reimburse Banner for reasonable and documented expenses incurred by Banner, including the cost to maintain insurance. The TSA includes mutual confidentiality and indemnification obligations with the Company agreeing to indemnify Banner in respect to certain third-party claims arising from the Services and Banner agreeing to indemnify the Company against third party claims arising from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of Banner or its related parties.

Credit Agreement; Hedging Agreement and Related Transactions
 
Credit Agreement
 
Separate from the Closing, but also effective on January 5, 2022, the Company entered into a five-year credit agreement (“Credit Agreement”) with Firstbank Southwest (“Firstbank”) as administrative agent for one or more lenders (the “Lenders”), which provides for a revolving line of credit with an initial borrowing base of $15 million, subject to adjustment as discussed in the Credit Agreement, and redetermination on a semi-annual basis on April 1st and October 1st of each year, or in the interim as provided in the Credit Agreement, and a maximum credit amount of $100,000,000. The borrowing base is subject to semi-annual redeterminations in April and October of each year until maturity, based on the value of the Company’s proved oil and natural gas reserves in accordance with the lenders’ customary procedures and practices.
 
Under the Credit Agreement, revolving loans may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed until January 5, 2026, when all outstanding amounts must be repaid.
 
Under the Credit Agreement, the Company may request letters of credit for its own account or the account of its subsidiaries (which are guarantors of the debt), in an amount equal to no more than 10% of the total borrowing base then in effect.
 
Amounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement are to be evidenced by promissory notes entered into with the Lenders subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement (the “Notes”).
 
Interest on the outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement will accrue at an interest rate equal to (a) the greatest of (i) the prime rate in effect on such day, and (b) the Federal Funds rate in effect on such day (as determined in the Credit Agreement) plus 0.50%, and an applicable margin that ranges between 0.25% to 1.25% depending on utilization of the amount of the borrowing base (the “Applicable Margin”). During the first six months of the term, the applicable margin will be 0.75% regardless of utilization. If the Company fails to deliver a report setting forth its proved oil and natural gas reserves as and when required under the Credit Agreement, the applicable margin will be 1.25% regardless of utilization.
 
In the event that certain event of defaults (as described under the Credit Agreement) occur, the outstanding amounts will bear an additional 2.00% interest per annum. Accrued interest on each revolving loan is payable in arrears on the last day of each March, June, September and December.
 
The Company generally has the right to make prepayments of the borrowings at any time without penalty or premium under the Credit Agreement. A commitment fee of 0.50% accrues on the average daily amount of the unused portion of the borrowing base (currently $11,500,000) is payable in arrears on the last business day of March, June, September and December of each year and on the maturity date. Letter of credit fees will include a participation fee to the administrative agent accruing interest at the Applicable Margin as loans under the Credit Agreement, based on the average daily amount of the letter of credits issued by such Lender, as calculated under the terms of the Credit Agreement, and a fronting fee accruing interest at 0.125% will be paid to each bank issuing letters of credit under the Credit Agreement, as well as certain other standard fees of issuing banks. Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and including the last business day of March, June, September and December of each year are payable on such last business day. We also agreed to pay certain fees to the agent, including an upfront fee of 0.75% of the initial borrowing base.
 

10
--


We are also required to make certain mandatory repayments under the Credit Agreement, in the event the borrowing base decreases below the aggregate amount of loans made by the Lenders and/or if as of the last business day of any calendar month, certain required debt ratios required under the Credit Agreement are not met, there are outstanding amounts owed to the Lenders, and the Company has consolidated cash on hand in excess of $5 million, and in some cases we are also required to pay cash to the agent to be held as collateral.
 
The Credit Agreement contains customary indemnification requirements, representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants applicable to the Loan Parties and their subsidiaries, including, among other things, restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers, dispositions, prepayment of other indebtedness, transactions with affiliates, and dividends and other distributions. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains financial covenants, tested quarterly, that limit the Company’s ratio of total debt to EBITDAX (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to 3:1 and require its ratio of consolidated current assets to consolidated current liabilities (as each is described in the Credit Agreement) to remain at 1:1 or higher.
 
The proceeds of the borrowings under the Credit Agreement must be used to provide funds for working capital, to finance capital expenditures, for the acquisition and development by the Company and its subsidiaries of certain oil and natural gas producing properties, to refinance existing debt, and for general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries.
 
The Credit Agreement also requires us to hedge certain oil and gas volumes, based on our utilization of the borrowing base, which hedging will be accomplished pursuant to the ISDA Master Agreement, discussed below.
 
Events of default under the Credit Agreement include: the failure by the Company to timely make payments due under the Credit Agreement; material misrepresentations or misstatements in any representation or warranty of any of the Loan Parties; failure by the Company or any of its subsidiaries to comply with their covenants under the Credit Agreement and other related agreements, subject in certain cases to rights to cure; certain defaults under other indebtedness of the Loan Parties; insolvency or bankruptcy-related events with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries; certain unsatisfied judgments against the Company or any of its subsidiaries in an amount in excess of $500,000; if the Credit Agreement or certain related agreements or security interests created by them cease to be in full force and effect; certain ERISA-related events reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries; and the occurrence of a change in control, each as discussed in greater detail in the Credit Agreement, and subject to certain cure rights. If any event of default occurs and is continuing under the Credit Agreement, the Lenders may terminate their commitments, and may require the Company and its subsidiaries to repay outstanding debt and/or to provide a cash deposit as additional security for outstanding letters of credit.
 
A total of $3.5 million was borrowed under the Credit Agreement, immediately upon the entry into such Credit Agreement, which was evidenced by a Note dated January 5, 2022. Such $3.5 million was immediately used to repay $3.3 million of debt owed by Banner which the Company agreed to assume as part of the Closing.
 
Guaranty and Security Agreement
 
The Company’s obligations under the Credit Agreement and any secured swap agreement or secured cash management agreement are jointly and severally guaranteed by each of the Company’s existing and subsequently acquired or organized subsidiaries, including the Company’s current subsidiaries, Energy One LLC, New Horizon Resources LLC and BOG – OSAGE, LLC (together with the Company, the “Loan Parties”) pursuant to an Unconditional Guaranty dated February 5, 2022 (the “Guaranty”) and are secured, subject to customary permitted liens and other agreed upon exceptions, by (i) all of the equity interests of each Loan Party and (ii) a perfected security interest in and mortgages on all tangible and intangible assets of each Loan Party (i.e., are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company). The security interests are set forth in a series of deeds of trust covering each of the Company’s oil and natural gas producing properties and in a Security Agreement dated February 5, 2022, covering the equity interests and other tangible and intangible assets of each Loan Party (the “Security Agreement”).
 
The Guaranty and Security Agreement requires the Company and its subsidiaries to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants, including, without limitation, covenants relating to maintaining perfected security interests, providing information and documentation to Firstbank, complying with contractual obligations relating to the collateral, restricting the sale and issuance of securities by their respective subsidiaries and providing Firstbank with access to the collateral.

Intercreditor Agreement
 
In connection with the Credit Agreement, Firstbank, as administrative agent for the Lenders and as collateral agent on behalf of all creditors, and Nextera Energy Marketing, LLC (“NextEra”), together with one or more future swap counterparties (“Swap Counterparties”) entered into an intercreditor agreement (“Intercreditor Agreement”), dated February 5, 2022, which was acknowledged by the Company. Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the parties agreed that the Loan Parties’ obligations under the Credit Agreement and their obligations to the Swap Counterparties in connection with certain acceptable swap agreements (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), and discussed below under “ISDA Master Agreement”, would be pari passu and ratably secured by the deeds of trust securing the Company’s obligations under the Credit Agreement, and permitted such swap agreements under the terms of the Credit Agreement, subject to certain requirements. The Intercreditor Agreement terminates upon payment in full of all amounts owed under the Credit Agreement and the Master Agreement Schedule, discussed below.
ISDA Master Agreement
 
Separate from the Closing, but also effective on January 5, 2022, the Company and NextEra entered into an International Swap Dealers Association, Inc. Master Agreement (“Master Agreement”), facilitating the Company to enter into derivative and/or hedging transactions (“Transactions”) to manage the risk associated with its business relating to commodity prices. The derivative and hedging transactions will be governed by the Master Agreement, including the related Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement (“Schedule”). The Company’s obligations to NextEra under the Master Agreement are secured by the collateral which secures the loans under the Credit Agreement on a pari passu and pro rata basis with the principal of such loans. The structure of the Transactions may include swaps, caps, floors, collars, locks, forwards and options.
 
Certain events of default will apply to the Transactions under the ISDA Master Agreement and Schedule, including, but not limited to, failure to pay or deliver, breach of the agreement, credit support default, cross-defaults and misrepresentation.
 
NextEra’s obligations under the Master Agreement and Schedule were guaranteed by NextEra Energy Capital Holdings, Inc. pursuant to a Guaranty, which is included as Exhibit I to the Master Agreement.
 
The Company’s entry into and the obligations of the Company under the Master Agreement and Schedule were required conditions to the Closing of the Banner Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which the Company was required to assume and novate certain hedges of Banner which had a mark to market loss of approximately $3.1 million as of the Closing Date.
 
Activities with Operating Partners
 
We own working interests in a geographically and geologically diverse portfolio of oil-weighted prospects in varying stages of exploration and development. Prospect stages range from prospect origination, including geologic and geophysical mapping, to leasing, exploratory drilling and development. The Company participates in the prospect stages either for its own account or with prospective partners to enlarge its oil and natural gas lease ownership base.
 
Each of the operators of our principal prospects has a substantial technical staff. We believe that these arrangements currently allow us to deliver value to our shareholders without having to build the full staff of geologists, engineers and land personnel required to work on diverse projects involving horizontal drilling in North Dakota, New Mexico, South Texas and West Texas. However, consistent with industry practice with smaller independent oil and natural gas companies, we also utilize specialized consultants with local expertise, as needed.
 
Presented below is a description of significant oil and natural gas projects with our key operating partners, which constitute the majority of our production and reserves. In addition to the below descriptions, the Company holds interests in non-operated wells with several operators, which constitute the remainder of our PV-10.
 

12
--

Williston Basin, North Dakota (Bakken and Three Forks Formations)
 
Zavanna, LLC. We have an interest in 18 wells with Zavanna, LLC (“Zavanna”) with an average working interest of approximately 16% and net revenue interests ranging from 2% to 31%. These properties operated by Zavanna comprised approximately 37.5% of the PV-10 related to our oil and natural gas reserves at December 31, 2021.
Permian Basin, New Mexico
 
Cimarex Energy Company. We have an interest in three wells Cimarex Energy Company operates in Lea County, New Mexico. We currently hold a 43.8% working interest and a 36.3% net revenue interest in these wells. All of the leases are currently held by production and comprised approximately 8.0% of the PV-10 related to our oil and natural gas reserves at December 31, 2021.
Texas (Gulf Coast)
 
Contango Resources Inc. We have an interest in multiple wells with Contango Resources Inc., which is the operator of the Leona River and Booth Tortuga prospects in which we currently hold a 29% working interest and a 22.4% net revenue interest. All of the leases are currently held by production and comprised approximately 6.9% of the PV-10 related to our oil and natural gas reserves at December 31, 2021.
Environmental Laws and Regulations
 
Environmental Matters
 
Our operations and properties are subject to extensive and changing federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment, and relating to safety and health. The recent trend in environmental legislation and regulation generally is toward stricter standards, and this trend will likely continue. These laws and regulations may:

● | Require the acquisition of a permit or other authorization before construction or drilling commences and for certain other activities; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Limit or prohibit construction, drilling and other activities on certain lands lying within wilderness and other protected areas; and 
● | Impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations. 

 
The permits required for our operations may be subject to revocation, modification and renewal by issuing authorities. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce their regulations, and violations are subject to fines or injunctions, or both. In the opinion of management, we are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations and have no material commitments for capital expenditures to comply with existing environmental requirements. Nevertheless, changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or in interpretations thereof could have a significant impact on our company, as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general.
 
Comprehensive Environmental, Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). CERCLA and comparable state statutes impose strict, joint and several liabilities on owners and operators of sites and on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of “hazardous substances” found at such sites. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, persons who disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at the site, and any person who accepted hazardous substances for transportation to the site. CERCLA authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), state environmental agencies, and in some cases third parties, to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. It is not uncommon for the neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. Although CERCLA currently excludes petroleum from its definition of “hazardous substance,” state laws affecting our operations may impose clean-up liability relating to petroleum and petroleum related products.
 

13
--


Waste Handling. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal, and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Under the auspices of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Drilling fluids, produced water, and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development, and production of oil or gas are currently regulated under RCRA’s non-hazardous waste provisions. However, it is possible that certain oil and gas exploration and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. Any such change could result in an increase in our costs to manage and dispose of wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.
 
Endangered Species. The federal Endangered Species Act and analogous state laws regulate activities that could have an adverse effect on threatened or endangered species. Some of our operations are conducted in areas where protected species are known to exist. In these areas, we may be obligated to develop and implement plans to avoid potential adverse impacts on protected species, and we may be prohibited from conducting operations in certain locations or during certain seasons, such as breeding and nesting seasons, when our operations could have an adverse effect on these species. It is also possible that a federal or state agency could order a complete halt to activities in certain locations if it is determined that such activities may have a serious adverse effect on a protected species. The presence of a protected species in areas where we perform drilling, completion, and production activities could impair our ability to timely complete well drilling and development and could adversely affect our future production from those areas.
 
Air Emissions. The federal Clean Air Act (the “CAA”) and state air pollution laws and regulations provide a framework for national, state and local efforts to protect air quality. Applicable to our business and operations, the CAA regulates emissions, discharges and controls with respect to oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations. The CAA includes New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) for the oil and natural gas source category to address emissions of sulfur dioxide, methane and volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”) from new and modified oil and natural gas production, processing and transmission sources as well as a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities. Further, the CAA regulates the emissions from compressors, dehydrators, storage tanks and other production equipment as well as leak detection for natural gas processing plants. These rules have required a number of modifications to the operations of our third-party operating partners, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions from compressors.
 
In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions at specified sources. For example, under the EPA’s NSPS and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAP”) regulations, since January 1, 2015, owners and operators of hydraulically fractured natural gas wells (wells drilled principally for the production of natural gas) have been required to use so-called “green completion” technology to recover natural gas that formerly would have been flared or vented. In 2016, the EPA issued additional rules for the oil and natural gas industry to reduce emissions of methane, VOCs and other compounds. These rules apply to certain sources of air emissions that were constructed, reconstructed, or modified after September 18, 2015. Among other things, the new rules impose green completion requirements on new hydraulically fractured or re-fractured oil wells and leak detection and repair requirements at well sites. We do not expect that the currently applicable NSPS or NESHAP requirements will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, any future laws and their implementing regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions, impose stringent air permitting requirements or require us to use specific equipment or technologies to control emissions.
 
On December 17, 2014, the EPA proposed to revise and lower the existing 75 pounds per barrel (ppb) National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”) for ozone under the CAA to a range within 65-70 ppb. On October 1, 2015, the EPA finalized a rule that lowered the standard to 70 ppb. This lowered ozone NAAQS could result in an expansion of ozone nonattainment areas across the United States, including areas in which we operate. Oil and natural gas operations in ozone nonattainment areas likely would be subject to more stringent emission controls, emission offset requirements for new sources, and increased permitting delays and costs. This could require a number of modifications to our operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions from our wells.
 
Permit and related compliance obligations under the CAA, each state’s development and promulgation of regulatory programs to comport with federal requirements, as well as changes to state implementation plans for controlling air emissions in regional non-attainment or near-non-attainment areas, may require oil and natural gas exploration and production operators to incur future capital and operating expenditures in connection with the addition or modification of existing air emission control equipment and strategies.


Climate change. In December 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other GHGs endanger public health and welfare, and as a result, began adopting and implementing a comprehensive suite of regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA. While President Trump’s administration had taken steps to rescind or review many of these regulations, President Biden’s administration has actively been reviewing those actions and taking steps to strengthen and expand the regulations, specifically targeting, among other things, the regulation of methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. Legislative and regulatory initiatives related to climate change could have an adverse effect on our operations and the demand for oil and gas. Please refer to Risk Factors - Risks Related to Governmental Regulations- Oil and natural gas operations are subject to environmental, legislative and regulatory initiatives that can materially adversely affect the timing and cost of operations and the demand for crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs. In Part I, Item 1A of this Report. In addition to the effects of regulation, the meteorological and physical effects of global climate change could pose additional risks to our operations, including physical damage risks associated with more frequent, more intensive storms, flooding, and wildfires, and could adversely affect the demand for our products.
 
Water discharges. The federal Water Pollution Control Act (“Clean Water Act”) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States and states. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA, or analogous state agencies. This includes the discharge of certain storm water without a permit which requires periodic monitoring and sampling. In addition, the Clean Water Act regulates wastewater generated by unconventional oil and gas operations during the hydraulic fracturing process and discharged to publicly-owned wastewater treatment facilities. The Clean Water Act also prohibits discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, including wetlands, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, or a state, if the state has assumed authority to issue such permits. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil, and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations.

Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”). OPA addresses prevention, containment and cleanup, and liability associated with oil pollution. OPA applies to vessels, offshore platforms, and onshore facilities. OPA subjects owners of such facilities to strict liability for containment and removal costs, natural resource damages, and certain other consequences of oil spills into jurisdictional waters. Any unpermitted release of petroleum or other pollutants from our operations could result in governmental penalties and civil liability.
 
Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”). The disposal of oil and natural gas wastes into underground injection wells are subject to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, as amended, and analogous state laws. The SDWA’s Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) Program establishes requirements for permitting, testing, monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting of injection well activities as well as a prohibition against the migration of fluid containing any contaminants into underground sources of drinking water. State programs may have analogous permitting and operational requirements. In response to concerns related to increased seismic activity in the vicinity of injection wells, regulators in some states are considering additional requirements related to seismic safety. For example, the Texas Railroad Commission (“RRC”) adopted new oil and natural gas permit rules in October 2014 for wells used to dispose of saltwater and other fluids resulting from the production of oil and natural gas in order to address these seismic activity concerns within the state. Among other things, the rules require companies seeking permits for disposal wells to provide seismic activity data in permit applications, provide for more frequent monitoring and reporting for certain wells, and allow the RRC to modify, suspend, or terminate permits on grounds that a disposal well is likely to be, or determined to be, causing seismic activity. If new regulatory initiatives are implemented that restrict or prohibit the use of underground injection wells in areas where we rely upon the use of such wells in our operations, our costs to operate may significantly increase and our ability to continue production may be delayed or limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. In addition, any leakage from the subsurface portions of the injection wells may cause degradation of freshwater, potentially resulting in cancellation of operations of a well, issuance of fines and penalties from governmental agencies, incurrence of expenditures for remediation of the affected resource, and imposition of liability by third parties for property damages and personal injury.
 
The Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”). OSHA and comparable state laws regulate the protection of the health and safety of employees. The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established workplace safety standards that provide guidelines for maintaining a safe workplace in light of potential hazards, such as employee exposure to hazardous substances. OSHA also requires employee training and maintenance of records, and the OSHA hazard communication standard and EPA community right-to-know regulations under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 require that we organize and disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations.
 
Hydraulic Fracturing. Substantially all of the oil and natural gas production in which we have interests is developed from unconventional sources that require hydraulic fracturing as part of the completion process. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight shale formations. We routinely utilize hydraulic fracturing techniques in most of our drilling and completion programs. The process involves the injection of water, sand, and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions. However, even on private lands, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives under the Safe Drinking Water Act’s Underground Injection Control Program. The federal Safe Drinking Water Act protects the quality of the nation’s public drinking water through the adoption of drinking water standards and controlling the injection of waste fluids, including saltwater disposal fluids, into below-ground formations that may adversely affect drinking water sources.
 
Increased regulation and scrutiny on oil and gas activities involving hydraulic fracturing techniques could potentially lead to a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells, an increase in compliance costs, delays, and changes in federal income tax laws, all of which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. As new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted at the state and local levels, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing becomes regulated at the federal level as a result of federal legislation or regulatory initiatives by the EPA or other federal agencies, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting requirements, which could result in additional permitting delays and potential increases in costs. Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could also reduce the amount of oil and gas that we are ultimately able to produce from our reserves.

We believe the trend in local, state, and federal environmental legislation and regulation will continue toward stricter standards, particularly under President Biden’s administration. While we believe we are in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations applicable to our current operations and that our continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations, we cannot give any assurance that we will not be adversely affected in the future.
 
National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”). Oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities on federal lands, including tribal lands and lands administered by the BLM, are subject to NEPA. NEPA requires federal agencies, including the BLM, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an Environmental Assessment that assesses the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement that may be made available for public review and comment. If we were to conduct any exploration and production activities on federal lands in the future, those activities may need to obtain governmental permits that are subject to the requirements of NEPA. This process has the potential to delay, limit or increase the cost of developing oil and natural gas projects. Authorizations under NEPA are also subject to protest, appeal or litigation, any or all of which may delay or halt projects. Many of our activities and those of our third-party operating partners are covered under categorical exclusions which results in a shorter NEPA review process, however, the impact of the NEPA review process on our activities and those of our third-party operating partners is uncertain at this time and could lead to delays and increased costs that could materially adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.
 
Research and Development
 
No research and development expenditures have been incurred during the past three fiscal years.
 
Insurance
 
We have general liability and property insurance coverage in amounts we deem sufficient for our business operations, consisting of property loss insurance on all major assets equal to the approximate replacement value of the assets and additional liability and operator’s and control of well insurance for our oil and natural gas operations and drilling programs. We do not have insurance coverage for the lost revenues associated with a business interruption, nor do we have coverage for the loss of our oil and natural gas reserves. There is no guarantee that any insurance coverage would be sufficient to protect the value of our assets or to fully cover any losses sustained. Payment of substantial liabilities in excess of coverage could require diversion of internal capital away from regular business, which could result in curtailment of projected future operations.
Human Capital
 
As of March 22, 2022, we had 23 full-time employees and 2 part-time employees, none of whom were subject to a collective bargaining agreement. In addition, we utilize several consultants on an as-needed basis. As a result of the acquisition completed on January 5, 2022, we added 13 employees. In addition, in 2022, we increased our corporate accounting, engineering and administrative staff. We recognize that our employees are our most valuable assets and drive the way we pursue our short-term and long-term goals. To attract and retain talent we promote:

● | integrity and ethical behavior in the conduct of our business; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | environmental, health and safety priorities: 
● | prioritizing the success of others and the team; 
● | communicating why we do what we do and how every employee contributes to achieving success; and 
● | support for team members’ professional and personal development. 

 
The core values of integrity and ethical behavior are the pillars of our culture, and as a result, the health and safety of our employees and contractors is our highest priority. All employees are responsible for upholding Company-wide standards and values. We have policies designed to promote ethical conduct and integrity, that employees are required to read and acknowledge.

We strive to provide competitive, performance-based compensation and benefits to our employees, including market-competitive pay, and various healthcare, retirement, and other benefit packages The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors oversees our compensation programs and designs programs to incentivize achievement of our corporate strategy and the matters of importance to our stakeholders.
 
Forward Plan 
 
In 2022 and beyond, we intend to seek additional opportunities in the oil and natural gas sector, including but not limited to further acquisition of assets, participation with current and new industry partners in their exploration and development projects, acquisition of existing companies, and the purchase of oil producing assets. In addition, we plan to grow production by performing workovers on operated idle wells acquired in 2022 to return them back to production.
Business Strategy
 
Key elements of our business strategy include:
 

● | Deploy our Capital in a Conservative and Strategic Manner and Review Opportunities to Bolster our Liquidity. In the current industry environment, maintaining liquidity is critical. Therefore, we will be highly selective in the projects we evaluate and will review opportunities to bolster our liquidity and financial position through various means. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Evaluate and Pursue Value-Enhancing Transactions. We will continuously evaluate strategic alternative opportunities that we believe will enhance shareholder value. 

Industry Operating Environment
 
The oil and natural gas industry is affected by many factors that we generally cannot control. Government regulations, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy, climate change and the environment, can have a significant impact on operations and profitability. Significant factors that will impact oil prices in the current fiscal year and future periods include the Russian war with Ukraine, inflation, political and social developments in the Middle East, demand in Asian and European markets, and the extent to which members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) and other oil exporting nations manage oil supply through export quotas. Natural gas prices are generally determined by North American supply and demand and are also affected by imports and exports of liquefied natural gas. Weather also has a significant impact on demand for natural gas since natural gas is a primary heating source.
 
In early March 2020, there was an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, which causes the infectious disease known as COVID-19, which resulted in a drastic decline in global demand of certain mineral and energy products including crude oil. As a result of the lower demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the oversupply of crude oil, spot and future prices of crude oil fell to historic lows during the second quarter of 2020, which remained depressed for the majority of 2020. Operators in North Dakota’s Williston Basin responded by significantly decreasing drilling and completion activity and shutting in or curtailing production from a significant number of producing wells, all of which have since come back online. Lower oil and natural gas prices not only decrease our revenues, but an extended decline in oil or gas prices may materially and adversely affect our future business, financial position, cash flows, results of operations, liquidity, ability to finance planned capital expenditures and the oil and natural gas reserves that we can economically produce.
 
Additionally, the outbreak of COVID-19 and decreases in commodity prices, resulting from oversupply, government-imposed travel restrictions, and other constraints on economic activity created disruptions and volatility in the global marketplace for oil and gas. While demand and commodity prices recovered and are back to, or greater than pre-pandemic levels, our financial results may continue to be depressed in future quarters. These factors may adversely impact the supply and demand for oil and gas and our ability to produce and transport oil and gas and perform operations at and on our properties. This uncertainty also affects management’s accounting estimates and assumptions, which could result in greater variability in a variety of areas that depend on these estimates and assumptions, including investments, receivables, and forward-looking guidance.

Development
 
During 2022, our development activities will be focused on returning idle wells acquired in the January 2022 acquisition to production and participating in drilling projects with our joint interest operators.


Until acquiring operated properties during 2020, we primarily engaged in oil and natural gas exploration and production by participating, on a proportionate basis, alongside third-party interests in wells drilled and completed in spacing units that include our acreage. We typically depend on drilling partners to propose, permit and initiate the drilling of wells. Prior to commencing drilling, our partners are required to provide all owners of oil, natural gas and mineral interests within the designated spacing unit the opportunity to participate in the drilling costs and revenues of the well to the extent of their pro-rata share of such interest within the spacing unit. We assess each drilling opportunity on a case-by-case basis and participate in wells that we expect to meet our return thresholds based upon our estimates of ultimate recoverable oil and natural gas, expected oil and natural gas prices, expertise of the operator, and completed well cost from each project, as well as other factors. Historically, we have participated pursuant to our working interest in a vast majority of the wells proposed to us.
 
Seasonality
 
Winter weather conditions and lease stipulations can limit or temporarily halt our drilling and producing activities and other oil and natural gas operations and those of our operating partners. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay or temporarily halt the operations of our operating partners and materially increase our operating and capital costs. Such seasonal anomalies can also pose challenges for meeting well drilling objectives and may increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel during the spring and summer months, which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay or temporarily halt our operations and those of our operating partners.
Governmental Regulation
 
Our operations are subject to various rules, regulations and limitations impacting the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry as a whole.
 
Regulation of Oil and Natural Gas Production
 
Our oil and natural gas exploration, production and related operations are subject to extensive rules and regulations promulgated by federal, state, tribal and local authorities and agencies. For example, North Dakota requires permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations and imposes other requirements relating to the exploration and production of oil and natural gas. Many states may also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, the sourcing and disposal of water used in the process of drilling, the flaring of natural gas, completion and abandonment, the establishment of maximum rates of production from wells, and the regulation of spacing, plugging and abandonment of such wells. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. Moreover, many states impose a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within their jurisdictions. Failure to comply with any such rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry will most likely increase our cost of doing business and may affect our profitability. Because such rules and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws. Significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, currently unforeseen environmental incidents may occur or past non-compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered. Therefore, we are unable to predict the future costs or impact of compliance. Additional proposals and proceedings that affect the oil and natural gas industry are regularly considered by Congress, the states, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) and the courts. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective.

Regulation of Transportation of Oil
 
Sales of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices. Nevertheless, Congress could re-enact price controls in the future. Our sales of crude oil are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The transportation of oil by common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate and access regulation. The FERC regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act. In general, interstate oil pipeline rates must be cost-based, although settlement rates agreed to by all shippers are permitted and market-based rates may be permitted in certain circumstances. Effective January 1, 1995, the FERC implemented regulations establishing an indexing system (based on inflation) for transportation rates for oil pipelines that allows a pipeline to increase its rates annually up to a prescribed ceiling, without making a cost-of-service filing. Every five years, the FERC reviews the appropriateness of the index level in relation to changes in industry costs. 
 
Intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates varies from state to state. Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors that are similarly situated.
 
Further, interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a non-discriminatory basis. Under this open access standard, common carriers must offer service to all similarly situated shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. When oil pipelines operate at full capacity, access is generally governed by pro-rationing provisions set forth in the pipelines’ published tariffs. Accordingly, we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our similarly situated competitors.
 
Regulation of Transportation and Sales of Natural Gas
 
Historically, the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce has been regulated by the FERC under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (“NGA”), the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (“NGPA”) and regulations issued under those statutes. In the past, the federal government has regulated the prices at which natural gas could be sold. While sales by producers of natural gas can currently be made at market prices, Congress could reenact price controls in the future.
 
Onshore gathering services, which occur upstream of FERC jurisdictional transmission services, are regulated by the states. Although the FERC has set forth a general test for determining whether facilities perform a non-jurisdictional gathering function or a jurisdictional transmission function, the FERC’s determinations as to the classification of facilities is done on a case-by-case basis. State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements. Although such regulation has not generally been affirmatively applied by state agencies, natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny in the future.
 
Intrastate natural gas transportation and facilities are also subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies, and certain transportation services provided by intrastate pipelines are also regulated by FERC. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state. Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers within the state on a comparable basis, we believe that the regulation of similarly situated intrastate natural gas transportation in any states in which we operate and ship natural gas on an intrastate basis will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors. Like the regulation of interstate transportation rates, the regulation of intrastate transportation rates affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas.

Marketing, Major Customers and Delivery Commitments
 
Markets for oil and natural gas are volatile and are subject to wide fluctuations depending on numerous factors beyond our control, including seasonality, economic conditions, foreign imports, political conditions in other energy producing countries, OPEC market actions, and domestic government regulations and policies. All of our production is marketed by our industry partners for our benefit and is sold to competing buyers, including large oil refining companies and independent marketers. Substantially all of our production is sold pursuant to agreements with pricing based on prevailing commodity prices, subject to adjustment for regional differentials and similar factors. We had no material delivery commitments as of December 31, 2021.
Competition
 
The oil and natural gas business is highly competitive in the search for and acquisition of additional reserves and in the sale of oil and natural gas. Our competitors principally consist of major and intermediate-sized integrated oil and natural gas companies, independent oil and natural gas companies and individual producers and operators. Specifically, we compete for property acquisitions and our operating partners compete for the equipment and labor required to operate and develop our properties. Our competitors may be able to pay more for properties and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties than we can. Ultimately, our future success will depend on our ability to develop or acquire additional reserves at costs that allow us to remain competitive.
