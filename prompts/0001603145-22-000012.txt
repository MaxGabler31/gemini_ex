Item 1.  Business 
NEP is a growth-oriented limited partnership formed to acquire, manage and own contracted clean energy projects with stable long-term cash flows. At December 31, 2021, NEP owned a controlling, non-economic general partner interest and a 45.3% limited partner interest in NEP OpCo. Through NEP OpCo, NEP owns a portfolio of contracted renewable generation assets consisting of wind, solar and solar-plus-storage projects, as well as contracted natural gas pipeline assets.
NEP expects to take advantage of trends in the North American energy industry, including the addition of clean energy projects as aging or uneconomic generation facilities are phased out, increased demand from utilities for renewable energy to meet state RPS requirements and improving competitiveness of energy generated from wind and solar projects relative to energy generated using other fuels. NEP plans to focus on high-quality, long-lived projects operating under long-term contracts that are expected to produce stable long-term cash flows. NEP believes its cash flow profile, geographic, technological and resource diversity, operational excellence and cost-efficient business model provide NEP with a significant competitive advantage and enable NEP to execute its business strategy.

At December 31, 2021, NEP's ownership interests in clean energy projects and pipelines in operation, excluding its non-economic ownership interests, are as follows:

Each of the renewable energy projects sells substantially all of its output and related renewable energy attributes pursuant to long-term, fixed price PPAs to various counterparties. The pipelines primarily operate under long-term firm transportation contracts under which counterparties pay for a fixed amount of capacity that is reserved by the counterparties and also generate revenues based on the volume of natural gas transported on the pipelines. In 2021, NEP derived approximately 12% and 14% of its consolidated revenues from its contracts with Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Mex Gas Supply S.L., respectively. See Item 1A for a discussion of risks related to NEP's counterparties and business relationship with Pemex.
NEP, NEP OpCo and NEP OpCo GP are parties to the MSA with an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of NEE, under which operational, management and administrative services are provided to NEP under the direction of the board, including managing NEP’s day-to-day affairs and providing individuals to act as NEP’s executive officers, in addition to those services that are provided under O&M agreements and ASAs between NEER subsidiaries and NEP subsidiaries. NEP OpCo pays NEE an annual management fee and makes certain payments to NEE based on the achievement by NEP OpCo of certain target quarterly distribution levels to its common unitholders (incentive distribution rights fees, or IDRs). See Note 14 – Management Services Agreement. In addition, certain subsidiaries of NEP are parties to transportation agreements and a fuel management agreement with a subsidiary of NEE. See Note 14 – Transportation and Fuel Management Agreements.
NEP and NEP OpCo are parties to a right of first refusal (ROFR) agreement with NEER granting NEER and its subsidiaries (other than NEP OpCo and its subsidiaries) a right of first refusal on any proposed sale of any NEP OpCo ROFR assets. Pursuant to the terms of the ROFR agreement, prior to engaging in any negotiation regarding any sale of a NEP OpCo ROFR asset, NEP OpCo must first negotiate for 30 days with NEER to attempt to reach an agreement on a sale of such asset to NEER or any of its subsidiaries. If an agreement is not reached within the initial 30-day period, NEP OpCo will be able to negotiate with any third party for the sale of such asset for a 30-day period. Prior to accepting any third-party offer, NEP OpCo will be required to restart negotiations with NEER for the next 30 days and will not be permitted to sell the applicable asset to the third party making the offer if NEER agrees to terms substantially consistent with those proposed by such third party. If, by the end of the 30-day period, NEER and NEP OpCo have not reached an agreement, NEP OpCo will have the right to sell such asset to such third party within 30 days.
INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
Renewable Energy Industry
Growth in renewable energy is largely attributable to the increasing cost competitiveness of renewable energy driven primarily by government incentives, RPS, improving technology and declining installation costs and the impact of environmental rules and regulations on other types of generation.
U.S. federal, state and local governments have established various incentives to support the development of renewable energy projects. These incentives make the development of renewable energy projects more competitive by providing accelerated depreciation, tax credits or grants for a portion of the development costs, decreasing the costs associated with developing such projects or creating demand for renewable energy assets through RPS programs. In addition, RPS provide incentives to utilities to contract for energy generated from renewable energy providers.
Renewable energy technology has improved and installation costs have declined meaningfully in recent years. Wind technology is improving as a result of taller towers, longer blades and more efficient energy conversion equipment, which allow wind projects to more efficiently capture wind resource and produce more energy. Solar technology is also improving as solar cell efficiencies improve and solar equipment costs decline. Wind and solar energy generation are becoming the lowest cost energy generation technologies in many regions in the U.S. which is expected to lead to significant growth in the renewable energy industry.
Natural Gas Pipeline Transportation Industry
The U.S. natural gas pipeline network is a highly integrated network that transports natural gas through approximately 3 million miles of mainline and other pipelines that link natural gas production areas and storage facilities with consumers. Based on data compiled through October 27, 2021 by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, there were U.S. natural gas pipeline capacity additions of approximately 22 Bcf/d and 10 Bcf/d in 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
Policy Incentives
Policy incentives in the U.S. have the effect of making the development of renewable energy projects more competitive by providing credits for a portion of the development costs or by providing favorable contract prices. A loss of or reduction in such incentives could decrease the attractiveness of renewable energy projects to developers, including NEE, which could reduce NEP's future acquisition opportunities. Such a loss or reduction could also reduce NEP's willingness to pursue or develop certain renewable energy projects due to higher operating costs or decreased revenues.
U.S. federal, state and local governments have established various incentives to support the development of renewable energy projects. These incentives include accelerated tax depreciation, PTCs, ITCs, cash grants, tax abatements and RPS programs. Pursuant to the U.S. federal Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS), wind and solar projects are substantially depreciated for tax purposes over a five-year period even though the useful life of such projects is generally much longer than five years. 
Owners of utility-scale wind facilities are eligible to claim an income tax credit (the PTC, or an ITC in lieu of the PTC) upon initially achieving commercial operation. The PTC is determined based on the amount of electricity produced by the wind facility during the first ten years of commercial operation. This incentive was created under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and has been extended several times. Alternatively, an ITC equal to 30% of the cost of a wind facility may be claimed in lieu of the PTC. Owners of solar facilities are eligible to claim a 30% ITC for new solar facilities. In order to qualify for the PTC (or an ITC in lieu of the PTC) for wind or an ITC for solar, construction of a facility must begin before a specified date and the taxpayer must maintain a continuous program of construction or continuous efforts to advance the project to completion. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued guidance establishing a safe harbor for the continuous efforts and continuous construction requirements. The current guidance provides that the requirements for safe harbor will generally be satisfied if the facility is placed in service no more than six years after the year in which construction of the facility began for a facility that began construction in 2016 through 2019, five years for a facility that began construction in 2020 and four years for a facility that begins construction in 2021 and beyond. Retrofitted wind facilities may re-qualify for PTCs or ITCs pursuant to the 5% safe harbor for the begin construction requirement, as long as the cost basis of the new investment is at least 80% of the facility’s total fair value. 
Tax credits for qualifying wind and solar projects are subject to the following schedule.

 | Year construction of project begins(a)
 | 2016 | | 2017 | | 2018 | 2019 | | 2020 | | 2021 | 2022 | | 2023 | | 2024 and beyond

______________________
(a)    To qualify for the PTC or an ITC, a project must be placed in service no more than six years after the year in which construction of the project began for a facility that began construction in 2016 – 2019, five years for a facility that began construction in 2020 and four years for a facility that begins construction in 2021 and beyond.
(b)    Percentage of the full PTC available for wind projects that began construction during the applicable year.
(c)    Percentage of eligible project costs that can be claimed as ITC by wind projects that began construction during the applicable year.
(d)    Percentage of eligible project costs that can be claimed as ITC by solar projects that begin construction during the applicable year. ITC is limited to 10% for solar projects not placed in service before January 1, 2026.
RPS, currently in place in certain states, require electricity providers in the state to meet a certain percentage of their retail sales with energy from renewable sources. Additionally, other states in the U.S. have set renewable energy goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from historic levels. NEP believes that these standards and goals will create incremental demand for renewable energy in the future. 
BUSINESS STRATEGY
NEP's primary business objective is to acquire ownership interests in contracted clean energy projects from NEER or third parties that allow NEP to increase its cash distributions to the holders of its common units over time. To achieve this objective, NEP intends to execute the following business strategy:
•Focus on contracted clean energy projects. NEP intends to focus on long-term contracted clean energy projects with newer and more reliable technology, lower operating costs and relatively stable cash flows, subject to seasonal variances, consistent with the characteristics of its portfolio.
•Focus on North America. NEP intends to focus its investments in North America, where it believes industry trends present significant opportunities to acquire contracted clean energy projects in diverse regions and favorable locations. By focusing on North America, NEP believes it will be able to take advantage of NEE’s long-standing industry relationships, knowledge and experience.
•Maintain a sound capital structure and financial flexibility. NEP and its subsidiaries have utilized various financing structures including limited-recourse project-level financings, the sale of differential membership interests and equity interests in certain subsidiaries, preferred units, convertible senior unsecured notes and senior unsecured notes, as well as revolving credit facilities and term loans. NEP believes its cash flow profile, its credit rating, the long-term nature of its contracts and its ability to raise capital provide flexibility for optimizing its capital structure and increasing distributions. NEP intends to continually evaluate opportunities to finance future acquisitions or refinance its existing debt and seeks to limit recourse, optimize leverage, hedge exposure, extend maturities and increase cash distributions to common unitholders over the long term.
•Take advantage of NEER’s operational excellence to maintain the value of the projects in NEP's portfolio. NEER provides O&M, administrative and management services to NEP's projects pursuant to the MSA and other agreements. Through these agreements, NEP benefits from the operational expertise that NEER currently provides across its entire portfolio. NEP expects that these services will maximize the operational efficiencies of its portfolio.
•Grow NEP's business and cash distributions through selective acquisitions of ownership interests in operating projects or projects under construction. NEP intends to focus on acquiring ownership interests in clean energy projects in operation or under construction, maintaining a disciplined investment approach and taking advantage of opportunities to acquire ownership interests in additional projects from NEER and third parties in the future, which it believes will enable it to increase cash distributions to its common unitholders over the long term. 
COMPETITION
Wholesale power generation is a capital-intensive, commodity-driven business with numerous industry participants. While NEP's renewable energy projects are currently contracted, NEP may compete in the future primarily on the bases of price and terms, but also believes the green attributes of NEP's renewable energy generation assets, among other strengths discussed below, are competitive advantages. Wholesale power generation is a regional business that is highly fragmented relative to many other commodity industries and diverse in terms of industry structure. As such, there is a wide variation in terms of the capabilities, resources, nature and identity of the companies NEP competes with depending on the market. In wholesale markets, customers' needs are met through a variety of means, including long-term bilateral contracts, standardized bilateral products such as full requirements service and customized supply and risk management services. 
In addition, NEP competes with other companies to acquire well-developed projects with projected stable cash flows. NEP believes its primary competitors for opportunities in North America are regulated utilities, developers, IPPs, pension funds and private equity funds.
NEP's pipeline projects face competition with respect to retaining and obtaining firm transportation contracts and compete with other pipeline companies based on location, capacity, price and reliability.
NEP believes that it is well-positioned to execute its strategy and increase cash distributions to its common unitholders over the long term based on the following competitive strengths:
NEE management and operational expertise. NEP believes it benefits from NEE’s experience, operational excellence and cost-efficient operations. Through the MSA and other agreements with NEE and its subsidiaries, NEP's projects will receive the same benefits and expertise that NEE currently provides across its entire portfolio.
Contracted projects with stable cash flows. The contracted nature of NEP's portfolio of projects supports expected stable long-term cash flows. The renewable energy projects in NEP's portfolio are contracted under long-term contracts that generally provide for fixed price payments over the contract term. Revenues from the Texas pipeline projects are primarily generated from firm transportation contracts based on the fixed amount of capacity reserved by the counterparties. The renewable energy projects and pipeline projects have a total weighted average remaining contract term of approximately 14 years at December 31, 2021 based on expected contributions to cash available for distribution. 
New, well-maintained portfolio. Approximately 76% of NEP's portfolio, based on expected contributions to cash available for distribution, of renewable energy projects and pipelines have been operating for fewer than eight years. Because NEP's portfolio of projects is relatively new and uses what NEP believes is industry-leading technology, NEP believes that it will achieve the expected levels of availability and performance without incurring unexpected operating and maintenance costs.
Geographic and resource diversification. NEP's portfolio is geographically diverse across the U.S. In addition, NEP's portfolio includes wind and solar generation facilities, solar-plus-storage projects and natural gas pipelines. A diverse portfolio tends to reduce the magnitude of individual project or regional deviations from historical resource conditions, providing a more stable stream of cash flows over the long term than a non-diversified portfolio. In addition, NEP believes the geographic diversity of its portfolio helps minimize the impact of adverse regulatory conditions in particular jurisdictions.
Competitiveness of renewable energy. Renewable energy technology has improved and installation costs have declined meaningfully in recent years. Wind technology has improved as a result of taller towers, longer blades and more efficient energy conversion equipment, which allow wind projects to more efficiently capture wind resource and produce more energy. Solar technology is also improving as solar cell efficiencies improve and installation costs are declining.
REGULATION
NEP's projects and pipelines are subject to regulation by a number of U.S. federal, state and other organizations, including, but not limited to, the following:
•the FERC, which oversees the acquisition and disposition of generation, transmission and other facilities, transmission of electricity and natural gas in interstate commerce and wholesale purchases and sales of electric energy, among other things;
•the NERC, which, through its regional entities, establishes and enforces mandatory reliability standards, subject to approval by the FERC, to ensure the reliability of the U.S. electric transmission and generation system and to prevent major system blackouts; 
•the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which has the responsibility to maintain and enforce national standards under a variety of environmental laws. The EPA also works with industries and all levels of government, including federal and state governments, in a wide variety of voluntary pollution prevention programs and energy conservation efforts;
•various agencies in Texas and Pennsylvania, which oversee safety, environmental and certain aspects of rates and transportation related to the pipeline projects; and
•the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and the Texas Railroad Commission's Pipeline Safety Division, which, among other things, oversee the safety of natural gas pipelines.
In addition, NEP is subject to environmental laws and regulations described in the Environmental Matters section below.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
NEP is subject to environmental laws and regulations, including federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations, for the ongoing operations, siting and construction of its facilities. Complying with these environmental laws and regulations could result in, among other things, changes in the design and operation of existing facilities and changes or delays in the location, design, construction and operation of any new facilities and failure to comply could result in fines and penalties. The following is a discussion of certain existing rules, some of which could potentially have a material effect on NEP and its subsidiaries.
Avian/Bat Regulations and Wind Turbine Siting Guidelines. NEP is subject to numerous environmental regulations and guidelines related to threatened and endangered species and/or their habitats, as well as avian and bat species, for the ongoing operations of its facilities. The environmental laws in the U.S., including, among others, the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act provide for the protection of migratory birds, eagles and bats and endangered species of birds and bats and/or their habitats. Regulations have been adopted under some of these laws that contain provisions that allow the owner/operator of a facility to apply for a permit to undertake specific activities, including those associated with certain siting decisions, construction activities and operations. In addition to regulations, voluntary wind turbine siting guidelines established by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service set forth siting, monitoring and coordination protocols that are designed to support wind development in the U.S. while also protecting both birds and bats and/or their habitats. These guidelines include provisions for specific monitoring and study conditions which need to be met in order for projects to be in adherence with these voluntary guidelines. Complying with these environmental regulations and adhering to the provisions set forth in the voluntary wind turbine siting guidelines could result in additional costs or reduced revenues at existing or new wind and solar facilities and transmission and distribution facilities at NEP and, in the case of environmental laws and regulations, failure to comply could result in fines, penalties, criminal sanctions or injunctions.
HUMAN CAPITAL
NEP does not have any employees and relies solely on employees of affiliates of the manager under the MSA, including employees of NEE and NEER, to serve as officers of NEP. See further discussion of the MSA and other payments to NEE in Note 14.
WEBSITE ACCESS TO SEC FILINGS
NEP makes its SEC filings, including the annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8‑K, and any amendments to those reports, available free of charge on NEP's internet website, www.nexteraenergypartners.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after those documents are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.
