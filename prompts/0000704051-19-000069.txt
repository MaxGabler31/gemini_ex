ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
General
Legg Mason is a global asset management firm that operates through nine independent asset management subsidiaries. Acting through our asset management subsidiaries, each of which generally markets its products and services under its own brand name, we provide investment management and related products and services to institutional and individual clients, company-sponsored mutual funds and other investment vehicles. We offer these products and services directly and through various financial intermediaries.
 Legg Mason, Inc. was incorporated in Maryland in 1981 to serve as a holding company for its various subsidiaries. The predecessor companies to Legg Mason trace back to Legg & Co., a Maryland-based broker-dealer formed in 1899. Our subsequent growth occurred primarily through internal expansion and the acquisition of asset management and broker-dealer firms. In December 2005, Legg Mason completed a transaction in which it sold its primary broker-dealer businesses to concentrate on the asset management industry. Legg Mason is an independent, publicly traded company, with no single majority shareholder and 90% of its Board of Directors consists of independent directors as of March 31, 2019.
Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this Report to “we,” “us,” “our” and “Legg Mason” include Legg Mason, Inc. and its predecessors and subsidiaries, and the term “asset managers” refers to the asset management businesses operated by our subsidiaries. References to “fiscal year 2019” or other fiscal years refer to the 12-month period ended March 31st of the year specified.
Business Developments During the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2019
The asset management industry continues to experience disruption and challenges, including a shift to lower-fee passively managed products, increased fee pressure (including pressure arising from the shift to lower-fee passive products), regulatory changes, an increasing and changing role of technology in asset management services, the constant introduction of new products and services and the consolidation of financial services firms through mergers and acquisitions. In light of these challenges, during fiscal year 2019, we continued to focus on expanding client choice, identifying and implementing opportunities for collaboration with and across affiliates and providing expanded client access through the enhancement of our centralized distribution function and the development of alternative and innovative distribution options through: 

• | Continued expansion of the range of vehicles and strategies available to Legg Mason’s client base, focusing on ETFs, alternatives, separately managed accounts and multi-asset class solutions;


• | Completing a strategic investment plus a bolt-on acquisition and continuing to evaluate other strategic opportunities for investment or bolt-on acquisitions:


• | Launching a strategic restructuring to further enhance efficiencies and promote growth:


• | Continuing to develop the alternative distribution strategies platform;


• | Continuing evolution of a growth plan to deepen coverage and improve sales force effectiveness; and


• | Continuing to build and enhance relationships with affiliates and strengthening key distribution relationships with partners in the U.S. and internationally.

See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for the revenues, net income and assets of Legg Mason, which operates in a single reportable business segment. See Notes 12 and 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for our revenues generated in, and our long-lived assets (consisting primarily of intangible assets and goodwill) located in, each of the principal geographic regions in which we conduct business. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for our deferred tax assets in the aggregate for all countries in which we operate.
Recent Developments
In February 2019, we announced a plan to implement a new global operating platform to combine certain affiliate and parent company operations. Since the announcement, our plans have evolved to focus on our corporate operations as 
2

part of a broader strategic restructuring to reduce costs. We have also expanded the areas included in the restructuring to include broader corporate and distribution functions as well as efficiency initiatives at certain smaller affiliates that operate outside of revenue-sharing arrangements. We expect to incur aggregate strategic restructuring costs in the range of $130 million to $150 million, substantially all of which will be incurred through March 2021. We expect the strategic restructuring will result in future annual cost savings of $100 million or more on a run rate basis by the end of fiscal 2020. See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
On May 20, 2019, we increased the size of our Board of Directors (the “Board”) from ten to 12 directors and appointed each of Nelson Peltz and Edward P. Garden as a director, effective immediately. Mr. Peltz is the Chief Executive Officer and a Founding Partner, and Mr. Garden is the Chief Investment Officer and a Founding Partner, of Trian Fund Management, L.P. (“Trian”), an investment management firm. Trian beneficially owns approximately 4.5% of the Company’s outstanding common stock. The Company and Trian have agreed that Mr. Peltz, Mr. Garden and a third independent director, to be identified by Trian and approved by the Board, will be included in the Company’s slate of nominees for election to the Board at the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders.
Business Overview
Our corporate structure combines our nine asset managers, each with diverse perspectives and specialized expertise across asset classes and strategies, with institutional distribution capabilities at each of our asset managers and a centralized global distribution platform focusing on retail distribution. Acting through our independent investment managers with diverse expertise in equity, fixed income, alternative and liquidity investments, we provide investment management and related services to institutional and individual clients, company-sponsored investment funds and retail separately managed account programs globally to help seek better financial outcomes by expanding choice across investment strategies, vehicles and investor access. Operating from asset management offices located in the United States, the United Kingdom and a number of other countries worldwide, we deliver our investment capabilities through varied products and vehicles and via multiple points of access, including directly and through various financial intermediaries. Our investment advisory services include discretionary and non-discretionary management of separate investment accounts in numerous investment styles for institutional and individual investors. Our investment products include proprietary mutual funds ranging from money market and other liquidity products to fixed income, equity and alternative funds managed in a wide variety of investment styles. We also offer other domestic and offshore funds to both retail and institutional investors, privately placed real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds-of-hedge funds.
Our asset managers primarily earn revenues by charging fees for managing the investment assets of clients. Fees are typically calculated as a percentage of the value of AUM; accordingly, the fee income of each of our asset managers will typically increase or decrease as its average AUM increases or decreases. In addition, the fees on our AUM vary with the type of account managed, the amount of assets in the account, the asset manager and the type of client. Increases in AUM generally result from inflows of additional assets from new and existing clients and from appreciation in the value of client assets (including investment income earned on client assets and due to changes in currency exchange rates). Conversely, decreases in AUM generally result from client redemptions and declines in the value of client assets. Our AUM may also increase as a result of business acquisitions or decrease as a result of dispositions.
We earn performance fees under certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks or hurdle rates. The largest portion of our performance fees is earned based on 12-month performance periods that end in differing quarters during the year, with a portion based on quarterly performance periods. We also earn performance fees on alternative products that are earned at the end of varying investment periods or in multiple-year intervals. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, of our $2.9 billion, $3.1 billion and $2.9 billion in total revenues, $84.9 billion, $227.8 million and $108.3 million, respectively, represented performance fees. During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, $49.0 million, $108.8 million, and $60.8 million, respectively, of these performance fees were earned by Clarion Partners on assets invested with them prior to the closing of our acquisition of Clarion Partners in April 2016 and were passed through as compensation to Clarion Partners’ management team pursuant to the terms of the Clarion Partners acquisition agreement. Exclusive of AUM eligible to earn performance fees passed through as compensation to Clarion Partners’ management team, as of March 31, 2019, approximately 8% of our total long-term AUM was in accounts that were eligible to pay performance fees at some point during the fiscal year.

As of March 31 of each of the last three fiscal years, we had the following aggregate AUM (in billions, except percentages):
 | AssetsUnderManagement | | EquityAssets | | % of Total inEquity Assets | | FixedIncomeAssets | % of Total inFixed IncomeAssets | | Alternative Assets | | % of Total in AlternativeAssets | LiquidityAssets | | % of Total in LiquidityAssets
2019 | $ | 758.0 | | | $ | 202.0 | | 27 | % | | $ | 419.6 | | 55 | % | $ | 68.6 | | 9 | % | | $ | 67.8 | 9 | %
2018 | 754.1 | | | 203.0 | | | 27 | | 422.3 | | | 56 | | 66.1 | | 9 | | 62.7 | | | 8 | 
2017 | 728.4 | | | 179.8 | | | 25 | | 394.3 | | | 54 | | 67.9 | | 9 | | 86.4 | | | 12 | 

From time to time, our reported equity, fixed income or alternative assets under management may exclude assets that we are retained to manage on a short-term or temporary basis. We currently define Alternative Assets as all AUM managed by Clarion Partners, EnTrust Global, RARE Infrastructure or a small private equity business prior to its sale on March 31, 2017. 
We believe that market conditions and our investment performance are critical elements in our attempts to grow our AUM and business. When securities or real estate markets are increasing, our AUM will tend to increase because of market performance, resulting in additional asset management revenues. Similarly, if we can produce positive investment results and maintain competitive fee levels, our AUM will tend to increase. In addition, favorable market conditions or strong relative investment performance can result in increased inflows in assets from existing and new clients. Conversely, in periods when securities or real estate markets are weak or declining, or when we have not maintained competitive fee levels or have produced poor investment performance, absolute or relative to benchmarks or peers, it is likely to be more difficult to grow our AUM and business and, in such periods, our AUM and business results may decline.
We generally manage the accounts of our clients pursuant to written investment management or sub-advisory contracts between one of our independent asset managers and the client (or a financial intermediary acting on behalf of the client). These contracts usually specify, among other things, the management fees to be paid to the asset manager and the investment strategy for the account, and are generally terminable by either party on relatively short notice. Typically, investment management contracts may not be assigned (including as a result of transactions, such as a direct or indirect change of control of the asset manager, if it would constitute an assignment under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 or other applicable regulatory requirements) without the prior consent of the client. When the asset management client is a U.S. registered mutual fund or closed-end fund (whether or not one of our asset managers has sponsored the fund), the fund's board of directors generally must annually approve the investment management contract, and any material changes to the contract, and the fund’s board of directors and fund shareholders must approve any assignment of the contract (including as a result of transactions that would constitute an assignment under the Investment Company Act of 1940).
We conduct the majority of our business through our independent asset managers. Our asset managers are individual businesses, each of which generally focuses on a portion of the asset management industry in terms of the types of assets managed (primarily alternatives, equity or fixed income), and differ in the types of products and services offered, the investment styles utilized, the distribution channels used, and the types and geographic locations of its clients. Each asset manager is housed in one or more different subsidiaries. As of March 31, 2019, we directly or indirectly owned all of the voting equity of Brandywine Global Investment Management, ClearBridge Investments, Martin Currie, QS Investors and Western Asset Management Company. Clarion Partners is 18% owned by its management team, EnTrust Global is 35% owned by its chief executive officer, Royce is 24.5% owned by its management team and RARE was 15% owned by its management team. After March 31, 2019, we purchased the outstanding equity interests in RARE that we did not already own. In addition, the management teams at Clarion Partners and ClearBridge Investments each owns non-voting equity interests in their respective businesses which provide them with participation in any increase in the value of the business (subject to appropriate valuation discounts).
Each of our asset managers is generally operated as a separate business that typically markets its products and services under its own brand name, with certain distribution functions being provided by our global distribution platform in many cases. Consistent with this approach, we have in place revenue sharing arrangements with certain of our asset managers: Brandywine Global Investment Management, ClearBridge Investments, RARE Infrastructure, Royce & Associates, and Western Asset Management Company, and/or certain of their key officers. Under the terms of these revenue 
4

sharing arrangements, a specified percentage of the asset manager's revenues, net of certain third party distribution and other operating expenses, is required to be distributed to the equity owners of the business, and the balance of the revenues (or net revenues) is retained to pay operating expenses, including salaries and bonuses, but excluding certain expenses such as amortization of acquired intangible assets and excluding income taxes. Specific compensation allocations are determined by the asset manager's management, subject to Legg Mason management approval in certain cases. Although, without renegotiation, the revenue sharing arrangements impede our ability to increase our profit margins from these businesses, we believe these arrangements help us retain and attract talented employees. In addition, the revenue sharing arrangements provide management of these asset managers with incentives to (i) grow the asset managers' revenues, since management is able to participate in the revenue growth through the portion that is retained; and (ii) control operating expenses, which will increase the portion of the revenues retained that is available to fund growth initiatives and for incentive compensation. In addition, the chief executive officer of EnTrust Global and the management teams of Clarion Partners, ClearBridge and Royce have significant equity interests in the applicable company, which helps to align the interests of the management of those affiliates with the interests of our shareholders.

Our asset managers provide a wide range of investment advisory services to separately managed account clients, including institutional clients such as pension and other retirement plans, corporations, insurance companies, endowments and foundations and governments, as well as retail clients such as high net worth individuals and families, and retail separately managed account programs.

United States Funds
Mutual Funds
Our U.S. mutual funds primarily consist of two groups of proprietary mutual and closed-end funds (the “Legg Mason Funds” and the "Royce Funds"). The Legg Mason Funds invest in a wide range of domestic and international equity and fixed income securities utilizing various investment styles, including several money market funds.

Our ETFs are managed by ClearBridge Investments, Martin Currie, QS Investors, RARE Infrastructure, Royce and Western Asset Management.

Following applicable exchange approvals, investors will be able to invest in actively-managed ETFs that do not disclose individual holdings on a daily basis, yet trade and operate in a manner that is similar to traditional ETFs. 
Private Funds
In addition to our U.S. mutual funds and ETFs, our asset managers sponsor and manage various unregistered, or “private” funds that are made available to qualified U.S. or non-U.S. investors, depending upon the product. Private funds are pooled investment vehicles that are exempt from local regulation and that are typically offered to sophisticated, high net worth investors, corporations, sovereign wealth funds, public pension plans and other pooled investment vehicles.

Global, the Brazil-domiciled funds managed by Western Asset Management or the privately placed real estate funds offered by Clarion Partners.
Retail Separately Managed Account Programs
We are a leading provider of asset management services to retail separately managed account programs, commonly known as managed account or wrap programs. These programs typically allow securities brokers or other financial intermediaries to offer their clients the opportunity to choose from a number of asset management services pursuing different investment strategies provided by one or more asset managers, and generally charge an all-inclusive fee that covers asset management, trade execution, asset allocation and custodial and administrative services. We provide investment management services through more than 111 retail separately managed account programs sponsored by various financial institutions.
Distribution
Our centralized global distribution group, Legg Mason Global Distribution, consists of the U.S. Distribution Group and the International Distribution Group. The U.S. Distribution Group markets, distributes and supports our U.S. mutual funds, ETFs and retail separately managed account programs. The International Distribution Group markets, distributes and supports our international funds. In general, our U.S. and international sales and marketing teams are housed in separate subsidiaries from our asset managers.
In addition, each of our asset managers has its own sales and marketing teams that distribute its products and services, primarily, in most cases, to institutional investors. The institutional sales and marketing teams of our asset managers distribute asset management services to potential clients, both directly and through consultants. Consultants play a large role in institutional asset management by helping clients select and retain asset managers. Institutional asset management clients and their consultants tend to be highly sophisticated and investment performance-driven.
U.S. Distribution
The U.S. Distribution Group of Legg Mason Global Distribution employs a team of U.S. based sales, marketing and support staff that market, distribute and support our U.S. mutual funds, including the Legg Mason Funds, the Royce Funds, the Clarion Funds and the Legg Mason ETFs. We distribute the Legg Mason Funds directly and through a number of third-party distributors.
The U.S. Distribution Group distributes institutional share classes of the Legg Mason Funds to institutional clients and also distributes variable annuity sub-advisory services provided by our asset managers to insurance companies (including advisory services provided to certain of the Legg Mason Funds that are specifically designed for purchase through variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies offered by participating insurance companies). Our institutional liquidity funds are primarily distributed by Western Asset Management's sales team. The Royce Funds are distributed by Royce’s sales team in addition to the U.S. Distribution Group.
In addition to distributing funds, the wholesalers in Legg Mason Global Distribution also market and support our retail separately managed account program services and the Legg Mason ETFs. These services are provided through programs sponsored by a variety of financial institutions.

International Distribution
The International Distribution Group of Legg Mason Global Distribution employs a team of sales, marketing and support staff that markets, distributes and supports our international funds to individual and institutional investors across Asia (including Australia and Japan), Europe and the Americas. The International Distribution Group has sales teams operating out of distribution offices in 16 cities in 13 countries and distributing our cross border international funds globally and our international local fund ranges in their respective countries. The goal of our International Distribution Group is to be a global partner for firms that utilize or distribute asset management products around the world, but also to be viewed as a local partner through an understanding of the nuances and needs of each local market that they cover. These distributors seek to develop deep distribution relationships with retail banks, private banks, asset managers, fund platforms, pension plans and insurance plans. Our international distribution offices also work with our asset managers on a case-by-case basis to take advantage of preferences for local distributors or to meet regulatory requirements in distributing products and services into their local markets.
Our distribution efforts are not limited to the locations where we have offices, as the International Distribution Group distributes cross border funds in more than 26 countries around the world. This global presence provides Legg Mason with the capabilities to provide a platform of sales, service, marketing and products that can cater to the different distribution dynamics in each of the regions that it covers. Client coverage is local, coordinated across regions, and encompasses multiple distribution channels including broker-dealers, funds-of-funds, asset managers, independent financial advisers, banks, fund platforms, insurance companies and other distribution partners. The extent to which each channel takes precedence in any one market is governed by local market dynamics.
In Australia, our distribution operations distribute local and cross border funds sub-advised by our asset managers primarily to retail investors, pension plans, fund-of-funds managers, insurance companies and government funds/agencies. In Japan, our distribution operations distribute domestic investment funds, cross border funds and institutional separate accounts primarily to the retail market, which includes retail banks, private banks, asset managers, funds platforms and insurance companies.
EnTrust Global's products and services are sold outside the United States to non-U.S. high net worth investors through a network of financial intermediaries by EnTrust Global's distribution operations as well as through our International Distribution Group. In addition, EnTrust Global distributes its products and services to U.S. and international institutions through EnTrust Global's internal distribution teams.
Employees
At March 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we had 3,246, 3,275 and 3,338 employees, respectively. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory. However, competition for experienced asset management personnel is intense and from time to time we may experience a loss of valuable personnel. We recognize the importance to our business of hiring, training and retaining skilled professionals.
Competition
We are engaged in an extremely competitive business and are subject to substantial competition in all aspects of our business. The success of our business depends on numerous factors, including investment style, investment performance, quality of advice, track records, the level of fees, the range of products offered, brand recognition, business reputation, financial strength, the depth and continuity of relationships, distribution relationships and compensation offered to distributors and quality of service. Our competition includes, with respect to one or more aspects of our business, numerous asset management firms and broker-dealers, mutual fund complexes, hedge funds, commercial banks, insurance companies, other asset management companies and other financial institutions. Many of these organizations offer products and services that are similar to, or compete with, those we offer, and many of these organizations have substantially more personnel and greater financial resources than we have. Some of these competitors have proprietary products and distribution channels that make it more difficult for us to compete with them. In addition, many of our competitors have long-standing and established relationships with distributors and clients. The primary competitive factors relating to our business are the quality of advice and services provided to investors, the performance records of that advice and service, the reputation of the company providing the services, the price of services, the products and services offered and distribution relationships 
9

and compensation offered to distributors. We believe that our focus on expanding client choice through a variety of products, vehicles and access enable us to compete effectively in the investment management business. 
Competition in our business periodically has been affected by significant developments in the asset management industry. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to our Asset Management Business - Competition in the Asset Management Industry Could Reduce our Revenues and Net Income.”
Risk Management
We are committed to continually strengthening and refining our risk management approach and believe our risk management efforts, along with the diversity of asset classes and products that we offer, are key factors in our ability to manage through various market cycles. Our risk management approach reaches across Legg Mason and its affiliates and encourages consistent and meaningful conversations about potential risk across the company. 
Regulation
The asset management industry generally, and virtually all aspects of our business, is subject to extensive federal, state and international laws and regulations promulgated by various governments, securities exchanges, central banks and regulatory bodies. Some of these laws and regulations are summarized below and almost all are intended to benefit and protect investment advisory clients and investors in registered and unregistered investment companies. In addition, our distribution activities also may be subject to regulation by international and U.S. federal agencies, self-regulatory organizations and securities commissions in those jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Under these laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisers, investment funds and other individuals and entities have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit the regulated entity or person from conducting business if it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Regulators also have a variety of informal enforcement mechanisms available that could have a significant impact on our business. Due to the extensive laws and regulations to which we are subject, we must devote substantial time, expense and effort to remaining vigilant about, and addressing, legal and regulatory compliance matters. Moreover, regulatory changes in one jurisdiction often affect our business operations in other jurisdictions. Possible sanctions for significant compliance failures include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of investment adviser and other registrations, censures and fines. A regulatory proceeding, regardless of whether it results in a sanction, can require substantial expenditures and can have an adverse effect on our reputation or business.
Regulatory Reform 
We are subject to numerous regulatory reform initiatives around the world. Any such initiative, or any new laws or regulations or changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations, could materially and adversely impact us by leading to business disruptions, requiring us to change certain business practices and exposing us to additional costs (including compliance and legal costs). The rules governing the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies and subsidiaries are very detailed and technical. Accordingly, the discussion below is general in nature, does not purport to be complete and is current only as of the date of this report.
U.S. Executive Order
On February 3, 2017, a U.S. presidential executive order (the “Executive Order”) articulated certain core principles for regulating the U.S. financial system and directed the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the “U.S. Treasury”) to report to the President the extent to which existing laws, treaties, rules, regulations and policies promote, support or inhibit the federal regulation of the U.S. financial system in a manner consistent with the core principles. The Treasury has issued four reports in response to the Executive Order (the “Treasury Reports”), which include a number of recommendations, the majority of which require further legislative or regulatory action in order to be implemented, that may affect our business or operations. The scope and potential impact of any regulatory changes resulting from the Executive Order and the Treasury Reports are unclear and we will continue to monitor the potential impact of the Executive Order on our business.

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was signed into law in the United States. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the adoption of extensive regulations and numerous regulatory decisions, many of which have been adopted and others of which will be forthcoming. We have implemented programs to address certain regulations adopted under Dodd-Frank, as well as financial reforms that have been introduced as part of the SEC’s investment company modernization initiatives. As certain limited aspects of Dodd-Frank and other rules are still being adopted, and the impact of the rules already adopted will become evident over time, it is not yet possible to predict the ultimate effects that the Dodd-Frank Act or subsequent implementing regulations and decisions will have on our business, financial condition, and operating activities.
Systemically Important Financial Institution (“SIFI”) Review
The Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”). has the authority to designate nonbank financial institutions as SIFIs. FSOC’s most recent statements and actions generally indicate that it is focused on products and activities, rather than designation of entities, in its review of asset managers. The Treasury report on asset management, issued in October 2017, also expressed this view. In addition, in November 2017, Treasury made recommendations concerning the process by which FSOC designates nonbanks as SIFIs, further supporting a products and activities approach to addressing risks in asset management, and in March 2019, FSOC issued proposed interpretive guidance that calls for an “activities based” designation approach. Currently, there are no non-bank financial companies with a SIFI designation. If we are designated as a SIFI, we could become subject to direct supervision by the Federal Reserve System.
Both the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”), working with the International Organization of Securities Commissions (“IOSCO”), and FSOC, are considering potential systemic risk related to asset management and are currently focused on a products and activities approach in their review of asset managers. In January 2017, the FSB announced its Policy Recommendations to Address Structural Vulnerabilities from Asset Management Activities, which concentrates primarily on products and activities and includes 14 recommendations largely focused on liquidity in open-end funds, leverage in funds, operational risk, and securities lending, certain of which IOSCO is expected to engage on in the future. The FSB has indicated that it may develop criteria for designation of nonbank non-insurers in the future to address “residual risks”. Any measures applied in relation to a global systemically important financial institution (“G-SIFI”) designation from the FSB would need to be implemented through existing regulatory processes and procedures by relevant national authorities.
If we or any other asset manager were designated a SIFI or G-SIFI, we could become subject to enhanced prudential, capital, supervisory and other requirements, such as risk-based capital requirements, leverage limits, liquidity requirements, resolution plan and credit exposure report requirements, concentration limits, a contingent capital requirement, enhanced public disclosures, short-term debt limits and overall risk management requirements. Requirements such as these, which were designed to regulate banking institutions, would likely need to be modified to be applicable to an asset manager. No proposals have been made indicating how such measures would be adapted for asset managers.
Securities and Exchange Commission Review of Asset Managers and Mutual Funds
Our business may also be impacted by additional regulatory initiatives by the SEC. In October 2016, the SEC adopted new rules (as well as amendments to existing rules) to modernize the reporting and disclosure of information by registered investment companies, including (i) new monthly and annual reporting requirements for certain U.S. registered funds; (ii) enhanced reporting regimes for investment advisers; these rules, many of which are currently in an implementation period, will increase the Funds’ and our U.S. asset managers’ public reporting and disclosure requirements, which could be costly. Any additional SEC oversight relating to the above, or the introduction of any new reporting, disclosure or control requirements could expose us to additional compliance costs and may require us to change how we operate our business.
Regulation of Exchange-Traded Funds
As part of a focus on financial stability issues and due to the significant growth of this product class over the last few years, regulators globally are examining the potential risks in ETFs, including risks related to transparency, liquidity and structural resiliency. There can be no assurance that structural or regulatory reforms, including potential rulemaking by the SEC, will be implemented in a manner favorable to us, or at all. Depending on the outcome of this renewed regulatory analysis, or any associated structural reforms, ETF products may become subject to increased regulatory scrutiny or 
11

restrictions, which may require us to incur additional compliance and reporting expenses and adversely affect our business. In addition, in June 2018, the SEC issued a proposed rule under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”) known as the “ETF Rule”. The ETF Rule is intended to establish a clear and consistent framework that allows most ETFs operating under the Investment Company Act to come to market without applying for individual exemptive orders. There is no indication as to when or if the final Rule will be adopted.
Regulation of Swaps and Derivatives
The SEC, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) each continue to review the use of futures, swaps and other derivatives. Such reviews could result in regulations that further limit the use of such products by mutual funds. If adopted, these limitations could require us to change certain mutual fund business practices or to register additional entities with the CFTC, which could result in additional costs and/ or restrictions. In December 2015, the SEC proposed a new rule governing the use of derivatives and other financial commitment transactions by investment companies that, if enacted, would represent a fundamental change in the nature of the SEC's regulations governing the use of derivatives and other financial commitment transactions by investment companies. This proposal has the potential to require us to change or restrict certain investment strategies or practices and incur additional costs. There is no indication as to when or if the final Rule will be adopted.
We report certain information about several of our private funds to the SEC and the CFTC, under systemic risk reporting requirements adopted by both agencies. These reporting obligations have required, and will continue to require, investments in people and systems to assure timely and accurate reporting. The rules and regulations applicable to offshore funds, accounts and counterparties will require us to build and implement new compliance monitoring procedures to address the enhanced level of oversight to which we will be subject. These rule changes also introduce new requirements for centrally clearing certain swap, and eventually security-based swap, transactions and for executing certain swap, and eventually security-based swap, transactions on or through CFTC or SEC-registered trading venues. Jurisdictions outside the United States in which we operate also have adopted and implemented, or are in the process of considering, adopting or implementing more pervasive regulation of many elements of the financial services industry, which could further impact us and the broader markets. This includes the implementation of mandated central clearing of swaps in the European Union (“EU”) and the implementation of trade reporting, documentation, central clearing and other requirements in various jurisdictions globally.
SEC’s Proposals to Enhance Protections for Retail Investors
In April 2018, the SEC issued several proposals designed to enhance protections for retail investors in their relationships with financial professionals, including broker-dealers and investment advisers, with respect to both retirement and non-retirement accounts. The issuance of the SEC’s proposals followed a decision handed down in March 2018 by the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals invalidating the U.S. Department of Labor’s “fiduciary rule” and related prohibited transaction class exemptions that had taken effect in June 2017. The most significant of the SEC’s proposals is a proposed “best interest” standard of conduct for broker-dealers and their representatives that would enhance the current “suitability” standard to which broker-dealers are subject by imposing an explicit care obligation and additional disclosure and conflict of interest mitigation or elimination requirements on broker-dealers that make securities recommendations to retail investors. In addition to the SEC’s proposals, several states have adopted or are considering rules that would establish heightened or more explicit standards of conduct for financial intermediaries operating in such states. It is unclear how these state initiatives will be affected once the SEC’s “best interest” standard of conduct for broker-dealers and investment adviser interpretation are finalized and issued. We and our asset managers may be adversely impacted by such SEC and state regulatory initiatives in the retail investment space to the extent that they lead to changes in investment preferences on the part of financial intermediaries and investors and increased pressure on product fees and expenses.
Revised EU Capital Requirements
EU regulators are considering how to design an appropriate capital regime for non-systemically important investment firms as the current regime is based upon banking requirements and has not been materially modified for asset managers. In December 2017, the European Commission published a legislative proposal addressed to the European Parliament and Council for a new Directive and new Regulation on prudential requirements for MiFID investment firms. The new legislative package is currently expected to come into effect in 2020 following agreement between the European Council and Parliament. 
12

Once implemented, any new requirements could result in significant changes to the methodology used to determine the amount of regulatory capital that we are required to hold in the EU.
Revised Retail Consumer Disclosure Requirements
EU legislators have introduced a new “Key Information Document” (“KID”), which is applicable where a retail consumer is sold Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products (“PRIIPs”) and which came into effect in January 2018. The KID must include specific information on costs, risks and performance. We are required to produce a KID for each fund in scope, as well as to make information available to distribution partners who sell these funds in the EU.
British Exit from the European Union
The United Kingdom (“U.K.”) held a referendum in June 2016 in which voters approved an exit from the EU ("Brexit"), which resulted in significant volatility in several international markets. On March 29, 2017, the U.K. delivered notice under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty of its intent to leave the EU, beginning a two-year negotiation period for the U.K. and the 27 remaining members of the EU to reach agreement on the terms of the exit. On March 23, 2018, the UK and the EU leaders endorsed a 21-month transition period that would begin on March 29, 2019 and end on December 31, 2020 and adopted negotiating guidelines on the future EU-UK relationship.  The terms of this transitional arrangement were not binding unless by March 31, 2019, a formal withdrawal agreement between the UK and the European Economic Area (“EEA”)had been negotiated in full and agreed, ratified by the European Parliament and the European Council; and ratified by the UK (which is likely to require an Act of Parliament). The UK and EU leaders were unable to negotiate a formal withdrawal agreement by March 31, 2019 but agreed to extend the Brexit date to October 31, 2019 to provide them more time to complete negotiations. Accordingly, there is substantial uncertainty surrounding the terms upon which the UK will ultimately exit the EU and whether an agreement will be reached by the October 31, 2019 extended Exit Deadline. 
As a result of Brexit, we have, and may continue to, incur additional costs due to having to locate more activities within the EU. There could also be changes to UK and EU immigration policies as a result of Brexit, which could lead to restrictions on the free movement of investment and support staff between the UK and the EU. We will continue to monitor the potential impact of Brexit on our business operations and financial condition and have implemented a number of steps to prepare for various outcomes, including establishing an office in Dublin, Ireland, effecting organizational, governance and operational changes, applying for and receiving licenses and permissions in the EU, and engaging in client communications. These steps, many of which have been time-consuming and costly, are expected to add complexity to our European operations.
Existing U.S. Regulation
The SEC is the federal agency charged with administration of the federal securities laws. Our U.S. asset managers are registered as investment advisers with the SEC, as are several of our international asset managers, and are also required to make notice filings in certain states. We and certain of our affiliates are also currently subject to regulation by the SEC, the Department of Labor (the “DOL”), the Federal Reserve, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), the National Futures Association (“NFA”), the CFTC and other government agencies and regulatory bodies. Certain of our affiliates are also subject to various anti-terrorist financing, privacy, anti-money laundering regulations and economic sanctions laws and regulations established by various agencies.
The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers such as certain of our asset managers, including recordkeeping, operational and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. The Investment Company Act of 1940 imposes stringent governance, compliance, operational, disclosure and related obligations on registered investment companies and their investment advisers and distributors. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser’s registration. Investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations. Non-compliance with the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Investment Company Act of 1940 or other federal and state securities laws and regulations could result in investigations, sanctions, disgorgement, fines and reputational damage.
Our trading and investment activities for client accounts are also regulated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), as well as the rules of various U.S. and non-U.S. securities exchanges and self-regulatory 
13

organizations, including laws governing trading on inside information, market manipulation and a broad number of technical requirements and market regulation policies in the United States and globally.
Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business. Much of the regulation of broker-dealers has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations, principally FINRA. These self-regulatory organizations have adopted extensive regulatory requirements relating to matters such as sales practices, compensation and disclosure, and conduct periodic examinations of member broker-dealers in accordance with rules they have adopted and amended from time to time, subject to approval by the SEC. The SEC, self-regulatory organizations and state securities commissions may conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, suspension or expulsion of a broker- dealer, its officers or registered employees. These administrative proceedings, whether or not resulting in adverse findings, can require substantial expenditures and can have an adverse impact on the reputation or business of a broker-dealer. The principal purpose of regulation and discipline of broker-dealers is the protection of clients and the securities markets, rather than protection of creditors and stockholders of the regulated entity.
In addition, our asset managers also may be subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), and related regulations, particularly insofar as they act as a “fiduciary” or “investment manager” under ERISA with respect to benefit plan clients. ERISA imposes duties on persons who are fiduciaries of ERISA plan clients, and ERISA and related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of ERISA plan and Individual Retirement Account (“IRA”) clients and certain transactions by the fiduciaries (and several other related parties) to such clients. Non-compliance with such ERISA and Internal Revenue Code provisions could result in sanctions, damages, disgorgement, penalties, fines, excise taxes and reputational damage. 
In October 2016, the SEC adopted a new rule (and amendments to existing rules) designed to promote effective liquidity risk management throughout the open-end fund industry, thereby reducing the risk that funds will be unable to meet redemption obligations and mitigating dilution of the interests of fund shareholders. The amendments also seek to enhance disclosure regarding fund liquidity and redemption practices. New rule 22e-4 requires each registered open-end fund, including open-end ETFs (but not including money market funds), to establish a liquidity risk management program. The Commission also adopted amendments to existing rule 22c-1 to permit a fund, under certain circumstances, to use “swing pricing,” the process of adjusting the NAV of a fund’s shares to effectively pass on the costs stemming from shareholder purchase or redemption activity to the shareholders associated with that activity. The funds were required to comply with certain aspects of rule 22e-4 beginning on December 1, 2018, and other aspects of the Rule beginning on June 1, 2019. The SEC delayed the effective date of the amendments that will permit funds to use swing pricing to provide funds, intermediaries and service providers time to work through operational issues. The potential impact of the new and amended rules on the funds and/or our business is unclear.
Existing International Regulation
In our international business, we have fund management, asset management, broker-dealer and distribution subsidiaries domiciled in a number of jurisdictions, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, Hong Kong, Ireland, Singapore, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. These subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of, and to supervision by, governmental authorities and regulatory agencies in each of these jurisdictions, including the Australian Securities & Investments Commission for our Australian businesses, the Comissão de Valores Mobiliários for Brazilian business, the Ontario Securities Commission in Canada for our Canadian business, the Financial Services Agency for our Japanese business, the Securities Futures Commission for our Hong Kong business, the Central Bank of Ireland for our Irish business, the Monetary Authority of Singapore for our Singapore business, the Financial Supervisory Commission for our Taiwan business and the Financial Conduct Authority for our UK business. Our international subsidiaries are also authorized or licensed to offer their products and services in several other countries around the world, and thus are subject to the laws of, and to supervision by, governmental authorities in these additional countries. 
Our offshore proprietary funds are also subject to the laws and regulatory bodies of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled and, for funds listed on exchanges, to the rules of the applicable exchanges. Certain of our funds domiciled in Ireland are also registered for public sale in several countries around the world and are subject to the laws of, and supervision by, the governmental authorities of those countries. All of these non-U.S. governmental authorities generally have broad supervisory and disciplinary powers, including, among others, the power to set minimum capital requirements, to temporarily or permanently revoke the authorization to carry on regulated business, to suspend registered employees, and to invoke censures and fines for both the regulated business and its registered employees.
14

Our European businesses, as well as our Irish and UK proprietary funds, are subject to numerous EU regulations, including mainly the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID”), the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFMD”) and the Undertaking For Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive (“UCITS Directive”).
MiFID 
Certain of our subsidiaries that provide investment services to clients in the EEA must comply with MiFID, which regulates the provision of investment services and activities throughout the EEA. MiFID originally became effective in 2007 and its was enhanced through adoption of MiFID II, which became effective in January 2018. MiFID II built upon many of the initiatives introduced through MiFID and introduced a number of changes that significantly impacted the EU securities and derivatives markets, including (i) enhanced investor protection and governance standards, (ii) prescriptive rules regarding the ability of asset management firms to receive and pay for investment research relating to all asset classes, (iii) rules on the identification and monitoring of target markets for MiFID financial instruments by MiFID investment firms who manufacture and/or distribute such instruments, (iv) enhanced regulation of algorithmic trading, (v) the movement of trading in certain shares and derivatives on to regulated execution venues, (vi) the extension of pre- and post-trade transparency requirements to wider categories of financial instruments, (vii) restrictions on the use of so-called dark pool trading, (viii) the creation of a new type of trading venue called the Organized Trading Facility for non-equity financial instruments, (ix) new commodity derivative position limits and reporting requirements, (x) a move away from vertical silos in execution, clearing and settlement, (xi) an enhanced role for the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) in supervising EU securities and derivatives markets and (xii) new requirements regarding non-EU investment firms’ access to EU financial market. Compliance with MiFID II has increased the costs some of our affiliates, as they have had to start paying for third-party investment research to comply with the MiFID II inducement rules. 

Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive
The AIFMD regulates managers of, and service providers to, a broad range of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) domiciled within and (depending on the precise circumstances) outside the EU. The AIFMD also regulates the marketing of all AIFs inside the EEA. The AIFMD’s scope is broad and, with a few exceptions, covers the management, administration and marketing of AIFs. In particular, the AIFMD introduced new rules governing (1) the registration and licensing of alternative investment fund managers (“AIFMs”), (2) conduct of business (fair treatment of investors, conflicts of interest, remuneration, risk management, valuation, disclosure to investors and regulators) for AIFMs, (3) regulatory capital requirements for AIFMs, (4) the safekeeping of investments (via the mandatory appointment of depositaries and custodians), (5) delegation of certain tasks, including portfolio management and risk management, (6) the marketing of AIFs to professional investors within the EEA via a passport regime, and (7) the use of leverage by AIFMs for all AIFs under management. 
We and our affiliates currently operate licensed AIFMs in Ireland, the UK and France. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, additional expenses related to satisfying these new compliance and disclosure obligations and the associated risk management and reporting requirements.
Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities
The UCITS Directive established a single EU-wide market for the sale of EU domiciled mutual funds (“UCITS funds”) to retail and institutional investors under a common, harmonized set of rules that govern the management, administration and marketing of UCITS funds. We currently operate proprietary UCITS funds in Ireland and the UK that are authorized by the Central Bank of Ireland and the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, respectively. 
The UCITS Directive established rules that govern (1) the registration and licensing of UCITS management companies and UCITS funds, (2) conduct of business (fair treatment of investors, conflicts of interest, remuneration, risk management, valuation, disclosure to investors and regulators) for UCITS, (3) regulatory capital requirements for UCITS management companies, (4) the custody and safekeeping of investments held by UCITS funds, (5) delegation of certain tasks, including portfolio management and risk management, (6) the marketing of UCITS to retail and institutional investors within the EEA via a passport notification regime, and (7) the use of leverage by UCITS.
15

UCITS V, which came into effect in March 2016 with further measures implemented in October 2016, seeks to align the depositary regime, remuneration rules and sanctioning powers of regulators under UCITS with the requirements of the AIFMD. In addition, ESMA guidelines include rules relating to collateral management requirements for UCITS funds concerning collateral received in the context of derivatives using Efficient Portfolio Management (“EPM”) techniques (including securities lending) and over-the-counter derivative transactions. These rules required us to make a series of changes to collateral management arrangements applicable to the EPM of UCITS fund ranges and cause us to incur additional expenses associated with risk management and reporting requirements.
Net Capital Requirements
We have several small, non-clearing broker-dealer subsidiaries that primarily distribute our funds and other asset management products. These broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to net capital rules that mandate that they maintain certain levels of capital. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries that operate outside the United States are subject to net capital or liquidity requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate. For example, in addition to requirements in other jurisdictions, our United Kingdom-based subsidiaries and our Singapore-based subsidiaries are subject to the net capital requirements of the FCA and the Monetary Authority of Singapore, respectively.
