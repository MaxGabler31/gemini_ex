Item 1. Business
Overview
 SurveyMonkey is a leading global provider of survey software products and purpose-built solutions that enable organizations to engage with their key constituents, including their customers, employees and the markets they serve. Our mission is to power curious individuals and organizations to measure, benchmark and act on the opinions that drive success. Our People Powered Data platform has changed the way individuals and organizations of all sizes collect and analyze feedback by making it easy for anyone to create their own online surveys.
Powering the Curious
 Measure
 We empower survey creators to measure constituent feedback and have designed our products to optimize the quality of constituent feedback and maximize response rates. Our library of customizable survey templates and certified questions, designed by a team of survey scientists and further enhanced by our machine learning and AI-based analysis of the millions of surveys on our survey platform, facilitates an easy-to-use and methodologically-sound survey creation process.
Benchmark
 We enable survey creators to analyze and benchmark the data they have collected. Our benchmarking capabilities allow our customers to assess constituent feedback accurately and compare themselves to industry, geographic and functional baselines as well as their own past performance and internal trends. For example, we have an extensive database of Net Promoter Score®, or NPS®, data that covers everything from small organizations to large corporations across a broad range of industries. This database allows our customers to put their NPS results in context relative to the NPS range for organizations in their industry.
Act
 We turn the voices of people into actionable data. Our products enable the filtering and comparing of data by cohort, geography, gender, time period, collection method and more. We help customers weave together data to form a narrative that answers the “why,” which enables them to better understand customer and employee attitudes, predict market appetite and identify meaningful opportunities more quickly. Our products integrate with a customer’s existing system of record, allowing them to implement the insights collected into new and existing workflows. This allows our customers to improve retention and satisfaction of their customers, maximize employee engagement and retention and tailor new products to the demands of prospective customers.
People Powered Data
 Our People Powered Data platform enables conversations at scale to deliver impactful customer, employee and market insights. Our survey platform is used to collect and analyze feedback and drive actionable insight for a broad range of use cases, such as collecting NPS data from customers, measuring employee engagement or conducting market research regarding the attributes of a future product offering.
 We believe the success of organizations large and small, for profit and non-profit, depends substantially on their ability to understand the expectations of, and respond effectively to, the feedback of their key constituents. Businesses that rely solely on intuition and anecdotal experience or traditional market research frequently struggle to anticipate and respond effectively to the evolving needs of their key constituents. As technology has enabled the collection of data at much greater scale and speed, massive amounts of information have been injected into the decision-making process. Organizations have invested heavily in “Big Data” solutions, which are designed to collect and extract information that provides visibility into the observed behavior of key constituents. However, information from Big Data alone is often insufficient to inform decision making as it fails to capture the human voice. The human voice, captured at scale in real-time and in a structured manner is what we refer to as People Powered Data. Big Data captures the “what.” People Powered Data captures the “why.” Understanding the “why” enables organizations to make better decisions that can drive optimal outcomes.

Our products are flexible and easy to use, which enables individuals and organizations of all sizes to collect and analyze People Powered Data. Our survey platform leverages SurveyMonkey Genius, our proprietary, AI-based survey creation assistant, which uses insights extracted from our massive data set to guide and optimize survey creation. For organizations, we offer SurveyMonkey Enterprise, which extends our survey platform with enhanced capabilities including managed user accounts, enterprise-grade security, customized company branding, collaboration capabilities and deep integrations with a broad set of leading software applications that enables users to customize and distribute more tailored questions for their target audience. To serve the needs of more advanced users in organizations of all sizes and across all industries, we offer purpose-built solutions to provide enhanced value across three key areas: customers, employees and the markets that these organization serve. These purpose-built solutions incorporate specific workflows, benchmarking data and preconfigured analyses.
 Our Customers
 Our global customer base is diversified across multiple industries, including financial services, internet, technology, healthcare, media and entertainment, consumer goods and retail, transportation and logistics, government agencies, manufacturing, energy, education, professional services and non-profit organizations. We have over 17.5 million active users, of which 646,727 are paying users in more than 345,000 organizational domains, including paying users in 98% of the Fortune 500. No customer represented more than 1% of our revenue in any of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.
 We define an active user as someone who has registered an account with us or logged in to their account on our survey platform in the last year. Some of our active users may use our products less frequently than others, which may reduce the opportunities to convert such active users to paying users.
 We define an organizational domain as a registered internet domain name held by an organization. As a result, the actual number of unique organizations in which we have paying users may be lower than the number of organizational domains in which we have paying users, because one organization may utilize multiple organizational domains.
 Customer 360
 Customer 360 is our proprietary, signal-based system fueled by our data science models that analyzes usage patterns and signals across our entire user base to identify opportunities to convert active users to paying users, upsell organizations to enterprise accounts, expand existing enterprise relationships and cross-sell purpose-built solutions. Specifically, Customer 360 monitors signals within an organization, such as total active users, number of surveys deployed, total new accounts in the last six months, total paid subscriptions, type of questions asked and user profiles and surfaces prioritized opportunities for our Sales and Success team.
Our Growth Strategy
 The virality of our survey platform is driven by our existing users who introduce SurveyMonkey to new potential users when they send surveys and collaborate with others to share survey results. We continue to focus on retaining our existing paid users, attracting new users, and improving conversion of free users to paid users. We also continue to build new products and enhance the features and functionality of our existing products and solutions. We intend to capitalize on a number of growth opportunities that we believe will accelerate our business, all powered by our massive user base and virality within organizations. Our principal growth strategies include the following:

• | Selling SurveyMonkey products directly to enterprise customers: For the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated approximately 12% of our revenue from customers that had an organizational level agreement with us, and as of December 31, 2018, we had over 3,566 customers with organizational level agreements. Our enterprise sales strategy starts with our brand recognition, our existing user base within organizations, and use of our Customer 360 technology to identify opportunities to convert active users to paying users, upsell organizations to enterprise accounts and cross-sell purpose-built solutions. Through this strategy, we expect to accelerate paying user growth and increase both monetization and retention within organizations.

• | Accelerating growth in self-serve through our SurveyMonkey Teams offerings: In the third quarter of 2018, we introduced SurveyMonkey Teams, which is designed to enable small groups of individuals within an organization to securely and efficiently collaborate in survey creation and analysis. These small groups typically do not require the more advanced features and functionality of our SurveyMonkey Enterprise offering. We also introduced new account verification procedures to enhance account security and ensure one user per account. Through this strategy, we expect to accelerate paying user growth, increase both monetization and retention, and create future upsell opportunities for our SurveyMonkey Enterprise offering.

• | Expanding our business in key international markets: For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, we generated 36%, 35% and 36% of our revenue from customers outside of the United States, and we see significant opportunity for growth internationally. We are investing in marketing our self-serve products and increasing awareness of our brand, developing a more localized product experience and expanding our international data center presence to improve user experience and website speed, and to provide locally hosted data. We are expanding our international workforce in Dublin, Ireland and Ottawa, Canada, across all of our business functions.

 We are focused on research and development to enhance our survey platform, develop new products and features, and improve our infrastructure.
 Sales, Marketing and Customer Success
 We believe the SurveyMonkey brand is globally synonymous with collecting feedback. We benefit from the virality of our platform, where survey creators increase our exposure organically among the respondents to their surveys, and every person who takes a survey is a potential future customer. In addition, our marketing function supports our sales effort targeted at organizations with an existing organic adoption of our survey platform.
 We also conduct direct response marketing and engage and reactivate users through communication channels such as in-product notifications, demand generation campaigns, mobile notifications and lifecycle email marketing. We also create brand awareness through search engine optimization, content marketing, social media marketing, public relations and earned media with partners.
 We augment our self-serve offering with a direct sales team focused on leveraging our existing base of active users. We use Customer 360 to gather insights into our user base to upsell organizations to SurveyMonkey Enterprise and cross-sell purpose-built solutions within organizations. 
 Our survey platform is designed to be easy to adopt and use without the need for support. For those who want support, we have a robust knowledge base and online help center, localized in 16 languages. We also have a dedicated team of experienced and highly-trained survey scientists whose mission is to provide our customers with the methodology they need to collect high quality, unbiased information and to increase survey response rates. 
 Customer 360 also assists our customer success team by estimating the likelihood of churn as well as potential customer adoption challenges.
 Employees
