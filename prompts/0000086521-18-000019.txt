ITEM 1. BUSINESS
This report on Form 10-K includes information for the following separate registrants:

▪ | Sempra Energy and its consolidated entities


▪ | SDG&E and its consolidated VIE


▪ | SoCalGas

References in this report to “we,” “our,” “us,” “our company” and “Sempra Energy Consolidated” are to Sempra Energy and its consolidated entities, collectively, unless otherwise indicated by the context. SDG&E and SoCalGas are collectively referred to as the California Utilities.
OVERVIEW
We are a Fortune 500 energy-services holding company. Our operating units invest in, develop and operate energy infrastructure, and provide electric and gas services to customers in North and South America. We were formed in 1998 through a business combination of Enova and PE, the holding companies of our regulated public utilities in California: SDG&E, which began operations in 1881, and SoCalGas, which began operations in 1867. Since our formation in 1998, we have expanded our investment in regulated utility operations through business acquisitions in 2011 in South America. Additionally, in response to changes in Mexican gas regulation in 1995, we entered the energy infrastructure business in Mexico through what is now known as IEnova, the first energy infrastructure company to be listed on the Mexican Stock Exchange. Our energy infrastructure footprint continues to expand across the U.S., through renewable energy generation projects and LNG and natural gas midstream projects and assets. In August 2017, we entered into the Merger Agreement to acquire an indirect ownership interest in Oncor, a regulated electric distribution and transmission business that operates the largest distribution and transmission system in Texas. We expect the Merger to close in the first half of 2018.
We have two principal operating units, Sempra Utilities and Sempra Infrastructure. Sempra Utilities includes SDG&E, SoCalGas and Sempra South American Utilities. Sempra Infrastructure includes Sempra Mexico, Sempra Renewables and Sempra LNG & Midstream. If the Merger is consummated, our investment in Oncor will be included in a new reportable segment within the Sempra Utilities operating unit.
All references to “Sempra Utilities” and “Sempra Infrastructure” and their respective reportable segments are not intended to refer to any legal entity with the same or similar name. Sempra Infrastructure also owns or owned (during periods presented in this report) regulated utilities that are not included in our references to the Sempra Utilities. We provide financial information about all our reportable segments and about the geographic areas in which we do business in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Business Strategy
Our objective is to increase shareholder value by developing, investing in and operating utilities and long-term-contracted energy infrastructure assets and operating our companies in a safe and reliable manner.
The key components of our strategy include the following disciplined growth platforms:

▪ | U.S. and South American regulated utilities


▪ | U.S. and Mexican energy infrastructure

Operating within these areas, we are focused on generating stable, predictable earnings and cash flows by investing in assets that are primarily regulated or contracted on a long-term basis. We have a robust capital program and take a disciplined approach to deploying this capital to areas that fit our strategy and are designed to create shareholder value.
PENDING ACQUISITION
Energy Future Holdings Corp.
11

On August 21, 2017, Sempra Energy entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, as supplemented by a Waiver Agreement dated October 3, 2017 and an amendment dated February 15, 2018 (together referred to as the Merger Agreement), with Energy Future Holdings Corp., the indirect owner of 80.03 percent of Oncor Electric Delivery Company LLC. Oncor is a regulated electric distribution and transmission business that operates the largest distribution and transmission system in Texas. Following closing, this acquisition will expand our regulated earnings base, while serving as a platform for future growth in the Texas energy market and U.S. Gulf Coast region. Under the Merger Agreement, we will pay the Merger Consideration of $9.45 billion in cash. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement and subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions described below, EFH will be merged with an indirect subsidiary of Sempra Energy, with EFH continuing as the surviving company and an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Sempra Energy (the Merger). The terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement (and a related letter agreement with Oncor) are described in more detail in Sempra Energy’s current reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 25, 2017, August 28, 2017 and October 6, 2017. The amendment dated February 15, 2018 (the Amendment) was made in connection with a settlement agreement, dated as of February 5, 2018, by and among the parties to the Merger Agreement and certain of their subsidiaries. The Amendment amends certain merger terms, in accordance with the settlement agreement, that relate to Oncor dividend payments and certain adjustments to the Merger Consideration. The Amendment is provided in its entirety by reference to Exhibit 2.1.3, filed herewith.
Ring-Fencing
In April 2014, EFH and the substantial majority of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court. The bankruptcy does not include Oncor or Oncor Holdings. Oncor Holdings owns 80.03 percent of Oncor and is indirectly wholly owned by EFH. Certain existing “ring-fencing” measures, governance mechanisms and restrictions will remain in effect following the Merger, which are intended to enhance Oncor Holdings’ and Oncor’s separateness from their owners and to mitigate the risk that these entities would be negatively impacted by the bankruptcy of, or other adverse financial developments affecting, EFH or its other subsidiaries or the owners of EFH. In accordance with the ring-fencing measures and commitments made by Sempra Energy as part of the Joint Application to the PUCT for regulatory approval of the Merger, Sempra Energy and Oncor will be subject to certain restrictions following the Merger. Sempra Energy will not control Oncor Holdings or Oncor, and the ring-fencing measures, governance mechanisms and restrictions, as well as the Stipulation discussed below and elsewhere herein, will limit our ability to direct the management, policies and operations of Oncor Holdings and Oncor, including the deployment or disposition of their assets, declarations of dividends, strategic planning and other important corporate issues and actions. Thus, Oncor Holdings and Oncor will continue to be managed independently (i.e., ring-fenced). Upon consummation of the Merger, although we will consolidate EFH, EFH will continue to account for its ownership in Oncor Holdings as an equity method investment. 
Settlement Agreement Regarding Joint Application 
On October 5, 2017, Sempra Energy and Oncor filed a Joint Application with the PUCT and an application with the FERC seeking approval of the Merger. In December 2017, Sempra Energy and Oncor entered into a comprehensive Stipulation with the Staff of the PUCT, the Office of the Public Utility Counsel, the Steering Committee of Cities Served by Oncor and the Texas Industrial Energy Consumers, reflecting the parties’ settlement of all issues in the PUCT proceeding regarding the Joint Application. Pursuant to the Stipulation, the parties have agreed that Sempra Energy’s acquisition of EFH is in the public interest and will bring substantial benefits. The parties to the Stipulation also agreed to ask the PUCT to approve the Merger, consistent with the governance, regulatory and operating commitments outlined in the Stipulation.
The Stipulation includes regulatory commitments by us, as described below and elsewhere herein, most of which are similar to the regulatory commitments made by us as part of the Joint Application and are consistent with the “ring-fencing” measures currently in place. Sempra Energy and Oncor are entitled to seek modifications of the PUCT order to be entered in the proceedings regarding the Joint Application, which modifications would be subject to PUCT approval.
While Oncor’s Limited Liability Company Agreement generally provides that Oncor will make quarterly distributions to its members equal to the net income of Oncor, subject to certain exceptions, and Oncor Holdings’ Limited Liability Company Agreement generally provides that Oncor Holdings will make quarterly distributions to its member equal to the dividends received by Oncor, subject to certain exceptions, the Stipulation provides a number of circumstances in which Oncor is not permitted to make dividends or other distributions (except for contractual tax payments). In addition, the Stipulation provides that the respective boards of Oncor and Oncor Holdings will control each respective company’s dividend policy (and any changes to such policy must be approved by a majority of its independent directors), issuances of dividends and other distributions (except for contractual tax payments). The Stipulation also provides that the respective boards of Oncor and Oncor Holdings will control each respective company’s debt issuances, capital expenditures, operation and maintenance expenditures, management and service fees, and, subject to certain limitations, appointment or removal of board members.
12

If the PUCT does not accept the Stipulation as presented, or issues an order inconsistent with the terms of the Stipulation, the parties have agreed that any party adversely affected by the alteration has the right to withdraw from the Stipulation and to exercise all rights available to such party under the law.
On January 5, 2018, Oncor, Sempra Energy and Staff of the PUCT jointly filed with the PUCT, requesting that the PUCT approve the Merger consistent with the Stipulation. As of January 31, 2018, all 10 intervening parties, including the Staff of the PUCT, agreed to the Stipulation. 
We discuss the Merger and financing of the Merger Consideration, ring-fencing measures, additional regulatory commitments, governance mechanisms and restrictions, as well as the Stipulation, in Notes 3 and 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Factors Influencing Future Performance.”
Closing Conditions
The Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of the PUCT. Certain conditions, such as approval from the Bankruptcy Court, the FERC, the Vermont Department of Financial Regulation and receipt of a private letter ruling from the IRS, have been satisfied. If the required governmental consents and approvals are not received, or if they are not received on terms that satisfy the closing conditions in the Merger Agreement, the Merger could be abandoned, delayed or restructured. 
The Merger Agreement provides that it will terminate if the Merger is not consummated by April 18, 2018, subject to limited exceptions. One of those exceptions provides that, if the Merger is not consummated because the requisite PUCT approval has not been obtained by April 18, 2018, but such approval is still capable of being obtained within 90 days thereafter, the April 18, 2018 date shall be extended for 90 days for purposes of continuing to pursue such approval, unless otherwise agreed by EFH and EFIH (acting together) and Sempra Energy.
We currently expect that the Merger will close in the first half of 2018, although there can be no assurance that the Merger will be completed on that timetable, or at all. 
OUR SEGMENTS
No single customer accounted for 10 percent or more of Sempra Energy’s consolidated revenues in 2017, 2016 or 2015.
SDG&E
SDG&E is a regulated public utility that provides electric services to a population of approximately 3.6 million and natural gas services to approximately 3.3 million of that population, covering a 4,100 square mile service territory in Southern California that encompasses San Diego County and an adjacent portion of southern Orange County. 
Electric Utility Operations 
Customers and Demand. SDG&E provides electric services through the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity to the following customer classes: 

SDG&E – ELECTRIC CUSTOMER METERS AND VOLUMES
 | | Customer meter count | Volumes(1)(millions of kWh)
 | | December 31, | Years ended December 31,

SDG&E’s system average rate is based on authorized revenue requirements divided by authorized sales volumes. SDG&E’s system average rate was $0.238, $0.206 and $0.218 per kWh in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The 2017 increase compared to 2016 was primarily the result of undercollected power costs in 2016. The 2016 decrease compared to 2015 was driven by the inclusion in 2015 of undercollections associated with activities prior to 2015, including the delay in implementing into rates the increases associated with the 2012 GRC. A significant proportion of SDG&E’s costs to operate are independent of sales volumes, which can contribute to system average rate variances as sales volumes change.
An electric utility’s system average rate can be affected by numerous factors, which are not necessarily common to other utilities regionally or nationally. In general, the utilization of a typical electric utility’s distribution assets is significantly less than their capacity because the assets are designed to meet peak needs. Compared to the typical utility in the U.S., SDG&E delivers a higher relative percentage of its total power sold to residential customers, who on average consume less power than an average commercial customer. San Diego’s mild climate and SDG&E’s robust energy efficiency programs also contribute to lower consumption by our customers. In addition, rooftop solar installations, especially in recent years, have reduced residential and commercial volumes sold by SDG&E. As of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the residential and commercial rooftop solar capacity in SDG&E’s territory totaled 836 MW, 694 MW and 496 MW, respectively. All these factors contribute to generally higher system average rates, where the cost of building and operating our assets is spread over a relatively smaller sales volume.
In addition to these factors, SDG&E’s CPUC-approved rate design includes a tiered residential pricing structure. We discuss electric rate reform further in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Factors Influencing Future Performance.”
Demand for electricity is dependent on the health and expansion of the Southern California economy, prices of alternative energy products, consumer preference, environmental regulations, legislation, renewable power generation, the effectiveness of energy efficiency programs, demand-side management goals and distributed generation resources. California’s energy policy supports increased electrification, particularly electrification of vehicles, which could result in significant increases in sales volumes in the coming years. Other external factors, such as the price of purchased power, the use of hydroelectric power, development of renewable energy resources, development of new natural gas supply sources, demand for natural gas, and general economic conditions, can also result in significant shifts in the market price of electricity, which may in turn impact demand. Demand for electricity is also impacted by seasonal weather patterns (or “seasonality”), tending to increase in the summer months to meet cooling load and in the winter months to meet heating load.
Electric Resources. To meet customer demand, SDG&E procures power from its own electric generation facilities and from other suppliers through CPUC-approved purchased-power contracts or through purchases on a spot basis. SDG&E’s supply as of December 31, 2017 is as follows: 

SDG&E – ELECTRIC RESOURCES(1) 
 | Contract | Net operating | 
 | expiration date | capacity (MW) | % of total
Owned generation facilities, natural gas(2) | | 1,193 | | 22 | %
Purchased-power contracts: | | | 
Qualifying facilities | 2019 to 2026 | 246 | | 5 |

(1) | Excludes approximately 114 MW of battery storage owned (including 70 MW pending CPUC approval) and approximately 13.5 MW of battery storage contracted (all pending CPUC approval).


(2) | SDG&E owns and operates four natural gas-fired power plants, three of which are in California and one of which is in Nevada.


(3) | Includes Otay Mesa VIE.

SDG&E is required to interconnect with and purchase power from QFs, a class of generating facilities established by the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, at rates that do not exceed SDG&E’s avoided cost. For SDG&E, QFs include cogeneration facilities, which produce electricity and another form of useful thermal energy (such as heat or steam) used for industrial, commercial, residential or institutional purposes. Charges under most of the contracts with QFs are based on what it 
14

would incrementally cost SDG&E to produce the power or procure it from other sources. Charges under the contracts with other suppliers are for firm and as-generated energy, and are based on the amount of energy received or are tolls based on available capacity. Tolling contracts are purchased-power contracts under which SDG&E provides natural gas for generation to the energy supplier. The prices under these contracts include 193 MW at prices that are based on the market value at the time the contracts were negotiated.
SDG&E provides bundled electric procurement service through various resources that are typically procured on a long-term basis, as shown above. While SDG&E provides such procurement service for the majority of its customer load, customers do have the ability to receive procurement service from a load serving entity other than SDG&E, through programs such as DA and CCA. DA is currently closed to new entrants, but utility customers can receive procurement through CCA, if the customer’s local jurisdiction (city) offers such a program. A number of cities in our service territory have expressed interest in CCA, which, if widely adopted, could result in substantial reductions in the load we are required to serve. For example, Solana Beach (representing less than 1 percent of SDG&E’s customer accounts) has elected to begin CCA service in 2018. When customers are served by another load serving entity, SDG&E no longer serves this departing load and the associated costs of the utility’s procured resources are otherwise borne by its remaining bundled procurement customers. The CPUC has tried to address this issue by adopting rate mechanisms that attempt to ensure bundled customer indifference in the event of departing load, but these existing mechanisms may not be sufficient to address the full extent of the potential cost shift in the event of significant departing load, and SDG&E bears some risk that its procured resources could become stranded without recovery of the associated costs.
Natural Gas Supply for Generation Facilities. SDG&E procures natural gas under short-term contracts for its owned generation facilities and for certain tolling contracts associated with purchased-power arrangements. Purchases are from various southwestern U.S. suppliers and are primarily priced based on published monthly bid-week indices.
Power Pool. SDG&E is a participant in the Western Systems Power Pool, which includes an electric-power and transmission-rate agreement that allows access to power trading with more than 300 member utilities, power agencies, energy brokers and power marketers located throughout the U.S. and Canada. Participants can make power transactions on standardized terms, including market-based rates, preapproved by the FERC. Participation in the Western Systems Power Pool is intended to assist members in managing power delivery and price risk.
Electric Transmission and Distribution System. Service to SDG&E’s customers is supported by its electric transmission and distribution system. At December 31, 2017, SDG&E’s electric transmission and distribution facilities included substations and overhead and underground lines. These electric facilities are in San Diego, Imperial and Orange counties of California, and in Arizona and Nevada. The facilities consist of 2,090 miles of transmission lines, 23,479 miles of distribution lines and 160 substations. Periodically, various areas of the service territory require expansion to accommodate customer growth, reliability and safety. 
SDG&E’s 500-kV Southwest Powerlink transmission line, which is shared with Arizona Public Service Company and Imperial Irrigation District, extends from Palo Verde, Arizona to San Diego, California. SDG&E’s share of the line is 1,162 MW, although it can be less under certain system conditions. SDG&E’s Sunrise Powerlink is a 500-kV transmission line constructed and operated by SDG&E with import capability of 1,000 MW of power.
Mexico’s Baja California transmission system is connected to SDG&E’s system via two 230-kV interconnections with combined capacity of up to 408 MW in the north-to-south direction and 800 MW in the south-to-north direction, although it can be less under certain system conditions.
Edison’s transmission system is connected to SDG&E’s system via five 230-kV transmission lines.
Competition. SDG&E faces competition to serve its customer load from the growth in distributed and local power generation, including rooftop solar installations, battery storage, and the corresponding decrease in demand for power delivered through SDG&E’s electric transmission and distribution system and from possible departing retail load resulting from customers transferring to DA and CCA. SDG&E does not earn any return on commodity sales.

For regulatory purposes, end-use customers are classified as either core or noncore customers. Core customers are primarily residential and small commercial and industrial customers.
Most core customers purchase natural gas directly from SoCalGas or SDG&E. While core customers are permitted to purchase directly from producers, marketers or brokers, the California Utilities are obligated to provide reliable supplies of natural gas to serve the requirements of their core customers. A substantial portion of SoCalGas’ revenues are from core customers.
16

Noncore customers at SoCalGas consist primarily of electric generation, wholesale, large commercial and industrial, and enhanced oil recovery customers. A portion of SoCalGas’ noncore customers are non-end-users. SoCalGas’ non-end-users include wholesale customers consisting primarily of other IOUs, including SDG&E, or municipally owned natural gas distribution systems. Noncore customers at SDG&E consist primarily of electric generation and large commercial customers.
Noncore customers are responsible for the procurement of their natural gas requirements, as the regulatory framework does not allow us to recover the actual cost of natural gas procured and delivered to noncore customers.
No single customer accounted for 10 percent or more of SoCalGas’ or SDG&E’s revenues from natural gas operations in 2017, 2016 or 2015.
Demand for natural gas largely depends on the health and expansion of the Southern California economy, prices of alternative energy products, consumer preference, environmental regulations, legislation, California’s energy policy supporting increased electrification and renewable power generation, and the effectiveness of energy efficiency programs. Other external factors such as weather, the price of electricity, the use of hydroelectric power, development of renewable energy resources, development of new natural gas supply sources, demand for natural gas outside the state of California, and general economic conditions, can also result in significant shifts in market price, which may in turn impact demand.
One of the larger sources for natural gas demand is electric generation. Natural gas-fired electric generation within Southern California (and demand for natural gas supplied to such plants) competes with electric power generated throughout the western U.S. Natural gas transported for electric generating plant customers may be affected by the overall demand for electricity, growth in renewable generation (including rooftop solar), the addition of more efficient gas technologies, new energy efficiency initiatives, and the extent that regulatory changes in electric transmission infrastructure investment divert electric generation from the California Utilities’ respective service areas. The demand for natural gas may also fluctuate due to volatility in the demand for electricity due to climate change, weather conditions and other impacts, and the availability of competing supplies of electricity such as hydroelectric generation and other renewable energy sources. Given the significant quantity of natural gas-fired generation, natural gas is the dispatchable fuel of choice to help ensure electric reliability in our California service territories.
The natural gas distribution business is seasonal, and cash provided from operating activities generally is greater during and immediately following the winter heating months. As is prevalent in the industry, but subject to current regulatory limitations, SoCalGas usually injects natural gas into storage during the summer months (April through October), which reduces cash provided by operating activities during this period, and usually withdraws natural gas from storage during the winter months (November through March), which increases cash provided by operating activities, when customer demand is higher.
Natural Gas Procurement and Transportation
At December 31, 2017, SoCalGas’ natural gas facilities include 2,964 miles of transmission and storage pipelines, 50,577 miles of distribution pipelines, 47,779 miles of service pipelines and nine transmission compressor stations, while SDG&E’s natural gas facilities consist of 168 miles of transmission pipelines, 8,928 miles of distribution pipelines, 6,503 miles of service pipelines and one compressor station.
SoCalGas purchases natural gas under short-term and long-term contracts for the California Utilities’ residential and smaller business customers. SoCalGas purchases natural gas from various sources, including from Canada, the U.S. Rockies and the southwestern regions of the U.S. Purchases of natural gas are primarily priced based on published monthly bid-week indices.
To help ensure the delivery of natural gas supplies to its distribution system and to meet the seasonal and annual needs of customers, SoCalGas has firm interstate pipeline capacity contracts that require the payment of fixed reservation charges to reserve firm transportation rights. Pipeline companies, primarily El Paso Natural Gas Company, Transwestern Pipeline Company, PG&E and Kern River Gas Transmission Company, provide transportation services into SoCalGas’ intrastate transmission system for supplies purchased by SoCalGas or its transportation customers from outside of California.
Natural Gas Storage 
SoCalGas owns four natural gas storage facilities. These facilities have a combined working gas capacity of 137 Bcf and have over 200 injection, withdrawal and observation wells that provide natural gas storage services for core, noncore and non-end-use customers. SoCalGas’ and SDG&E’s core customers are allocated a portion of SoCalGas’ storage capacity. SoCalGas offers the remaining storage capacity for sale to others, including SDG&E for its non-core customer requirements, through an open bid process. Natural gas withdrawn from storage is important for ensuring service reliability during peak demand periods, including heating needs in the winter, as well as peak electric generation needs in the summer. The Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility represents 63 percent of SoCalGas’ natural gas storage capacity. SoCalGas discovered a natural gas leak at one of its wells at the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility in October 2015, and permanently sealed the well in February 2016. SoCalGas ceased 
17

injecting natural gas into the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility on October 25, 2015, pursuant to orders from DOGGR and the Governor of California, and SB 380. Limited withdrawals and injections of natural gas at the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility were authorized to recommence in 2017. We discuss the Aliso Canyon natural gas leak in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Factors Influencing Future Performance” and in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

In Chile, customers are classified as regulated and non-regulated customers based on installed capacity. Regulated customers are those whose installed capacity is less than 500 kW. Non-regulated customers are those whose installed capacity is greater than 5,000 kW. Customers with installed capacity between 500 kW and 5,000 kW may choose to be classified as regulated or non-regulated. Non-regulated customers that can buy power from other sources, such as directly from the generator, are classified as tolling customers. Both regulated and non-regulated customers pay transmission and distribution tariffs for the transportation of their electricity through the system. There is no risk of stranded costs for Chilquinta Energía because PPAs with generators are not take-or-pay contracts; rather, Chilquinta Energía only purchases power taken by its customers.
Chilquinta Energía’s system average rate (excluding tolling customers) was $0.164, $0.168 and $0.165 per kWh in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
Demand for electricity depends on the growth and stability of the Chilean economy, customer growth and preferences, prices, policies and environmental regulations driving the substitution of alternative energy products for wood and coal, legislation and energy policy supporting increased electrification of the public and private transportation sector, and the effectiveness and expansion of energy efficiency programs and distributed generation resources.
The price of electricity can be affected by the growth of renewable power generation, the amount of hydroelectric power, the market price of oil and natural gas, and transmission and distribution service tariffs, which may, in turn, also impact demand for electricity.
18

Other factors that can affect the demand for electricity include weather and seasonality. Demand for electricity at Chilquinta Energía is higher in the winter months to meet heating load, and tends to decrease during the mild temperatures in the summer months. 
Electric Resources. The supply of electric power available to Chilquinta Energía comes from purchased-power contracts currently in place with various suppliers. The supply as of December 31, 2017 was as follows:
CHILQUINTA ENERGÍA – ELECTRIC RESOURCES
 | Contract | Net operating | 
 | expiration date | capacity (MW) | % of total
Purchased-power contracts: | | | 
Thermal(1) | 2023 to 2026 | 291 | | 62 | %
Hydro | 2023 to 2036 | 141 | | 30 | 
Wind/solar | 2023 to 2036 | 32 | | 7 | 
Biomass | 2023 to 2036 | 7 | | 1 | 
Total | | 471 | | 100 | %

(1) Contracts with fuel sources that include natural gas, coal or diesel are collectively referred to as thermal.
Power Generation System. The National Electric System is operated and coordinated by the National Electric Coordinator (Coordinador Eléctrico Nacional). This institution is managed by a Directive Council (Consejo Directivo) formed by five members designated through a public tender. This entity coordinates the operation of the nationwide interconnected electric system. 
Transmission System and Access. At December 31, 2017, Chilquinta Energía’s electric facilities include 10,227 miles of distribution lines, 352 miles of transmission lines and 49 substations. Chilquinta Energía also owns a 50-percent interest in Eletrans, which operates a 97-mile, double circuit 220-kV transmission line in the Atacama region of northern Chile, and a 46-mile, double circuit 220-kV transmission line in the Los Rios region of southern Chile.
Transmission lines in Chile are either part of the main transmission system (the national system) or the sub-transmission system (the zonal system). Sub-transmission systems, including those owned by Chilquinta Energía, are comprised of infrastructure that is interconnected to the electricity system to supply non-regulated and regulated end-users located in the distribution service area.
We discuss ongoing transmission line projects at Chilquinta Energía’s joint ventures in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Factors Influencing Future Performance.”
Competition. Chilquinta Energía faces limited competition from the growth in rooftop solar installations, as electricity prices remain competitive and tariffs compensate self-generators only for the commodity component of the energy delivered to the grid. Presently, there are no public programs or incentives promoting the adoption of distributed energy generation. 
In addition, the National Electric Coordinator will be tendering a significant number of projects, divided between extension work and new development work, for sub-transmission systems. The new development projects in these tenders will be opened to independent developers, allowing such developers to compete with incumbent utilities for their construction and operation.
Luz del Sur S.A.A.
Sempra South American Utilities owns 83.6 percent of Luz del Sur, an electric distribution utility that serves a population of approximately 4.9 million in the southern zone of metropolitan Lima, Peru, with a service area covering approximately 1,394 square miles. Luz del Sur delivers approximately one-third of all power used in Peru. The remaining shares of Luz del Sur are held by noncontrolling interests and trade on the Lima Stock Exchange (Bolsa de Valores de Lima) under the symbol LUSURC1. The shares are subject to regulation by the Superintendencia del Mercado de Valores (Superintendency of Securities Market).
19

Customers and Demand. Luz del Sur provides electric services through the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity to the following customer classes:

LUZ DEL SUR – ELECTRIC CUSTOMER METERS AND VOLUMES
 | | Customer meter count | Volumes(millions of kWh)
 | | December 31, | Years ended December 31,
 | | 2017 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015

 | 1,101,739 | | 6,999 | | 7,387 | | 7,549 | 
Tolling | 253 | | 1,922 | | 1,365 | | 974 | 
 | Total | 1,101,992 | | 8,921 | | 8,752 | | 8,523

In Peru, customers are classified as regulated and non-regulated customers based on capacity demand. Regulated customers are those whose capacity demand is less than 200 kW and their energy supply is considered public service. Non-regulated customers, which are free and tolling customers, are those whose capacity demand is greater than 2,500 kW. Customers with capacity demand between 200 kW and 2,500 kW may choose to be classified as regulated or non-regulated. Free customers purchase power directly from a utility and pay the utility a fee for generation, transmission (primary and secondary) and distribution services. Tolling customers purchase power from alternate suppliers and pay only a tolling fee to the utility for secondary transmission and distribution services. Utilities in Peru, including Luz del Sur, generally have PPAs with generators to serve their regulated and free customers’ load. Because the power purchased by Luz del Sur from generators is generally based on take-or-pay contracts, Luz del Sur is exposed to the risk of stranded costs associated with capacity charges, as we discuss in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Factors Influencing Future Performance.”
Luz del Sur’s system average rate (excluding free and tolling customers) was $0.130, $0.122 and $0.117 per kWh in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Demand for electricity depends on the stability and growth of the Peruvian economy, customer growth and usage preferences, electricity prices, legislation and energy policy supporting increased electrification within our service territory. The price of electricity can be affected by changes in energy policy, volatility of spot market prices, the amount of hydroelectric power, the market price of oil and natural gas, changes in inflation and foreign exchange rates, new technologies and transmission and distribution service tariffs, which may also impact demand for electricity. Other factors that can affect the demand for electricity include weather and seasonality. Demand for electricity at Luz del Sur is higher in the summer months to meet cooling load, and tends to decrease during the colder temperatures in the winter months.
Electric Resources. The supply of electric power available to Luz del Sur comes from purchased-power contracts currently in place with various suppliers, its own electric generation facility or purchases made on an as-needed basis. This supply as of December 31, 2017 was as follows: 

LUZ DEL SUR – ELECTRIC RESOURCES 
 | Contract | Firm contracted | 
 | expiration date | capacity (MW) | % of total
Owned generation facility, hydro(1) | | 61 | | 4 | %
Purchased-power contracts: | | | 
Thermal(2) | 2021-2025 | 413 | | 27 | 
Hydro | 2021-2025 | 233 | | 15 | 
Combined thermal/hydro | 2019-2025 | 832 | | 54 | 
Total | | 1,539 | | 100 | %

(1) | Santa Teresa has a nameplate capacity of 100 MW with an associated firm capacity estimated at 61 MW

based on guidelines established by the system operator in Peru and historical water flows. Available excess 
capacity is sold in the spot market.

(2) | Contracts with fuel sources that include natural gas, coal or diesel are collectively referred to as thermal.

Power Generation System. The Sistema Eléctrico Interconectado Nacional (SEIN) is the Peruvian national interconnected system. The OSINERGMIN, in addition to setting tariffs, supervises the bidding processes for energy purchases between distribution companies and generators.
The Committee of Economic Operation of the National Interconnected System (Comité de Operación Económica del Sistema Interconectado Nacional) coordinates the operation and dispatch of electricity of the SEIN.
Transmission System and Access. At December 31, 2017, Luz del Sur’s electric facilities consisted of 13,966 miles of distribution lines, 216 miles of transmission lines and 40 substations. Luz del Sur also owns and operates Santa Teresa, a 100-MW hydroelectric power plant located in the Cusco region of Peru.
Transmission lines in Peru are divided into principal and secondary systems. The principal system lines are accessible by all generators and allow the flow of energy through the national grid. The secondary system lines connect principal transmission with the network of distribution companies or connect directly to certain final customers. The transmission company receives tariff revenues and collects tolls based on a charge per unit of electricity.
We discuss ongoing transmission line and substation projects at Luz del Sur in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Factors Influencing Future Performance.”
Competition. While electric distribution companies in Peru are considered natural monopolies, users consuming more than 200 kW are free to choose the company of their preference, including Luz del Sur, to provide them with electric power.
Key Noncash Performance Indicators 
Key noncash performance indicators for our South American electric distribution utilities’ operations are customer count and consumption and transmission line losses. Additional noncash performance indicators include goals related to safety, environmental considerations, electric reliability, and regulatory compliance.

Gas Business
Pipelines and Related Assets/Facilities. At December 31, 2017, Sempra Mexico’s assets/facilities consisted of 1,353 miles of natural gas transmission pipelines, 11 compressor stations, 139 miles of ethane pipelines, 118 miles of LPG pipelines and one LPG storage terminal in Mexico. These assets are contracted under long-term, U.S. dollar-based agreements with major industry participants such as the CFE, CENAGAS, PEMEX, Shell, Gazprom, InterGen N.V. and other similar counterparties. 
In 2017, our pipeline assets in Mexico had design capacity of approximately 16,501 MMcf per day of natural gas, 204 MMcf per day of ethane gas, 106,000 barrels per day of ethane liquid, 34,000 barrels per day of LPG transmission and 80,000 barrels of LPG storage.
LNG. Sempra Mexico operates its ECA LNG regasification terminal on land it owns in Baja California, Mexico. The ECA LNG regasification terminal is capable of processing 1 Bcf of natural gas per day and generates revenues from reservation and usage fees under terminal capacity agreements and nitrogen injection service agreements with Shell and Gazprom, expiring in 2028, that permit them, together, to use one-half of the terminal’s capacity.
In connection with Sempra LNG & Midstream’s LNG purchase agreement with Tangguh PSC, Sempra Mexico purchases from Sempra LNG & Midstream the LNG delivered to ECA by Tangguh PSC. Sempra Mexico uses the natural gas produced from this LNG and from natural gas purchased in the market or through Sempra LNG & Midstream’s marketing operations to supply a contract for the sale of natural gas to Mexico’s national electric company, the CFE, at prices that are based on the SoCal Border index. If LNG volumes received from Tangguh PSC are not sufficient to satisfy the commitment to the CFE, Sempra Mexico may purchase natural gas from Sempra LNG & Midstream’s natural gas marketing operations.
The LNG business is impacted by worldwide LNG market prices. High LNG prices in markets outside the market in which IEnova’s LNG terminal operates have resulted and could continue to result in lower than expected deliveries of LNG cargoes to the ECA LNG terminal from third parties under existing supply agreements, which could increase costs if IEnova is instead required to obtain LNG in the open market at prevailing prices. Any inability to obtain expected LNG cargoes could also impact IEnova’s ability to maintain the minimum level of LNG required to keep the ECA LNG terminal in operation at the proper temperature. LNG market prices also affect IEnova’s LNG marketing operations, through which IEnova must purchase natural gas in the international market to meet its contractual obligations to deliver natural gas to customers, but which could have an adverse impact on its earnings, which may be mitigated in part by the indemnity payments discussed below.
Sempra Mexico’s LNG marketing operations sell natural gas to the CFE and other customers under supply agreements. Sempra Mexico recognizes the revenue from the sale of natural gas upon transfer of the natural gas via pipelines to the customers at the agreed upon delivery points, and in the case of the CFE, at its thermoelectric power plants. 
Sempra LNG & Midstream has an agreement with Sempra Mexico to supply LNG to the ECA LNG terminal. Although the LNG purchase agreement specifies a number of cargoes to be delivered annually, actual cargoes delivered have been significantly lower than the maximum specified under the agreement. As a result, Sempra LNG & Midstream is contractually required to make monthly indemnity payments to Sempra Mexico for failure to deliver the contracted LNG. The revenues from the indemnity payments, along with an amount for profit sharing, allow Sempra Mexico to recover the costs of operating the ECA LNG terminal.
Natural Gas Distribution. Sempra Mexico’s natural gas distribution utility, Ecogas, operates in three separate distribution zones in Mexico with approximately 2,394 miles of pipeline, and had approximately 120,000 customer meters (serving more than 400,000 residential, commercial and industrial consumers) with sales volume of approximately 81 MMcf per day in 2017. 
Ecogas relies on affiliates, Sempra LNG & Midstream and SoCalGas, for the supply and transportation of natural gas that it distributes to its customers. If these affiliates fail to perform and IEnova is unable to obtain supplies of natural gas from alternate sources, IEnova could lose customers and sales volume and could also be exposed to commodity price risk and volatility.
Ecogas had been entitled to a 12-year period of exclusivity with respect to each of its three distribution zones in Mexicali, Chihuahua and La Laguna-Durango. As the last of these exclusivity periods expired in 2011, Ecogas could face competition from other distributors of natural gas in all of these distribution zones as other distributors of natural gas are now legally permitted to build natural gas distribution systems and compete with Ecogas for customers.
Power Business
Wind Power Generation. Sempra Mexico develops, invests in and operates renewable energy generation facilities that have long-term PPAs to sell the electricity they generate to its customers, which are generally load serving entities, and industrial and other customers. Load serving entities sell electric service to their end-users and wholesale customers immediately upon receipt of 
23

our power delivery, while industrial and other customers consume the electricity to run their facilities. In 2017, Sempra Mexico had contracted capacity of 330 MW for its ownership share of fully operating wind energy generation facilities.
Natural Gas-Fired Generation. TdM is a 625-MW natural gas-fired power plant located in Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico that generates revenue from selling electricity and/or resource adequacy to the CAISO and to governmental, public utility and wholesale power marketing entities. It also has an EMA with Sempra LNG & Midstream for energy marketing, scheduling and other related services to support its sales of generated power into the California electricity market. Under the EMA, TdM pays fees to Sempra LNG & Midstream for these revenue-generating services. TdM also purchases fuel from Sempra LNG & Midstream. Sempra Mexico records revenue for the sale of power generated by TdM, and records cost of sales for the purchases of natural gas and energy management services provided by Sempra LNG & Midstream.
In February 2016, management approved a plan to market and sell TdM. As a result, we stopped depreciating the plant and classified the plant as held for sale. We continue to actively pursue the sale of TdM, which we expect to be completed in 2018. We discuss TdM further in Notes 3 and 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
TdM competes daily with other generating plants that supply power into the California electricity market. Several of the wholesale markets supplied by merchant power plants have experienced significant pricing declines due to excess supply. IEnova manages commodity price risk at TdM by optimizing a mix of forward on-peak energy sales, daily and hourly spot market sales of capacity, energy and ancillary services, and longer-term structured transactions, as well as avoiding short positions.
Demand and Competition
The overall demand for natural gas distribution services increases during the winter months. Conversely, in the power business, the overall demand for electricity is greater during the summer months. 
IEnova competes with Mexican and foreign companies for certain new energy infrastructure projects in Mexico and some of its competitors (including but not limited to, public or state-operated companies, their subsidiaries and affiliates) may have better access to capital and greater financial and other resources, which could give them a competitive advantage in bidding for such projects. We discuss Sempra Mexico’s demand and competition further below. 
Key Noncash Performance Indicators
Key noncash performance indicators for Sempra Mexico include sales volume, plant or facility availability, capacity utilization and, for its distribution operations, customer count and consumption. Additional noncash performance indicators include obtaining and completing (on time and on budget) major projects, compliance with reliability and regulatory standards, and goals related to safety, environmental considerations and regulatory performance.
Sempra Renewables
Sempra Renewables develops, owns and operates, or holds interests in, solar and wind energy generation facilities in the U.S. that have long-term PPAs to sell the electricity and the related green energy attributes they generate to its customers, which are generally load serving entities. Load serving entities sell electric service to their end-users and wholesale customers immediately upon receipt of our power delivery.
The majority of Sempra Renewables’ wind farm assets earn PTCs based on the number of megawatt hours of electricity they generate. A PTC is a federal subsidy that provides an income tax incentive to wind-energy producers at a flat rate for generating clean energy. Because PTCs last for ten years after project completion, any wind turbine that is under construction before the end of 2019 will earn a full decade of PTCs at phased-out rates beginning with construction starting in 2017 through 2019. For each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, PTCs represented a large portion of our wind farm earnings, often exceeding earnings from operations.
Certain of Sempra Renewables’ wind and solar power facilities are held by limited liability companies whose members include financial institutions. These financial institutions are noncontrolling tax equity investors to which earnings, tax attributes and cash flows are allocated in accordance with the respective limited liability company agreements. We discuss these tax equity arrangements in “Variable Interest Entities” and in “Noncontrolling Interests” in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Demand and Competition
Generation from Sempra Mexico’s and Sempra Renewables’ renewable energy assets is susceptible to fluctuations in naturally occurring conditions such as wind, inclement weather and hours of sunlight.
Sempra Renewables’ future performance and the demand for renewable energy are impacted by various market factors, most notably state mandated requirements to deliver a portion of total energy load from renewable energy sources. The rules governing these requirements in California are generally known as the RPS Program. In California, certification of a generation project by the CEC as an ERR allows the purchase of output from such generation facility to be counted towards fulfillment of the RPS Program requirements, if such purchase meets the provisions of California SB X1-2. The RPS Program may affect the demand for output from renewables projects developed by Sempra Renewables and Sempra Mexico, particularly the demand from California’s utilities. We expect to receive ERR certification for all our renewable facilities operating in and/or providing power to California, including those at Sempra Mexico, as they become operational. Additionally, the phase out or extension of U.S. federal income tax incentives, primarily ITCs and PTCs, could significantly impact future renewable energy resource availability and investment decisions. Certain provisions of the TCJA could reduce the value of tax benefits generated by our renewable projects and therefore make investments less attractive, as well as reducing the size of the tax equity financing market, which could lead to increased financing costs. These impacts may be offset by a lower overall federal tax rate.
Sempra Renewables primarily competes for wholesale contracts for the generation and sale of electricity through its development of and investments in wind and solar power generation facilities. Sempra Renewables also competes with other non-utility generators, regulated utilities, unregulated subsidiaries of regulated utilities, and other energy service companies for sales of non-
25

contracted renewable energy. The number and type of competitors may vary based on location, generation type and project size. Also, regulatory initiatives designed to enhance energy consumption from renewable resources for regulated utility companies may increase competition from these types of institutions. These utilities may have a cost of capital that differs from most independent renewable power producers and often are able to recover fixed costs through rate mechanisms. This allows them to build, buy and upgrade renewable generation projects without relying exclusively on market clearing prices to recover their investments. 
Because Sempra Mexico sells the power that it generates at its Energía Sierra Juárez wind power generation facility into California, it is also impacted by these competitive factors.
Our renewable energy competitors include, among others:
§ | EDF Energy | § | MidAmerican Energy 
§ | First Solar | § | NextEra Energy Resources
§ | Invenergy | § | Southern Company 

Key Noncash Performance Indicators 
Key noncash performance indicators for Sempra Renewables include capacity factors, plant availability and sales volume at our renewable energy facilities. Additional noncash performance indicators include goals related to safety, environmental considerations, and compliance with reliability standards.
Sempra LNG & Midstream
Sempra LNG & Midstream develops, owns and operates, or holds interests in, LNG and natural gas midstream assets and operations in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, including:

▪ | a terminal in the U.S. for the import and export of LNG and sale of natural gas


▪ | natural gas pipelines and storage facilities


▪ | marketing operations

LNG
Sempra LNG & Midstream and three project partners hold interests in the Cameron LNG JV for the development, construction and operation of a three-train natural gas liquefaction export facility at the existing Cameron LNG, LLC regasification terminal in Hackberry, Louisiana, a project developed and permitted by Sempra LNG & Midstream.
Beginning from the October 1, 2014 joint venture effective date, Cameron LNG, LLC was no longer wholly owned, and Sempra LNG & Midstream began accounting for its 50.2-percent equity interest in the joint venture under the equity method. The joint venture began construction in the second half of 2014 on the natural gas liquefaction export facility using the existing regasification infrastructure contributed by Sempra LNG & Midstream. The joint venture has authorization to export LNG to both FTA and non-FTA countries.
The existing regasification terminal is capable of processing 1.5 Bcf of natural gas per day, and from 2009 through 2017, it generated revenue under a terminal services agreement for approximately 3.75 Bcf of natural gas storage and associated send-out rights of approximately 600 MMcf of natural gas per day. The agreement allowed the customer to pay capacity reservation and usage fees to use the facilities to receive, store and regasify the customer’s LNG. In December 2017, Cameron LNG JV terminated the regasification terminal services agreement, as progress on the construction of the three-train liquefaction project requires that certain terminal infrastructure be taken offline. The revenues associated with the terminal services agreement have been included in the equity earnings generated from Cameron LNG JV.
The three liquefaction trains are designed to a nameplate capacity of 13.9 Mtpa of LNG with an expected export capability of 12 Mtpa of LNG, or approximately 1.7 Bcf per day. Cameron LNG JV has 20-year liquefaction and regasification tolling capacity agreements in place with ENGIE S.A. and affiliates of Mitsubishi Corporation and Mitsui & Co., Ltd., which subscribe the full nameplate capacity of three trains at the facility. In addition, Cameron LNG JV is working on the development of up to two additional trains. We discuss Cameron LNG JV in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and the construction of the first three trains and the potential for an additional two trains in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Factors Influencing Future Performance” and in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Sempra Energy is also taking steps to explore the development of additional LNG export facilities at Sempra LNG & Midstream’s Port Arthur, Texas property and Sempra Mexico’s ECA regasification facility. We discuss these opportunities in “Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Factors Influencing Future Performance” and in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Demand and Competition. Technological advances associated with shale gas and tight oil production have significantly reduced the need for North American LNG import facilities and increased interest in liquefaction and export opportunities.
At current forward gas prices, U.S. Gulf Coast liquefaction is among the most price competitive potential LNG supply in the world. Brownfield liquefaction is particularly price competitive, resulting from many factors, including:

▪ | high levels of developed and undeveloped North American unconventional natural gas and tight oil resources relative to domestic consumption levels;


▪ | increasing gas and oil drilling productivity and decreasing unit costs of gas production;


▪ | low breakeven prices of marginal North American unconventional gas production;


▪ | proximity to ample existing gas transmission pipeline and underground gas storage capacity; and


▪ | existing LNG tankage and berths.

Global LNG competition may limit U.S. LNG exports, as international liquefaction projects attempt to match U.S. Gulf Coast LNG production costs and customer contractual rights such as volume and destination flexibility. Host governments for international liquefaction projects are altering fiscal and tax regimes in an effort to make projects in their jurisdictions competitive relative to U.S. projects; however, sustained low oil prices may cause some of the international projects to become unfeasible due to their LNG price formulas’ link to oil prices. It is expected that U.S. LNG exports will increase competition for current and future global natural gas demand, and thereby facilitate development of a global commodity market for natural gas and LNG.
Our LNG liquefaction business’ major domestic and international competitors will include, among others, the following companies and their related LNG affiliates:

§ | BP | § | Petronas 
§ | Cheniere Energy | § | Qatar Petroleum 
§ | Chevron | § | Royal Dutch Shell
§ | ConocoPhillips | § | Total 
§ | ExxonMobil | § | Woodside 
§ | Kinder Morgan | | 

Additionally, our Cameron LNG JV partners, affiliates of ENGIE S.A., Mitsubishi Corporation (through a related company jointly established with Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha), and Mitsui & Co., Ltd., compete globally to market and sell LNG to end users, including gas and electric utilities located in LNG importing countries around the world. By providing liquefaction services, Cameron LNG JV will compete indirectly with liquefaction projects currently operating and those under development in the global LNG market. In addition to the U.S., these competitors are located in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Africa, South America, Australia and Europe.
Midstream
Sempra LNG & Midstream has 42 Bcf of operational working natural gas storage capacity and a development project as follows:

▪ | Bay Gas is a facility located 40 miles north of Mobile, Alabama, that provides underground storage (20 Bcf of operational working natural gas storage capacity) and delivery of natural gas. Sempra LNG & Midstream owns approximately 91 percent of the facility. It is the easternmost salt dome storage facility on the Gulf Coast, with direct service to the Florida market and markets across the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions.


▪ | Mississippi Hub is an underground salt dome with 22 Bcf of operational working natural gas storage capacity located 45 miles southeast of Jackson, Mississippi. It has access to natural gas from shale basins of East Texas and Louisiana, traditional Gulf Coast supplies and LNG, with multiple interconnections to serve the Southeast and Northeast regions.


▪ | Liberty Gas Storage, LLC owns a 77-percent interest in LA Storage, a salt cavern development project in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, and ProLiance Transportation LLC owns the remaining 23 percent. The project’s location provides access to several LNG facilities in the area and could be positioned to support LNG export from various liquefaction terminals. Future development will require approval of a new construction permit by the FERC, if anticipated cash flows support further investment. The LA Storage project also includes an existing 23.3-mile pipeline header system, the LA Storage pipeline, that is not currently contracted.

Demand and Competition. The natural gas storage business depends on market forecasts of seasonal natural gas prices, and cash provided from operating activities generally is greater during and immediately following the winter heating months. As is 
27

prevalent in the industry, Sempra LNG & Midstream customers usually inject natural gas into storage during the summer months (April through October) and usually withdraw natural gas from storage during the winter months (November through March) when customer demand is higher.
Within their respective market areas, Sempra LNG & Midstream’s and Sempra Mexico’s pipeline businesses and Sempra LNG & Midstream’s storage facilities businesses compete with other regulated and unregulated storage facilities and pipelines. They compete primarily on the basis of price (in terms of storage and transportation fees), available capacity and interconnections to downstream markets.
Sempra LNG & Midstream’s competitors include, among others:

§ | Boardwalk Pipeline Partners | § | Macquarie Infrastructure Partners
§ | Cardinal Gas Storage Partners | § | Plains All American Pipeline 
§ | Columbia Energy | § | Southern Company Gas 
§ | Enbridge | § | Tellurian 
§ | Energy Transfer Partners | § | TransCanada 
§ | Enterprise Products Partners | § | The Williams Companies 
§ | Kinder Morgan | | 

Sempra Mexico’s competitors include, among others:

§ | Carso Energy | § | Fermaca 
§ | Enagas | § | Kinder Morgan
§ | ENGIE S.A. | § | TransCanada 

Marketing Operations
Sempra LNG & Midstream provides natural gas marketing, trading and risk management services through the utilization and optimization of contracted natural gas supply, transportation and storage capacity, as well as optimizing its assets in the short-term services market. Additionally, it sells electricity under short-term and long-term contracts and into the spot market and other competitive markets.
Sempra LNG & Midstream’s marketing operations have an LNG purchase agreement with Tangguh PSC for the supply of the equivalent of 500 MMcf of natural gas per day from Tangguh PSC’s Indonesian liquefaction facility with delivery to Sempra Mexico’s ECA LNG receipt terminal at a price based on the SoCal Border index for natural gas. The LNG purchase agreement allows Tangguh PSC to divert deliveries to other global markets in exchange for cash differential payments to Sempra LNG & Midstream. Sempra LNG & Midstream also may enter into short-term supply agreements to purchase LNG to be received, stored and regasified at the terminal for sale to other parties.
In addition to LNG, if deliveries of LNG cargoes are not sufficient, Sempra LNG & Midstream is also contracted to sell natural gas to Sempra Mexico that allows Sempra Mexico to satisfy its obligation under supply agreements with the CFE and other customers, and to supply the TdM power plant. These revenues are adjusted for indemnity payments and profit sharing, as discussed in “Sempra Mexico – Gas Business – LNG” above.
Sempra LNG & Midstream also has an EMA with Sempra Mexico to provide energy marketing, scheduling and other related services to Sempra Mexico’s TdM power plant to support its sales of generated power into the California electricity market. We discuss the EMA in “Sempra Mexico – Power Business – Natural Gas-Fired Generation” above.
Key Noncash Performance Indicators
Key noncash performance indicators at Sempra LNG & Midstream include natural gas sales volume, plant or facility availability and capacity utilization. Additional noncash performance indicators include goals related to safety, environmental considerations and regulatory compliance, and on-time and on-budget completion of development projects.
REGULATION
California State Utility Regulation
The California Utilities are principally regulated at the state level by the CPUC, the CEC and the CARB.
28

The CPUC:

▪ | consists of five commissioners appointed by the Governor of California for staggered, six-year terms;


▪ | regulates SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ rates and conditions of service, sales of securities, rates of return, capital structure, rates of depreciation, and long-term resource procurement, except as described below in “U.S. Utility Regulation;”


▪ | has jurisdiction over the proposed construction of major new electric generation, transmission and distribution, and natural gas storage, transmission and distribution facilities in California;


▪ | conducts reviews and audits of utility performance and compliance with regulatory guidelines, and conducts investigations into various matters, such as safety, deregulation, competition and the environment, to determine its future policies; and


▪ | regulates the interactions and transactions of the California Utilities with Sempra Energy and its other affiliates.

The CPUC also oversees and regulates new products and services, including solar and wind energy, bioenergy, alternative energy storage and other forms of renewable energy. In addition, the CPUC’s safety and enforcement role includes inspections, investigations and penalty and citation processes for safety violations.
The CEC publishes electric demand forecasts for the state and for specific service territories. Based on these forecasts, the CEC:

▪ | determines the need for additional energy sources and conservation programs;


▪ | sponsors alternative-energy research and development projects;


▪ | promotes energy conservation programs to reduce demand within the state of California for electricity and natural gas;


▪ | maintains a statewide plan of action in case of energy shortages; and


▪ | certifies power-plant sites and related facilities within California.

The CEC conducts a 20-year forecast of available supplies and prices for every market sector that consumes natural gas in California. This forecast includes resource evaluation, pipeline capacity needs, natural gas demand and wellhead prices, and costs of transportation and distribution. This analysis is one of many resource materials used to support the California Utilities’ long-term investment decisions.
The state of California requires certain California electric retail sellers, including SDG&E, to deliver a percentage of their retail energy sales from renewable energy sources. The rules governing this requirement, administered by both the CPUC and the CEC, are generally known as the RPS Program. We discuss this requirement as it applies to SDG&E in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Factors Influencing Future Performance.”
California AB 32, the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, assigns responsibility to CARB for monitoring and establishing policies for reducing GHG emissions. The bill requires CARB to develop and adopt a comprehensive plan for achieving real, quantifiable and cost-effective GHG emission reductions, including a statewide GHG emissions cap, mandatory reporting rules, and regulatory and market mechanisms to achieve reductions of GHG emissions. CARB is a department within the California Environmental Protection Agency, an organization that reports directly to the Governor’s Office in the Executive Branch of California State Government. Sempra LNG & Midstream and Sempra Mexico are also subject to the rules and regulations of CARB. We provide further discussion of GHG allowances and emissions in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
The operation and maintenance of SoCalGas’ natural gas storage facilities are regulated by DOGGR, as well as various other state and local agencies. We provide further discussion of DOGGR’s increased regulations in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Factors Influencing Future Performance.”
U.S. Utility Regulation
The California Utilities are also regulated at the federal level by the FERC, the NRC, the EPA, the DOE and the DOT.
The FERC regulates the California Utilities’ interstate sale and transportation of natural gas and the application of the uniform systems of accounts. In the case of SDG&E, the FERC also regulates the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce, transmission access, rates of return on transmission investment, rates of depreciation and electric rates involving sales for resale. The Energy Policy Act governs procedures for requests for transmission service. The FERC approved the California IOUs transfer of operation and control of their transmission facilities to the CAISO in 1998.
The NRC oversees the licensing, construction, operation and decommissioning of nuclear facilities in the U.S., including SONGS, in which SDG&E owns a 20-percent interest and which has been permanently retired since 2013. NRC and various state regulations require extensive review of the safety, radiological and environmental aspects of these facilities. We provide further discussion of SONGS matters, including the closure and pending decommissioning of the facility, in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
29

The DOT, through PHMSA, has established regulations regarding engineering standards and operating procedures applicable to the California Utilities’ natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines. The DOT has certified the CPUC to administer oversight and compliance with these regulations for the entities they regulate in California. The PHMSA also is in the process of promulgating regulations applicable to the California Utilities’ natural gas storage facilities. See “Other U.S. Regulation” below and further discussion in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Factors Influencing Future Performance.”
Other State and Local Regulation Within the U.S.
The SCAQMD is the air pollution control agency responsible for regulating stationary sources of air pollution in the South Coast Air Basin in Southern California. The district’s territory covers all of Orange County and the urban portions of Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Riverside counties.
SoCalGas has natural gas franchises with the 12 counties and the 223 cities in its service territory. These franchises allow SoCalGas to locate, operate and maintain facilities for the transmission and distribution of natural gas. Most of the franchises have indefinite lives with no expiration date. Some franchises have fixed expiration dates, ranging from 2018 to 2062. 
SDG&E has electric franchises with the two counties and the 27 cities in or adjoining its electric service territory; and natural gas franchises with the one county and the 18 cities in its natural gas service territory. These franchises allow SDG&E to locate, operate and maintain facilities for the transmission and distribution of electricity and/or natural gas. Most of the franchises have indefinite lives with no expiration dates. Some natural gas and some electric franchises have fixed expiration dates that range from 2021 to 2035.
Other U.S. Regulation
The FERC regulates certain Sempra Renewables and Sempra LNG & Midstream assets pursuant to the Federal Power Act and Natural Gas Act, which provide for FERC jurisdiction over, among other things, sales of wholesale power in interstate commerce, transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce, and siting and permitting of LNG terminals. In addition, certain Sempra Renewables power generation assets are required under the Federal Power Act to comply with reliability standards developed by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. Bay Gas’ natural gas storage operations are also regulated by the Alabama Public Service Commission.
Sempra LNG & Midstream’s investment in Cameron LNG JV is subject to regulations of the DOE regarding the export of LNG. 
The FERC may regulate rates and terms of service based on a cost-of-service approach or, in geographic and product markets determined by the FERC to be sufficiently competitive, rates may be market-based. FERC-regulated rates at the following businesses are

▪ | Sempra Renewables and Sempra LNG & Midstream: market-based for wholesale electricity sales


▪ | Sempra LNG & Midstream: cost-based for the transportation of natural gas


▪ | Sempra LNG & Midstream: market-based for the storage of natural gas, as well as the purchase and sale of LNG and natural gas

The California Utilities, Sempra LNG & Midstream and businesses that Sempra LNG & Midstream invests in are subject to the DOT rules and regulations regarding pipeline safety. PHMSA, acting through the Office of Pipeline Safety, is responsible for administering the DOT’s national regulatory program to assure the safe transportation of natural gas, petroleum and other hazardous materials by pipelines, including pipelines associated with natural gas storage, and develops regulations and other approaches to risk management to assure safety in design, construction, testing, operation, maintenance, and emergency response of pipeline facilities. The California Utilities, Sempra LNG & Midstream, Sempra Renewables and Sempra Mexico are also subject to regulation by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
Foreign Regulation
Sempra South American Utilities has two utilities in South America that are subject to laws and regulations in the localities and countries in which they operate. These utilities serve primarily regulated customers, and their revenues are based on tariffs that are set by the CNE in Chile and the OSINERGMIN in Peru, as we discuss below in “Ratemaking Mechanisms – Sempra South American Utilities.”
Operations and projects in our Sempra Mexico segment are subject to regulation by the CRE, the Mexican Safety, Energy and Environment Agency (Agencia de Seguridad, Energía y Ambiente), the Mexican Secretary of Energy (Secretaría de Energía) and other labor and environmental agencies of city, state and federal governments in Mexico. 
30

Licenses and Permits
The California Utilities obtain numerous permits, authorizations and licenses for the transmission and distribution of natural gas and electricity and the operation and construction of related assets, including electric generation and natural gas storage facilities, some of which may require periodic renewal. 
Sempra South American Utilities and Sempra Mexico obtain numerous permits, authorizations and licenses for their electric and natural gas distribution, generation and transmission systems from the local governments where the service is provided. The respective energy ministries in Chile or Peru granted the concessions to operate Chilquinta Energía’s and Luz del Sur’s distribution operations for indefinite terms, not requiring renewal. The permits for generation, transportation, storage and distribution operations at Sempra Mexico are generally for 30-year terms, with options for renewal under certain regulatory conditions. 
Sempra Mexico and Sempra LNG & Midstream obtain licenses and permits for the construction, operation and expansion of LNG facilities, and the import and export of LNG and natural gas. Sempra Mexico also obtains licenses and permits for the construction and operation of terminals for the receipt, storage and delivery of liquid fuels.
Sempra Renewables obtains permits, authorizations and licenses for the construction and operation of power generation facilities, and for the wholesale distribution of electricity.
Sempra LNG & Midstream obtains permits, authorizations and licenses for the construction and operation of natural gas storage facilities and pipelines, and in connection with participation in the wholesale electricity market.
Most of the permits and licenses associated with construction and operations within the Sempra Renewables and Sempra LNG & Midstream businesses are for periods generally in alignment with the construction cycle or life of the asset and in many cases are greater than 20 years.
RATEMAKING MECHANISMS
California Utilities
General Rate Case Proceedings. A CPUC GRC proceeding is designed to set sufficient base rates to allow the California Utilities to recover their reasonable cost of operations and maintenance and to provide the opportunity to realize their authorized rates of return on their investment. The proceeding generally establishes the test year revenue requirements, which authorizes how much the California Utilities can collect from their customers, and provides for attrition, or annual increases in revenue requirements, for each year following the test year. The CPUC generally conducts a GRC every three years. 
Cost of Capital Proceedings. A CPUC cost of capital proceeding determines a utility’s authorized capital structure and authorized return on rate base, which is a weighted-average of the authorized returns on debt, preferred stock, and common equity (referred to as return on equity or ROE), weighted on a basis consistent with the authorized capital structure. The authorized return on rate base approved by the CPUC is the rate that the California Utilities use to establish customer rates to recover costs incurred to finance investments in CPUC-regulated electric distribution and generation, as well as natural gas distribution and transmission assets.
A cost of capital proceeding also addresses the automatic CCM, which applies market-based benchmarks to determine whether an adjustment to the authorized return on rate base is required during the interim years between cost of capital proceedings. The CCM did not operate in 2017, but could operate in 2018 to change the rates effective for January 1, 2019. The market-based benchmark for SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ CCM is the 12-month average monthly A-rated utility bond index, as published by Moody’s for the 12-month period from October 1st through September 30th (CCM Period) of each calculation year. Remaining unchanged from the last cost of capital proceeding, SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ CCM benchmark rate was set at 4.24 percent. If at the end of the CCM Period the monthly average benchmark rate falls outside of the established range of 3.24 percent to 5.24 percent, SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ authorized ROE would be adjusted, upward or downward, by one-half of the difference between the 12-month average and the benchmark rate. In addition, the authorized recovery rate for SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ cost of debt and preferred stock would be adjusted to their respective actual weighted-average costs, with no change to the authorized capital structure. All three adjustments with the new rate would become effective on January 1st of the following year in which the benchmark range was exceeded. 
The CCM only applies during the intervening years between scheduled cost of capital proceedings. In the year the cost of capital proceeding is scheduled, the cost of capital proceeding takes precedence over the CCM and will set new rates for the following year. The next cost of capital proceeding is scheduled to be filed in April 2019 for a January 1, 2020 implementation.
We also discuss the cost of capital and CCM in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
31

Transmission Rate Cases. SDG&E files separately with the FERC for its authorized ROE on FERC-regulated electric transmission operations and assets. The TO4 settlement agreement, approved by the FERC in May 2014 and in effect through December 31, 2018, established a 10.05 percent ROE. The settlement also established 1) a process whereby rates are determined using a base period of historical costs and a forecast of capital investments and 2) a true-up period similar to balancing account treatment that is designed to provide SDG&E earnings of no more and no less than its actual cost of service including its authorized return on investment. SDG&E makes annual information filings on December 1 of each year to update rates for the following calendar year. SDG&E also has the right to file for any ROE incentives that might apply under FERC rules. SDG&E’s debt-to-equity ratio will be set annually based on the actual ratio at the end of each year.
Incentive Mechanisms. The CPUC applies performance-based measures and incentive mechanisms to all California IOUs, under which the California Utilities have earnings potential above authorized CPUC base operating margin if they achieve or exceed specific performance and operating goals. Generally, for performance-based awards, if performance is above or below specific benchmarks, the utility is eligible for financial awards or subject to financial penalties.
SDG&E has incentive mechanisms associated with:

▪ | operational incentives (electric reliability)


▪ | energy efficiency

SoCalGas has incentive mechanisms associated with:

▪ | energy efficiency


▪ | natural gas procurement


▪ | unbundled natural gas storage and system operator hub services

Other Cost-Based Recovery. The CPUC authorizes the California Utilities to collect additional revenue requirements to recover costs that they have been authorized to pass on to customers, including the costs to purchase electricity and natural gas and those associated with administering public purpose, demand response, and customer energy efficiency programs. Actual costs are recovered as the commodity or service is delivered or, to the extent actual amounts vary from forecasts, generally recovered or refunded within a subsequent period based on the nature of the account. Overcollections and undercollections represent differences between cash collected in current rates and amounts due for specified components (including costs, depreciation and return on rate base) probable of recovery from ratepayers. The lagging aspect of overcollections and undercollections impacts cash flows until these respective amounts are trued up with collections from customers.
Because changes in SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ cost of electricity and/or natural gas is substantially recovered in rates through a balancing account mechanism, changes in these costs are offset in revenues, and therefore do not impact earnings. 
We also discuss regulatory matters in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Sempra South American Utilities
Chilquinta Energía and Luz del Sur, our electric distribution utilities in South America, recognize revenues based on tariffs that are set by government agencies in their respective countries based on an efficient model distribution company defined by those agencies. The tariffs are based on a model and are intended to cover the costs of the model company. Because the tariffs are not based on the costs of the specific utility, they may not result in full cost recovery. The tariffs are designed to provide for a pass-through to customers of transmission and energy charges, recovery of reasonable operating and administrative costs, incentives to reduce costs and make needed capital investments and a regulated rate of return on the distributor’s regulated asset base.
Chilquinta Energía’s revenues are based on tariffs that are set by the CNE. The CNE’s review process for authorized distribution and transmission rates generally remains in effect for a period of four years. The CNE reviews rates for four-year periods related to distribution and transmission separately on an alternating basis every two years.
Luz del Sur’s revenues are based on tariffs that are set by the OSINERGMIN. The components of tariffs for Luz del Sur are reviewed and adjusted every four years. 
Sempra Mexico
Ecogas’ revenues are derived from service and distribution fees charged to its customers in pesos. The price Ecogas pays to purchase natural gas, which is based on international price indices, is passed through directly to its customers. The service and distribution fees charged by Ecogas are regulated by the CRE, which performs a review of rates every five years and monitors prices charged to end-users. The tariffs operate under a return-on-asset-base model. In the annual tariff adjustment, rates are adjusted to account for inflation or fluctuations in exchange rates, and inflation indexing includes separate U.S. and Mexican cost components, so that U.S. costs can be included in the final distribution rates.
32

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
We discuss environmental issues affecting us in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” You should read the following additional information in conjunction with those discussions.
Hazardous Substances
The CPUC’s Hazardous Waste Collaborative mechanism allows California’s IOUs to recover hazardous waste cleanup costs for certain sites, including those related to certain Superfund sites. This mechanism permits the California Utilities to recover in rates 90 percent of hazardous waste cleanup costs and related third-party litigation costs, and 70 percent of the related insurance-litigation expenses. In addition, the California Utilities have the opportunity to retain a percentage of any recoveries from insurance carriers and other third parties to offset the cleanup and associated litigation costs not recovered in rates.
We record estimated liabilities for environmental remediation when amounts are probable and estimable. In addition, we record amounts authorized to be recovered in rates under the Hazardous Waste Collaborative mechanism as regulatory assets.
Air and Water Quality
The electric and natural gas industries are subject to increasingly stringent air quality and GHG standards, such as those established by the CARB and SCAQMD. The California Utilities generally recover in rates the costs to comply with these standards. We discuss GHG standards and credits further in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
We discuss environmental matters concerning SoCalGas’ Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Factors Influencing Future Performance” and in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
