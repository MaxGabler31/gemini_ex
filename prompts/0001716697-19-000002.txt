ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
First Choice Bancorp, a California corporation, was organized on September 1, 2017 to serve as the holding company for its wholly owned subsidiary, First Choice Bank (the "Bank"), a California state-chartered commercial bank. On December 21, 2017, the Bank received requisite shareholder and regulatory approval necessary for the Bank to reorganize into the holding company form of ownership pursuant to which First Choice Bank became a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Choice Bancorp. When we refer to "Bancorp" or the "holding company", we are referring First Choice Bancorp, the parent company, on a stand-alone basis. When we refer to "we," "us," "our," or the "Company", we are referring to First Choice Bancorp and the Bank collectively. We are regulated as a bank holding company by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve”) and the Bank is regulated by the California Department of Business Oversight ("DBO") and the Federal Reserve.

Our principal place of business is currently located at 17785 Center Court N, Suite 750, Cerritos, California 90703, and our telephone number at that location is (562) 345-9092. Our common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the trading symbol of “FCBP” on May 1, 2018.
Acquisition and Expansion
We completed the acquisition of Pacific Commerce Bancorp ("PCB") on July 31, 2018. The acquisition has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, the operating results of PCB have been included in the consolidated financial statements from August 1, 2018. See also Note 2. Business Combinations to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this Annual Report. 

Business of the Bank
The Bank was incorporated under the laws of the State of California in March 2005, is licensed by the DBO, and commenced banking operations in August 2005 as a California state-chartered commercial bank headquartered in Cerritos, Los Angeles County, California. On October 1, 2018, the Bank satisfied the requirements of the Federal Reserve Bank and became a state member bank of the Federal Reserve System and purchased the required stock of the Federal Reserve Bank. Accordingly, the Bank is subject to periodic examination and supervision by the DBO and the Federal Reserve as the Bank's primary regulators. In addition, the Bank's deposits are insured under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") and as a result the FDIC also has examination authority over the Bank.
The Bank is a full-service commercial bank offering a broad range of retail and commercial banking products and services to individuals, families and businesses throughout Southern California. Our market area is broadly defined as the seven Southern California Counties, composed of Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, Ventura, Riverside, San Bernardino and Imperial Counties of California, with particular focus on Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego Counties. We operate eleven branches located in the cities of Alhambra, Anaheim, Carlsbad, Cerritos, Chula Vista, Downtown Los Angeles, Pasadena, Rowland Heights, San Diego and West Los Angeles, California, and one loan production office located in Manhattan Beach, California. We also maintain the brand name ProAmérica. 
We have received regulatory approval to discontinue two of our branches: (i) our Little Tokyo branch located at 420 East Third Street, Suite 100, Los Angeles, California 90013, which will be consolidated with our 6th and Figueroa branch, located at 888 W. 6th Street, Suite 200, Los Angeles, California 90017, and (ii) our San Diego branch located at 12730 High Bluff Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, California 92130, which will be consolidated with our Carlsbad branch located at 5857 Owens Avenue, Suite 106, Carlsbad, California 92008, and converting the San Diego branch to a loan center. The branch closings, consolidations and conversion are intended to become effective at the close of business on May 17, 2019. 

We focus on offering banking products and services designed for small- and medium-sized businesses, non-profit organizations, business owners and entrepreneurs, and the professional community, including attorneys, certified public accountants, financial advisors, healthcare providers and investors, who need the personalized and responsive service of a local bank with accessible, top-level decision makers who know the individual community. We target these potential customers who prefer to have a relationship with an institution where decisions are made locally and its employees know them and their business personally. Our deposit products consist primarily of demand, money market, and certificates of deposit. Our lending products consist primarily of construction and land development loans, commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, U.S. Small Business Administration ("SBA") loans, and consumer loans. We also provide treasury management services, on-line banking, commercial credit cards (offered under a private labeling arrangement with a correspondent bank) and other primarily business-oriented products.

Our mission is to increase economic opportunity and promote community development investments, job creation, business development, affordable housing, financial literacy and philanthropic support for the under-served populations in economically distressed communities in the area of our operations and to generally serve the business needs of those doing business in Southern California. While a majority of the members of our board of directors and our employees are members of a minority community, we are committed to serving all communities in our Southern California market area. We provide support to the communities that we serve in the form of financial grants and service hours to many local non-profit organizations. 
Since its formation in 2005, the Bank has operated as a minority depository institution (“MDI”), which is defined by the FDIC and the Federal Reserve, as any depository institution where 51% or more of the stock is owned by minority individuals. We started as a bank focused on providing quality banking and opportunities for first generation Asian immigrants to the United States and we have two branches in the San Gabriel community, which is predominately an Asian-
6

American community. Over time, we have expanded from serving our founding communities to serving the broader communities prevalent in Southern California, a diverse mixture of many ethnic groups. During 2018, we acquired PCB, a community bank that shared our values, goals, culture and mission. PCB was originally organized by members of the Japanese-American community in Southern California. Over time, PCB expanded its operations by acquiring Vibra Bank in Chula Vista, California, and ProAmerica Bank in downtown Los Angeles, both of which have long histories of serving the Mexican-American and Hispanic-American population in Southern California. We expect the addition of PCB will increase our ability to reach minority and under-served communities, especially in downtown Los Angeles and San Diego markets.
An MDI is eligible to receive training, technical assistance and review, and assistance regarding the implementation of proposed new deposit taking and lending programs, as well as with respect to the adoption of applicable policies and procedures governing such programs. The MDI designation has been historically beneficial to us, as the FDIC has reviewed and assisted with the implementation of our deposit and lending programs, and we continue to use the MDI program for technical assistance. Due to our growth and size, and following our conversion to a member bank on October 1, 2018, we anticipate that the Federal Reserve will provide technical assistance reviewing our existing and proposed lending and deposit programs. Accordingly, we believe any change in our MDI designation will not adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or business because we have already benefited greatly from our MDI designation and anticipate leveraging those historic benefits into any new deposit and lending programs we may develop.

In addition, since 2010, our Bank was certified as a Community Development Financial Institution (“CDFI”). A CDFI certification is the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s recognition of specialized financial institutions serving low-income communities. We are qualified to apply for technical assistance and financial assistance awards, as well as training provided by the CDFI Fund. Since 2011, we have received 7 consecutive Business Enterprise Awards totaling an aggregate of $2.6 million from the CDFI Fund for our continuing efforts to increase the lending and service activities within the economically distressed communities that we serve. We have invested the proceeds from the Business Enterprise Awards primarily in loans to small businesses in our local communities including SBA loans and micro-loans, a program to provide startup funds to entrepreneurs starting small businesses.


Strategy

Our strategic objective is to continue growing as a premier community-based commercial bank, focused on offering business-oriented products, financial solutions, and relationship banking services to customers located throughout the Southern California area, principally Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Diego counties. We offer a wide variety of deposit, loan and other financial services to small- and medium-sized businesses, to non-profit organizations, to business owners and entrepreneurs, to the professional community, including attorneys, certified public accountants, financial advisors and healthcare providers and to high-net worth individuals. Our value proposition is to provide a premier business banking experience through relationship banking, depth of expertise, resources and products while maintaining disciplined credit underwriting standards and continuing our focus on our operational efficiency. We focus on originating high-quality loans and growing our deposit base through our relationship-based business lending. We pride ourselves on being “First in Speed, Service and Solutions.” Our objective is to serve most segments of the business community within our market area. The key components of our strategy and business plan for continued success and future growth include the following:

• | customer service, including a high level of personal service and responsiveness;


• | relationship banking by experts in their fields including private banking, commercial banking, and real estate;


• | banking and financial service products for businesses, professionals and high net worth individuals, including products and services similar to those offered by larger banks;


• | leveraging our existing infrastructure with improvements in technology and processes to gain efficiencies to support a larger volume of business;


• | an experienced management team with roots in our market areas; and


• | strong community commitment.


We believe that the investments in experienced relationship management will establish an infrastructure to support our future.

Marketing Strategy

To fulfill our mission, we target the marketing of our products and services toward the small- to middle-market segments of the business community. The small- to middle- business market, generally defined as companies with revenues of less than $50 million, is our primary commercial banking target market. At December 31, 2018, our capital allowed us to 
7

provide unsecured lending (defined as a loan not secured by a first deed of trust on real estate or cash collateral) and secured lending (defined as a loan secured by a first deed of trust on real estate or cash collateral) to a single obligor up to a maximum of $29 million and $48 million, respectively. However, we generally limit our lending commitments to a lower level, currently set at $15 million (the “house limit”), unless the relationship is specifically approved by our Directors’ Loan Committee. Our relationship managers, directors and executive officers are uniquely qualified to support its marketing plan, having deep roots in many of the communities within our target market.

Our directors and officers are actively involved in local community groups and service organizations. Accordingly, our marketing strategy anticipates our ability to respond quickly to customer needs and changes in the market place. Because we are locally owned and operated, with a management team and board of directors charged with monitoring the financial needs of our communities, we are in a position to respond promptly to the requirements of potential new customers, as well as the changing needs of our existing customers.

Our strategy includes the retention of experienced and proven bankers as relationship managers who are familiar with our market area, along with a full offering of products. This provides each of our customers with access to a strong trusted advisor, who can offer knowledgeable advice and an extensive suite of products, including state of the art remote deposit products and specialized personnel for non-deposit products. Our approach is to staff offices with experienced bankers who are familiar with the area and preferably live or have worked in the area.

Products Offered

We offer a full array of competitively priced commercial loan and deposit products, as well as other services delivered directly or through strategic alliances with other service providers. The products offered are aimed at both business and individual customers in our target market.
Loan Products

We offer a diversified mix of business loans primarily encompassing the following loan products: (i) construction and land development loans; (ii) real estate loans for owner occupied and non-owner occupied commercial property ("CRE"); (iii) commercial and industrial ("C&I") loans; (iv) SBA loans, guaranteed in part by the U.S. Government and (v) consumer loans. We occasionally offer lines of credit, secured by a lien on real estate owned by our clients, which may include the primary personal residence of our clients; such lines of credit generally are requested to accommodate the business and investment needs of that customer segment. We encourage relationship banking, obtaining a substantial portion of each borrower’s banking business, including deposit accounts. We will engage in transactional based lending only for borrowers with a history of successful track records who typically have worked with our employees here or at other banks and have a good record of repayment. Although we do not typically engage in residential mortgage lending, we may acquire, from time to time, for our own investment single family residential loans from other mortgage loan originators.

Construction and Land Development Loans. We originate and underwrite interim land and construction loans for commercial and speculative residential purposes. Land loans are primarily to allow the borrower time to complete entitlements, or as bridge financing prior to construction. We also provide new construction and renovation loans. We do not engage in any tract construction lending. Land and construction loans are generally limited to experienced and financially supportive sponsorship, known to management, and in markets that support the development. We impose limits on the loan amount for land, acquisition and construction loans based on a loan-to-cost ratios and loan-to-value ratios based on an "as completed appraisal". The project financed must be supported by current appraisals and other relevant information. These loans are typically Prime-based and have maturities of less than 36 months. Our loan-to-cost policy limits are typically 70% and loan-to-value limits are typically less than 65% based upon an as-completed basis for construction. The following table presents the components of our construction and land development portfolio as of December 31, 2018 and 2017:


 | December 31, 2018 | | December 31, 2017
 | Amount | | % of Total | | Amount | | % of Total
 | (in thousands) | | (in thousands) 
Residential construction (single family 1-4 units) | $ | 95,906 | | | 52.07 | % | | $ | 65,944 | | | 57.13 | %
Commercial real estate construction | 68,173 | | | 37.02 | % | | 30,903 | | | 26.77 | %
Land acquisition & development | 20,098 | | | 10.91 | % | | 18,580 | | | 16.10 | %
Total construction and land development loans | $ | 184,177 | | | 100.00 | % | | $ | 115,427 | | | 100.00 | %

Real Estate Loans - Residential. From time to time we purchase residential real estate loans within our market place that have been originated by unaffiliated third parties. We take a comprehensive and conservative approach to mortgage underwriting. These loans are carefully selected and also audited by third parties for compliance with all applicable mortgage regulations. The typical loan is a five-year hybrid adjustable mortgage with a current start rate in the range of 4% to 7%, which re-prices after five years to the one-year LIBOR plus a specified margin. As of as December 31, 2018, our residential real estate portfolio had an average loan-to-value of the portfolio of 51%. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $57.4 million and $63.4 million of single-family residential real estate loans, representing 4.6% and 8.5% of our total loans held for investment portfolio. There were no non-performing single-family residential real estate loans as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.

Commercial Real Estate Loans. We originate and underwrite commercial property and occasionally multi-family loans, principally within our service areas. These loans are originated by both owner-users and investors. Typically, these loans are held in our loan portfolio and collateralized by the underlying property. The property financed must be supported by current appraisals at the date of origination and other relevant information, and the loan underwriting is managed with a loan-to-value policy limit of 75% and minimum debt service requirements. The real estate securing our existing commercial real estate loans includes a wide variety of property types, such as office buildings, warehouses and production facilities, hospitality properties (such as hotels and restaurants), mixed-use residential and commercial, retail centers, commercial land and multi-family properties.

At December 31, 2018 and 2017, CRE loans totaled $581.2 million and $304.6 million, representing 46.5% and 41.0% of our total loans held for investment portfolio. This includes $401.7 million and $251.8 million of CRE loans secured by non-owner occupied properties and $179.5 million and $52.8 million of CRE loans secured by owner occupied properties at December 31, 2018 and 2017. There were no non-performing CRE loans as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.
Commercial and Industrial Loans. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, commercial and industrial loans amounted to $281.7 million and $169.2 million, representing 22.5% and 22.8% of our total loans held for investment portfolio and are generally made to businesses located in the Southern California region and surrounding communities whose borrowing needs are generally $10.0 million or less. We have non-performing loans of $89 thousand and $634 thousand as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. Our commercial and industrial loans may be secured (meaning secured by a first lien deed of trust on real estate) or unsecured (meaning not secured by a first lien deed of trust on real estate, although usually secured by a perfected commercial lien on non-real estate assets, such as accounts receivable and inventory). The loans may be revolving lines of credit, term equipment financing, amortizing or interest only, or lines of credit secured by general liens on accounts receivable, inventory or a borrower’s other business assets, which may include loans made to third parties. 

We also make loans that provide funding for executive retirement benefit programs. These loans are frequently secured to at least 90% and often well above that level by cash equivalent collateral, typically the cash surrender value, also known as CSV, of one or more life insurance policies. We manage these loans individually against our current house limit of $15 million and legal lending limit of 15% of total risk-based capital. Our Board of Directors also receives quarterly reports of the level of concentration of any single insurance company’s CSV as collateral. The amount of the acceptable loan to CSV is dependent upon the credit quality of the insurer. A decline in the credit quality of the insurer would require the borrower to pledge additional collateral or substitute the CSV of one insurer for another or a reduction in the advance rate of the loan to a lower loan to value.

Small Business Administration (SBA) Loans. We are designated as a Preferred Lender under the SBA Preferred Lender Program. We offer both SBA 7(a) loans, generally at variable rates, and SBA 504 loans, generally with an initial fixed rate term of 5 to 7 years. We originate SBA 7(a) loans with the intention of selling the guaranteed portions as soon as the loan is fully funded and the guaranteed portion may be sold. Most SBA 7(a) loans have a 75% guarantee, although the guaranteed amount can vary from 50% or less to as much as 90%. While the SBA 504 loans are not guaranteed by the SBA (there is a junior lien loan that is guaranteed by the SBA and funded separately by the SBA), SBA 504 loans typically have a low loan-to-value ratio of 65% or less, and there is usually a relatively liquid secondary market where these loans can be sold. Our SBA loans are typically made to small-sized manufacturing companies, wholesalers and retailers, hotels/motels, restaurants and other service businesses for the purpose of purchasing real estate, refinancing real estate, and meeting working capital or business expansion needs. SBA loans can have any maturity up to 25 years. Typically, non-real estate secured loans mature in 10 years or less. In addition to real estate, collateral may also include inventory, accounts receivable and equipment, as well as personal guarantees. We generally sell the guaranteed portion of the SBA 7(a) and the senior lien portion of SBA 504 loans in the secondary market and, for certain loans, retain the servicing responsibility. Consideration for the sale includes the cash received as well as the related servicing asset. We receive servicing fees ranging from 0.25% to 1.00% for the services provided. The portions of the SBA 7(a) loans not sold but collateralized by real estate are monitored by collateral type and included in our CRE stress testing, as separately discussed. The following table presents the components of our SBA portfolio by program at December 31, 2018 and 2017:

 | December 31, 2018 | | December 31, 2017
 | Amount | | % of Total | | Amount | | % of Total
 | (in thousands) | | (in thousands) 
SBA 504 | $ | 46,303 | | | 31.61 | % | | $ | 36,020 | | | 40.61 | %
SBA 7(a) | 100,159 | | | 68.39 | % | | 52,668 | | | 59.39 | %
Total SBA loans | $ | 146,462 | | | 100.00 | % | | $ | 88,688 | | | 100.00 | %


At December 31, 2018, our SBA portfolio totaled $146.5 million of which $30.2 million is guaranteed by the SBA and $116.2 million is unguaranteed. Of the $116.2 million unguaranteed SBA portfolio, $31.6 million is secured by industrial/warehouse properties; $22.7 million by hospitality; $47.0 million by other real estate types, and $15.0 million is unsecured or secured by business assets. At December 31, 2017, our SBA portfolio totaled $88.7 million of which 
$10.9 million is guaranteed by the SBA and $77.8 million is unguaranteed. Of the $77.8 million unguaranteed SBA portfolio, 
$27.8 million is secured by industrial/warehouse properties; $24.4 million by hospitality; $20.9 million by other real estate types, and $4.8 million is unsecured or secured by business assets. Non-performing SBA loans total $1.6 million and 
$1.1 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017. 

Consumer Loans. We do not make a practice of offering personal loans. When offered to relationship clients, these personal loans may be unsecured (meaning not secured by a first lien deed of trust on real estate), but typically they would be secured by collateral, including deposit accounts or cash-equivalent assets, such as the cash surrender value of a life insurance policy.
Deposit Products

As a full-service commercial bank, we focus deposit generation on transactional accounts, encompassing noninterest-bearing demand, interest-bearing demand, and money market accounts. We also offer time certificates of deposit and savings accounts. We market deposits by offering the convenience of state of the art “online banking,” “remote deposit capture” product, and mobile banking technology, which allows check deposits to be deposited from a mobile device. We also offer customers “e-statements” which allows customers to receive statements electronically, which is more convenient and secure, in addition to reducing paper and being environmentally-friendly. To assist in our marketing efforts, we hire seasoned business development officers and focus on generating noninterest-bearing demand deposits.
Our ability to gather deposits, particularly low-cost core deposits, is an important aspect of our business franchise and a significant driver of franchise value as a cost efficient and stable source of funding are important to support our growth. We understand that local branding and customer loyalty are essential for business success. We have successfully generated non-maturity deposits to individual and business customers in our market area to reduce reliance on time deposits. At December 31, 2018, we had total deposits of $1.25 billion, including noninterest-bearing demand deposits of 
$546.7 million, or 44% of total deposits. This compares to $772.7 million of total deposits, including $235.6 million of noninterest-bearing demand deposits, or 30% of total deposits, at December 31, 2017. Our total deposit cost at December 31, 2018 was 0.82%; this compares to a total deposit cost of 0.77% at December 31, 2017. 
As of December 31, 2018, our 10 largest deposit relationships totaled $315.5 million, or 25% of total deposits; this compares to $230.3 million, or 30% of total deposits, at December 31, 2017. In addition, deposit relationships with aggregate balances over $2 million, including our 10 largest depositors, total $584.9 million, represent 47% of total deposits, and relate to 69 clients at December 31, 2018.

For customers requiring full FDIC insurance on certificates of deposit in excess of $250,000, we occasionally offer the CDARS® program which allows us to place the time certificates of deposit with other participating banks to maximize the customers’ FDIC insurance. In December 2018, the FDIC issued a final rule, indicating that under Section 202 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, well-capitalized and well-rated institutions are not required to treat reciprocal deposits as brokered deposits up to the lesser of 20% of its total liabilities or $5 billion. As of December 31, 2018, our reciprocal CDARS® deposits totaled $21.7 million, representing 1.6% of total liabilities. 

Well-capitalized institutions are not subject to limitations on brokered deposits. Generally, we limit the use of brokered deposits to long-term (maturity dates in excess of one year at the time of placement) and callable deposits. Because the deposits pay a fixed interest rate for a longer period of time, they provide us with protection against increasing deposit costs as a result of rising interest rates. Furthermore, because the deposits can be called by us, they also provide us with 
10

protection against decreasing deposit cost if there is a fall in the market interest rates. Short term brokered deposits may be used based on market conditions and other considerations, for example when the cost of such funds is lower than other wholesale funding sources. Total brokered time deposits as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $53.4 million and $52.6 million, representing 4.3% and 6.8% of total deposits. 

With a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act, also known as CRA, we are qualified to participate in the Time Deposit Program administered by the California State Treasurer. By accessing these stable funds through the Time Deposit Program, we can provide financial services and lending products to local businesses in the communities we serve to stimulate local economies. At December 31, 2018, time deposits from the State of California totaled $35.1 million. Such deposits are included in our aforementioned 10 largest deposits. In connection with our participation in this program, the Bank purchased $38.5 million in letters of credit issued by FHLB as collateral at December 31, 2018.

Treasury Management Services. We offer treasury management products to our customers which are designed to provide a high level of specialized support to the operations of business customers. This is especially important for customers such as 1031 Exchange companies, property management companies, developers, attorneys, accountants, manufacturers and real estate contractors that have specialized deposit service needs. Treasury management has four basic functions: deposit handling, funds concentration, funds disbursement and information reporting. The treasury management services we offer include automatic transfer (sweep) of funds between accounts or lines of credit, automated clearing house services (e.g., direct deposit, direct debit and electronic cash concentration and disbursement), lockbox, zero balance accounts, current and prior day transaction reporting, bank statement retrieval, reconciliation services, fraud prevention tools and account analysis. We emphasize responsive, courteous customer service and we send fully-trained staff to our customers’ businesses to set-up their services, so they may fully benefit from the treasury management services we offer.

Online Banking. We are committed to technology and e-commerce in its broadest terms and as it directly applies to financial service providers. To best serve our customers’ needs, we offer complete banking services online. Although our customers are always able to discuss specific banking needs with a knowledgeable service representative available in our offices, we offer our customers the option to conduct banking activities from our secure website – www.firstchoicebankca.com. Our website is designed to be user-friendly and expedites customer transactions. There are multiple types of online banking services for consumer, small business and for commercial customers. All online banking systems allow our customers the ability to conveniently access their accounts 7-days-a-week, 24-hours-a-day to obtain loan information and complete many common transactions including electronic bill pay, data download, transfer funds, reorder checks, view images of the front and back of canceled checks, view deposits, view their account statements, change addresses and issue stop payment requests. The commercial online banking product provides additional treasury management features, which allow customers to set up varied levels of security and assign access to a number of employees, with different levels of access/security for each person. Commercial online customers can view their accounts online, transfer funds from one of their accounts to another, place stop payments, initiate wire transfers, initiate Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) debits and credits, pay state and federal taxes electronically, export information to Quicken®, QuickBooks®, or Excel Spreadsheets and utilize robust reporting tool features. We also offer ACH and Check Positive Pay antifraud services which allows a business to review their ACH debit transactions and/or all of their issued checks daily and then provides them with the ability to pay or reject any item.

We are sensitive to the privacy and security concerns of our customers, especially where internet banking is concerned. Accordingly, we have put in place various procedures designed to maintain appropriate security levels. The vendors who support our internet banking platform work with us to enhance the security of these services. Our responsibility to our customers is to select appropriate hardware and software in the context of the right vendor relationships to provide the best assurance we can to our customers that, subject to applicable law, we can protect their privacy and finances.

Mobile Banking. We offer mobile banking service to consumer and business customers. The mobile banking applications allow customers to access their account information, make transfers, deposit checks, manage their debit card security and pay bills while on the go and from the convenience of their registered mobile device.

Remote Deposit. For the convenience of and to better serve our customers, we offer qualified commercial customers a state of the art remote deposit capture (“RDC”) product that allows businesses to process check deposits on a daily basis from the convenience of their location. We believe RDC, as well as the other customer convenience services that we offer, allows us to offer a marketable, different and competitive package of services to our business customers. At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 242 customers utilizing RDC.

Other Services. In addition to a full complement of lending and deposit products and related services, we provide customers, through other providers, access to Automated Teller Machines (“ATM’s”) using their Visa® EMV Debit Cards; 
11

bank-by-mail, courier services, commercial cash vault services, domestic and international wires, credit cards and international services. We reimburse customers for surcharges for any transactions conducted on another bank’s ATM’s.
Market Area and Competition

Our primary market area includes the seven Southern California Counties, composed of Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, Ventura, Riverside, San Bernardino and Imperial. The economic base of the area is heavily dependent on small- and medium-sized businesses. Our relationship management team consists of experienced bankers involved with the business communities in their market areas. Their business development efforts are augmented by referrals from our Board of Directors and existing customers. The members of our management team, in particular, are well experienced in business lending, supporting middle-market banking needs, and generating value-added banking services to small- and medium-sized businesses.

The banking business in California is highly competitive with respect to both loans and deposits and is dominated by a relatively small number of major financial institutions with many offices operating over a wide geographic area, including institutions based outside of California. The increasingly competitive environment faced by banks is a result primarily of changes in laws and regulations, changes in technology and product delivery systems, the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers and the emergence of non-regulated financial technology companies. We compete for loans and deposits with other commercial banks, as well as with finance companies, credit unions, securities and brokerage companies, money market funds and other non-financial institutions. Larger financial institutions offer certain services (such as trust services or wealth management) that we do not offer. These institutions also have the ability to finance extensive advertising campaigns. By virtue of their greater total capitalization, such institutions also have substantially higher lending limits than we have.

Our ability to compete is based primarily on our ability to develop a relationship, built upon customer service and responsiveness to customer needs. Our “preferred lender” status with the Small Business Administration allows us to approve SBA loans faster than many of our competitors. We distinguish ourselves with the availability and accessibility of our senior management to customers and prospects. In addition, our knowledge of our markets and industries assists us in locating, recruiting and retaining customers. Our ability to compete also depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain our senior management and experienced relationship managers.

Legal Proceedings

In the normal course of business, we are named or threatened to be named as a defendant in various lawsuits. Management, following consultation with legal counsel, does not expect the ultimate disposition of any or a combination of these matters to have a material adverse effect on our business. However, given the nature, scope and complexity of the extensive legal and regulatory landscape applicable to our business (including laws and regulations governing consumer protection, fair lending, fair labor, privacy, information security and anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws), we, like all banking organizations, are subject to heightened legal and regulatory compliance and litigation risk.
Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company

We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). An emerging growth company may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements and is relieved of certain other significant requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies. As an emerging growth company:

• | we may present as few as two years of audited financial statements and two years of related management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations;


• | we are exempt from the requirement to obtain an attestation and report from our auditors on management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;


• | we are permitted to provide less extensive disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements; and


• | we are not required to give our shareholders non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.

We have elected to take advantage of the reduced disclosure requirements relating to executive compensation and the number of years of financial information presented, and in the future we may take advantage of any or all of these 
12

exemptions for so long as we remain an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the end of the fiscal year during which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.0 billion or more, (ii) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering which would be December 31, 2023, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt, and (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

In addition to the relief described above, the JOBS Act provided an optional extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards affecting public companies. We have irrevocably opted to decline this extended transition period, which means that the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as any consolidated financial statements that we file in the future, will be subject to all new or revised accounting standards generally applicable to public companies.
Employees
At December 31, 2018, we had 177 full time equivalent ("FTE") employees.

Regulation and Supervision
Banks and bank holding companies are heavily regulated by federal and state laws and regulations.  Most banking regulations are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the deposit insurance fund and not for the benefit of shareholders.  The following is a summary of certain statutes, regulations and regulatory guidance affecting the Company and the Bank.  This summary is not intended to be a complete explanation of such statutes, regulations and guidance, all of which are subject to change in the future, nor does it fully address their effects and potential effects on the Company and the Bank.
Regulation of the Company Generally
The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and its other subsidiaries.  As a bank holding company, the Company is regulated under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 ("BHC Act"), and is subject to supervision, regulation and inspection by the Federal Reserve Board.  The Company is also subject to certain provisions of the California Financial Code which are applicable to bank holding companies.  In addition, the Company is under the jurisdiction of the SEC and is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each administered by the SEC.  The Company’s common stock is listed on the NASDAQ with “FCBP” as its trading symbol, and the Company is subject to the rules of NASDAQ for listed companies.
The Company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the BHC Act and is registered as such with the Federal Reserve Board.  A bank holding company is required to file annual reports and other information with the Federal Reserve regarding its business operations and those of its subsidiaries.  In general, the BHC Act limits the business of bank holding companies to banking, managing or controlling banks and other activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto, including securities brokerage services, investment advisory services, fiduciary services, and management advisory and data processing services, among others.  A bank holding company that also qualifies as and elects to become a “financial holding company” may engage in a broader range of activities that are financial in nature or complementary to a financial activity (as determined by the Federal Reserve or Treasury regulations), such as securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and agency, and making merchant 
13

banking investments.  The Company has not elected to become a financial holding company but may do so at some point in the future if deemed appropriate in view of opportunities or circumstances at the time.
The BHC Act requires the prior approval of the FRB for the direct or indirect acquisition of more than five percent of the voting shares of a commercial bank or its parent holding company. Acquisitions by the Bank are subject instead to the Bank Merger Act, which requires the prior approval of an acquiring bank’s primary federal regulator for any merger with or acquisition of another bank.  Acquisitions by both the Company and the Bank also require the prior approval of the DBO pursuant to the California Financial Code.
The Company and the Bank are deemed to be “affiliates” of each other and thus are subject to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act as well as related Federal Reserve Regulation W which impose both quantitative and qualitative restrictions and limitations on transactions between affiliates.  The Bank is also subject to laws and regulations requiring that all extensions of credit to our executive officers, directors, principal shareholders and related parties must, among other things, be made on substantially the same terms and follow credit underwriting procedures no less stringent than those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not related to the Bank.
A bank holding company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for its subsidiary banks and must commit resources as necessary to support such subsidiaries. Under certain conditions, the Federal Reserve has the authority to restrict the payment of cash dividends by a bank holding company as an unsafe and unsound banking practice and may require a bank holding company to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve prior to purchasing or redeeming its own equity securities. The Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to contribute additional capital to an undercapitalized subsidiary bank and may disapprove of the holding company’s payment of dividends to the shareholders in such circumstances. The Federal Reserve also has the authority to regulate the debt of bank holding companies.
Regulation of the Bank Generally
As a state-chartered member bank, the Bank is subject to broad federal regulation and oversight extending to all its operations by the FDIC and to state regulation by the DBO.  The Bank is also subject to certain regulations of the Federal Reserve Board.
Capital Adequacy Requirements. The Company and the Bank are subject to the regulations of the Federal Reserve Board governing capital adequacy.  This agency has adopted risk-based capital guidelines to provide a systematic analytical framework that imposes regulatory capital requirements based on differences in risk profiles among banking organizations, considers off-balance sheet exposures in evaluating capital adequacy, and minimizes disincentives to holding liquid, low-risk assets.  Capital levels, as measured by these standards, are also used to categorize financial institutions for purposes of certain prompt corrective action regulatory provisions.
Pursuant to the adoption of final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s capital guidelines for all U.S. banks and bank holding companies with more than $500 million in assets, minimum regulatory requirements for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Company and the Bank increased effective January 1, 2015.  Furthermore, a capital class known as Common Equity Tier 1 ("CET1") capital was established in addition to Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, and most financial institutions were given the option of a one-time election to continue to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) from regulatory capital.  The Company has exercised its option to exclude AOCI from regulatory capital.  The final rules also increased capital requirements for certain categories of assets, including higher-risk construction and real estate loans, certain past-due or nonaccrual loans, and certain exposures related to securitizations.  The final rules permanently grandfather non-qualifying capital instruments (such as trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock) issued before May 19, 2010 for inclusion in the Tier 1 capital of banking organizations with total consolidated assets of less than $15 billion at December 31, 2009, subject to a limit of 25% of Tier 1 capital.  
Common Equity Tier 1 capital includes common stock, additional paid-in capital, and retained earnings, less the following: disallowed goodwill and intangibles, disallowed deferred tax assets, and any insufficient additional capital to cover the deductions.  Tier 1 capital is generally defined as the sum of core capital elements, less the following:  goodwill and other intangible assets, accumulated other comprehensive income, disallowed deferred tax assets, and certain other deductions.  The following items are defined as core capital elements:  (i) common shareholders’ equity; (ii) qualifying non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus (and, in the case of holding companies, senior perpetual preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury Department pursuant to the Troubled Asset Relief Program); (iii) minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries; and (iv) “restricted” core capital elements (which include qualifying trust preferred securities) up to 25% of all core capital elements.  Tier 2 capital includes the following supplemental capital elements: (i) allowance for loan and lease losses (but not more than 1.25% of an institution’s risk-weighted assets); (ii) 
14

perpetual preferred stock and related surplus not qualifying as core capital; (iii) hybrid capital instruments, perpetual debt and mandatory convertible debt instruments; and, (iv) term subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred stock and related surplus.  The maximum amount of Tier 2 capital is capped at 100% of Tier 1 capital.  
The final rules established a regulatory minimum of 4.5% for common equity Tier 1 capital to total risk weighted assets (“Common Equity Tier 1 RBC Ratio”), a minimum of 6.0% for Tier 1 capital to total risk weighted assets (“Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio” or “Tier 1 RBC Ratio”), a minimum of 8.0% for qualifying Tier 1 plus Tier 2 capital to total risk weighted assets (“Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio” or “Total RBC Ratio”), and a minimum of 4.0% for the Leverage Ratio, which is defined as Tier 1 capital to adjusted average assets (quarterly average assets less the disallowed capital items discussed above).  In addition to the other minimum risk-based capital standards the final rules also require a Common Equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer, which has been phased in over three years starting on January 1, 2016.  The capital conservation buffer was 0.625% for 2016, 1.25% for 2017, 1.875% for 2018 and has been fully phased in to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets beginning on January 1, 2019.  The buffer has effectively raised the minimum required Common Equity Tier 1 RBC Ratio to 7.0%, the Tier 1 RBC Ratio to 8.5%, and the Total RBC Ratio to 10.5%.  Institutions that do not maintain the required capital buffer will become subject to progressively more stringent limitations on the percentage of earnings that can be paid out in dividends or used for stock repurchases, and on the payment of discretionary bonuses to executive management.
Based on our capital levels at December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules on a fully phased-in basis.  For more information on the Company’s capital, see Part II, Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.  Risk-based capital ratio (“RBC”) requirements are discussed in greater detail in the following section.
Prompt Corrective Action Provisions. Federal law requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured financial institutions, including but not limited to those that fall below one or more of the prescribed minimum capital ratios.  The federal banking agencies have by regulation defined the following five capital categories: “well capitalized” (Total RBC Ratio of 10%; Tier 1 RBC Ratio of 8%; Common Equity Tier 1 RBC Ratio of 6.5%; and Leverage Ratio of 5%); “adequately capitalized” (Total RBC Ratio of 8%; Tier 1 RBC Ratio of 6%; Common Equity Tier 1 RBC Ratio of 4.5%; and Leverage Ratio of 4%); “undercapitalized” (Total RBC Ratio of less than 8%; Tier 1 RBC Ratio of less than 6%; Common Equity Tier 1 RBC Ratio of less than 4.5%; or Leverage Ratio of less than 4%); “significantly undercapitalized” (Total RBC Ratio of less than 6%; Tier 1 RBC Ratio of less than 4%; Common Equity Tier 1 RBC Ratio of less than 3%; or Leverage Ratio less than 3%); and “critically undercapitalized” (tangible equity to total assets less than or equal to 2%).  A bank may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if, after notice and the opportunity for a hearing, the appropriate federal agency finds an unsafe or unsound condition or practice merits a downgrade, but no bank may be treated as “critically undercapitalized” unless its actual tangible equity to assets ratio warrants such treatment.  As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, both the Company and the Bank were deemed to be well capitalized for regulatory capital purposes.

At each successively lower capital category, an insured bank is subject to increased restrictions on its operations.  For example, a bank is generally prohibited from paying management fees to any controlling persons or from making capital distributions if to do so would cause the bank to be “undercapitalized.”  Asset growth and branching restrictions apply to undercapitalized banks, which are required to submit written capital restoration plans meeting specified requirements (including a guarantee by the parent holding company, if any).  “Significantly undercapitalized” banks are subject to broad regulatory authority, including among other things capital directives, forced mergers, restrictions on the rates of interest they may pay on deposits, restrictions on asset growth and activities, and prohibitions on paying bonuses or increasing compensation to senior executive officers without FDIC approval.  Even more severe restrictions apply to “critically undercapitalized” banks.  Most importantly, except under limited circumstances, not later than 90 days after an insured bank becomes critically undercapitalized the appropriate federal banking agency is required to appoint a conservator or receiver for the bank.
In addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions, insured banks may be subject to potential actions by the federal regulators for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses or for violations of any law, rule, regulation or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency.  Enforcement actions may include the issuance of cease and desist orders, termination of insurance on deposits (in the case of a bank), the imposition of civil money penalties, the issuance of directives to increase capital, formal and informal agreements, or removal and prohibition orders against “institution-affiliated” parties.

The Potential for Community Bank Capital Simplification. Community banks have long raised concerns with bank regulators about the regulatory burden, complexity, and costs associated with certain provisions of the Basel III Rule.  In response, Congress provided a potential Basel III “off-ramp” for institutions, like the Company, with total 
15

consolidated assets of less than $10 billion.  Section 201 of the Regulatory Relief Act instructed the federal banking regulators to establish a single "Community Bank Leverage Ratio" (“CBLR”) of between 8 and 10%.  On November 21, 2018, the agencies proposed setting the CBLR at 9% of tangible equity to total assets for a qualifying bank to be well-capitalized.  Under the proposal, a community banking organization would be eligible to elect the new framework if it has less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, limited amounts of certain assets and off-balance sheet exposures, and a CBLR greater than 9%. The electing institution would not be required to calculate the existing risk-based and leverage capital requirements of the Basel III Rule and would not need to risk weight its assets for purposes of capital calculations. 
The Company is in the process of considering the CBLR proposal and will await the final regulation to determine whether it will elect the framework. 
Safety and Soundness Standards. The federal banking agencies have also adopted guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards for all insured depository institutions.  Those guidelines relate to internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan underwriting and documentation, compensation, and liquidity and interest rate exposure.  In general, the standards are designed to assist the federal banking agencies in identifying and addressing problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired.  If an institution fails to meet the requisite standards, the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to submit a compliance plan and could institute enforcement proceedings if an acceptable compliance plan is not submitted or followed.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Legislation and regulations enacted and implemented since 2008 in response to the U.S. economic downturn and financial industry instability continue to impact most institutions in the banking sector.  Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”), which was enacted in 2010, are now effective and have been fully implemented, including revisions to the deposit insurance assessment base for FDIC insurance and a permanent increase in coverage to $250,000; the permissibility of paying interest on business checking accounts; the removal of barriers to interstate branching; and, required disclosures and shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation.  Additional actions taken to implement Dodd-Frank provisions include (i) final capital rules, (ii) a final rule to implement the so called Volcker rule restrictions on certain proprietary trading and investment activities, and (iii) final rules and increased enforcement action by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (discussed further below in connection with consumer protection).
Some aspects of Dodd-Frank are still subject to rulemaking, making it difficult to anticipate the ultimate financial impact on the Company, its customers or the financial services industry more generally.  However, many provisions of Dodd-Frank are already affecting our operations and expenses, including but not limited to changes in FDIC assessments, the permitted payment of interest on demand deposits, and enhanced compliance requirements.  Some of the rules and regulations promulgated or yet to be promulgated under Dodd-Frank will apply directly only to institutions much larger than ours, but could indirectly impact smaller banks, either due to competitive influences or because certain required practices for larger institutions may subsequently become expected “best practices” for smaller institutions.  We could see continued attention and resources devoted by the Company to ensure compliance with the statutory and regulatory requirements engendered by Dodd-Frank. 
In reaction to the global financial crisis and particularly following the passage of the Dodd Frank Act, the Company experienced heightened regulatory requirements and scrutiny. Although the reforms primarily targeted systemically important financial service providers, their influence filtered down in varying degrees to community banks over time and caused the Company’s compliance and risk management processes, and the costs thereof, to increase. After the 2016 federal elections, momentum to decrease the regulatory burden on community banks gathered strength. In May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “Regulatory Relief Act”) was enacted to modify or remove certain financial reform rules and regulations. While the Regulatory Relief Act maintains most of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, it amends certain aspects of the regulatory framework for small depository institutions with assets of less than $10 billion, like the Company, and for large banks with assets of more than $50 billion. Many of these changes are intended to result in meaningful regulatory relief for community banks and their holding companies, including new rules that may make the capital requirements less complex.  For a discussion of capital requirements, see “-Capital Adequacy Requirements.” It also eliminated questions about the applicability of certain Dodd-Frank Act reforms to community bank systems, including relieving the Bank of any requirement to engage in mandatory stress tests or comply with the Volcker Rule’s complicated prohibitions on proprietary trading and ownership of private funds. The Company believes these reforms are favorable to its operations, but the true impact remains difficult to predict until rulemaking is complete and the reforms are fully implemented. 
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) was signed into law.  The Act makes significant changes that impact corporate taxation, including the reduction of the maximum federal income tax rate for corporations from 35% to 21% and changes or limitations to certain tax deductions.  The reduced tax rate has had a 
16

favorable impact on our tax expense beginning in 2018, and our effective income tax rate dropped to 29.8% in 2018 from 52.4% in 2017.  The tax rate reduction also resulted an adjustment to our deferred tax assets to reflect their value to us at the lower federal tax rate of 21%, with such revaluation required in the period in which the legislation was enacted.  As of December 31, 2018, we completed the accounting for the enactment of this comprehensive tax legislation. In accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118"), we performed an initial assessment and reasonably estimated the effects of the Act by recording a provisional income tax expense of $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. As required by SAB 118, we continued to evaluate and re-measure the impact of the Act on deferred tax amounts that existed at December 31, 2017 as new information concerning those deferred tax amounts became available during 2018. As a result, we recorded an income tax benefit of $226 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. Net deferred tax assets totaled $8.7 million and $4.5 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017.
Deposit Insurance. As an FDIC-insured institution, the Bank is required to pay deposit insurance premium assessments to the FDIC.  The FDIC has adopted a risk-based assessment system whereby FDIC-insured institutions pay insurance premiums at rates based on their risk classification.  For institutions like the Bank that are not considered large and highly complex banking organizations, assessments are now based on examination ratings and financial ratios. The total base assessment rates currently range from 1.5 basis points to 30 basis points. At least semi-annually, the FDIC updates its loss and income projections for the Deposit Insurance Fund ("DIF") and, if needed, increases or decreases the assessment rates, following notice and comment on proposed rulemaking. The assessment base against which an FDIC-insured institution’s deposit insurance premiums paid to the DIF has been calculated since effectiveness of the Dodd-Frank Act based on its average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity. This method shifted the burden of deposit insurance premiums toward those large depository institutions that rely on funding sources other than U.S. deposits.  
The reserve ratio is the FDIC insurance fund balance divided by estimated insured deposits. The Dodd-Frank Act altered the minimum reserve ratio of the DIF, increasing the minimum from 1.15% to 1.35% of the estimated amount of total insured deposits, and eliminating the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to FDIC-insured institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds.  The reserve ratio reached 1.36% as of September 30, 2018 (most recent available), exceeding the statutory required minimum reserve ratio of 1.35%. The FDIC will provide assessment credits to insured depository institutions, like the Bank, with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion for their portion of their regular assessments that contribute to growth in the reserve ratio between 1.15% and 1.35%. The FDIC will apply the credits each quarter that the reserve ratio is at least 1.38% to offset the regular deposit insurance assessments of institutions with credits. The Bank is expecting to receive an assessment credit from the FDIC in 2019. 
FICO Assessments.  In addition to paying basic deposit insurance assessments, FDIC-insured institutions must pay FICO assessments. FICO is a mixed-ownership governmental corporation chartered by the former Federal Home Loan Bank Board pursuant to the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 to function as a financing vehicle for the recapitalization of the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. FICO issued 30-year noncallable bonds of approximately 
$8.1 billion that mature in 2018 through 2019. FICO’s authority to issue bonds ended on December 12, 1991. Since 1996, federal legislation has required that all FDIC-insured institutions pay assessments to cover interest payments on FICO’s outstanding obligations. The Bank paid $26 thousand in FICO assessments in 2018.
Community Reinvestment Act. The Bank is subject to certain requirements and reporting obligations involving the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) activities.  The CRA generally requires federal banking agencies to evaluate the record of a financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its local communities, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA further requires the agencies to consider a financial institution’s efforts in meeting its community credit needs when evaluating applications for, among other things, domestic branches, mergers or acquisitions, or the formation of holding companies.  In measuring a bank’s compliance with its CRA obligations, the regulators utilize a performance-based evaluation system under which CRA ratings are determined by the bank’s actual lending, service, and investment performance, rather than on the extent to which the institution conducts needs assessments, documents community outreach activities or complies with other procedural requirements.  In connection with its assessment of CRA performance, the federal regulatory agencies assign a rating of “outstanding,” “satisfactory,” “needs to improve” or “substantial noncompliance.”  The Bank received a “satisfactory” rating in its most recent CRA evaluation. 
Privacy and Data Security. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, also known as the Financial Modernization Act of 1999 (the “Financial Modernization Act”), imposed requirements on financial institutions with respect to consumer privacy.  Financial institutions, however, are required to comply with state law if it is more protective of consumer privacy than the Financial Modernization Act.  The Financial Modernization Act generally prohibits disclosure of consumer information to non-affiliated third parties unless the consumer has been given the opportunity to object and has not objected to such disclosure.  The statute also directed federal regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, to establish standards for the security of consumer information, and requires financial institutions to disclose their privacy policies to consumers annually.
17

In June 2018, California adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), effective January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives “consumers” (defined as natural persons who are California residents) four basic rights in relation to their personal information:

1. | the right to know, through a general privacy policy and with more specifics available upon request, what personal information a business has collected about them, where it was sourced from, what it is being used for, whether it is being disclosed or sold, and to whom it is being disclosed or sold;


2. | the right to “opt out” of allowing a business to sell their personal information to third parties (or, for consumers who are under 16 years old, the right not to have their personal information sold absent their, or their parent’s, opt-in);


3. | the right to have a business delete their personal information, with some exceptions; and


4. | the right to receive equal service and pricing from a business, even if they exercise their privacy rights under the CCPA.

The CCPA can be enforced by the California Attorney General, subject to a thirty-day cure period. The civil penalty for intentional violations of the CCPA is up to $7,500 per violation.
The CCPA also provides a private right of action that allows consumers to seek, either individually or as a class, statutory or actual damages and injunctive and other relief, if their sensitive personal information (more narrowly defined than under the rest of the CCPA) is subject to unauthorized access and exfiltration, theft or disclosure as a result of a business’s failure to implement and maintain required reasonable security procedures. Statutory damages can be between $100 and $750 per California resident per incident, or actual damages, whichever is greater.
In September 2018, California adopted amendments to the CCPA. In particular, the bill clarifies the exemption for personal information that is regulated under the Financial Modernization Act and adds an exemption for personal information regulated under the California Financial Information Privacy Act. These two statutes also regulate the privacy of consumer financial information.
Consumer Financial Protection and Financial Privacy. Dodd-Frank created the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) as an independent entity with broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services including deposit products, residential mortgages, home-equity loans and credit cards.  The CFPB’s functions include investigating consumer complaints, conducting market research, rulemaking, supervising and examining bank consumer transactions, and enforcing rules related to consumer financial products and services.  CFPB regulations and guidance apply to all financial institutions, including the Bank, although only banks with $10 billion or more in assets are subject to examination by the CFPB.  Banks with less than $10 billion in assets, including the Bank, are examined for compliance by their primary federal banking agency.
In January 2013, the CFPB issued final regulations governing consumer mortgage lending.  Certain rules which became effective in January 2014 impose additional requirements on lenders, including the directive that lenders need to ensure the ability of their borrowers to repay mortgages.  The CFPB also finalized a rule on escrow accounts for higher priced mortgage loans and a rule expanding the scope of the high-cost mortgage provision in the Truth in Lending Act.  The CFPB also issued final rules implementing provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that relate to mortgage servicing.  In November 2013 the CFPB issued a final rule on integrated and simplified mortgage disclosures under the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, which became effective in October 2015.
The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial laws that apply to all banks, including, among other things, the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices.  Abusive acts or practices are defined as those that materially interfere with a consumer’s ability to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service or take unreasonable advantage of a consumer’s:  (i) lack of financial savvy, (ii) inability to protect himself in the selection or use of consumer financial products or services, or (iii) reasonable reliance on a covered entity to act in the consumer’s interests.
In addition, as is the case with all financial institutions, the Bank is required to maintain the privacy of its customers’ non-public, personal information.  Such privacy requirements direct financial institutions to:  (i) provide notice to customers regarding privacy policies and practices; (ii) inform customers regarding the conditions under which their non-public personal information may be disclosed to non-affiliated third parties; and (iii) give customers an option to prevent disclosure of such information to non-affiliated third parties.
The Bank continues to be subject to numerous other federal and state consumer protection laws that extensively govern its relationship with its customers.  Those laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability 
18

Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act, and respective state-law counterparts to these laws, as well as state usury laws and laws regarding unfair and deceptive acts and practices.  These and other laws require disclosures including the cost of credit and terms of deposit accounts, provide substantive consumer rights, prohibit discrimination in credit transactions, regulate the use of credit report information, provide financial privacy protections, prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive practices, restrict the Company’s ability to raise interest rates and otherwise subject the Company to substantial regulatory oversight.
Identity Theft. Under the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (the “FACT Act”), the Bank is required to develop and implement a written Identity Theft Prevention Program to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft “red flags” in connection with certain existing accounts or the opening of certain accounts.  Under the FACT Act, the Bank is required to adopt reasonable policies and procedures to (i) identify relevant red flags for covered accounts and incorporate those red flags into the program; (ii) detect red flags that have been incorporated into the program; (iii) respond appropriately to any red flags that are detected to prevent and mitigate identity theft; and (iv) ensure the program is updated periodically, to reflect changes in risks to customers or to the safety and soundness of the financial institution or creditor from identity theft.  The Bank maintains a program to meet the requirements of the FACT Act and the Bank believes it is currently in compliance with these requirements.
Interstate Banking and Branching. The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (the “Interstate Act”), together with Dodd-Frank, relaxed prior interstate branching restrictions under federal law by permitting, subject to regulatory approval, state and federally chartered commercial banks to establish branches in states where the laws permit banks chartered in such states to establish branches.  The Interstate Act requires regulators to consult with community organizations before permitting an interstate institution to close a branch in a low-income area.  Federal banking agency regulations prohibit banks from using their interstate branches primarily for deposit production and the federal banking agencies have implemented a loan-to-deposit ratio screen to ensure compliance with this prohibition.  Dodd-Frank effectively eliminated the prohibition under California law against interstate branching through de novo establishment of California branches.  Interstate branches are subject to certain laws of the states in which they are located.  The Bank presently does not have any interstate branches.
USA Patriot Act of 2001. The impact of the USA Patriot Act of 2001 (the “Patriot Act”) on financial institutions of all kinds has been significant and wide ranging.  The Patriot Act substantially enhanced anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and required certain regulatory authorities to adopt rules that promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators, and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering.  Under the Patriot Act, financial institutions are subject to prohibitions regarding specified financial transactions and account relationships, as well as enhanced due diligence and “know your customer” standards in their dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers.  The Patriot Act also requires all financial institutions to establish anti-money laundering programs.  The Bank expanded its Bank Secrecy Act compliance staff and intensified due diligence procedures concerning the opening of new accounts to fulfill the anti-money laundering requirements of the Patriot Act, and also implemented systems and procedures to identify suspicious banking activity and report any such activity to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.
Incentive Compensation. In June 2010, the FRB and the FDIC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to help ensure that banking organizations do not undermine their own safety and soundness by encouraging excessive risk-taking.  The guidance, which covers all employees who have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization's board of directors.  The regulatory agencies will review, as part of their regular risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Company, that are not “large, complex banking organizations.”  Where appropriate, the regulatory agencies will take supervisory or enforcement action to address perceived deficiencies in an institution’s incentive compensation arrangements or related risk-management, control, and governance processes.  The Company believes that it is in compliance with the regulatory guidance on incentive compensation policies.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Company is subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley”) which addresses, among other issues, (i) corporate governance and disclosure issues, including the controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, (ii) certification of financial statements by the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer, (iii) auditing and accounting, (iv) forfeiture of bonuses and profits made by directors and senior officers in the 12-month period covered by restated financial statements, (v) a prohibition on insider trading during black-out periods, (vi) disclosure of off-balance sheet transactions, and (vii) accelerated share transaction filing requirements for

officers and directors. In addition, Sarbanes-Oxley increased penalties for non-compliance with the Exchange Act of 1934.  SEC rules, promulgated pursuant to Sarbanes-Oxley, impose obligations and restrictions on auditors and audit committees with the intention of enhancing their independence from management, and include extensive additional disclosure, corporate governance and other related rules.
Commercial Real Estate Lending Concentrations. As a part of their regulatory oversight, the federal regulators have issued guidelines on sound risk management practices with respect to a financial institution’s concentrations in commercial real estate (“CRE”) lending activities.  These guidelines were issued in response to the agencies’ concerns that rising CRE concentrations might expose institutions to unanticipated earnings and capital volatility in the event of adverse changes in the commercial real estate market.  The guidelines identify certain concentration levels that, if exceeded, will expose the institution to additional supervisory analysis with regard to the institution’s CRE concentration risk.  The guidelines are designed to promote appropriate levels of capital and sound loan and risk management practices for institutions with a concentration of CRE loans.  In general, the guidelines establish the following supervisory criteria as preliminary indications of possible CRE concentration risk: (1) the institution’s total construction, land development and other land loans represent 100% or more of total risk-based capital; or (2) total CRE loans as defined in the regulatory guidelines represent 300% or more of total risk-based capital, and the institution’s CRE loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the prior 36 month period.  The Bank believes that the guidelines are applicable to it, as it has a relatively high concentration in CRE loans.  The Bank and its Board of Directors have discussed the guidelines and believe that the Bank’s underwriting policies, management information systems, independent credit administration process, and monitoring of real estate loan concentrations are sufficient to address the guidelines.
Other Pending and Proposed Legislation. Other legislative and regulatory initiatives which could affect the Company, the Bank and the banking industry in general are pending, and additional initiatives may be proposed or introduced before the United States Congress, the California legislature and other governmental bodies in the future.  Such proposals, if enacted, may further alter the structure, regulation and competitive relationship among financial institutions, and may subject the Company or Bank to increased regulation, disclosure and reporting requirements.  In addition, the various banking regulatory agencies often adopt new rules and regulations to implement and enforce existing legislation.  It cannot be predicted whether, or in what form, any such legislation or regulations may be enacted or the extent to which the business of the Company or the Bank would be affected thereby.
