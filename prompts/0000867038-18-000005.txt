Item 1. Description of Business
GENERAL 
 
Spindletop Oil & Gas Co. is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration, development, production and acquisition of oil and natural gas; the rental of oilfield equipment; and through one of its subsidiaries, the gathering and marketing of natural gas. The terms the "Company", "We", "Us" or “Spindletop” are used interchangeably herein to refer to Spindletop Oil & Gas Co. (“Spindletop”, “SOG”) and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Spindletop Drilling Company ("SDC"), and Prairie Pipeline Co. (“PPC”).
 
The Company has focused its oil and gas operations principally in Texas, although we operate properties in six states including: Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Louisiana, Alabama and Arkansas. We operate a majority of our projects through the drilling and production phases. Our staff has a great deal of experience in the operations arena. We have traditionally leveraged the risks associated with drilling by obtaining industry partners to share in the costs.
 
In addition, the Company, through PPC, owns several miles of pipelines associated with Company operated oil and natural gas properties in Texas and other states, which are used for the gathering of natural gas. These gathering lines are located in the Fort Worth Basin and are being utilized to transport the Company's natural gas as well as natural gas produced by third parties.

We make available free of charge through our website, www.spindletopoil.com, our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information on our website is not a part of this report.
Operating Approach
 
We believe that a major attribute of the Company is its long history with, and extensive knowledge of, the Fort Worth Basin of Texas. Our technical staff has an average of over 24 years oil and gas experience, most of it in the Fort Worth Basin.
 
One of our strengths has been the ability of the Company to look at cost effective ways to grow our production. We have traditionally increased our reserve base in one of two ways. Initially, in the 1970s and 1980s, the Company obtained its production through an exploration and development drilling program focused principally in the Fort Worth Basin of North Texas. Today, the Company has retained many of these wells as producing properties and holds a large amount of acreage by production in that Basin.
 
From the 1990s through 2003, the Company took advantage of the lower product prices by cost effectively adding to its reserve base through value-priced acquisitions. We found that through selective purchases we could make producing property acquisitions that were more cost effective than drilling.
 
During this time period, the Company acquired a large number of operated and non-operated oil and gas properties in various states.
 
From 2003 through the fourth quarter of 2008, we returned our focus to a strategy of development drilling with an emphasis on our Barnett Shale acreage. Since 2009, our focus has evolved to seek value-priced acquisitions combined with the development of economically feasible drilling prospects. Currently we are continuing our efforts to acquire producing properties and develop our leasehold acreage. We are pursuing controlled growth through acquisitions of good quality producing properties as well as through the drilling of new wells. With current oil and natural gas prices and high costs to produce, we believe that it is prudent to carefully evaluate all our options and make sure that each transaction can be supported in today’s price environment.

Strategic Business Plans
 
One of our key strategies is to attempt to maintain shareholder value through implementation of plans for selective drilling and value priced acquisitions to the extent the economics of such projects work in this low energy price environment and development of assets. The Company's long-term focus is to grow its oil and natural gas production through a strategic combination of selected property acquisitions, divestitures, and a development program primarily based on developing its leasehold acreage. Additionally, the Company plans to continue to rework existing wells to increase production and reserves when feasible.
 
The Company's primary area of operation has been in the State of Texas with an emphasis in the geological province known as the Fort Worth Basin. We plan to continue to focus on operations in Texas, and we want to capitalize on our strengths which include an extensive knowledge of the various reservoirs in Texas, experience in operations in this geographic area, development of lease holdings, and utilization of existing infrastructure to minimize costs.
 
The Company will continue to generate and evaluate prospects using its own technical staff. The Company intends to fund operations primarily from cash flow generated by its operations.
 
Project Significant Areas
 
The Company owns various interests in wells located in 14 states and the Company’s operations are currently located in 6 of those states which include Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Texas.
 
The Company holds approximately 88,130 gross acres under lease in 14 states. The majority of the leases are held by production. A breakout of the Company’s leasehold acreage by geographic area is as follows:

North Texas - Fort Worth Basin & Bend Arch
 
The Fort Worth Basin-Bend Arch Province has been a focal point of the Company since its inception. Our technical personnel have an average of over 24 years of exploration, drilling, completing, and production experience extracting natural gas and oil from both conventional and unconventional hydrocarbon deposits found across the basin. Furthermore, the Company maintains comprehensive and extensive dossiers of geologic and engineering data gathered from the province.
 
The Fort Worth Basin-Bend Arch Province is a major United States onshore natural gas-prone expanse containing multiple pay zones that range in depth from one thousand to nine thousand (1,000-9,000) feet. Improved technical advances in fracturing and stimulation technologies have helped unlock natural gas and oil reserves from the hydrocarbon bearing Barnett Shale Formation; and thus, continue to bolster vigorous exploration and development activities that target these conventional and unconventional reservoir reserves throughout the province.
 
The Barnett Shale is a thick natural gas and oil bearing stratigraphic zone found throughout the Fort Worth Basin-Bend Arch Province. The natural gas reserves in place are significant; however, as a consequence of the extreme low permeability character of the shales, it has been technically challenging to produce these reserves. According to the United States Geological Survey assessment, an estimated 26.7 trillion cubic feet (TCF) of undiscovered natural gas, 98.5 MMBO of undiscovered oil, as well as a mean of 1.1 BBNGL of undiscovered natural gas liquids reserves remain within the 54,000 square mile Fort Worth Basin-Bend Arch Province. More than 98 percent or approximately 26.2 TCF of the undiscovered natural gas is contained in the organic-rich Mississippian Barnett Shale. Combined, recent advances in hydraulic fracturing, completion procedures, and improvements in pump technology, as well as refined horizontal well drilling technologies, continue to enable the economic recovery of natural gas and oil reserves from tight low-permeability reservoirs found throughout the Fort Worth Basin-Bend Arch Province. Undiscovered conventional reservoir natural gas reserves are estimated to be 467 billion cubic feet of gas (BCFG), the majority of which is dissolved in conventional oil accumulations (source: United States Geological Survey Energy Resource Program).

The Company has 14,996 gross acres under lease across the prolific Fort Worth Basin-Bend Arch Province, the majority of which is held by production from the more shallow producing zones. The Company uses recent and emerging technologies, as well as proven industry practices, to develop and produce oil and natural gas from its properties. Additionally, the Company has a dedicated and well-trained team of employees and professional staff that continually seek out low-risk profitable drilling and acquisition opportunities throughout the Fort Worth Basin-Bend Arch Province.

Oil and Natural Gas Reserves
 
The Company’s net proved oil and natural gas reserves have been estimated by Company personnel. (See footnote 17 to the financial statements). No separate independent reserve report analysis has been prepared by an independent third party.
 
The net proved crude oil and natural gas reserves of the Company as of December 31, 2017 were 308,940 barrels of oil and condensate and 7.173 BCF of natural gas. Based on SEC guidelines, the reserves were classified as follows:
 

 | Barrels of Oil | BCF Gas
-------------------------------+----------------+--------
Proved Developed Producing | 308,940 | 7.173 
Proved Developed Non-Producing | - | - 
Proved Undeveloped | - | - 
Total Proved Reserves | 308,940 | 7.173 

 
Only reserves that fell within the Proved classification were considered. Other categories such as Probable or Possible Reserves were not considered. No value was given to the potential future development of behind pipe reserves, untested fault blocks, or the potential for deeper reservoirs underlying the Company's properties. Shut-in uneconomic wells and insignificant non-operated interests were excluded.
 
On a BOE (barrel of oil equivalent) basis (6 MCF/BOE), the net reserves are:
 

 | Barrels of Oil Equivalent (BOE) | 
-------------------------------+---------------------------------+-----
Natural Gas Reserves | 1,195,572 | 79% 
Oil Reserves | 308,940 | 21% 
Total Reserves | 1,504,512 | 100%
Proved Developed Producing | 1,504,512 | 100%
Proved Developed Non-Producing | - | 0% 
Proved Undeveloped | - | 0% 
Total Proved Reserves | 1,504,512 | 100%

Financial Information Relating to Industry Segments
 
The Company has three identifiable business segments: (1) exploration, acquisition, development and production of oil and natural gas, (2) natural gas gathering, and (3) commercial real estate investment. Footnote 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements filed herein sets forth the relevant information regarding revenues, income from operations, and identifiable assets for these segments.
Narrative Description of Business
 
The Company is engaged in the exploration, development, acquisition and production of oil and natural gas, and the gathering and marketing of natural gas. The Company is also engaged in commercial real estate leasing through leasing office space to non-related third party tenants in the Company’s corporate headquarters office building.
Principal Products, Distribution and Availability
 
The principal products marketed by the Company are crude oil and natural gas which are sold to major oil and gas companies, brokers, pipelines and distributors, and oil and natural gas properties which are acquired and sold to oil and natural gas development entities. Reserves of oil and natural gas are depleted upon extraction, and the Company is in competition with other entities for the discovery of new prospects.
 
The Company is also engaged in the gathering and marketing of natural gas through its subsidiary PPC, which owns several miles of pipelines in various states. Natural gas is gathered for a fee. Substantially all of the natural gas gathered by the Company is produced from wells that the Company operates and in which it owns a working interest.
 
The Company owns land and a two story commercial office building in Dallas, Texas, which it uses as its principal headquarters office. The Company leases the remainder of the building to non-related third party commercial tenants at prevailing market rates.
 
Patents, Licenses and Franchises
 
Oil and natural gas leases of the Company are obtained from the owner of the mineral estate. The leases are generally for a primary term of one or more years, and often have extension options for an equivalent period as the original primary term for payment of additional bonus consideration. The leases customarily provide for extension beyond their primary term for as long as oil and natural gas are produced in commercial quantities or other operations are conducted on such leases as provided by the terms of the leases.
 
The Company currently holds interests in producing and non-producing oil and natural gas leases. The existence of the oil and natural gas leases and the terms of the oil and natural gas leases are important to the business of the Company because future additions to reserves will come from oil and natural gas leases currently owned by the Company, and others that may be acquired, when they are proven to be productive. The Company is continuing to purchase oil and natural gas leases in areas where it currently has production, and also in other areas.

Prospective Drilling Activities
 
The Company's primary oil and natural gas prospect generation and acquisition efforts have been in known producing areas in the United States with emphasis devoted to Texas.
 
The Company intends to use a portion of its available funds to participate in drilling activities. The Company does not own any drilling rigs. Independent drilling contractors perform all drilling activity. The Company does not refine or otherwise process its oil and natural gas production.
 
Exploration for oil and natural gas is normally conducted with the Company acquiring undeveloped oil and natural gas leases under prospects, and carrying out exploratory drilling on the prospective leasehold with the Company retaining a majority interest in the prospect. Interests in the property are sometimes sold to key employees and associated companies at cost. Also, interests may be sold to third parties with the Company retaining an overriding royalty interest, carried working interest, or a reversionary interest.
 
A prospect is a geographical area designated by the Company for the purpose of searching for oil and natural gas reserves and reasonably expected by it to contain at least one oil or natural gas reservoir. The Company utilizes its own funds along with the issuance of common stock and options to purchase common stock in some limited cases, to acquire oil and gas leases covering the lands comprising the prospects. These leases are selected by the Company and are obtained directly from the landowners, as well as from land men, geologists, other oil companies, some of whom may be affiliated with the Company, and by direct purchase, farm-in, or option agreements. After an initial test well is drilled on a property, any subsequent development drilling of such prospect will normally require the Company to fund the development activities.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, the Company employed or contracted for the services of a total of approximately 54 people. The Company has 19 full-time employees. The remainder are part-time employees or independent contractors. We believe that our relationships with our employees are good.
 
In order to effectively utilize our resources, we employ the services of independent consultants and contractors to perform a variety of professional, technical, and field services, including in the areas of lease acquisition, land related documentation and contracts, drilling and completion work, pumping, inspection, testing, maintenance and specialized services. We believe that it can be more cost effective to utilize the services of consultants and independent contractors for some of these services.
 
We depend to a large extent on the services of certain key management personnel and officers, and the loss of any these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our operations. The Company does not maintain key-man life insurance policies on its employees.
 
Financial information about foreign and domestic operations and export sales
 
All of the Company's business is conducted domestically, with no export sales.
 
Compliance with Environmental Regulations
 
Our oil and natural gas operations are subject to numerous United States federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharge of materials into the water and air, the generation, management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and clean-up of contaminated sites. We could incur material costs, including clean-up costs, fines, civil and criminal sanctions, and third party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations not only expose us to liability for our own activities, but may also expose us to liability for the conduct of others or for actions by us that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. In addition, we could incur substantial expenditures complying with environmental laws and regulations, including future environmental laws and regulations which may be more stringent.

"Present Value" ("PV") when used with respect to oil and natural gas reserves, means the estimated future gross revenues to be generated from the production of proved reserves calculated in accordance with the guidelines of the SEC, net of estimated production and future development costs as of the date of estimation without future escalation, and discounted using an annual discount rate of 10%. Prices are not escalated and are computed using a 12-month average price, calculated as the un-weighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the month price for each month of the year (except to the extent a contract specifically provides otherwise). No effect is given to non-property related expenses such as general and administrative expenses, debt service, future income tax expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization.
 
"Productive Wells" or "Producing Wells" consist of producing wells and wells capable of production, including wells waiting on pipeline connections.
 
"Proved Developed Reserves" means reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Additional oil and natural gas expected to be obtained through the application of fluid injection or other improved recovery techniques for supplementing the natural forces and mechanisms of primary recovery will be included as "proved developed reserves" only after testing by a pilot project or after the operation of an installed program has confirmed through production response that increased recovery will be achieved.
 
"Proved Reserves" means the estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas which upon analysis of geological and engineering data appear with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions, i.e., prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made. Prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements, but not on escalations based upon future conditions.
 
(i) Reservoirs are considered proved if either actual production or conclusive formation
 tests support economic producability. The area of a reservoir considered proved
 includes (A) that portion delineated by drilling and defined by gas-oil and/or oil-water
 contacts, if any; and (B) the immediately adjoining portions not yet drilled, but which
 can be reasonably judged as economically productive on the basis of available geological
 and engineering data. In the absence of information on fluid contacts, the lowest known
 structural occurrence of hydrocarbons controls the lower proved limit of the reservoir.
 
(ii) Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery
 techniques (such as fluid injection) are included in the "proved" classification when successful
 testing by a pilot project, or the operation of an installed program in the reservoir, provides
 support for the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based.

(iii) Estimates of proved reserves do not include the following: (A) oil that may become
 available from known reservoirs but is classified separately as "indicated additional reserves";
 (B) crude oil and natural gas, the recovery of which is subject to reasonable doubt because of
 uncertainty as to geology, reservoir characteristics or economic factors; (C) crude oil and
 natural gas that may occur in undrilled prospects; and (D) crude oil and natural gas that may
 be recovered from oil shales, coal, gilsonite and other such resources.
 
"Proved Undeveloped Reserves" means reserves that are recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for completion. Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those drilling units offsetting productive units that are reasonably certain of production when drilled. Proved reserves for other undrilled units can be claimed only where it can be demonstrated with certainty that there is continuity of production from the existing productive formation. Under no circumstances should estimates for proved undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual tests in the area and in the same reservoir.
 
"Recompletion" means the completion for production of an existing well bore in another formation from that in which the well has been previously completed.
 
"Reserves" means proved reserves.
 
"Reservoir" means a porous and permeable underground formation containing a natural accumulation of producible oil and/or gas that is confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is individual and separate from other reservoirs.
 
"Royalty" means an interest in an oil and natural gas lease that gives the owner of the interest the right to receive a portion of the production from the leased acreage (or of the proceeds of the sale thereof), but generally does not require the owner to pay any portion of the costs of drilling or operating the wells on the leased acreage. Royalties may be either landowner's royalties, which are reserved by the owner of the leased acreage at the time the lease is granted, or overriding royalties, which are usually reserved by an owner of the leasehold in connection with a transfer to a subsequent owner.
 
“TCF” means trillion cubic feet.
 
“TD” means total depth.
 
“TVD” means true vertical depth,
 
"2-D Seismic" means an advanced technology method by which a cross-section of the earth's subsurface is created through the interpretation of reflecting seismic data collected along a single source profile.
 
"3-D Seismic" means an advanced technology method by which a three dimensional image of the earth's subsurface is created through the interpretation of reflection seismic data collected over a surface grid. 3-D seismic surveys allow for a more detailed understanding of the subsurface than do conventional surveys and contribute significantly to field appraisal, development and production.
 
"Working Interest" means an interest in an oil and natural gas lease that gives the owner of the interest the right to drill for and produce oil and gas on the leased acreage and requires the owner to pay a share of the costs of drilling and production operations. The share of production to which a working interest owner is entitled will always be smaller than the share of costs that the working interest owner is required to bear, with the balance of the production accruing to the owners of royalties.
 
"Workover" means operations on a producing well to restore or increase production.
