Overview
 
Harvard Bioscience, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is a leading developer, manufacturer and seller of technologies, products and services that enable fundamental research, discovery, and preclinical testing for drug development. Our customers range from renowned academic institutions and government laboratories, to the world’s leading pharmaceutical, biotechnology and contract research organizations. With operations in North America, Europe, and China, we sell through a combination of direct and distribution channels to customers around the world.
Recent Developments
 
COVID-19
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on our operations since its onset in March 2020. While the Company has improved revenues and operations during 2021, a higher degree of volatility and uncertainty in the global economy has been observed during this period, and with it uncertainty around economic impacts. Since the global outbreak of COVID-19, many customers, particularly academic research institutions, have reduced laboratory work which has negatively impacted, and will continue to negatively impact, the Company’s sales. While many of the Company's customers, including academic labs, have reopened, a significant number of them remained closed or at significantly lower capacity levels during 2021. Additionally, to ensure business continuity while maintaining a safe environment for employees aligned with guidance from government and health organizations, the Company transitioned a significant portion of its workforce to work-from-home while implementing social distancing requirements and other measures to allow manufacturing and other personnel essential to production to continue work within the Company’s facilities. Business travel was significantly reduced during this period. While a portion of the workforce has returned to in-office work and travel is less restricted, the Company continues to have restrictions which represent disruptions which can impact productivity including sales and marketing activities.
 
The global supply chain experienced significant disruptions during 2021 due to electronic component and labor shortages and other macroeconomic factors which have emerged since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to increased cost of freight, purchased materials and manufacturing labor, while also delaying customer shipments. Accordingly, these conditions in addition to the overall impact on the global economy have negatively impacted our results of operations and cash flows.

Our History and Strategy
 
Our business began in 1901 under the name Harvard Apparatus. It was founded by Dr. William T. Porter, a Professor of Physiology at Harvard Medical School and a pioneer of physiology education. We have grown over the years with the development and evolution of modern life science research and education. Our early inventions included ventilators based on Dr. Porter’s design, the mechanical syringe pump for drug infusion in the 1950s, and the microprocessor-controlled syringe pump in the 1980s.
 
In March of 1996, a group of investors acquired a majority of the then existing business of our predecessor, Harvard Apparatus, Inc. Following this acquisition, our focus was redirected to acquiring complementary companies with innovative technologies while continuing to grow the existing business through internal product development. Since 1996, we have completed multiple business or product line acquisitions related to our continuing operations. Harvard Bioscience, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Delaware in September 2000 and became the successor entity to Harvard Apparatus, Inc. by merger in November 2000.
 
In December 2019, we implemented a restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”) to deliver significant cost savings beginning in 2020 and to support delivery of the strategic action plan we announced in September 2019. The Restructuring Plan included consolidation of our Connecticut manufacturing plant to our existing Massachusetts site, downsizing of operations in the United Kingdom and a reduction in force across the business equal to approximately 10% of our headcount. The initial initiatives under the Restructuring Plan were completed in the second half of 2020.
 
We continued to execute the Restructuring Plan during the COVID-19 pandemic and expanded the scope of the restructuring by realigning our organizational structure to reduce management layers and accelerated our efforts to move to a leaner organization and operation. As a result of this expanded scope, we eliminated additional headcount during 2020, and in the first quarter of 2021, communicated to employees our plan to consolidate certain engineering operations and eliminate two small facilities in Europe.
 
In 2021 we completed cost savings initiatives and related actions related to the Restructuring Plan, and we increased our focus on effectiveness of sales and product management to deliver organic sales growth. A portion of the savings generated from the Restructuring Plan has been reinvested to support these growth initiatives.
 
Our Products
 
Our products support research in 6 different classes of laboratory use: (1) molecular, (2) cellular, (3) tissue, (4) organ, (5) organisms or preclinical and (6) clinical. We have organized our product line activities into two product families, Cellular and Molecular Technologies (CMT) and Preclinical.    
 
Products in classes (1), (2), (3), (4) and some products in class (5) are part of CMT, which includes 14 individual business lines supporting new drug discovery and development. Our Preclinical product family includes 4 individual business lines included in class (5) which support the preclinical research phase for drug development. CMT products are primarily sold to academic and government labs and institutions. Preclinical products are primarily sold to pharmaceutical, biotechnology and contract research organizations.

We primarily sell our products under several brand names, including Harvard Apparatus, DSI, Ponemah, Buxco, Biochrom, BTX, MCS.
 
Our solutions range from simple to complex, and generally consist of hardware/firmware/ and software products, augmented with consumables, options, upgrades and post-sales (scientific) services. Sales prices of these products and services range from under $100 to over $100,000. Our products include spectrophotometers that analyze light to detect and quantify a wide range of molecules as well as cell analysis and electroporation and electrofusion systems to influence and/or analyze cellular processes. Other products and services focus on tissue and organ responses to new drugs and encompass wireless monitors, and signal acquisition and analysis functionality. We also feature products that monitor physiology processes in living organisms to study behavior. Many of our proprietary products are leaders in their field. 
 
In addition to our proprietarily manufactured products, we sell factored products from other manufacturers. These distributed products accounted for approximately 14% and 15% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Resale of factored products enable us to act as a single source for our customers’ research needs. They consist of a large variety of complementing instruments or accessories as well as consumables used in experiments involving fluid handling, molecular and cell analysis and tissue, organ and animal research. Following is a description of each product family.

Customers 
 
Our end-user customers are primarily research scientists at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities, hospitals, government laboratories, including the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH), and contract research organizations (CROs). Our pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers have included pharmaceutical companies and research laboratories such as Pfizer, Amgen, Inc., AstraZeneca plc, Genentech, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson. Our academic customers include major colleges and universities including Harvard University, Cambridge University, Johns Hopkins University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Yale University, the University of California system, Baylor College of Medicine, and the University of Texas - MD Anderson Center. Our CRO customers include Covance and Charles River Laboratories. We have a wide range of diverse customers worldwide and no customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues in 2021.
Sales
 
We conduct direct sales in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Canada and China. We sell primarily through distributors in other countries. For the year ended December 31, 2021, revenues from direct sales to end-users represented approximately 67% of our revenues; and revenues from sales of our products through distributors represented approximately 33% of our revenues.
Direct Sales
 
We have a global sales organization managing both direct sales and distributors. Our websites and catalogs serve as the primary sales tool for our product lines, which includes both proprietary manufactured products and complementary products from various suppliers. Our reputation as a leading producer of many of our manufactured products creates traffic to our websites, enables cross-selling and facilitates the introduction of new products.
Sales through Distributors
 
We engage distributors for the sales of our own branded and private label products in certain areas of the world and for certain product lines.
 
Marketing
 
We have a centralized marketing group, which encompasses product management, field-marketing and market communications and application science. Marketing maintains value-proposition based product roadmaps, collaborates with research and development on timing and investment for new products, supports direct and distributor sales activities, sets the global pricing of our products and conceives the storylines on how to sell our products. Marketing also maintains digital presence across the web and social media, creates electronic leads and analyzes opportunities for new product portfolio extensions.
Research and Development
 
Our principal research and development mission is to develop products that address growth opportunities within the life science research process as well as to maintain and optimize our existing product portfolios. We maintain development staff in many of our manufacturing facilities to design and develop new products and to re-engineer existing products to bring them to the next generation. Our research and development expenses were approximately $10.8 million and $8.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We anticipate that we will continue to make investments in research and development activities as we deem appropriate. We plan to continue to pursue a balanced development portfolio strategy of originating new products from internal research and acquiring products through business and technology acquisitions.
Manufacturing
 
We manufacture and test the majority of our products in our principal manufacturing facilities located in the United States, Sweden, Spain and Germany. We have considerable manufacturing flexibility at our various facilities, and each facility can manufacture multiple products at the same time. We maintain in-house manufacturing expertise, technologies and resources. We seek to maintain multiple suppliers for key components that are not manufactured in-house, and while some of our products are dependent on sole-source suppliers, we have made investments in new talent in procurement and other functions to reduce exposures related to sole-source suppliers, and are accelerating these efforts given the dynamics of the global supply chain in 2021. Our manufacturing operations primarily involve assembly and testing activities along with some machine-based processes. Going forward we will continue to evaluate our manufacturing facilities and operations in order to optimize our manufacturing footprint.
 
See “Part I, Item 2. Properties” of this report for additional information regarding our manufacturing facilities.

Competition
 
The markets into which we sell our products are highly competitive, and we expect the intensity of competition to continue or increase. We compete with many companies engaged in developing and selling tools for life science research. Many of our competitors have greater financial, operational, sales and marketing resources and more experience in research and development and commercialization than we have. Moreover, our competitors may have greater name recognition than we do, and many offer discounts as a competitive tactic. These competitors and other companies may have developed or could in the future develop new technologies that compete with our products, which could render our products obsolete. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to make the enhancements to our technologies necessary to compete successfully with newly emerging technologies. We believe that we offer one of the broadest selections of products to organizations engaged in life science research. We have numerous competitors on a product line basis. We believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of product performance, including quality, reliability, speed, technical support, price and delivery time.
We compete with several companies that provide instruments for life science research including, Lonza Group Ltd., Becton Dickinson, Eppendorf AG, Kent Scientific Corporation, Razel Scientific Instruments, Inc., Ugo Basile, Danaher Corporation, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., PerkinElmer, Inc., Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. Notocord, Emka Technologies and TSE Systems.
 
We cannot forecast if or when these or other companies may develop competitive products. We expect that other products will compete with our products and potential products based on efficacy, safety, cost and intellectual property positions. While we believe that these will be the primary competitive factors, other factors include, in certain instances, availability of supply, manufacturing, marketing and sales expertise and capability.
Seasonality
 
Sales and earnings in our third quarter are usually flat or down from the second quarter primarily because there are a large number of holidays and vacations during such quarter, especially in Europe. Our fourth quarter revenues and earnings are often the highest in any fiscal year compared to the other three quarters, primarily because many of our customers tend to spend budgeted money before their own fiscal year ends.
Intellectual Property
 
To establish and protect our proprietary technologies and products, we rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality provisions in our contracts. Patents or patent applications cover certain of our new technologies. Most of our more mature product lines are protected by trade names and trade secrets only.
 
We have implemented a patent strategy designed to provide us with freedom to operate and facilitate commercialization of our current and future products. Our success depends, to a significant degree, upon our ability to develop proprietary products and technologies. We intend to continue to file patent applications as we develop new products and technologies.
 
Patents provide some degree of protection for our intellectual property. However, the assertion of patent protection involves complex legal and factual determinations and is therefore uncertain. The scope of any of our issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to offer meaningful protection. In addition, our issued patents or patents licensed to us may be successfully challenged, invalidated, circumvented or unenforceable so that our patent rights would not create an effective competitive barrier. Moreover, the laws of some foreign countries may protect our proprietary rights to a greater or lesser extent than the laws of the United States. In addition, the laws governing patentability and the scope of patent coverage continue to evolve, particularly in areas of interest to us. As a result, there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from any of our patent applications or from applications licensed to us. As a result of these factors, our intellectual property positions bear some degree of uncertainty.
 
We also rely in part on trade secret protection of our intellectual property. We attempt to protect our trade secrets by entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, employees and consultants. Our employees and consultants also sign agreements requiring that they assign to us their interests in patents and copyrights arising from their work for us. Although many of our United States employees have signed agreements not to compete unfairly with us during their employment and after termination of their employment, through the misuse of confidential information, soliciting employees, soliciting customers and the like, the enforceability of these provisions varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and, in some circumstances, they may not be enforceable. In addition, it is possible that these agreements may be breached or invalidated and if so, there may not be an adequate corrective remedy available. Despite the measures we have taken to protect our intellectual property, we cannot provide assurance that third parties will not independently discover or invent competing technologies or reverse engineer our trade secrets or other technologies. Therefore, the measures we are taking to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate.

We do not believe that our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of any third party. We cannot assure, however, that third parties will not claim such infringement by us or our licensors with respect to current or future products. We expect that product developers in our market will increasingly be subject to such claims as the number of products and competitors in our market segment grows and the product functionality in different market segments overlaps. In addition, patents on production and business methods are becoming more common and we expect that more patents will be issued in our technical field. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of management’s attention and resources, cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Moreover, such royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be on terms advantageous to us, or acceptable at all, which could seriously harm our business or financial condition.
 
“Harvard” is a registered trademark of Harvard University. The marks “Harvard Apparatus” and “Harvard Bioscience” are being used pursuant to a license agreement entered into in December 2002 between us and Harvard University.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are not subject to direct governmental regulation other than the laws and regulations generally applicable to businesses in the domestic and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. In particular, our current products are not subject to pre-market approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for use on human clinical patients. In addition, we believe we are materially in compliance with all relevant environmental laws.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2021, we employed 494 employees, which included 475 full-time employees. Some of our employees in Europe have statutory collective bargaining rights. We have never experienced a general work stoppage or strike, and management believes that our relations with our employees are good. Additional information about our employees follows:
