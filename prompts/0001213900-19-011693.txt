ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
 
Empire Global Gaming, Inc. (the “Company,” “We” or “Our”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on May 11, 2010 to participate in the worldwide gaming market. We offer custom game manufacturing, gaming solutions, supplies and custom game marketing. We provide consulting and advisory services to the gaming industry. We hold exclusive licenses for proprietary Class II and Class III grade Table Games for use in the home and casinos, as well as the rights to several other innovative board, dice, card and electronic games for use in the home and casinos.
 
Lottopick3
 
We have developed a website (www.lottopick3.com) which provides analytical data to consumers on several different lottery type games. This service is a potential source of revenue for the Company. This program is not a gambling/consulting program. It is strictly an analysis program. We do not offer any advice one way or the other. It offers an in depth breakdown of all the previous numbers that have been drawn in all states that have the pick 3 games. The software breaks things down into all the possible categories and shows any types of trends that may occur. The program also comes with printable charts that show exactly which numbers fall under every category.
 
Casino Grade Games
 
We hold licenses for eight patented Class II and III Casino Grade Mechanical & Electronic Games. The games include (i) proprietary 20 sided dice game, (ii) combination game of poker and blackjack, side bet blackjack, and (iii) five patents covering roulette. We also created a new proprietary variation on the standard deck of playing cards (patent pending). We anticipate that these cards will be used in retail and casino sales.
Roulette
 
The Company has the exclusive rights through an exclusive license agreement to four U.S. Patents related to “roulette” that cover fourteen different roulette games via an Exclusive License Agreement granted by our President, Chief Executive Officer and Director (Mr. Nicholas Sorge Sr.), to market, sell, distribute and sublicense these patented roulette games. We expect to license these games for royalties to casinos throughout the world after obtaining approval from the appropriate regulatory agency in each state or country, as is applicable. We will also offer the casinos to purchase equipment with the new roulette game attributes and the table felt with the new number configurations from their own sources. We do not intend, at this time, to manufacture any equipment or products.
 
We intend to make application with the various prominent gaming control boards in the United States to obtain approval of the Company’s licensed roulette games. We had our Roulette games examined by a well-respected and well known research firm in the gaming industry to verify certain aspects of our game. Our New Balanced American and European Roulette Wheels and Layout with Digit-Bets was shown to beat the Standard American and European Roulette Wheels and Layout games in keeping the Fairness and Integrity of both Roulette games in all scenarios. We have retained well known attorneys in the gaming space to advise us on the best methods of proceeding further with our proprietary Roulette.
 
Other Products
 
We are working on developing some of our patented games into video and slot machine terminals as well as computer and mobile devices.
 
The Company has taken certain steps to become fully “e-commerce” operational while awaiting Gaming Board approvals. We operate a website where we sell certain equipment and proprietary games. Our website is located at: www.empireglobalgaminginc.com.
Industry Overview
 
The domestic and global gaming markets have grown rapidly and consistently over most of the last decade despite some slowdown in the past three years due to the macroeconomic recession. This growth has generally brought increased social and political acceptance of legalized gaming throughout many diverse societies. The conventional wisdom that the gaming industry is recession- proof has been challenged over the last three years. However, recent economic pressures have prompted new efforts to legalize casino gaming and to liberalize gaming laws to fill fiscal gaps. Furthermore, in the current environment, operators are pressured to extract the most out of existing operations by enhancing the competitiveness of their floor at minimal investment rather than deploying cash into new or expanded equipment or facilities. While historical U.S. trends suggest a resilient recovery will eventually be at hand, through our proprietary products, we expect to offer the casino operator products that will enhance the gaming machine’s productivity while simultaneously enhancing the customer’s playing experience.

Competition
 
The gaming business is highly competitive. The principal areas of competition are pricing, packaging, development of new products, and marketing campaigns. Our products compete with a wide range of games produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers, most of which have substantially greater financial, marketing, and distribution resources than we do.
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in most jurisdictions in which we operate. Gaming regulatory requirements vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and obtaining licenses and findings of suitability for our officers, directors, and principal stockholders, registrations, and other required approvals with respect to us, our personnel, and our products are time consuming and expensive. Generally, gaming regulatory authorities have broad discretionary powers and may deny applications for or revoke approvals on any basis they deem reasonable. We have not yet obtained approvals that enable us to conduct our (gaming) business in any jurisdictions. In the event a gaming jurisdiction determines that an officer, director, key employee, stockholder, or other personnel of our company is unsuitable to act in such a capacity, we will be required to terminate our relationship with such person or lose our rights and privileges in that jurisdiction. This may have a materially adverse effect on us. We may be unable to obtain all the necessary licenses and approvals or ensure that our officers, directors, key employees, affiliates, and certain other stockholders will satisfy the suitability requirements in each jurisdiction in which our products are sold or used. The failure to obtain such licenses and approvals in one jurisdiction may affect our licensure and approvals in other jurisdictions. In addition, a significant delay in obtaining such licenses and approvals could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects.
Board of Directors
 
As of December 31, 2017, Nicholas Sorge, Sr. was the President and Director and Dolores Marsh was the Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Director. On December 6, 2018, the Board of Directors approved and authorized the appointment of A. Stone Douglass as Chief Executive Officer, Secretary and Chairman of the Board of Directors. Nicholas Sorge Sr. remains the President and a Director, as well as the interim Chief Financial Officer. Dolores Marsh stepped down as an officer and Director of the Company on June 13, 2019. We have not employed additional people either on a full time or part time basis.
