Item 1. Business
Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise indicates, references to the “Company,” “MedAvail,” “we,” “our,” “us,” or similar terms refer to MedAvail Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
Overview
We are a pharmacy technology and services company that has developed and commercialized an innovative self-service pharmacy, mobile application, kiosk, and drive-thru solution. Our principal technology and product is the MedCenter kiosk, a pharmacist controlled, patient-interactive, prescription dispensing system akin to a “pharmacy in a box” or prescription-dispensing ATM. The MedCenter kiosk facilitates live pharmacist counselling via two-way audio-video communication with the ability to dispense prescription medicines under pharmacist control. We also operate SpotRx Pharmacy, or SpotRx, a full-service retail pharmacy utilizing our automated pharmacy technology. 
Business Segments
Our operations consist of two business segments: Retail Pharmacy Services and Pharmacy Technology. 
Retail Pharmacy Services Segment
Our Retail Pharmacy Services Segment comprises MedAvail Pharmacy Inc., an Arizona corporation, that is a wholly owned subsidiary of MedAvail, and does business under the trade name “SpotRx Pharmacy” or “SpotRx”. SpotRx pharmacy operations consist of MedCenter kiosk generated sales to patients, including pharmaceuticals and merchandise. SpotRx is a full-service retail pharmacy platform operating in the United States, that is structured as a hub-and-spoke model; where a centralized pharmacy supports and operates a network of MedCenter kiosks. Payors include the patient and third-party payors (e.g., pharmacy benefit managers, insurance companies and governmental agencies). The SpotRx Pharmacy segment focuses on the Medicare (65+ year old) market and the medical clinics where Medicare recipients receive care. We typically pay rent to the healthcare site operator where the MedCenter kiosk is located. As of December 31, 2021, SpotRx had 81 MedCenter kiosks deployed, 68 of which were actively dispensing and generating revenue, and we were operating seven central pharmacies including two in Arizona, three in California, one in Florida, and one in Michigan.
Pharmacy Technology Segment
The Pharmacy Technology Segment comprises MedAvail Technologies, Inc., a Canadian corporation, MedAvail Technologies (US) Inc., a Delaware corporation, both collectively referred to as “MedAvail Technologies”. MedAvail Technologies sells the MedPlatform System, which includes the MedCenter prescription dispensing kiosk, software, integration services, and maintenance services. The customer provides and conducts all pharmacy staff and operations, including procuring and packaging all medications for stocking in the MedCenter kiosks. The MedPlatform agreement consideration includes either an initial lump sum payment upon MedCenter kiosk integration and installation, with monthly payments thereafter, for software and maintenance services; or a combined monthly payment that includes the MedCenter kiosk, integration services, software, and maintenance services.
The major steps of our deployment process include integration with the customer’s pharmacy software, including educating and training customer pharmacy staff, and MedCenter kiosk site planning and installation. The deployment process typically runs one to two months. 
Core Strengths
Published studies have shown that medical clinics and other health care sites with an embedded pharmacy have higher patient medication adherence, with resulting improved health outcomes (Wright & Gorman 2016). However, deploying a traditional retail pharmacy in a medical clinic is costly. Many medical clinics cannot support the cost of establishing and running a physical pharmacy.
Our proprietary hardware and software technology has the following unique strengths:
•The SpotRx Pharmacy provides an embedded pharmacy with no capital investment or operational costs to the health care site location operator;
•The MedPlatform systems reduce customer pharmacy capital costs and operating cost through telehealth technology, automation, and shared centralized resources;
•The MedCenter kiosk and support software are a proprietary real time telehealth platform, delivering remote pharmacy team, dispensing medications, answering patient questions, and supporting administrative functions;
Table of Contents

•The SpotRx and MedPlatform software support systems share data with the healthcare practitioners to support patient adherence to improve patient health outcomes; and
•The SpotRx centralized pharmacy team supports medication adherence by combining regular refill reminders via text, phone or email, and convenient MedCenter kiosk dispensing, or home courier delivery.
Growth Opportunities
The SpotRx Retail Pharmacy Services segment primarily targets medical clinics that write at least 10,000 Medicare prescription claims per year. Based on Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, data, there are approximately 260 clinics in Arizona, 1,200 clinics in California, 1,500 clinics in Florida, and 800 clinics in Michigan that qualify as potential target sites. Currently SpotRx Pharmacy expansion is focused on six key states: Arizona, California, Florida, and Michigan; future expansion into Illinois and Texas is being considered. When we enter a state, we focus on large health care provider chains that mainly support a Medicare population and then seek growth within those chains.
The Pharmacy Technology segment primarily targets customers that stand to benefit from the use of our MedCenter technology to better serve their customer base. There is a wide range of customer types and business benefits that our technology addresses. Pharmacy Technology customer types include large healthcare systems, mass merchandise retailers, hospital systems, etc. Our customers report that our technology creates value for them, including lower operating costs, and a better consumer experience for their customers. We focus on an enterprise sales approach that demonstrates to potential customers the expected benefits of lower operating costs, better customer service, and improved medication adherence. 
The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the SpotRx Pharmacy and MedPlatform benefits. As a result, health systems such as Texas Health Resources began to deploy our MedPlatform technology to increase their pharmacy footprint, with an initial focus on their emergency departments. Certain states changed their regulations to allow our technology (e.g. Florida and Washington implemented new laws effective July 1, 2020). Additionally, Texas and Nevada enacted permanent laws to allow MedCenter kiosk deployments in 2021 and 2022, respectively.
Sales and Marketing
Both business segments are supported by one sales and business development team that currently consists of our Chief Commercial Officer, and Vice Presidents of Business Development. This team is responsible for identifying and engaging large Medicare focused primary care and specialty clinic chains, as well as independent physician groups in our focus markets. For customers that want us to operate pharmacy operations for them, we contract to provide full retail pharmacy services through SpotRx. If the customer desires to purchase our MedCenter kiosk and lease the associated proprietary software, the customer will contract with us through our Pharmacy Technology segment. 
Research and Development
Our research and development process begins with customer and health care provider collaboration to develop solutions for unmet customer and industry needs. We have a team of software architects and hardware engineers that design and prototype our MedCenter kiosk hardware and software technology. 
Manufacturing and Inventory
The MedCenter kiosk equipment produced is available in the M4 or M5 models. The M4 MedCenter kiosk is a compact design utilized for the SpotRx Pharmacy operations and available to MedPlatform customers. The M5 MedCenter kiosk is a modular and scalable design available to MedPlatform customers.
The MedCenter kiosk hardware is produced through an agreement with a contract manufacturer that specializes in complex electronic kiosk manufacturing. Through January 2020, we contracted with an electronics manufacturer in South Carolina. In August 2020, we signed a manufacturing and supply agreement with a new contract manufacturer, Kitron Technologies, or Kitron. Under this agreement, Kitron manufactures our MedCenter kiosks for an initial term of three years.
Intellectual Property
We own or license rights to certain know-how, proprietary information and technology, copyrights, patents, and other intellectual property upon which our business depends. To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely on trade secret laws, patents, copyrights, trademarks and confidentiality agreements and contracts with employees, consultants and other parties.
Table of Contents

As of December 31, 2021, we have the following patents and trademarks issued and pending:
•12 US patents, 4 Canadian patents, 1 European patent, that expire beginning in July 2027 through June 2031;
•6 US trademarks, 7 US trademarks pending;
•7 Canadian trademarks, 1 Canadian trademark pending; and
•4 European registered trademarks.
Competition
We operate in the increasingly complex and challenging medical technology marketplace. Technological advances and scientific discoveries have accelerated the pace of change in medical technology, and the regulatory environment of medical products is becoming more complex and vigorous. We compete directly with several companies in the medication management automations solutions market, as well as the medication adherence solutions market, based on many factors, including price, quality, customer outcome and cost of operation, innovation, product features and capabilities, installation and service, reputation and brand recognition, size of installed base, range of solutions, distribution, and promotion. To remain competitive in the industries in which we operate, we continue to make investments in research and development, quality management, quality improvement, product innovation and productivity improvement in support of our operating segments. 
Government Regulation
SpotRx Pharmacy is a prescription drug dispensing solution that is regulated on a state-by-state basis by the respective board of pharmacy, and each state has its own distinct rules. These rules typically govern the marketing and deployment of the SpotRx Pharmacy and its services, and not the technology itself. The boards of pharmacy view the MedCenter kiosk as an extension of the physical pharmacy, with the MedCenter being a remote dispensing device for a licensed physical pharmacy within the applicable state. The board of pharmacy for many states will perform a physical site visit to see the MedCenter kiosk prior to licensing, perform an inspection of the physical pharmacy, and review the policies and procedures associated with the MedCenter kiosk. This process is consistent whether the MedCenter kiosk is being operated by SpotRx or customer.
When analyzing the United States market, we view states as:
•Open to deploy;
•2022 rule making in-process to be open to deploy;
•Favorable waiver rules in place to allow deployment; and
•Restrictive or unfavorable rules.
Table of Contents

Federally, we are regulated by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, or the DEA, with respect to controlled substances that are dispensed through our MedCenters kiosks and SpotRx Pharmacies services. At this time, we cannot dispense any controlled substances through the MedCenter. SpotRx patients requiring controlled substances have these medicines delivered to them through our home delivery service, which is executed by the SpotRx central pharmacy for the applicable area.
State Licensing Requirements
Certain states have enacted laws regulating companies that offer and market discount medical plans, including prescription drug plans, subscription membership programs or discount cards. These state laws are intended to protect consumers from fraudulent, unfair or deceptive marketing, sales and enrollment practices by such plans. It is possible that other states may enact new requirements or interpret existing requirements to include our programs. Failure to obtain the required licenses, certifications or registrations to offer and market these subscription discount programs may result in civil penalties, receipt of cease and desist orders, or a restructuring of our operations.
Professional Licensure
Pharmacists, nurses and certain other healthcare professionals employed by us are required to be individually licensed or certified under applicable state law. We perform criminal, government exclusion and other background checks on employees. Additionally, we take steps to ensure that our employees possess all necessary licenses and certifications, and our employees comply with applicable licensure laws.
State Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee Splitting Laws
The corporate practice of medicine doctrine and fee splitting laws, which are enforced by many states, are intended to prevent unlicensed persons from interfering with or influencing the physician’s or other medical professional’s professional judgment, and prohibiting the sharing of professional services income with non-professional or business interests. These laws vary from state to state and are subject to broad interpretation and enforcement by state regulators. A determination of non-compliance could lead to adverse judicial or administrative action against us, civil or criminal penalties, receipt of cease and desist orders from state regulators, loss of professional licenses, or a restructuring of our business arrangements.
Pharmacy Licensing and Registration
State laws require that each of our pharmacy locations be appropriately licensed and/or registered to dispense pharmaceuticals in that state. We are licensed in all states that require such licensure and comply with all state licensing laws applicable to our business.
Table of Contents

Laws enforced by the DEA, as well as some similar state agencies, require our pharmacy locations to individually register to handle controlled substances, including prescription pharmaceuticals. A separate registration is required at each principal place of business where we dispense controlled substances. Federal and state laws also require that we follow specific labeling, reporting and record-keeping requirements for controlled substances. We maintain DEA registrations for each of our facilities that require such registration and follow procedures intended to comply with all applicable federal and state requirements regarding controlled substances.
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act
Certain provisions of the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act govern the handling and distribution of pharmaceutical products. This law exempts many pharmaceuticals and medical devices from federal labeling and packaging requirements, if they are not adulterated or misbranded and are dispensed in accordance with and pursuant to a valid prescription. We comply with all applicable requirements.
Fraud and Abuse Laws — Anti-Kickback Statute
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits individuals and entities from knowingly and willfully paying, offering, receiving, or soliciting money or anything else of value in order to induce the referral of patients or to induce a person to purchase, lease, order, arrange for, or recommend services or goods covered by Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs. The federal courts have held that an arrangement violates the Anti-Kickback Statute if any one purpose of the remuneration is to induce the referral of patients covered by the Medicare or Medicaid programs, even if another purpose of the payment is to compensate an individual for rendered services. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and potentially covers many standard business arrangements. Violations can lead to significant penalties, including criminal fines of up to $100,000 per violation and/or ten years imprisonment, civil monetary penalties of up to $50,000 per violation plus treble damages and/or exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Certain types of payments are excluded from the statutory prohibition. Additionally, in an effort to clarify the conduct prohibited by the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Office of the Inspector General of HHS, or the OIG, publishes regulations that identify a limited number of safe harbors. Business arrangements that satisfy all of the elements of a safe harbor are immune from criminal enforcement or civil administrative actions. The Anti-Kickback Statute is an intent-based statute and the failure of a business relationship to satisfy all of the elements of a safe harbor does not, in and of itself, mean that the business relationship violates the Anti-Kickback Statute. The OIG, in its commentary to the safe harbor regulations, has recognized that many business arrangements that do not satisfy a safe harbor nonetheless operate without the type of abuses the Anti-Kickback Statute is designed to prevent.We attempt to structure our business relationships to satisfy an applicable safe harbor. However, in those situations where a business relationship does not fully satisfy the elements of a safe harbor, we attempt to satisfy as many elements of an applicable safe harbor as possible. The OIG is authorized to issue advisory opinions regarding the interpretation and applicability of the Anti-Kickback Statute, including whether an activity constitutes grounds for the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions.
Several states have statutes and regulations that prohibit the same general types of conduct as those prohibited by the Anti-Kickback Statute described above. Some state anti-fraud and anti-kickback laws apply only to goods and services covered by Medicaid. Other state anti-fraud and anti-kickback laws apply to all healthcare goods and services, regardless of whether the source of payment is governmental or private. Where applicable, we structure our business relationships to comply with these statutes and regulations.
Fraud and Abuse Laws — False Claims Act
We are subject to state and federal laws that govern the submission of claims for reimbursement. These laws generally prohibit an individual or entity from knowingly and willfully presenting a claim or causing a claim to be presented for payment from a federal healthcare program that is false or fraudulent. The standard for “knowing and willful” may include conduct that amounts to a reckless disregard for the accuracy of information presented to payors. Penalties under these statutes include substantial civil and criminal fines, exclusion from the Medicare or Medicaid programs and imprisonment. One of the most prominent of these laws is the federal False Claims Act, which may be enforced by the federal government directly or by a private plaintiff by filing a qui tam lawsuit on the government’s behalf. Under the False Claims Act, the government and private plaintiffs, if any, may recover monetary penalties in the amount of $11,803 to $23,607 per false claim, subject to adjustment for inflation, as well as an amount equal to three times the amount of damages sustained by the government as a result of the false claim. Several states, including states in which we operate, have adopted their own false claims statutes as well as statutes that allow individuals to bring qui tam actions. In recent years, federal and state government authorities have launched several initiatives aimed at uncovering practices that violate false claims or fraudulent billing laws, and they have conducted numerous investigations of pharmaceutical manufacturers, or pharmacy benefit managers “PBMs”, pharmacies and healthcare providers with respect to false claims, fraudulent billing and related matters. We have procedures in place to ensure the accuracy of our claims.
Ethics in Patient Referrals Law — Stark Law
The federal Physician Self-Referral Prohibition, commonly known as the Stark Law, generally prohibits a physician from ordering Designated Health Services for Medicare and Medicaid patients from an entity with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship and prohibits the entity from presenting or causing to be presented claims to Medicare or Medicaid for those referred services, 
Table of Contents

unless an exception applies. A financial relationship is generally defined as an ownership, investment, or compensation relationship. Designated Health Services include, but are not limited to, outpatient pharmaceuticals, parenteral and enteral nutrition products, home health services, durable medical equipment, physical and occupational therapy services, and inpatient and outpatient hospital services. Among other sanctions, a civil monetary penalty of over $15,000 may be imposed for each bill or claim for a service a person knows or should know is for a service for which payment may not be made due to the Stark Law. Such persons or entities are also subject to exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Any person or entity participating in a circumvention scheme to avoid the referral prohibitions is liable for a civil monetary penalty of up to $100,000 per scheme or arrangement. A fine of over $20,000 may be imposed for failure to comply with reporting requirements regarding an entity’s ownership, investment and compensation arrangements for each day for which reporting is required to have been made under the Stark Law.
The Stark Law is a broad prohibition on certain business relationships, with detailed exceptions. However, unlike the Anti-Kickback Statute under which an activity may fall outside a safe harbor and still be lawful, a referral for Designated Health Services that does not fall within an exception is strictly prohibited by the Stark Law. We structure all our relationships with physicians who make referrals to us in compliance with an applicable exception to the Stark Law.
In addition to the Stark Law, many of the states in which we operate has comparable restrictions on the ability of physicians to refer patients for certain services to entities with which they have a financial relationship. Certain of these state statutes mirror the Stark Law while others may be more restrictive. We structure all of our business relationships with physicians to comply with any applicable state self-referral laws.
HIPAA and Other Privacy and Confidentiality Legislation
Our activities involve the receipt, use and disclosure of confidential health information, including disclosure of the confidential information to a patient’s health benefit plan, as permitted in accordance with applicable federal and state privacy laws. In addition, we use and disclose identified data for analytical and other purposes. Many state laws restrict the use and disclosure of confidential medical information, and similar new legislative and regulatory initiatives are underway at the state and federal levels.
HIPAA imposes extensive requirements on the way in which healthcare providers that engage in certain actions covered by HIPAA, as well as healthcare clearinghouses (each known as “covered entities”) and the persons or entities that create, receive, maintain, or transmit protected health information, or PHI, on behalf of covered entities (known as “business associates”) and their subcontractors, use, disclose and safeguard PHI, including requirements to protect the integrity, availability and confidentiality of electronic PHI. Many of these obligations were expanded under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, passed as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. In January 2013, the Office for Civil Rights of HHS issued a final rule under HITECH that makes significant changes to the privacy, security, breach notification and enforcement regulations promulgated under HIPAA, or the Final Omnibus Rule, and which generally took effect in September 2013. The Final Omnibus Rule enhances individual privacy protections, provides individuals new rights to their health information and strengthens the government’s ability to enforce HIPAA.
The privacy regulations, or the Privacy Rule, issued by the Office of Civil Rights of HHS pursuant to HIPAA, give individuals the right to know how their PHI is used and disclosed, as well as the right to access, amend and obtain information concerning certain disclosures of PHI. Covered entities, such as pharmacies and health plans, are required to provide a written Notice of Privacy Practices to individuals that describes how the entity uses and discloses PHI, and how individuals may exercise their rights with respect to their PHI. For most uses and disclosures of PHI other than for treatment, payment, healthcare operations and certain public policy purposes, HIPAA generally requires that covered entities obtain a valid written individual authorization. In most cases, use or disclosure of PHI must be limited to the minimum necessary to achieve the purpose of the use or disclosure. The Final Omnibus Rule modifies the content of Notice of Privacy Practices in significant ways, requiring, among other things, statements informing individuals of their rights to receive notifications of any breaches of unsecured PHI and to restrict disclosures of PHI to a health plan where the individual pays out of pocket.
We are a covered entity under HIPAA in connection with our operation of specialty service pharmacies. To the extent that we provide services other than as a covered entity and we perform a function or activity, or provide a service to, a covered entity that involves PHI, the covered entity may be required to enter into a business associate agreement with us. Business associate agreements mandated by the Privacy Rule create a contractual obligation for us, as a business associate, to perform our duties for the applicable covered entity in compliance with the Privacy Rule. In addition, HITECH subjects us to certain aspects of the Privacy Rule and the HIPAA security regulations when we act as a business associate, including imposing direct liability on business associates for impermissible uses and disclosures of PHI and the failure to disclose PHI to the covered entity, the individual, or the individual’s designee (as specified in the business associate agreement), as necessary to satisfy a covered entity’s obligations with respect to an individual’s request for an electronic copy of PHI. The Final Omnibus Rule also extends the business associate provisions of HIPAA to subcontractors where the function, activity, or service delegated by the business associate to the subcontractor involves the creation, receipt, maintenance, or transmission of PHI. As such, business associates are required to enter into business associate agreements with subcontractors for services involving access to PHI and may be subject to civil monetary penalties for the acts and omissions of their subcontractors.
Table of Contents

Importantly, the Final Omnibus Rule greatly expands the types of product- and service-related communications to patients or enrollees that will require individual authorizations by requiring individual authorization for all treatment and healthcare operations communications where the covered entity receives payment in exchange for the communication from or on behalf of a third-party whose product or service is being described. While the Office of Civil Rights of HHS has established limited exceptions to this rule where individual authorization is not required, the marketing provisions finalized in the Final Omnibus Rule could potentially have an adverse impact on our business and revenues.
If we fail to comply with HIPAA or our policies and procedures are not sufficient to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of PHI, we could be subject to liability, fines and lawsuits under federal and state privacy laws, consumer protection statutes and other laws. Criminal penalties and civil sanctions may be imposed for failing to comply with HIPAA standards either as a covered entity or business associate, and these penalties and sanctions have significantly increased under HITECH. In addition to imposing potential monetary penalties, HITECH also requires the Office of Civil Rights of HHS to conduct periodic compliance audits and empowers state attorneys general to bring actions in federal court for violations of HIPAA on behalf of state residents harmed by such violations. Several such actions have already been brought, and continued enforcement actions are likely to occur in the future.
The transactions and code sets regulation promulgated under HIPAA requires that all covered entities that engage in certain electronic transactions, directly or through a third-party agent, use standardized formats and code sets. We, in our role as a business associate of a covered entity, must conduct such transactions in accordance with such transaction rule and related regulations that require the use of operating rules in connection with HIPAA transactions. In our role as a specialty pharmacy operator, it must also conduct such transactions in accordance with such regulations or engage a clearinghouse to process our covered transactions. HHS promulgated a National Provider Identifiers, or NPI, Final Rule that requires covered entities to utilize NPIs in all standard transactions. NPIs replaced National Association of Boards of Pharmacy numbers for pharmacies, DEA numbers for physicians and similar identifiers for other healthcare providers for purposes of identifying providers in connection with HIPAA standard transactions. Covered entities may be excluded from federal healthcare programs for violating these regulations.
The security regulations issued pursuant to HIPAA mandate the use of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality of electronic PHI. Such security rules apply to covered entities and business associates.
We must also comply with the “breach notification” regulations, which implement provisions of HITECH. In the case of a breach of “unsecured PHI,” covered entities must promptly notify affected individuals and the HHS Secretary, as well as the media in cases where a breach affects more than 500 individuals. Breaches affecting fewer than 500 individuals must be reported to the HHS Secretary on an annual basis. The regulations also require business associates of covered entities to notify the covered entity of such breaches by the business associate.
Final regulations governing the accounting of disclosures implementing provision in HITECH are forthcoming, but have been subject to significant delay. The initial proposed rule, if finalized, would require covered entities to develop systems to monitor and record: (1) which of their employees and business associates access an individual’s electronic PHI contained in a designated record set; (2) the time and date access occurs; and (3) the action taken during the access session (e.g., modification, deletion, viewing). The final regulations could impose significant burdens on covered entities and business associates.
The ACA (as defined in “Health Reform Legislation” below) require the HHS Secretary to develop new health information technology standards that could require changes to our existing software products. For example, the statute requires the establishment of interoperable standards and protocols to facilitate electronic enrollment of individuals in federal and state health and human services programs and provides the government with authority to require incorporation of these standards and protocols in health information technology investments as a condition of receiving federal funds for such investments.
HIPAA generally preempts state laws, except when state laws are more protective of PHI or are more restrictive than HIPAA requirements. Therefore, to the extent states continue to enact more protective or restrictive legislation, we could be required to make significant changes to our business operations. In addition, independent of any statutory or regulatory restrictions, individual health plan clients could increase limitations on our use of medical information, which could prevent us from offering certain services.
Medicare Part D
The Medicare Part D program, which makes prescription drug coverage available to eligible Medicare beneficiaries, regulates various aspects of the provision of Medicare drug coverage, including enrollment, formularies, pharmacy networks, marketing and claims processing. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, imposed restrictions and consent requirements for automatic prescription delivery programs, and further limited the circumstances under which Medicare Part D plans may recoup payments to pharmacies for claims that are subsequently determined not payable under Medicare Part D. CMS sanctions for non-compliance may include suspension of enrollment and even termination from the program.
Table of Contents

The Medicare Part D program has undergone significant legislative and regulatory changes since its inception. Medicare Part D continues to attract a high degree of legislative and regulatory scrutiny, and applicable government rules and regulations continue to evolve. For example, CMS may issue regulations that limit the ability of Medicare Part D plans to establish preferred pharmacy networks.
Health Reform Legislation
Congress passed major health reform legislation, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or the ACA, which enacted a number of significant healthcare reforms. Since its enactment, there have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Act) was enacted, which, among other things, removed penalties for not complying with ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance, effective January 1, 2019. In June 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court held that Texas and other challengers had no legal standing to challenge the ACA, dismissing the case on procedural grounds without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how any such challenges and healthcare measures promulgated by the Biden administration will impact the ACA, our business, financial condition and results of operations. On January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period to help people obtain health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. This executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare. Complying with any new legislation or reversing changes implemented under the ACA could be time-intensive and expensive, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.
Managed Care Reform
In addition to health reforms enacted by the ACA, legislation has been considered, proposed and/or enacted at the state level, aimed at providing additional rights and access to drugs to individuals enrolled in managed care plans. This legislation may impact the design and implementation of prescription drug benefit plans sponsored by our PBM health plan clients and/or the services we provide to them. Both the scope of the managed care reform proposals considered by state legislatures and reforms enacted by states to date vary greatly, and the scope of future legislation that may be enacted is uncertain.
21st Century Cures Act
The 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, enacted in December 2016, among other things implemented Average Sales Price pricing for Part B DME infusion drugs in January 2017 and delayed payment for the home infusion services necessary to administer these drugs until January 2021. Given our current understanding of the Cures Act, we do not believe that it will have a significant impact on our business.
Consumer Protection Laws
The federal and state governments have many consumer protection laws that may apply to our business operations. These laws have been the basis for investigations, lawsuits and multi-state settlements relating to, among other matters, the marketing of loyalty programs and health care services, pricing accuracy, expired front store products, financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to pharmacies in connection with therapeutic interchange programs and disclosures related to how personal data is used and protected.
Environmental and Safety Regulation
Our business is subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and other requirements pertaining to protection of the environment, public health and employee safety, including, for example, regulations governing the management of hazardous substances, the cleaning up of contaminated sites, and the maintenance of safe working conditions in our stores, distribution centers and other facilities. Governmental agencies on the federal, state and local levels have, in recent years, increasingly focused on the retail and health care sectors’ compliance with such laws and regulations, and have at times pursued enforcement activities. Any failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or other sanctions by government authorities.
Human Capital 
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants, into our company. The principal purposes of our cash and equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of cash-based and stock-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our short- and long-term business goals.

Corporate and other Information
We were originally incorporated as MYOS Corporation in the State of Nevada in April 2007. In March 2016, we completed a merger with our wholly-owned subsidiary, MYOS RENS Technology Inc., and formally assumed the subsidiary’s name by filing Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada. The subsidiary was incorporated solely for the purpose of effecting the name change and the merger did not affect our governing documents or corporate structure in any other way. Following our acquisition of MedAvail, Inc. in November 2020, we reincorporated as a Delaware corporation and changed our name to MedAvail Holdings, Inc. In accordance with “reverse merger” accounting treatment, our historical financial statements as of period ends, and for periods ended, prior to our acquisition of MedAvail, Inc. were replaced with the historical financial statements of MedAvail, Inc. in our SEC filings made after the acquisition.
Our principal executive offices are located at 6665 Millcreek Dr. Unit 1, Mississauga ON L5N 5M4 Canada, and our telephone number is (905) 812-0023. Our website address is www.medavail.com.
