COVID-19 Update
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide.
Since the outbreak began, our first priority has been the health and safety of our employees and those of our customers and other business counterparties. Beginning in March 2020, we implemented preventative measures and developed a response plan to minimize unnecessary risk of exposure and prevent infection, while supporting our customers’ operations, and we continue to follow these plans. We also continue to promote heightened awareness and vigilance, hygiene, and implementation of more stringent cleaning protocols across our facilities and operations and we continue to evaluate and adjust our preventative 
measures, response plans and business practices with the evolving impacts of COVID-19 and its variants. Since the inception of the pandemic, we have not experienced any significant COVID-19 related operational disruptions.
There remains considerable uncertainty regarding how long the COVID-19 pandemic (including variants of the virus) will persist and affect economic conditions and the extent and duration of changes in consumer behavior.
We cannot predict the full impact that the COVID-19 pandemic or the related volatility in oil and natural gas markets will have on our business, liquidity, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows (including our ability to make distributions to unitholders) at this time due to numerous uncertainties. The ultimate impacts will depend on future developments, including, among others, the ultimate duration and persistence of the pandemic, the impact of the Delta and Omicron variants of the virus, the speed at which the population is vaccinated against the virus and the efficacy of the vaccines, the emergence of any new variants of the virus against which vaccines are less effective, the effect of the pandemic on economic, social, and other aspects of everyday life, the consequences of governmental and other measures designed to prevent the spread of the virus, actions taken by members of OPEC+ and other foreign, oil-exporting countries, actions taken by governmental authorities, customers, suppliers, and other third parties, and the timing and extent to which normal economic, social, and operating conditions fully resume. Although crude oil and natural gas prices and production activities have recovered to pre-pandemic levels, producers remain cautious and a decline in commodity prices could affect producers’ exploration and production activities. A sustained significant decline in oil and natural gas exploration and production activities and related reduced demand for our services by our customers, whether due to decreases in consumer demand or reduction in the prices for crude oil, condensate, natural gas, and NGLs or otherwise, would have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows (including our ability to make distributions to our unitholders).
For additional discussion regarding risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, see “Item 1A—Risk Factors—The ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.”
Our Operations 
We primarily focus on providing midstream energy services, including: 
•gathering, compressing, treating, processing, transporting, storing, and selling natural gas;
•fractionating, transporting, storing, and selling NGLs; and
•gathering, transporting, stabilizing, storing, trans-loading, and selling crude oil and condensate, in addition to brine disposal services. 
Our midstream energy asset network includes approximately 12,100 miles of pipelines, 22 natural gas processing plants with approximately 5.5 Bcf/d of processing capacity, seven fractionators with approximately 320,000 Bbls/d of fractionation capacity, barge and rail terminals, product storage facilities, purchasing and marketing capabilities, brine disposal wells, a crude oil trucking fleet, and equity investments in certain joint ventures. Our operations are based in the United States, and our sales are derived primarily from domestic customers. 
Our natural gas business includes connecting the wells of producers in our market areas to our gathering systems. Our gathering systems consist of networks of pipelines that collect natural gas from points at or near producing wells and transport it to our processing plants or to larger pipelines for further transmission. We operate processing plants that remove NGLs from the natural gas stream that is transported to the processing plants by our own gathering systems or by third-party pipelines. In conjunction with our gathering and processing business, we may purchase natural gas and NGLs from producers and other supply sources and sell that natural gas or NGLs to utilities, industrial consumers, marketers, and pipelines. Our transmission pipelines receive natural gas from our gathering systems and from third-party gathering and transmission systems and deliver natural gas to industrial end-users, utilities, and other pipelines. 
Our fractionators separate NGLs into separate purity products, including ethane, propane, iso-butane, normal butane, and natural gasoline. Our fractionators receive NGLs primarily through our transmission lines that transport NGLs from East Texas and from our South Louisiana processing plants. Our fractionators also have the capability to receive NGLs by truck or rail terminals. We also have agreements pursuant to which third parties transport NGLs from our West Texas and Central Oklahoma operations to our NGL transmission lines that then transport the NGLs to our fractionators. In addition, we have NGL storage capacity to provide storage for customers.
Our crude oil and condensate business includes the gathering and transmission of crude oil and condensate via pipelines, barges, rail, and trucks, in addition to condensate stabilization and brine disposal. We also purchase crude oil and condensate from producers and other supply sources and sell that crude oil and condensate through our terminal facilities to various markets. 
Across our businesses, we primarily earn our fees through various fee-based contractual arrangements, which include stated fee-only contract arrangements or arrangements with fee-based components where we purchase and resell commodities in connection with providing the related service and earn a net margin as our fee. We earn our net margin under our purchase and resell contract arrangements primarily as a result of stated service-related fees that are deducted from the price of the commodities purchased. 
We manage and report our activities primarily according to the nature of activity and geography. We have five reportable segments:
•Permian Segment. The Permian segment includes our natural gas gathering, processing, and transmission activities and our crude oil operations in the Midland and Delaware Basins in West Texas and Eastern New Mexico; 
•Louisiana Segment. The Louisiana segment includes our natural gas and NGL pipelines, natural gas processing plants, natural gas and NGL storage facilities, and fractionation facilities located in Louisiana and our crude oil operations in ORV; 
•Oklahoma Segment. The Oklahoma segment includes our natural gas gathering, processing, and transmission activities, and our crude oil operations in the Cana-Woodford, Arkoma-Woodford, northern Oklahoma Woodford, STACK, and CNOW shale areas; 
•North Texas Segment. The North Texas segment includes our natural gas gathering, processing, and transmission activities in North Texas; and 
•Corporate Segment. The Corporate segment includes our unconsolidated affiliate investments in the Cedar Cove JV in Oklahoma, our ownership interest in GCF in South Texas, and our general corporate assets and expenses. 
For more information about our segment reporting, see “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 15.” 
Our Business Strategies 
We operate a differentiated midstream platform that is built for long-term, sustainable value creation. Our integrated assets are strategically located in premier production basins and core demand centers, including the Permian Basin, the Louisiana Gulf Coast, Central Oklahoma, and North Texas. Our primary business objective is to provide cash flow stability while growing prudently and profitably. We intend to accomplish this objective by executing the following strategies:
•Operational Excellence and Innovation. We have created a rigorous company-wide program that we refer to as the EnLink Way centered on innovation and continuous improvement in our business. We believe this program will allow us to optimize our operations in order to enhance the profitability of current operations, capture capital-efficient commercial opportunities, and enhance the scalability of our asset platforms for future growth. 
•Financial Discipline and Flexibility. We are focused on strengthening our financial position and flexibility by generating significant cash flows, driving disciplined and balanced capital allocation, focusing on cost discipline, and maintaining liquidity and balance sheet strength. We believe that these strategies will afford us better access to the capital markets and a competitive cost of capital, and the opportunity to grow our business in a prudent manner throughout the cycles in our industry. 
•Strategic Growth. We believe our assets are positioned in some of the most economically advantageous basins in the U.S., as well as key demand centers with growing end-use customers. We expect to grow certain of our systems organically over time by meeting our customers’ midstream service needs that result from their drilling activity in our areas of operation, or growth in supply needs. We are also focused on economically attractive organic expansion opportunities in our areas of operation that allow us to leverage our existing infrastructure, operating expertise, and customer relationships, as well as to increase our natural gas and NGL presence downstream. We are committed to becoming the future of midstream by participating in the energy transition. As part of this effort, we are developing an 
integrated offering to bring CCS to businesses along the Mississippi River corridor in Louisiana, one of the highest CO2 emitting regions in the United States. We believe our existing asset footprint, including our extensive network of natural gas pipelines in Louisiana, our operating expertise, and our customer relationships, provide EnLink a strong advantage in building a CCS business. 
•Sustainability and Safety. Sustainability and safety are integrated into all aspects of our business. Approximately 90% of our current business is focused on natural gas and natural gas liquids, which we believe will continue to be important sources of clean energy for decades to come. We publish a sustainability report with key metrics that can be measured from year to year, and have announced target emission reduction milestones. To achieve those goals, we continue to evaluate opportunities to reduce or offset emissions in our operations using process improvements and technology, or utilizing renewable energy. With respect to safety, we are committed to operating safely and in an environmentally responsible manner. During 2021, EnLink had its best safety year on record with the lowest number of employee reportable incidents in our history.

We have extended our fixed-fee processing agreement with Devon, which was effective after the GIP Transaction, and currently have approximately seven years remaining on the fixed-fee gathering and processing 
agreement pursuant to which we provide processing services for natural gas delivered by Devon to the Cana processing plant.
•Northridge processing facility. Our Northridge processing plant is located in Hughes County in the Arkoma-Woodford Shale in Southeastern Oklahoma. The residue natural gas from the Northridge processing facility is delivered to CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Enable Midstream Partners, LP, and MPLX LP. 
•Crude Oil Gathering Systems. Our crude and condensate assets in the Oklahoma segment have crude oil and condensate pipelines and above ground storage in Central Oklahoma. These assets consist of the following: 
•Central Oklahoma Crude Oil Gathering Systems. Our Central Oklahoma crude oil gathering systems include Black Coyote and Redbud. Black Coyote operates in the core of the STACK play in Central Oklahoma and was built primarily to service acreage dedicated from Devon, which is the anchor customer on the system. Redbud also operates in the core of the STACK play and is supported by a contract with Marathon Oil Company. 
North Texas Segment Assets. Our North Texas segment assets include gas gathering systems, a gas transmission system, gas processing facilities, and a fractionation facility in the Barnett Shale. 
•Gas Gathering Systems. Our gas gathering systems in the North Texas segment are connected to our processing assets and consist of the following: 
•Bridgeport rich gas gathering system. A substantial majority of the natural gas gathered on the Bridgeport rich gas gathering system is delivered to the Bridgeport processing facility. BKV was the largest customer on the Bridgeport rich gas gathering system contributing substantially all of the natural gas gathered for the year ended December 31, 2021. BKV acquired Devon’s Barnett Shale assets in October 2020. As a result of this acquisition, we have extended a fixed-fee gathering agreement with BKV and currently have approximately eleven years remaining on the fixed-fee gathering agreement pursuant to which we provide gathering services on the Bridgeport system. 
•Bridgeport lean gas gathering system. Natural gas gathered on the Bridgeport lean gas gathering system was primarily attributable to BKV for the year ended December 31, 2021 and was delivered to the Acacia transmission system and to intrastate pipelines without processing. As described above, we are party to a fixed-fee gathering and processing agreement with BKV that covers gathering services on the Bridgeport system. 
•Johnson County gathering system. Natural gas gathered on this system is primarily attributable to one customer with whom we have a fixed-fee processing agreement that currently has approximately two years remaining. 
•Silver Creek gathering system. Our Silver Creek gathering system is located primarily in Hood, Parker, and Johnson counties, Texas, and connects to the Silver Creek processing system. 
•Gas Transmission System. The Acacia transmission system is a pipeline that connects production from the Barnett Shale to markets in North Texas accessed by Atmos Energy, Brazos Electric, Enbridge Inc, Energy Transfer Partners, Enterprise Product Partners, and GDF Suez. BKV was the largest customer on the Acacia pipeline for the year ended December 31, 2021. We currently have approximately two years remaining on a fixed-fee transportation agreement with BKV that covers transmission services and includes annual rate escalators. 
•Gas Processing Facilities. Our gas processing facilities in the North Texas segment consist of the following: 
•Bridgeport processing facility. Our Bridgeport natural gas processing facility, located in Wise County, Texas, is one of the largest processing plants in the U.S. with seven cryogenic turboexpander plants. BKV was the Bridgeport facility’s largest customer, providing substantially all of the natural gas processed for the year ended December 31, 2021. As described above, we have extended a fixed-fee processing agreement with BKV and currently have approximately eleven years remaining on our agreement with BKV pursuant to which we provide processing services for natural gas delivered to the Bridgeport processing facility. 
•Silver Creek processing system. Our Silver Creek processing system, located in Weatherford, Azle, and Fort Worth, Texas, includes three processing plants: the Azle plant, the Silver Creek plant, and the Goforth plant, 
which account for 50 MMcf/d, 200 MMcf/d, and 30 MMcf/d of processing capacity, respectively. The Azle and Goforth plants are idled due to decreased volumes, and these plants remain non-operational. Currently, the processing capacity at the Silver Creek plant is sufficient to process all gas on the Silver Creek processing system. 
•Fractionation Facility. Our Bridgeport processing plant in North Texas also has fractionation capabilities that provide operational flexibility for the related processing plants but is not the primary fractionation facility for the NGLs produced by the processing plants. Under our current contracts, we do not earn fractionation fees for operating this facility, so throughput volumes through this facility are not captured on a routine basis and are not significant to our adjusted gross margin. 
Corporate Segment Assets. Our Corporate segment assets primarily consist of our 38.75% ownership interest in GCF and 30% ownership interest in the Cedar Cove JV. 
•GCF. We own a 38.75% interest in GCF, with the remaining interests owned 22.5% by Phillips 66, and 38.75% by Targa Resources Partners, LP. GCF owns an NGL fractionator located on the Gulf Coast at Mont Belvieu, Texas. Targa Resources Partners, LP is the operator of the fractionator. GCF receives raw mix NGLs from customers, fractionates the raw mix, and redelivers the finished products to customers for a fee. Beginning in January 2021, the GCF assets were temporarily idled to reduce operating expenses. We expect these assets to resume operations when there is a sustained need for additional fractionation capacity in Mont Belvieu.
•Cedar Cove JV. We own a 30% interest in the Cedar Cove JV, which operates gathering and compression assets in Blaine County, Oklahoma that tie into our existing Oklahoma assets. Kinder Morgan, Inc. owns a 70% interest in, and is the operator of, the Cedar Cove JV. All gas gathered by the Cedar Cove JV is processed by our Central Oklahoma processing facilities.
Recent Developments 
Phantom Processing Plant. In November 2021, we began moving equipment and facilities associated with the Thunderbird processing plant in Central Oklahoma to the Midland Basin. This processing plant relocation is expected to increase the processing capacity of our Permian Basin processing facilities by approximately 200 MMcf/d. We expect to complete the relocation in the second half of 2022.
Amarillo Rattler Acquisition. On April 30, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Amarillo Rattler, LLC, the owner of a gathering and processing system located in the Midland Basin. In connection with the purchase, we entered into an amended and restated gas gathering and processing agreement with Diamondback Energy, strengthening our dedicated acreage position with that entity. We acquired the system with an upfront payment of $50.0 million, which was paid with cash-on-hand, with an additional $10.0 million to be paid on April 30, 2022, and contingent consideration capped at $15.0 million and payable between 2024 and 2026 based on Diamondback Energy’s drilling activity above historical levels.
War Horse Processing Plant. In December 2020, we began moving equipment and facilities previously associated with the Battle Ridge processing plant in Central Oklahoma to the Permian Basin. The move has been completed and the War Horse processing plant began operations in August 2021. In November 2021, we completed an expansion to the War Horse processing plant, which increased the processing capacity to 95 MMcf/d.
Industry Overview 
The following diagram illustrates the gathering, processing, fractionation, stabilization, and transmission process. 

The midstream industry is the link between the exploration and production of natural gas and crude oil and condensate and the delivery of its components to end-user markets. The midstream industry is generally characterized by regional competition based on the proximity of gathering systems and processing plants to natural gas and crude oil and condensate producing wells. 
Natural gas gathering. The natural gas gathering process follows the drilling of wells into gas-bearing rock formations. After a well has been completed, it is connected to a gathering system. Gathering systems typically consist of a network of small diameter pipelines and, if necessary, compression and treating systems that collect natural gas from points near producing wells and transport it to larger pipelines for further transmission. 
Compression. Gathering systems are operated at pressures that will maximize the total natural gas throughput from all connected wells. Because wells produce gas at progressively lower field pressures as they age, it becomes increasingly difficult to deliver the remaining production in the ground against the higher pressure that exists in the connected gathering system. Natural gas compression is a mechanical process in which a volume of gas at an existing pressure is compressed to a desired higher pressure, allowing gas that no longer naturally flows into a higher-pressure downstream pipeline to be brought to market. Field compression is typically used to allow a gathering system to operate at a lower pressure or provide sufficient discharge pressure to deliver gas into a higher-pressure downstream pipeline. The remaining natural gas in the ground will not be produced if field compression is not installed because the gas will be unable to overcome the higher gathering system pressure. A declining well can continue delivering natural gas if field compression is installed. 
Natural gas processing. The principal components of natural gas are methane and ethane, but most natural gas also contains varying amounts of heavier NGLs and contaminants, such as water and CO2, sulfur compounds, nitrogen, or helium. Natural gas produced by a well may not be suitable for long-haul pipeline transportation or commercial use and may need to be processed to remove the heavier hydrocarbon components and contaminants. Natural gas in commercial distribution systems mostly consists of methane and ethane, and moisture and other contaminants have been removed, so there are negligible 
amounts of them in the gas stream. Natural gas is processed to remove unwanted contaminants that would interfere with pipeline transportation or use of the natural gas and to separate those hydrocarbon liquids from the gas that have higher value as NGLs. The removal and separation of individual hydrocarbons through processing is possible due to differences in weight, boiling point, vapor pressure, and other physical characteristics. Natural gas processing involves the separation of natural gas into pipeline-quality natural gas and a mixed NGL stream and the removal of contaminants. 
NGL fractionation. NGLs are separated into individual, more valuable components during the fractionation process. NGL fractionation facilities separate mixed NGL streams into discrete NGL products: ethane, propane, isobutane, normal butane, natural gasoline, and stabilized crude oil and condensate. Ethane is primarily used in the petrochemical industry as feedstock for ethylene, one of the basic building blocks for a wide range of plastics and other chemical products. Propane is used as a petrochemical feedstock in the production of ethylene and propylene and as a heating fuel, an engine fuel, and industrial fuel. Isobutane is used principally to enhance the octane content of motor gasoline. Normal butane is used as a petrochemical feedstock in the production of ethylene and butylene (a key ingredient in synthetic rubber), as a blend stock for motor gasoline, and to derive isobutene through isomerization. Natural gasoline, a mixture of pentanes and heavier hydrocarbons, is used primarily as motor gasoline blend stock or petrochemical feedstock. 
Natural gas transmission. Natural gas transmission pipelines receive natural gas from mainline transmission pipelines, processing plants, and gathering systems and deliver it to industrial end-users, utilities, and to other pipelines. 
Crude oil and condensate transmission. Crude oil and condensate are transported by pipelines, barges, rail cars, and tank trucks. The method of transportation used depends on, among other things, the resources of the transporter, the locations of the production points and the delivery points, cost-efficiency, and the quantity of product being transported. 
Condensate Stabilization. Condensate stabilization is the distillation of the condensate product to remove the lighter end components, which ultimately creates a higher quality condensate product that is then delivered via truck, rail, or pipeline to local markets. 
Brine gathering and disposal services. Typically, shale wells produce significant amounts of water that, in most cases, require disposal. Produced water and frac-flowback is hauled via truck transport or is pumped through pipelines from its origin at the oilfield tank battery or drilling pad to the disposal location. Once the water reaches the delivery disposal location, water is processed and filtered to remove impurities, and injection wells place fluids underground for storage and disposal. 
Storage. Demand for natural gas, NGLs, and crude oil fluctuate daily and seasonally, while production and pipeline deliveries are relatively constant in the short term. Storage of products during periods of low demand helps to ensure that sufficient supplies are available during periods of high demand. Natural gas and NGLs are stored in large volumes in underground facilities and in smaller volumes in tanks above and below ground, while crude oil is typically stored in tanks above ground. 
Crude oil and condensate terminals. Crude oil and condensate rail terminals are an integral part of ensuring the movement of new crude oil and condensate production from the developing shale plays in the United States and Canada. In general, the crude oil and condensate rail loading terminals are used to load rail cars and transport the commodity out of developing basins into market rich areas of the country where crude oil and condensate rail unloading terminals are used to unload rail cars and store crude oil and condensate volumes for third parties until the crude oil and condensate is redelivered to premium market delivery points via pipelines, trucks, or rail. 
Balancing Supply and Demand 
When we purchase natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, and condensate, we establish a margin normally by selling it for physical delivery to third-party users. We can also use over-the-counter derivative instruments or enter into future delivery obligations under futures contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) related to our natural gas purchases to balance our margin position. Through these transactions, we seek to maintain a position that is balanced between (1) purchases and (2) sales or future delivery obligations. Our policy is not to acquire and hold natural gas, NGL, or crude oil futures contracts or derivative products for the purpose of speculating on price changes. 
Competition 
The business of providing gathering, transmission, processing, and marketing services for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, and condensate is highly competitive. We face strong competition in obtaining natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, and condensate 
supplies and in the marketing, transportation, and processing of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, and condensate. Our competitors include major integrated and independent exploration and production companies, natural gas producers, interstate and intrastate pipelines, other natural gas, NGLs, and crude oil and condensate gatherers, and natural gas processors. Competition for natural gas and crude oil and condensate supplies is primarily based on geographic location of facilities in relation to production or markets, the reputation, efficiency, and reliability of the gatherer, and the pricing arrangements offered by the gatherer. For areas where acreage is not dedicated to us, we compete with similar enterprises in providing additional gathering and processing services in its respective areas of operation. Many of our competitors may offer more services or have greater financial resources and access to larger natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, and condensate supplies than we do. Our competition varies in different geographic areas. 
In marketing natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, and condensate, we have numerous competitors, including marketing affiliates of interstate pipelines, major integrated oil and gas companies, and local and national natural gas producers, gatherers, brokers, and marketers of widely varying sizes, financial resources, and experience. Local utilities and distributors of natural gas are, in some cases, engaged directly and through affiliates in marketing activities that compete with our marketing operations. 
We face strong competition for acquisitions and development of new projects from both established and start-up companies. Competition increases the cost to acquire existing facilities or businesses and results in fewer commitments and lower returns for new pipelines or other development projects. Our competitors may have greater financial resources than we possess or may be willing to accept lower returns or greater risks. Our competition differs by region and by the nature of the business or the project involved. 
Natural Gas, NGL, Crude Oil, and Condensate Supply 
Our gathering and transmission pipelines have connections with major intrastate and interstate pipelines, which we believe have ample natural gas and NGL supplies in excess of the volumes required for the operation of these systems. We evaluate well and reservoir data that is either publicly available or furnished by producers or other service providers in connection with the construction and acquisition of our gathering systems and assets to determine the availability of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, and condensate supply for our systems and assets and/or obtain an MVC from the producer that results in a rate of return on investment. We do not routinely obtain independent evaluations of reserves dedicated to our systems and assets due to the cost and relatively limited benefit of such evaluations. Accordingly, we do not have estimates of total reserves dedicated to our systems and assets or the anticipated life of such producing reserves. 
Credit Risk and Significant Customers 
We are subject to risk of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers and other counterparties, such as our lenders and hedging counterparties. We diligently attempt to ensure that we issue credit to only credit-worthy customers. However, our purchase and resale of crude oil, condensate, NGLs, and natural gas exposes us to significant credit risk, as the margin on any sale is generally a very small percentage of the total sales price. Therefore, a credit loss can be very large relative to our overall profitability. A substantial portion of our throughput volumes come from customers that have investment-grade ratings. However, lower commodity prices in future periods and other macro-economic factors, including the ongoing or future effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our industry and our customers may result in a reduction in our customers’ liquidity and ability to make payments or perform on their obligations to us.
The following customers individually represented greater than 10% of our consolidated revenues during 2021, 2020, or 2019. These customers represented a significant percentage of our consolidated revenues, and the loss of these customers would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations because the revenues and adjusted gross margin received from transactions with these customers is material to us. No other customers represented greater than 10% of our consolidated revenues during the periods presented.

Regulation 
Recent Regulatory Developments. On January 20, 2021, the Acting Secretary for the Department of the Interior signed an order suspending new fossil fuel leasing and permitting on federal lands, including offshore pipeline leases, for 60 days. Then on January 27, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order indefinitely suspending new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices. Several states filed lawsuits challenging the suspension and on June 15, 2021, a judge in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana issued a nationwide temporary injunction blocking the suspension. The Department of the Interior appealed the U.S. District Court’s ruling but resumed oil and gas leasing pending resolution of the appeal. In November 2021, the Department of the Interior completed its review and issued a report on the federal oil and gas leasing program. The Department of the Interior’s report recommends several changes to federal leasing practices, including changes to royalty payments, bidding, and bonding requirements.
If our customers are unable to secure permits, sustained reductions in exploration or production activity in our areas of operation could lead to reduced utilization of our pipeline and terminal systems or reduced rates under renegotiated transportation or storage agreements. We are still evaluating the effects of the potential change to the federal leasing program on our operations and our customers’ operations, but our inability and our customers’ inability to secure required permits could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, including our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.
Natural Gas Pipeline Regulation. We own an interstate natural gas pipeline that is subject to regulation as a natural gas company by FERC under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (“NGA”). FERC regulates the rates and terms and conditions of service on interstate natural gas pipelines, as well as the certification, construction, modification, expansion, and abandonment of facilities. 
The rates and terms and conditions of service for our interstate pipeline services regulated by FERC must be just and reasonable and not unduly preferential or unduly discriminatory, although negotiated rates may be accepted in certain circumstances. Such rates and terms and conditions of service are set forth in FERC-approved tariffs. Proposed rate increases and changes to our tariff are subject to FERC approval. Pursuant to FERC’s jurisdiction over rates, existing rates may be challenged by complaint or by FERC on its own initiative and proposed new or changed rates may be challenged by protest. If protested, a rate increase may be suspended for up to five months and collected, subject to refund. If, upon completion of an investigation, FERC finds that the new or changed rate is unlawful, it is authorized to require the pipeline to refund revenues collected in excess of the just and reasonable rate during the term of the investigation. 
In addition to policies regarding rate setting, interstate natural gas pipelines regulated by FERC are required to comply with numerous regulations related to standards of conduct, market transparency, and market manipulation. FERC’s standards of conduct regulate the manner in which interstate natural gas pipelines may interact with their marketing affiliates if such marketing affiliates are shippers on their interstate natural gas pipelines. FERC’s market oversight and transparency regulations require regulated entities to submit annual reports of threshold purchases or sales of natural gas and publicly post certain information on scheduled volumes. FERC’s market manipulation regulations, promulgated pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the “EPAct 2005”), make it unlawful for any entity, directly or indirectly in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, to (1) use or employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud; (2) make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made not misleading (in light of the circumstances under which the statements were made); or (3) engage in any act, practice, or course of business that operates (or would operate) as a fraud or deceit upon any person. The EPAct 2005 also gives FERC authority to impose civil penalties for violations of these statutes up to $1.0 million per day per violation for violations occurring after August 8, 2005. The maximum penalty authority established by the statute has been adjusted to approximately $1.39 million per day per violation and will continue to be adjusted periodically for inflation. Should we fail to comply with all applicable FERC-administered statutes, rules, regulations, and orders, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines. 
Certain of our intrastate natural gas pipelines also transport gas in interstate commerce and, thus, the rates, terms and conditions of such services are subject to FERC jurisdiction under Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (“NGPA”). Pipelines providing transportation service under Section 311 of the NGPA are required to provide services on an open and nondiscriminatory basis, and the maximum rates for interstate transportation services provided by such pipelines must be “fair and equitable.” Such rates are generally subject to review every five years by FERC or by an appropriate state agency. 
In addition to regulation under Section 311 of the NGPA, our intrastate natural gas pipeline operations are subject to regulation by various state agencies. Most state agencies possess the authority to review and authorize natural gas transportation transactions and the construction, acquisition, abandonment, and interconnection of physical facilities for intrastate pipelines. State agencies also may regulate transportation rates, service terms and conditions, and contract pricing. 
Liquids Pipeline Regulation. We own certain liquids and crude oil pipelines that are regulated by FERC as common carrier interstate pipelines under the Interstate Commerce Act (“ICA”), the Energy Policy Act of 1992, and related rules and orders. 
FERC regulation requires that interstate liquids pipeline rates and terms and conditions of service, including rates for transportation of crude oil, condensate, and NGLs, be filed with FERC and that these rates and terms and conditions of service be “just and reasonable” and not unduly discriminatory or unduly preferential. 
Rates of interstate liquids pipelines are currently regulated by FERC primarily through an annual indexing methodology, under which pipelines increase or decrease their rates in accordance with an index adjustment specified by FERC. This adjustment is subject to review every five years. On December 17, 2020, for the five-year period beginning on July 1, 2021, FERC established an annual index adjustment equal to the change in the producer price index for finished goods plus 0.78%. On January 20, 2022, however, FERC issued an Order on Rehearing revising the annual index adjustment to the change in the producer price index for finished goods minus 0.21% (“Order on Rehearing”). As a result of the change in the index adjustment, certain ceiling levels for our interstate liquids pipelines were reduced and any rates that exceeded the newly computed ceiling levels were subsequently lowered to bring those rates into compliance with the revised ceiling level. The revised rates will become effective March 1, 2022. 
The ICA permits interested persons to challenge proposed new or changed rates and authorizes FERC to suspend the effectiveness of such rates for up to seven months and investigate such rates. If, upon completion of an investigation, FERC finds that the new or changed rate is unlawful, it is authorized to require the pipeline to refund revenues collected in excess of the just and reasonable rate during the term of the investigation. FERC may also investigate, upon complaint or on its own motion, rates that are already in effect and may order a carrier to change its rates prospectively. Under certain circumstances, FERC could limit our ability to set rates based on our costs or could order us to reduce our rates and pay reparations to complaining shippers for up to two years prior to the date of the complaint. FERC also has the authority to change our terms and conditions of service if it determines that they are unjust and unreasonable or unduly discriminatory or preferential. 
As we acquire, construct, and operate new liquids assets and expand our liquids transportation business, the classification and regulation of our liquids transportation services, including services that our marketing companies provide on our FERC-regulated liquids pipelines, are subject to ongoing assessment and change based on the services we provide and determinations by FERC and the courts. Such changes may subject additional services we provide to regulation by FERC. 
Intrastate NGL and other petroleum pipelines are not generally subject to rate regulation by FERC, but they are subject to regulation by various agencies in the respective states where they are located. While such regulatory regimes vary, state agencies typically require intrastate NGL and petroleum pipelines to file their rates with the agencies and permit shippers to challenge existing rates or proposed rate increases. 
Gathering Pipeline Regulation. Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the jurisdiction of FERC under the NGA (no such exemption exists under the ICA for pipelines transporting liquids in interstate commerce). We own a number of natural gas pipelines that we believe meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish that a pipeline is a gathering pipeline and therefore not subject to FERC jurisdiction. The distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is a fact-intensive analysis, however, so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities are subject to change. Application of FERC jurisdiction to our gathering facilities could increase our operating costs, decrease our rates, and adversely affect our business. State regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental, and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory requirements and complaint-based rate regulation. 
In addition, we are subject to some state ratable take and common purchaser statutes. The ratable take statutes generally require gatherers to take, without undue discrimination, natural gas production that may be tendered to the gatherer for handling. Similarly, common purchaser statutes generally require gatherers to purchase without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. These statutes are designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer or one source of supply over another source of supply. 
Natural Gas Storage Regulation. The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) regulates safety issues related to downhole facilities located at both intrastate and interstate underground natural gas storage facilities. PHMSA mandates certain reporting requirements for operators of underground 
natural gas storage facilities and sets minimum federal safety standards. In addition, all intrastate transportation related underground natural gas storage facilities are subject to minimum federal safety standards and are inspected by PHMSA or by a state entity that has chosen to expand its authority to regulate these facilities under a certification filed with PHMSA. We are in compliance with these PHMSA rules. 
Certain of our field injection and withdrawal wells and water disposal wells are subject to the jurisdiction of the Railroad Commission of Texas (“TRRC”). TRRC regulations require that we report the volumes of natural gas and water disposal associated with the operations of such wells on a monthly and annual basis, respectively. Results of periodic mechanical integrity tests must also be reported to the TRRC. In addition, our underground gas storage caverns in Louisiana are subject to the jurisdiction of the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources (“LDNR”). In recent years, LDNR has put in place more comprehensive regulations governing underground hydrocarbon storage in salt caverns, and we are in compliance with these newer regulations. 
We also operate brine disposal wells that are regulated as Class II wells under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”). The SDWA imposes requirements on owners and operators of Class II wells through the EPA’s Underground Injection Control program, including construction, operating, monitoring and testing, reporting, and closure requirements. Our brine disposal wells are also subject to comparable state laws and regulations. For more information, see “Environmental Matters” below. 
Sales of Natural Gas and NGLs. The prices at which we sell natural gas and NGLs currently are not subject to federal regulation and, for the most part, are not subject to state regulation. Our natural gas and NGL sales are, however, affected by the availability, terms, cost, and regulation of pipeline transportation. 
Employee Safety. We are subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”), and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities, and citizens. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with the OSHA requirements including general industry standards, record keeping requirements, and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances. 
Pipeline Safety Regulations. Our pipelines are subject to regulation by PHMSA pursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 (“NGPSA”) and the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (“PSIA”). The NGPSA regulates safety requirements in the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of gas pipeline facilities. The PSIA established mandatory inspections for all U.S. crude oil and natural gas transportation pipelines and some gathering lines in high-consequence areas (“HCAs”), which include, among other things, areas of high population density or that serve as sources of drinking water. PHMSA has developed regulations implementing the PSIA that require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections and other measures to ensure pipeline safety in HCAs. Additionally, the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011 increased penalties for safety violations, established additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines, and required studies of certain safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements for existing pipelines. In December 2020, the President of the United States signed the Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2020 (the “PIPES Act”), which reauthorizes PHMSA’s oil and gas pipeline programs through 2023 and imposes additional mandates on the agency. For example, the law requires, among other things, rulemaking to amend the integrity management program, emergency response plan, operation and maintenance manual, and pressure control recordkeeping requirements for gas distribution operators; to create new leak detection and repair program obligations; and to set new minimum federal safety standards for onshore gas gathering lines. Additionally, PHMSA’s maximum civil penalties were increased in January 2021.
On January 23, 2017, PHMSA issued a final rule amending its pipeline safety regulations to address requirements of the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 and to update and clarify certain regulatory requirements regarding notifications of accidents and incidents. The final rule also added provisions for cost recovery for design reviews of certain new projects, provides for renewal of existing special permits, and incorporates certain standards for in-line inspections and stress corrosion cracking assessments. On January 11, 2021, PHMSA issued another final rule amending its pipeline safety regulations to ease regulatory burdens on the construction, operation, and maintenance of gas transmission, distribution, and gathering pipeline systems. The amendments also modified the monetary threshold for reporting to PHMSA incidents that result in property damage from $50,000 to $122,000. 
In July 2018, PHMSA issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on the class location requirements for natural gas transmission pipelines, and particularly the actions operators must take when class locations change due to population growth or building construction near the pipeline. The associated notice of proposed rulemaking, 
issued October 14, 2020, proposes an integrity management alternative for managing class location changes in areas that increase in population above a defined threshold.
In October 2019, PHMSA issued three new final rules. One rule, effective in December 2019, establishes procedures to implement the expanded emergency order enforcement authority set forth in an October 2016 interim final rule. Among other things, this rule allows PHMSA to issue an emergency order without advance notice or opportunity for a hearing. The other two rules, effective in July 2020, impose several new requirements on operators of onshore gas transmission systems and hazardous liquids pipelines. The rule concerning gas transmission extends the requirement to conduct integrity assessments beyond HCAs to pipelines in Moderate Consequence Areas (“MCAs”). It also includes requirements to reconfirm Maximum Allowable Operating Pressure (“MAOP”), report MAOP exceedances, consider seismicity as a risk factor in integrity management, and use certain safety features on in-line inspection equipment. The rule concerning hazardous liquids extends the required use of leak detection systems beyond HCAs to all regulated non-gathering hazardous liquid pipelines, requires reporting for gravity fed lines and unregulated gathering lines, requires periodic inspection of all lines not in HCAs, calls for inspections of lines after extreme weather events, and adds a requirement to make all lines in or affecting HCAs capable of accommodating in-line inspection tools over the next 20 years. 
In addition, PHMSA has taken recent action to regulate gathering systems, which includes integrity management requirements. In November 2021, PHMSA issued a final rule that extended pipeline safety requirements to onshore gas gathering pipelines. The rule requires all onshore gas gathering pipeline operators to comply with PHMSA’s incident and annual reporting requirements. It also extends existing pipeline safety requirements to a new category of gas gathering pipelines, “Type C” lines, which generally include high-pressure pipelines that are larger than 8.625 inches in diameter. Safety requirements applicable to Type C lines vary based on pipeline diameter and potential failure consequences. The final rule becomes effective in May 2022 and operators must comply with the applicable safety requirements by November 2022.
At the state level, several states have passed legislation or promulgated rules dealing with pipeline safety. We believe that our pipeline operations are in substantial compliance with applicable PHMSA and state requirements; however, due to the possibility of new or amended laws and regulations or reinterpretation of existing laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that future compliance with PHMSA or state requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
Environmental Matters
Recent Developments. On January 20, 2021, the Biden Administration came into office and immediately issued a number of executive orders related to environmental matters that could affect our operations and those of our customers, including an Executive Order on “Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis” seeking to adopt new regulations and policies to address climate change and suspend, revise, or rescind, prior agency actions that are identified as conflicting with the Biden Administration’s climate policies. Among the areas that could be affected by the review are regulations addressing methane emissions and the part of the extraction process known as hydraulic fracturing. The Biden Administration has also issued other orders that could ultimately affect our business, such as the executive order rejoining the Paris Agreement. As part of rejoining the Paris Agreement, the Biden Administration announced that the United States would commit to a 50 to 52 percent reduction from 2005 levels of GHG emissions by 2030, and set the goal of reaching net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. The Biden Administration could seek, in the future, to put into place additional executive orders, policy and regulatory reviews, and seek to have Congress pass legislation that could adversely affect the production of oil and gas assets and our operations and those of our customers. 
General. Our operations involve processing and pipeline services for delivery of hydrocarbons (natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, and condensates) from point-of-origin at crude oil and gas wellheads operated by our suppliers to our end-use market customers. Our facilities include natural gas processing and fractionation plants, natural gas and NGL storage caverns, brine disposal wells, pipelines and associated facilities, fractionation and storage units for NGLs, and transportation and delivery of hydrocarbons. As with all companies in our industrial sector, our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the discharge of hazardous substances or solid wastes into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment. Compliance with existing and anticipated environmental laws and regulations increases our overall costs of doing business, including costs of planning, constructing, and operating plants, pipelines, and other facilities, as well as capital expenditures necessary to maintain or upgrade equipment and facilities. Similar costs are likely upon changes in laws or regulations and upon any future acquisition of operating assets. 
Any failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to equipment failures, and obtaining required governmental approvals and permits, may result in the assessment of administrative, civil, or criminal penalties, imposition of investigatory or remedial activities, and, in certain, less common circumstances, issuance of temporary 
or permanent injunctions, or construction or operation bans or delays. As part of the regular evaluation of our operations, we routinely review and update governmental approvals as necessary. 
The continuing trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and thus there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. Moreover, risks of process upsets, accidental releases, or spills are associated with possible future operations, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities, including those relating to claims for damage to the environment, property, and persons as a result of any such upsets, releases, or spills. We may be unable to pass on current or future environmental costs to our customers. A discharge or release of hydrocarbons, hazardous substances, or solid wastes into the environment could, to the extent losses related to the event are not insured, subject us to substantial expense, including both the cost to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to pay fines or penalties that may be assessed and the cost related to claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury or damage to natural resources or property. We attempt to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to comply with changing environmental laws and regulations and to minimize costs with respect to more stringent future laws and regulations or more rigorous enforcement of existing laws and regulations. 
Hazardous Substances and Solid Waste. Environmental laws and regulations that relate to the release of hazardous substances or solid wastes into soils, sediments, groundwater, and surface water and/or include measures to prevent and control pollution may pose significant costs to our industrial sector. These laws and regulations generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation, and disposal of solid wastes and hazardous substances and may require investigatory and corrective actions at facilities where such waste or substance may have been released or disposed. For instance, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the federal “Superfund” law, and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that contributed to a release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. Potentially responsible parties include the owner or operator of the site where a release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at an off-site location, such as a landfill. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up and restoring sites where hazardous substances have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources. CERCLA also authorizes the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and, in some cases, third parties, to take actions in response to threats to public health or the environment and to seek recovery of costs they incur from the potentially responsible classes of persons. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or solid wastes released into the environment. Although petroleum, natural gas, and NGLs are excluded from CERCLA’s definition of a “hazardous substance,” in the course of ordinary operations, we may generate wastes that may fall within the definition of a “hazardous substance.” In addition, there are other laws and regulations that can create liability for releases of petroleum, natural gas, or NGLs. Moreover, we may be responsible under CERCLA or other laws for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which such substances have been disposed. We have not received any notification that we may be potentially responsible for cleanup costs under CERCLA or any analogous federal, state, or local law. 
We also generate, and may in the future generate, both hazardous and nonhazardous solid wastes that are subject to requirements of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and/or comparable state statutes. From time to time, the EPA and state regulatory agencies have considered the adoption of stricter disposal standards for nonhazardous wastes, including crude oil, condensate, and natural gas wastes. Moreover, it is possible that some wastes generated by us that are currently exempted from the definition of hazardous waste may in the future lose this exemption and be designated as “hazardous wastes,” resulting in the wastes being subject to more rigorous and costly management and disposal requirements. Additionally, the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”) and analogous state laws impose requirements on the use, storage, and disposal of various chemicals and chemical substances. Changes in applicable laws or regulations may result in an increase in our capital expenditures or plant operating expenses or otherwise impose limits or restrictions on our production and operations. 
We currently own or lease, have in the past owned or leased, and in the future may own or lease, properties that have been used over the years for brine disposal operations, crude oil and condensate transportation, natural gas gathering, treating, or processing and for NGL fractionation, transportation, or storage. Solid waste disposal practices within the NGL industry and other oil and natural gas related industries have improved over the years with the passage and implementation of various environmental laws and regulations. Nevertheless, some hydrocarbons and other solid wastes may have been released on or under various properties owned, leased, or operated by us during the operating history of those properties. In addition, a number of these properties may have been operated by third parties over whose operations and hydrocarbon and waste management practices we had no control. These properties and wastes disposed thereon may be subject to the SWDA, CERCLA, RCRA, 
TSCA, and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required, alone or in participation with others, to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes or property contamination, if present, including groundwater contamination, or to take action to prevent future contamination. 
Air Emissions. Our current and future operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act and regulations promulgated thereunder and under comparable state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including our facilities, and impose various control, monitoring, and reporting requirements. Pursuant to these laws and regulations, we may be required to obtain environmental agency pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions or result in an increase in existing air emissions, obtain and comply with the terms of air permits, which include various emission and operational limitations, or use specific emission control technologies to limit emissions. We likely will be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with maintaining or obtaining governmental approvals addressing air emission-related issues. Failure to comply with applicable air statutes or regulations may lead to the assessment of administrative, civil, or criminal penalties and may result in the limitation or cessation of construction or operation of certain air emission sources or require us to incur additional capital expenditures. Although we can give no assurances, we believe such requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, and the requirements are not expected to be more burdensome to us than to any similarly situated company. 
In addition, the EPA included Wise County, the location of our Bridgeport facility, in its January 2012 revision to the Dallas-Fort Worth ozone nonattainment area (“DFW area”) for the 2008 revised ozone national ambient air quality standard (“NAAQS”). Effective September 23, 2019, the DFW area was reclassified to a serious nonattainment area under this standard, potentially requiring the state to adopt more stringent permitting requirements. Under the area’s serious nonattainment designation, new major sources in Wise County, meaning sources that emit greater than 50 tons/year of nitrogen oxides (“NOx”) and volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”), as well as major modifications of existing facilities in the county resulting in net emissions increases of greater than 25 tons/year of NOx or VOCs, are subject to more stringent new source review (“NSR”) pre-construction permitting requirements than they would be in an area that is in attainment with the 2008 ozone NAAQS. NSR pre-construction permits can take twelve to eighteen months to obtain and require the permit applicant to offset the proposed emission increases with reductions elsewhere at a 1.2 to 1 ratio. The attainment date for serious nonattainment areas was July 20, 2021, with a 2020 attainment year. The DFW area did not comply with the 2008 ozone NAAQs by the end of 2020 and thus risks reclassification to severe nonattainment. Reclassification for the DFW area is anticipated in early 2022. 
In October 2015, the EPA promulgated a new NAAQS for ozone of 70 parts per billion (“ppb”) for both the 8-hour primary and secondary standards, down from the 75 ppb standards of the 2008 ozone NAAQS. On June 4, 2018, EPA designated the DFW area, including Wise County, as a marginal nonattainment area under this standard. EPA published a final rule to implement the 2015 ozone NAAQS on December 6, 2018. The area’s marginal classification does not require the additional control measures to be implemented. The DFW Area, however, failed to attain this standard by its marginal attainment date of August 2021, and now risks reclassification to moderate nonattainment, which could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits, and result in potentially significant expenditures for pollution control equipment. Furthermore, the area remains subject to the requirements associated with its serious classification under the 2008 standard notwithstanding its marginal classification under the 2015 standard. The 2015 standards were challenged before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. On August 23, 2019, the D.C. Circuit upheld the EPA’s primary ozone standard and remanded the secondary standard to EPA for reconsideration. The implementation of these standards could result in stricter permitting requirements, delays or prohibitions on our ability to obtain such permits, and result in potentially significant expenditures for pollution control equipment. Reclassification for the DFW area is anticipated in early 2022.
The EPA reviewed the 2015 NAAQS standard in 2020 but decided to retain the standard without revision. EPA, however, recently announced that it intends to reconsider the 2020 decision to retain the 2015 NAAQS standards. To the extent that EPA’s reconsideration results in a new standard, the new standard could cause stricter permitting requirements, delays or prohibitions on our ability to obtain such permits, and result in potentially significant expenditures for pollution control equipment. Furthermore, the area remains subject to the requirements associated with its serious classification under the 2008 standard notwithstanding its marginal classification under the 2015 standard.
Effective May 15, 2012, the EPA promulgated rules under the Clean Air Act that established new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production, pipelines, and processing operations under the New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAPs”) programs. These rules require the control of emissions through reduced emission (or “green”) completions and establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from wet seal and reciprocating compressors, pneumatic controllers, and storage vessels at production facilities, gathering systems, boosting facilities, and onshore natural gas processing plants. In addition, the rules revised existing requirements for VOC emissions from equipment leaks at onshore natural gas processing plants by lowering the leak definition for valves from 
10,000 parts per million to 500 parts per million and requiring the monitoring of connectors, pumps, pressure relief devices, and open-ended lines. These rules required a number of modifications to our assets and operations. In October 2012, several challenges to the EPA’s NSPS and NESHAPs rules for the industry were filed by various parties, including environmental groups, and industry associations. In a January 16, 2013 unopposed motion to hold this litigation in abeyance, the EPA indicated that it may reconsider some aspects of the rules. The case remains in abeyance. The EPA has since revised certain aspects of the rules. 
In partial response to the issues raised regarding the 2012 rulemaking, the EPA finalized new rules that took effect August 2, 2016 to regulate emissions of methane and VOCs from new and modified sources in the oil and gas sector under the NSPS. In September 2020, the EPA published two additional final rules, the 2020 Policy Rule and the 2020 Technical Amendments. The 2020 Policy Rule removed sources in the transmission and storage segment from the regulated source category of the 2016 NSPS, rescinded the NSPS (including both VOC and methane requirements) applicable to those sources, and rescinded the methane-specific requirements of the NSPS applicable to sources in the production and processing segments. On January 21, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order on “Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis” directing EPA to consider publishing for notice and comment, by September 2021, a proposed rule suspending, revising, or rescinding the 2020 NSPS for the oil and natural gas sector, and on June 30, 2021, President Biden signed a joint congressional resolution rescinding the 2020 Policy rule. In November 2021, the EPA proposed a new rule targeting methane and VOC emissions from new and existing oil and gas sources, including sources in the production, processing, transmission, and storage segments. The proposed rule would: (1) update NSPS subpart OOOOa; (2) adopt a new NSPS subpart OOOOb for sources that commence construction, modification, or reconstruction after the date the proposed rule is published in the Federal Register; and (3) adopt a new NSPS subpart OOOOc to establish emissions guidelines, which will inform state plans to establish standards for existing sources. If finalized, these increasingly stringent requirements, or the application of new requirements to existing facilities, could result in additional restrictions on operations and increased compliance costs for us or our customers. The Company had previously complied with these regulations during the Obama administration and does not expect the reinstatement to have a material effect on the Company or its operations.
In June 2016, the EPA also finalized a rule regarding alternative criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air quality permitting purposes. This rule could cause small facilities within one-quarter mile of one another to be deemed a major source on an aggregate basis, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting processes and requirements across the oil and gas industry. EPA draft guidance issued in September 2018 clarified that this rule pertains to the oil and gas industry. 
Other federal agencies have also taken steps to impose new or more stringent regulations on the oil and gas sector in order to further reduce methane emissions. For example, the BLM adopted new rules, effective January 17, 2017, to reduce venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and natural gas production activities on onshore federal and Indian leases. Certain provisions of the BLM rule went into effect in January 2017, while the effective date of others was delayed until 2019 pending reconsideration. In September 2018, BLM published a final rule that rescinded several requirements of the 2016 methane rules. The September 2018 rule was challenged in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California almost immediately after issuance. In July 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California vacated BLM’s 2018 revision rule. Additionally, in October 2020, a Wyoming federal district judge vacated the 2016 venting and flaring rule. In December 2020, environmental groups appealed the October 2020 decision, and litigation is ongoing. As a result of this continued regulatory focus and other factors, additional GHG regulation of the oil and gas industry remains possible. Compliance with such rules could result in additional costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs for us and for other companies in our industry. While we are not able at this time to estimate such additional costs, as is the case with similarly situated entities in the industry, they could be significant for us. Compliance with such rules, as well as any new state rules, may also make it more difficult for our suppliers and customers to operate, thereby reducing the volume of natural gas transported through our pipelines, which may adversely affect our business. However, the status of recent and future rules and rulemaking initiatives under the Biden Administration remains uncertain. 
Climate Change. In December 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as “greenhouse gases,” present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to the warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act that require Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) pre-construction permits and Title V operating permits for greenhouse gas emissions from certain large stationary sources. Under these regulations, facilities required to obtain PSD permits must meet “best available control technology” standards for their greenhouse gas emissions established by the states or, in some cases, by the EPA on a case by case basis. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified sources in the United States, including, among others, certain onshore oil and natural gas processing and fractionating facilities. In addition, on January 21, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order on “Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis” seeking to adopt new regulations and policies to address 
climate change and suspend, revise, or rescind, prior agency actions that are identified as conflicting with the Biden Administration’s climate policies. 
In addition, efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues. Because regulation of greenhouse gas emissions is relatively new, further regulatory, legislative, and judicial developments are likely to occur. Such developments in greenhouse gas initiatives may affect us and other companies operating in the oil and gas industry. In addition to these developments, recent judicial decisions have allowed certain tort claims alleging property damage to proceed against greenhouse gas emissions sources, which may increase our litigation risk for such claims. In addition, in 2015, the United States participated in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement entered into force November 4, 2016, and requires countries to review and “represent a progression” in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. In November 2019, the State Department formally informed the United Nations of the United States’ withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and withdrew from the agreement in November 2020. However, on January 20, 2021, President Biden signed an instrument that reverses this withdrawal, and the United States will formally re-join the Paris Agreement on February 19, 2021. As part of rejoining the Paris Agreement, President Biden announced that the United States would commit to a 50 to 52 percent reduction from 2005 levels of GHG emissions by 2030 and set the goal of reaching net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. Due to the uncertainties surrounding the regulation of and other risks associated with greenhouse gas emissions, we cannot predict the financial impact of related developments on us. 
Federal or state legislative or regulatory initiatives that regulate or restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas in which we conduct business could adversely affect the availability of, or demand for, the products we store, transport, and process, and, depending on the particular program adopted, could increase the costs of our operations, including costs to operate and maintain our facilities, install new emission controls on our facilities, acquire allowances to authorize our greenhouse gas emissions, pay any taxes related to our greenhouse gas emissions, and/or administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program. We may be unable to recover any such lost revenues or increased costs in the rates we charge our customers, and any such recovery may depend on events beyond our control, including the outcome of future rate proceedings before FERC or state regulatory agencies and the provisions of any final legislation or regulations. Reductions in our revenues or increases in our expenses as a result of climate control initiatives could have adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
Due to their location, our operations along the Gulf Coast are vulnerable to operational and structural damages resulting from hurricanes and other severe weather systems, while inland operations include areas subject to tornadoes. Our insurance may not cover all associated losses. We are taking steps to mitigate physical risks from storms, but no assurance can be given that future storms will not have a material adverse effect on our business. 
Hydraulic Fracturing and Wastewater. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act, and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants, including NGL-related wastes, into state waters or waters of the United States. In June 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“USACE”) finalized a rule intended to clarify the meaning of the term “waters of the United States,” (“WOTUS”) which establishes the scope of regulated waters under the Clean Water Act. The rule has been challenged and was stayed by federal courts. If upheld, the rule is expected to expand federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act. On February 6, 2018, EPA and USACE published a final rule to postpone the effectiveness of the WOTUS rule until February 6, 2020. The February 2018 delay rule is subject to pending judicial challenges in multiple federal district courts. In October 2019, EPA and USACE issued a final rule that repealed the 2015 WOTUS definition and reinstated the agencies’ narrower pre-2015 scope of federal CWA jurisdiction. In April 2020, EPA and USACE issued a new final WOTUS definition that continues to provide a narrower scope of federal CWA jurisdiction than contemplated under the 2015 WOTUS definition, while also providing for greater predictability and consistency of federal CWA jurisdiction. Judicial challenges to EPA’s 2015 WOTUS definition, the October 2019 repeal rule and the April 2020 final rule are currently before multiple federal district courts. Additionally, the rules are among agency actions listed for review in accordance with President Biden’s January 20, 2021 Executive Order: “Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis.”
On August 30, 2021, the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona vacated and remanded the April 2020 final rule. Following the August 30, 2021 decision, EPA and USACE ceased implementing the April 2020 final rule, and on December 7, 2021, published a proposed rule titled the “Revised Definition of ‘Waters of the United States.’” The proposed rule provides that EPA and USACE will began interpreting the WOTUS definition consistent with the Pre-2015 regulatory regime, generally referred to as the “1986 definition,” subject to some amendments that reflect the agencies’ interpretation of the statutory limits on the WOTUS definition and Supreme Court precedent. The proposed rule, if finalized, would be expected to significantly expand federal jurisdiction as compared to the April 2020 final rule, and as such, we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for activities in jurisdictional waters, including wetlands. Regulations promulgated pursuant to the Clean Water Act require that entities that discharge into federal and state waters obtain National Pollutant Discharge 
Elimination System permits and/or state permits authorizing these discharges. The Clean Water Act and analogous state laws assess administrative, civil, and criminal penalties for discharges of unauthorized pollutants into the water and impose substantial liability for the costs of removing spills from such waters. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require that individual permits or coverage under general permits be obtained by covered facilities for discharges of storm water runoff. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with Clean Water Act permitting requirements as well as the conditions imposed by our permits and that continued compliance with such existing permit conditions will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
We operate brine disposal wells that are regulated as Class II wells under the SDWA. The SDWA imposes requirements on owners and operators of Class II wells through the EPA’s Underground Injection Control program, including construction, operating, monitoring and testing, reporting, and closure requirements. Our brine disposal wells are also subject to comparable state laws and regulations, which in some cases are more stringent than requirements under the SDWA, such as the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (“ODNR”) rules that took effect October 1, 2012. These rules set more stringent standards for the permitting and operating of brine disposal wells, including extensive review of geologic data and use of state-of-the-art technology. The ODNR also imposes requirements on the transportation and disposal of brine. Compliance with current and future laws and regulations regarding our brine disposal wells may impose substantial costs and restrictions on our brine disposal operations, as well as adversely affect demand for our brine disposal services. State and federal regulatory agencies recently have focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste waters and an observed increase in minor seismic activity and tremors. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. In a few instances, operators of injection wells in the vicinity of minor seismic events have reduced injection volumes or suspended operations, often voluntarily. A 2012 report published by the National Academy of Sciences concluded that only a very small fraction of the tens of thousands of injection wells have been suspected to be, or have been, the likely cause of induced seismicity. However, some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations to account for induced seismicity. For example, TRRC rules allow the TRRC to modify, suspend, or terminate a permit based on a determination that the permitted activity is likely to be contributing to seismic activity. In the state of Ohio, the ODNR requires a seismic study prior to the authorization of any new disposal well. In addition, the ODNR has instituted a continuous monitoring network of seismographs and is able to curtail injected volumes regionally based upon seismic activity detected. The Oklahoma Corporation Commission (“OCC”) has also taken steps to focus on induced seismicity, including increasing the frequency of required recordkeeping for wells that dispose into certain formations and considering seismic information in permitting decisions. For instance, on August 3, 2015, the OCC adopted a plan calling for mandatory reductions in oil and gas wastewater disposal well volumes, the implementation of which has involved reductions of injection or shut-ins of disposal wells. The OCC also released well completion seismicity guidelines in December 2016 for operators in the STACK play that call for hydraulic fracturing operations to be suspended following earthquakes of certain magnitudes in the vicinity. Regulatory agencies are continuing to study possible linkage between injection activity and induced seismicity. To the extent these studies result in additional regulation of injection wells, such regulations could impose additional regulations, costs, and restrictions on our brine disposal operations. Such regulations could also affect our customers’ injection well operations and, therefore, impact our gathering business.
It is common for our customers or suppliers to recover natural gas from deep shale formations through the use of hydraulic fracturing, combined with sophisticated horizontal drilling. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of wells by oil and gas producers. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand, and chemical additives under pressure into rock formations to stimulate gas production. Due to public concerns raised regarding potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality, legislative, and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some states and localities have been initiated to require or make more stringent the permitting and other regulatory requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations of our customers and suppliers. There are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. On December 13, 2016, the EPA released a study of the potential adverse effects that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health, concluding that there is scientific evidence that hydraulic fracturing activities potentially can impact drinking water resources in the United States under some circumstances. This study or similar studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing. In June 2016, the EPA finalized rules prohibiting discharges of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. Also, effective June 24, 2015, BLM adopted rules regarding well stimulation, chemical disclosures, water management, and other requirements for hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands. A federal district court invalidated these BLM rules in June 2016, but they were reinstated on appeal by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in September 2017. In December 2017, BLM published a final rule rescinding the 2015 BLM rules. The final rule was challenged in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California almost immediately after issuance. On March 27, 2020, the District Court upheld the BLM’s rescission of the 2015 rules. This decision is pending appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Reinstatement of the 2015 BLM rules, or the adoption of additional regulatory burdens in the future, whether federal, state, or local, could increase the cost of or restrict the ability of our customers or suppliers to perform hydraulic fracturing. As a result, any increased federal, state, or local regulation could reduce the volumes of natural 
gas that our customers move through our gathering systems which would materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
Endangered Species and Migratory Birds. The Endangered Species Act (“ESA”), Migratory Bird Treaty Act (“MBTA”), and similar state and local laws restrict activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats or migratory birds. Some of our pipelines may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species, potentially exposing us to liability for impacts on an individual member of a species or to habitat. The ESA can also make it more difficult to secure a federal permit for a new pipeline. 
Office Facilities 
We lease approximately 157,600 square feet of space at our executive offices in Dallas, Texas under a lease expiring in February 2030. We also lease office space of approximately 56,000 square feet in Midland, Texas, and 47,500 square feet in Houston, Texas under long-term leases, and various other locations to support our operations. 
Human Capital 
As of December 31, 2021, we (through our subsidiaries) employed 1,073 full-time employees. Of these employees, 249 were general and administrative, engineering, accounting, and commercial personnel, and the remainder were operational employees. We are not party to any collective bargaining agreements, and we have not had any significant labor disputes in the past. We believe that we have good relations with our employees. 
One of our core values is a “focus on people.” We strive to provide our employees with a rewarding work environment, including the opportunity for success and a platform for personal and professional development. We are committed to providing a working environment that empowers our employees, allows them to execute at their highest potential, keeps them safe, and promotes their professional growth. We offer a competitive total rewards program to our employees. Our total rewards program is comprised of base salary, short-term incentives tied to our performance, comprehensive employee benefits that include medical and dental coverage, company-paid life insurance, disability coverage, and paid parental leave for both birth and non-birth parents. We also offer a 401(k) program, which includes fully-vested employer matched contributions. We believe that our values, rewarding work environment, and competitive pay help us retain our employees and minimize employee turnover in a very challenging personnel market. Our employees have an average tenure of eight years and voluntary turnover rates over the last three years have remained relatively flat, averaging approximately 9% per year.
The safety of our employees is a key management priority. We strive to promote a safety-centric culture, including linking a portion of short-term incentive compensation for our employees to our safety standards and performance. We also maintain strict safety protocols and require quarterly safety training for all field employees and annual safety training for corporate employees. During 2021, EnLink had its best safety year on record. We assess the effectiveness of our safety record by closely monitoring various measures, including our Total Recordable Incident Rate (“TRIR”), which is an industry standard measurement of safety. In 2021, we had a TRIR of 0.44, representing the lowest number of employee reportable incidents in our history. We also require annual safety training by every employee. Additional hours of safety training are required for field personnel. During 2021, our employees completed approximately 8,000 online courses comprising more than 8,500 hours of compliance-based training. In addition, our employees completed over 4,500 hours of required safety training.
We also see value in having a diverse and inclusive environment. We have a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Action Team, which is responsible for helping us to promote and foster a welcoming, open, and diverse workplace, and whose members are drawn from throughout the company. As of December 31, 2021, women represented approximately 39% of the positions at our corporate offices in Dallas and Houston and held approximately 36% of all manager and above positions in those offices. At the same date, minorities represented approximately 26% of the manager and above positions at our corporate offices in Dallas and Houston and held approximately 20% of all manager and above positions company-wide. Additionally, women and minorities constituted 29% of all officers company-wide. We also require annual anti-harassment and discrimination training for all employees, and, in 2021, all people managers completed inclusive leadership training.

Sustainability
We strive for sustainable business practices, including safe, responsible and ethical operations, respect for the environment, a focus on customers, and support for our team of employees. We maximize safe operations of our assets by focusing on mitigating risk, routinely increasing knowledge and skills of our employees, improving our processes, and measuring our performance. We link a portion of short-term incentive compensation for our employees to our safety standards and performance in order to promote a safety-centric culture. We also operate our assets and construct new facilities to minimize our footprint and environmental impact, control pollution, and conserve resources. We focus on serving our customers safely and reliability and providing the highest level of service through innovation and continuous improvement processes in our business. We support our employees by providing competitive pay and benefits, training, and a respectful and inclusive culture.
We have a standing Sustainability Committee (“Sustainability Committee”) of the Board of Directors of the Managing Member (the “Board”), which assists the Board in its general oversight of our environmental, social, and governance initiatives, including our environmental, health and safety, and operational excellence initiatives, and also provides oversight with respect to identifying, evaluating, and monitoring of risks associated with such matters. We have also formed an executive sponsored, cross-functional committee, comprised of leaders from various departments of our company, to put into action our sustainable business practices. In addition, we publish an annual sustainability report, which provides both accountability to us regarding sustainable business practices as well as transparency to our stakeholders regarding our progress toward becoming a more sustainable company. Our most recent sustainability report can be found on our website (www.enlink.com). Information included in our Sustainability Report or otherwise included on our website is not incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Environmental Responsibility
We strive for safe operations that minimize our environmental impact. We demonstrate that objective by complying with applicable environmental laws, focusing on prevention of spills and emissions of unpermitted substances into the atmosphere, reducing our impact on land, waterways, and wildlife habitats, and managing our resource consumption to minimize waste. We have also adopted technologies that support the continuous improvement of our operations to minimize their environmental impact.
We work to operate our assets in a way that maximizes their usefulness, reliability, and safe operations, including through the use of smart tool runs, pressure testing, cathodic protection and robust corrosion management, and routine tests of our assets. We utilize the latest technology to monitor and operate our pipeline systems, such as leak detection monitoring software and vibration monitoring of our compressor stations, which accelerates response time to potential incidents and increases our reliability. We also hold safety trainings for our employees each month and require employees to attend based on their job position.
We attempt to minimize our environmental impact through our operations. Many of our facilities are self-powered, generating energy from the hydrocarbons being processed and reducing the need for public grid connection. We also employ processes that allow us to repurpose exhaust heat, a byproduct of operations, for warming purposes required elsewhere in our process. We utilize solar capabilities to power our methanol pumps, meter stations, and line operating data gathering stations, reducing our need for additional power. We maintain a robust leak detection and repair program and have implemented infrared optical gas image surveys at most of our facilities. To improve emissions performance and operational efficiency, we replaced flares with thermal oxidizers at many of our plants, and we installed vapor recovery units and exhaust catalysts and rerouted compressor blowdown gas back into our system at many of our compressor stations and we continue to make similar changes to our operations, from time to time, to minimize our environmental impact.
We also reuse our resources to limit our waste production. We focus on repurposing and refurnishing idle materials and equipment to be used in new ways at other facilities, including meters, filter separators, compressors, treaters, scrubbers, dehydration systems, amine systems, process vessels, cylinders, valves, pipe, tanks, and pig traps.
We seek to minimize impacts from the construction of our facilities and other operations as well. We first identify site options during the project planning phase to avoid wetlands, habitats, and other environmentally sensitive areas, when possible. Once operational, we partner closely with regulatory agencies to ensure we are compliant with environmental regulations. We also generally restore land to preconstruction conditions, often beyond the footprint that we utilize.
We also seek to minimize the CO2 emissions in our operations. In May 2021, we announced our intention to reach net zero
greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, positioning us among industry leaders in sustainability. We plan to execute substantial
emissions reduction strategies that will systematically move EnLink toward a net zero goal, including achieving a 30%
reduction in methane emissions intensity by 2024 and a path to reach a 30% reduction in total CO2-equivalent emissions
intensity levels by 2030, both as compared to 2020 levels. In November 2021, we entered into an agreement with Continental Carbonic Products, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc., and member of the Nippon Sanso Holdings Corporation group of companies, to capture and sell CO2 emitted from our Bridgeport processing plant in North Texas. The 
31


CO2 will be sold on a firm basis for 15 years and will be converted into food-grade products. This project is expected to be in service in early 2024. The project makes meaningful progress toward our goal of a 30% reduction in total CO2-equivalent emissions intensity by 2030, while being modestly profitable.
Social Responsibility
We provide our employees with a rewarding work environment, providing a platform for personal and professional development. We focus on providing a working environment that empowers, and invests in, our employees. We often participate in community events throughout our area of operations each year, and we encourage our employees to participate in at least one community service project each year.
We provide competitive pay packages that support the financial security of our employees and help attract and retain top talent. For more information on our employee initiatives, see “Item 1. Business—Human Capital” in this report.
Governance
The Board includes directors with extensive energy, finance, sustainability, and public company governance experience. The compensation of our executives is determined and approved by the Board and by the Governance and Compensation Committee (the “Compensation Committee”) of the Board, which Compensation Committee includes independent directors. The determination of executive compensation includes an analysis of the evolving demands of the industry, assessment of individual contributions to the business strategy, and an in-depth comparison of the compensation practices of a defined peer company group. We foster a strong culture of ownership among our executives and align the interests of our leaders with those of our stakeholders by tying a large portion of the short-term and long-term compensation of our executives to the performance of the company.
We require our employees to complete annual training courses related to our corporate policies, including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which outlines our requirements to maintain a work culture based on integrity, ethics, and safe and fair business dealings. We also identify and prioritize the risks associated with our business each quarter through our enterprise risk management program, conducted by leaders throughout our business. We identify top risks to our business and regularly review them with the Board and its committees, including the Sustainability Committee, and through biannual meetings held with the Audit Committee.
