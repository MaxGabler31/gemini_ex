ITEM 1. BUSINESS
GENERAL
 
Where Food Comes From, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“WFCF,” the “Company,” “our,” “we,” or “us”) is a leading trusted resource for third-party verification of food production practices in North America. The Company estimates that is supports more than approximately 17,500 farmers, ranchers, vineyards, wineries, processors, retailers, distributors, trade associations, consumer brands and restaurants with a wide variety of value-added services provided through its family of verifiers, including IMI Global (“IMI”), Where Food Comes From Organic (“WFCFO” - previously International Certification Services and A Bee Organic), Validus Verification Services (“Validus”), and Sterling Solutions. In order to have credibility, product claims such as gluten-free, non-GMO, non-hormone treated, humane handling, and others require verification by an independent third-party such as WFCF. The Company’s principal business is conducting both on-site and desk audits to verify that claims being made about livestock, crops and other food products are accurate.
 
Through SureHarvest Services LLC (“SureHarvest”) and Postelsia Holdings, Ltd. (“Postelsia”), we primarily provide a wide range of professional services and technology solutions that generate incremental revenue specific to the food and agricultural industry and drive sustainable value creation.
 
Finally, the Company’s Where Food Comes From Source Verified® retail and restaurant labeling program utilizes the verification of product attributes to connect consumers directly to the source of the food they purchase through product labeling and web-based information sharing and education. With the use of Quick Response Code (“QR”) technology, consumers can instantly access information about the producers behind their food.
 
WFCF was founded in 1996 and incorporated in the state of Colorado as a subchapter C corporation in 2006. The Company’s shares of common stock trade on the NASDAQ Capital Market (“NASDAQ”), under the stock ticker symbol, “WFCF.”
 
The Company’s original name – Integrated Management Information, Inc. (d.b.a. IMI Global) – was changed to Where Food Comes From, Inc. in 2012 to better reflect the Company’s mission. Early growth was attributable to source and age verification services for beef producers that wanted access to markets overseas following the discovery of “mad cow” disease in the U.S. Over the years, WFCF has expanded its portfolio to include verification and software services for most food groups and over 50 programs and organizations. This growth has been achieved both organically and through the acquisition of other companies.
 
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
 
What We Do
 
The Company is one of the nation’s largest independent, third-party traceability and verification providers.
 We use rigorous verification processes on food production processes to ensure that claims made by food producers and processors are accurate. We care about food and other agricultural products, how it is grown and raised, the quality of what we eat, what farmers and ranchers do, and authentically telling that story to the consumer. Our team visits farms and ranches and looks at their plants, animals, and records, and compares the information we collect to specific standards or claims that farms and ranches want to make about how they are producing food. Our customers include top-tier players in the food and wine space.

The Company also provides a wide range of professional consulting services and technology solutions that generate incremental revenue specific to the food and agricultural industry and drive sustainable value creation.
 
The Company’s business benefits from growing demand by consumers, retailers and government for increased transparency into food production practices.
 
Consumers: Due to concerns about social responsibility and sustainability, food safety, and an overall increase in health consciousness, consumers are demanding more information about the food they purchase.
 
Retailers: Responding to consumer demands for increased transparency as well as to the negative impact food scandals have on their bottom lines, retailers are requiring their suppliers to adhere to more stringent traceability and verification of product claims.
 
Government Regulation: Regulations including the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal Disease Traceability program, international export requirements, non-GMO and gluten-free testing requirements, and ingredient labeling regulations are all impacting product verification.
 
Growth Strategy
 
Due to organic growth in our portfolio of auditing standards, consumer demand and acquisitions, our sales have grown rapidly from $1.1 million in 2006 to $21.9 million in 2021, a 15-year compounded annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of approximately 22%.
 
Our growth strategy is as follows:
 

● | To cover more food groups than any other verification provider. Currently we verify beef, lamb, pork, poultry, dairy, eggs, fresh produce, nuts and grains, shrimp and finished products. In the future, we hope to include beverages, other seafood and other produce. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | To offer solutions for all participants in the food supply chain, including feed and input ingredient providers, farmers, producers, packers, auction barns, processors, handlers, distributors, restaurants, retailers and consumers. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | To expand on the industry’s largest solutions portfolio. We currently are verifying or certifying to more than 50 certification standards or guidelines. To our knowledge, that is the most in the industry. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | To continue organic growth. We leverage our bundling capability to aggressively pursue new customers, while sustaining our recurring revenue model and high retention rates. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | To continue growth through merger and acquisition opportunities. Through selective acquisitions, we can expand our footprint, add new services, food groups and revenue streams. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Acquisition of Postelsia Holdings, Ltd.
 
On February 21, 2020 we acquired all of the stock of privately held Postelsia Holdings, Ltd. (“Postelsia”) for $0.3 million in cash. We believe the transaction expands our services into a new market food group, seafood. Postelsia, based in Victoria, British Columbia, is a leader in the emerging field of environmental and social sustainability programs for the seafood industry. Postelsia provides a range of programs and consulting services designed to improve and promote sustainable practices, including environmental conservation, worker care, and food safety compliance.

INDUSTRY BACKGROUND 
 
The value-added food industry has been growing rapidly for the past several years in response to increased consumer interest about social responsibility, sustainability and food safety production practices. We continue to see a growing interest from consumers regarding how their food is produced. We are in an increasingly global food market with food products traveling around the world, and brands differentiating themselves in the market. These key drivers are increasing the number of food labeling claims made on food products.
 
Natural and/or organic are examples of food labels that indicate that the food or other agricultural product has been produced in a certain way. Natural and organic sales are only part of the story of how consumers look for the verification of practices tied to food labeling claims. Other factors are also becoming increasingly more important to consumers, evidenced on menus and product labels. While not an exhaustive list, some of the issues that farms, ranches, producers, processors, restaurants and retailers are addressing include how animals are cared for and handled, how a product’s production impacts the environment and societies, and what inputs were used in the production of food items (like antibiotics).
 
As consumers want more assurance about the trustworthiness of labeling claims, there is a growing trend for verification of practices around sustainability. As the agriculture, livestock and food industries continue to mature and expand internationally, there is an increasing need to record, manage, report and verify information regarding the source, age, genetic background, animal husbandry, environmental stewardship, practices surrounding the people and community, and other credence attributes. We believe verification of labeling claims by an independent third-party can meet consumer demands and expectations. Third-party verification also benefits producers, processors, distributors, restaurants, and retailers by addressing marketplace differentiation and global competitiveness.
 
Current Marketplace Opportunities 
 
Because of growing demand for increased transparency into food production practices, we believe there are three main market drivers to promote forward momentum for our business:
 
Market Driver #1 - Consumer awareness and expectations
 

● | Per the Global Organic Food Market Report 2021, the global organic food market is expected to grow from $201.8 billion in 2020 to $221.4 billion in 2021 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.7%. The growth is mainly due to the companies resuming their operations and adapting to the new normal while recovering from the COVID-19 impact, which had earlier led to restrictive containment measures involving social distancing, remote working, and the closure of commercial activities that resulted in operational challenges. The organic food market is expected to reach $380.8 billion in 2025 at a CAGR of 14.5%. Growing awareness regarding health benefits of organic food consumption, rising per capita spending on organic food products and increasing health concerns due to the growing number of chemical poisoning cases are expected to drive global organic food market in the coming years. Moreover, easy accessibility and product labeling are also expected to drive the global organic food market over the next five years. In addition, continuing product innovations and aggressive marketing strategies adopted by major players and online retailers would positively influence the global organic food market during the forecast period. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Per Priya Khan, Founder and CEO of Nutrigold, “concerned consumers often wonder if the claims on product labels are actually true. They want to buy healthy, environmentally-friendly products and often pay a premium to do so. It is difficult to know what companies you can trust, and hard to tell what you are really getting when you buy. Something an increasing number of companies do to add transparency is use third-party verification, so consumers can buy with confidence.” 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Alex Beckett, Associate Director, Mintel Food & Drink Trends 2021, recently stated “When it comes to value, pandemic-shocked consumers are seeking a return to what is essential… In the next few years, brands will also be challenged to respond to new definitions of quality and ensure ecommerce is accessible to shoppers of all socioeconomic levels. The focus on getting the best value for one’s money will motivate brands to be more transparent about product price by providing details about the ingredients, processes, and people that are reflected in a product’s price.”

Market Driver #2 - Global competitiveness and risk mitigation among producers, restaurants, and retailers
 

● | At the December 2019 Organic Grower Summit, Nikki Rodoni, CEO and founder of Measure to Improve, stated “More and more growers are being asked by food companies to communicate everything from fertilizer efficiency to water efficiency to energy efficiency, as well as social responsibility. All of this is an effort by food companies to mitigate their risk in the supply chain and to also credibly market that their products are sustainably sourced. All of this being driven by customers making a shift to more sustainable products. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Per “Managing Business Risk in the Food and Beverage Industry,” prepared by Cambashi, Inc., “To compete, midsize companies across the industry have stepped up research and development (R&D) to improve on and leverage existing brands and product lines for new applications, markets, and regions. The way people eat and what they eat around the globe continually changes, and this is driving co-ops and processors to research and develop new types of packaging, a wider variety of flavors, partially prepared options, and facilities dedicated to organic, allergy-free, or kosher foods. To support these shifts, companies are building or expanding facilities with state-of-the-art technologies and systems for development, testing, processing, and packaging.” We can assist companies by providing third party verification and other technology solutions to help companies compete on brand innovation. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Producers, restaurant chains and retailers with dominant market shares and large buying power, like Dannon, Tyson, McDonald’s, Chick-Fil-A, Costco, and Wal-Mart, are leading the way in prioritizing sustainable food supply initiatives in response to consumer demands. With information literally at our fingertips, Google searches and smart phone apps are making it easier to expose where sustainable food supply chains are, and where they are not. We believe our technology will play a key role in capturing data to improve processes, yields and communicate our customer’s values, practices and other initiatives to consumers. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Producers, packers, distributors and retailers understand that verification, identification and traceability are key competitive differentiators. Oftentimes, it is necessary for export into international markets, including Korea, Russia, China and the European Union. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Market Driver #3 - Government regulation
 

● | On July 15, 2019 the European Council approved an agreement to establish a duty-free tariff rate quote (TRQ) exclusively for the United States. Under the agreement, American ranchers will have an initial TRQ of 18,500 metric tons annually, valued at approximately $220 million. Over seven years, the TRQ will grow to 35,000 metric tons valued at approximately $420 million. American ranchers will be guaranteed a bigger share of Europe’s beef market, with annual duty-free exports expected to grow from $150 million (or 13,000 metric tons) currently to $420 million (or 35,000 metric tons) when the agreement is fully implemented. We believe the EU quota will continue to fuel demand for non-hormone treated cattle (“NHTC”). 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Effective February 19, 2019, the USDA released a rule establishing the new national mandatory bioengineered (BE) food disclosure standard (NBFDS or Standard). The new Standard requires food manufacturers, importers, and other entities that label foods for retail sale to disclose information about BE food and BE food ingredients. As of January 1, 2022, all food manufacturers must comply with the new Standard. Our work as a Technical Administrator for the Non-GMO Project enables brands to have confidence that their products will align with the new Standard. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Animal Disease Traceability Rule promulgated by the USDA primarily covers beef cattle 18 months of age or older. Under the final rule, unless specifically exempted, livestock moved interstate must be officially identified and accompanied by an interstate certificate of veterinary inspection or other documentation, such as owner-shipper statements or brand certificates. Although animal disease traceability does not prevent disease, an efficient and accurate traceability system reduces the number of animals and response time involved in a disease investigation.

REVENUES 
 
We offer a wide array of services, including verification, certification, consulting and software as a service (“SaaS”), to help food producers, brands and consumers differentiate certain attributes and production methods in the marketplace. We sell our services directly to customers at various levels in the agriculture, food and livestock supply chain. Most of our service offerings can be bundled to provide a “one-stop shop” for customers that have multiple levels of verification and certification needs, such as source verification and food safety certification. Our customers include some of the largest U.S. beef and pork packers, organic producers and processors, and specialty retail chains. No single customer generated more than 10% of the Company’s consolidated revenue in 2021 or 2020.
 
With each acquisition, we assess the need to disclose discrete information related to our operating segments. Because of the similarities of certain of our acquisitions that provide certification and verification services, we aggregate operations into one verification and certification reportable segment. The operating segments included in the aggregated verification and certification segment include IMI Global, WFCFO and Validus. The factors considered in determining this aggregated reporting segment include the economic similarity of the businesses, the nature of services provided, production processes, types of customers and distribution methods.
 
The Company also determined that it has a software and related consulting reportable segment. SureHarvest, which includes Postelsia, is the sole operating unit under the software and related consulting reportable segment. This segment includes a wide range of professional consulting services and technology solutions that generate incremental revenue specific to the food and agricultural industry and drive sustainable value creation.
 
The Company’s chief operating decision maker (the Company’s CEO) allocates resources and assesses the performance of its operating segments. Segment management makes decisions, measures performance, and manages the business utilizing internal operating segment information. Performance of operating segments are based on net sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses and most importantly, operating income.
 
Verification and Certification Segment
 
Our verification and certification service revenues consist of fees charged for verification audits and other verification and certification related services that the Company performs for customers. We include fees earned from our WFCF labeling program and consulting/program development services in our verification and certification revenues due to the immateriality of the revenue stream and because it represents a value-added extension of our source verification. We are recognized and utilized by numerous standard-setting bodies as an accredited verification or certification service provider. We enable food producers and brands to make certain claims on live animals or packaged food products by verifying that they are meeting the standards or guidelines associated with the claim(s) they are making. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, our third-party verification programs provided 73.2% and 71.0% of our total revenue, respectively.
 
Our product sales are an ancillary part of our verification and certification services and represent sales of cattle identification ear tags. While our product sales have lower profit margins than do our proprietary offerings, the products allow us to offer our customers a comprehensive solution. Approximately 17.5% and 19.2% of our total revenue was generated by the sale of product during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

We purchase most of our electronic identification (“EID”) tags from one significant supplier and source the remainder of our EID tags from alternate smaller suppliers. We have been informed by our key tag supplier that materials are becoming scarcer and their ability to meet our need is becoming more difficult. In anticipation of this risk, we have worked with all our tag suppliers to build our inventory by purchasing excess supply. Should material shortages continue to impact our tag suppliers, we may be unable to meet the needs of our customers which could have an impact on our costs and margins. Due to the overall uncertainty in our EID tag supply, we are uncertain of the material impact that it may have on our business.
 
Software and Related Consulting Segment
 
Software and related consulting includes a wide range of professional consulting services and technology solutions that support our verification business and generate incremental revenue specific to the food and agricultural industry.
MARKETING
 
Our marketing strategy includes direct marketing, advertising, event sponsorship, and trade show participation. From a public relations perspective, members of our staff are frequently quoted in industry trade journals and requested as speakers at various industry events as subject matter experts on the topics of animal identification, traceability, branding, third-party verification and certification, and the USDA verification programs.
 
In order to reach additional customers, we continually develop strategic marketing partnerships with leading companies in the industry with complementary abilities and products. We do not currently rely on any third-party contracts with distributors, licensors or manufacturers in conducting our business.
 
We also use social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter to help promote our business, market our product offerings, and connect consumers with current topics in the agriculture, livestock and food industries.
 
COMPETITION 
 
The competition for third-party verification services in the food and agriculture industry is growing more intense, especially within the organic market. As of December 31, 2021, we estimate that there are approximately eight key competitors serving the food and agricultural industry, including Quality Assurance International, California Certified Organic Farmers, Oregon Tilth, Organic Crop Improvement Association, Earth Claims, FoodChain ID, NSF International, SGS and SCS Global Services. Differentiation hinges upon understanding all facets of food verification and the complex compliance challenges to make product verifications efficient, cost-effective, and seamless. Our core business and expertise focus on the “on farm” verifications to a variety of standards, guidelines and criteria, including source verification, natural, animal care and well-being, and sustainability verification.
SEASONALITY
 
Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Significant portions of our verification and certification service revenue is typically realized during late May through early October when the calf marketings and the growing seasons are at their peak. Because of the seasonality of the business and our industry, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any other quarter or for the full fiscal year.
