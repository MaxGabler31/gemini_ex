Item 1. Description of Business.
Overview and Corporate History



TD Holdings, Inc. (formerly known as Bat Group, Inc.), has become a business engaging in commodity trading business (the “Commodities Trading Business”) and supply chain service business (the “Supply Chain Service Business”) in China since the disposition of its direct loans, loan guarantees and financial leasing services to small-to-medium sized businesses, farmers and individuals in July 2018 and its used luxurious car leasing business in August 2020.



The Commodities Trading Business primarily involves purchasing non-ferrous metal products from upstream metal and mineral suppliers and then selling to downstream customers. The Supply Chain Service Business primarily has served as a one-stop commodity supply chain service and digital intelligence supply chain platform integrating upstream and downstream enterprises, warehouses, logistics, information, and futures trading.



Our Current Business



Commodities Trading Business



The Commodity Trading Business primarily involves purchasing non-ferrous metal products, such as aluminum ingots, copper, silver, and gold, from upstream metal and mineral suppliers and then selling to downstream customers. In connection with the Company’s commodity sales, in order to help customers to obtain sufficient funds to purchase various metal products and also help upstream metal and mineral suppliers to sell their metal products, the Company launched its Supply Chain Service Business in December 2019. The Company primarily generates revenues from bulk non-ferrous commodity products, and from providing related supply chain management services in the PRC.



In order to diversify the Company’s business, the Company has operated the Commodities Trading Business through Shenzhen Huamucheng Trading Co., Ltd. (“Huamucheng”) since November 2019, which was renamed Shenzhen Baiyu Jucheng Data Technology Co., Ltd. (“Shenzhen Baiyu Jucheng”) in 2021. On November 22, 2019, Hao Limo Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd. (“Hao Limo”), our indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a series of agreements with Shenzhen Baiyu Jucheng and the shareholders of Shenzhen Baiyu Jucheng pursuant to which we obtained control of Shenzhen Baiyu Jucheng (the “VIE Agreement”). On June 25, 2020, Hao Limo and Shenzhen Baiyu Jucheng entered into certain VIE termination agreement to terminate the Shenzhen Baiyu Jucheng VIE Agreement. As such, Hao Limo no longer has the control rights and rights to the assets, property and revenue of Shenzhen Baiyu Jucheng. At the same time, Shanghai Jianchi Supply Chain Co., Ltd. (“Shanghai Jianchi”), our wholly-owned subsidiary incorporated in China, acquired 100% equity interest of Shenzhen Baiyu Jucheng from the shareholders of Shenzhen Baiyu Jucheng (the “Shenzhen Baiyu Jucheng Shareholders”) for nominal consideration.


Through Shenzhen Baiyu Jucheng’s business, we source bulk commodity products from non-ferrous metal and mines or its designated distributors and then sell to manufacturers who need these metals in large quantity. We also work with upstream suppliers in the sourcing of commodities.



Through Shenzhen Qianhai Baiyu Supply Chain Co., Ltd. (“Qianhai Baiyu”), our wholly-owned subsidiary incorporated in China, we provide supply chain management services to our customers. On October 26, 2020, Shenzhen Baiyu Jucheng entered into certain share purchase agreements to acquire 100% shares of Qianhai Baiyu. Qianhai Baiyu is engaged in the supply chain service business and covers a full range of commodities, including non-ferrous metals, ferrous metals, coal, metallurgical raw materials, soybean oils, oils, rubber, wood and various other types of commodities. It also has a supply chain infrastructure, which includes processing, logistics, warehousing and terminals. Utilizing its customer base, industry experience, and expertise in the commodity trading industry, Qianhai Baiyu serves as a one-stop commodity supply chain service and digital intelligence supply chain platform integrating upstream and downstream enterprises, warehouses, logistics, information, and futures trading.



The acquisition of Qianhai Baiyu has laid a solid foundation for the Company to further expand its operations in the commodity supply chain field. The Company plans to strengthen and upgrade its supply chain services platform by introducing a systematic quantitative risk control system, which will be based on the Qianhai Baiyu’s massive historical market data and complex data analysis models. The platform is expected to establish a quantitative risk management system utilizing ETL data integration (Extract, Transform, Load) as its core, and then optimize trading portfolios by incorporating a combination of various factors and strategies in order to effectively control risks and sustain business development.



For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, the Company generated revenue of $197,954,015 from its commodities trading business and $3,180,227 from its supply chain management services.

Our Business



As of December 31, 2021, the Company has two business lines, the commodities trading business and Supply Chain Management Services set forth below. 


Commodities Trading Business



Industry Overview



Bulk commodities trading refers to the trading of materials used in industrial and agricultural production that are continuously purchased in bulk, and are unable to be purchased from the retail sector. Commodities belong at the upstream stage of production processes of various industrial chains, and the supply and demand conditions of commodities can cause price fluctuations and affect the development of these industrial chains.



Commodities can be divided into four categories, metals, energy, livestock and meat, and agricultural. Metal commodities include gold, silver, platinum, and copper. Energy commodities include crude oil, heating oil, natural gas, and gasoline. Livestock and meat include lean hogs, pork bellies, live cattle, and feeder cattle. Agricultural commodities include corn, soybeans, wheat rice, cocoa, coffee, cotton, and sugar.



In recent years, although the growth rate of China’s total commodity sales has slowed down, the aggregate sales are still impressive and exceed RMB100 billion. Prior to 2013, the growth rate of commodity trading was the highest at nearly 12% per year. From 2014 to 2016, as the nationwide economic operations stabilized, the growth rate slowed down to approximately 8%, and slowed down further to 5.3% and 4.6% in 2017 and 2018, respectively. However, at the same time, China’s commodity market turnover has increased from RMB25.89 trillion in 2009 to RMB60.28 trillion in 2018. China’s commodity market is still a multi-trillion dollars industry based on calculation of the size of its market turnover.

Operation of Commodity Trading Business



The Company’s commodities trading operations via Shenzhen Baiyu Jucheng is focused on non-ferrous metal commodities such as aluminum, copper, silver, and gold. We strive to become an emerging platform in the non-ferrous metal e-commerce industry by offering all participants in the non-ferrous metal e-commerce industry a seamless, one-stop transaction experience.
Business Model



We source bulk commodities from non-ferrous metal mines or its designated distributors and sell them to manufactures who need these metals in large quantities. We work with many suppliers in the sourcing of commodities, including various metal and mineral suppliers such as Kunsteel Group, Baosteel Group, Aluminum Corporate of China Limited, Yunnan Benyuan, Yunnan Tin, and Shanghai Copper. Potential customers include large infrastructure companies such as China National Electricity, Datang Power, China Aluminum Foshan International Trade, Tooke Investment (China), CSSC International Trade Co., Ltd., Shenye Group, and Keliyuan.
The Company has entered into a Warehousing Agreement with Foshan Nanchu Storage Management Co., Ltd. (“Foshan Nanchu”) to designate it as the Company’s warehouse. The Company’s criteria for choosing its warehouse are based primarily on the convenience of its location for transportation, which is highly conducive to the transportation of non-ferrous metal commodities, and secondarily based on its storage price.



Our inventory management procedure involves (1) an Application for Storage, (2) Storage of the Commodities, (3) an Application for Shipment, and (4) Shipment of Commodities, which are further described below.




1) | Application for Storage 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The upstream suppliers apply for storage with the Company’s leased warehouse center upon the sale of commodities to the Company. The application requires information including the commodities’ production company, brand, specifications, weight, quantity, and storage time. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Storage of the Commodities 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Upon acceptance, the warehouse scans and places the commodities into sorted storage. The warehouse then issues a certificate of inspection, which includes information such as the brand name, specifications, weight, quantity, packaging information, arrival time, storage location and other information of the received commodities.

Four copies of the certificate of inspection are made, two of which are provided to the transportation company and the supplier.

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We use a prepaid unified purchase and distribution model (“Prepaid Model”) in our business, which is further detailed below.



Under the Prepaid Model, we make advance prepayments between 1 – 3 months in advance when purchasing from the Company’s upstream suppliers. The process involves first obtaining purchase orders from one or more downstream purchasers and entering into sales agreements with such purchasers. After the Company receives the down payment from the downstream purchasers, it aggregates the total amount of commodities required to fulfill the orders and enters into purchase agreements with upstream suppliers to fulfill its purchase orders. Once the upstream suppliers have received the prepayment from the Company, they produce and deliver the commodities to the Company’s designated warehouse on the purchase agreement. Upon receipt of the commodities in the designated warehouse, the Company is notified by the warehouse and obtains the full payment from the downstream purchasers. After the Company pays its remaining balance to the upstream suppliers, it issues delivery instructions to the designated warehouse on the sales agreement and has the commodities delivered to the downstream purchasers.



Through the Prepaid Model, which is further illustrated below, the Company maintains a stable distribution volume and thereby generates profit margins via purchase discounts from upstream suppliers and mark-up pricing to downstream customers.

The Company competes against other large domestic commodity trade service providers such as Xiamen International Trade and Yijian Shares.

According to the PRC Company Law amended and took effect on October 26, 2018 and the Administration Regulations of Company Registration amended and took effect on February 26, 2016, a company may establish branch companies, which are entities without the status of a legal person and conduct business outside the domicile of the company.

Our PRC subsidiaries have registered one branch in Shanghai and have obtained a business license for it as of the date of this report.




Regulations on Employment Contracts



The Labor Contract Law of the PRC was promulgated on June 29, 2007, as amended on December 28, 2012 and effective on July 1, 2013. On September 18, 2008, the PRC State Council issued the PRC Labor Contract Law Implementing Rules, which became effective as of the date of issuance. The Labor Contract Law and its Implementing Rules govern the establishment of employment relationships between employers and employees, and the conclusion, performance, termination of, and the amendment to employment contracts. To establish an employment relationship, a written employment contract must be signed. In the event that no written employment contract was signed at the time of establishment of an employment relationship, a written employment contract must be signed within one month after the date on which the employer starts to use the employee’s services. An employer may terminate the labor agreement of an employee under certain specified circumstances and in some cases, such termination can only be done after fulfillment of certain procedural requirements, such as 30 days’ prior notice or upon payment of one month’s salary in lieu of such notice. In certain cases, the terminated employee is entitled to receive a severance payment equal to the average monthly salary during the 12-month period immediately preceding to the termination (inclusive of all monetary income such as base salary, bonus, allowances, etc.), for each year of service up to the date of termination. If an employer terminates a labor contract in any circumstance other than those specified under the Labor Contract Law and its implementing rules, including termination without cause, the employer must either reinstate and continue to perform the employee’s employment contract or pay the employee damages calculated at twice the rate for calculating the severance payment, subject to the employee’s own request. In the case that the employee requests for damages, the employer is not required to pay other severance or the remainder of the amount owed under the employment contract unless the employment contract has otherwise provided for.





11







In addition, according to the Labor Contract Law and its implementing rules, in order to enforce the non-compete provision with the employees after the termination or ending of employment relationship, the employer shall compensate the employees on a monthly basis during the non-competition period after such termination or ending of employment.



On January 24, 2014 the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security promulgated Interim Provisions on Labor Dispatching, or Circular 22, effective from March 1, 2014, which provides that an employer shall strictly control the number of employees under labor dispatching arrangements and dispatched employees can only be used in temporary, ancillary and replaceable positions. The number of dispatched workers used by an employer shall be reduced to no more than 10% of the total number of its employees within two years after March 1, 2014. If the employer fails to reduce the number of dispatched employees as required by Circular 22 and could not correct its practice after receiving warnings from government authority, the employer may be subject to a fine ranging from RMB1,000 to RMB5,000 per dispatched employee.



Regulation on PRC Business Tax and VAT



Prior to January 1, 2012, pursuant to the Provisional Regulation of China on Business Tax and its Implementing Rules, an entity or individual rendering services in China were generally subject to a business tax at the rate of 5% on revenues generated from the provision of such services. Since January 1, 2012, the MOF and the SAT have started to implement the VAT Pilot Program, which imposes VAT in lieu of business tax for certain industries in Shanghai. Since August 1, 2012, the VAT Pilot Program has been expanded to and implemented in other regions, including Beijing, Tianjin, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Hubei, Guangdong. On May 24, 2013, the MOF and the SAT jointly issued Notice 37, which expanded the VAT Pilot Program nationwide starting on August 1, 2013. On December 12, 2013, the MOF and the SAT jointly issued Notice 106, effective on January 1, 2014, which replaced Notice 37 and improved some tax policies in the VAT Pilot Program. From May 1, 2016, the VAT was expanded to all business tax taxpayers and until November 19, 2017, the State Council promulgated Decision of the State Council on Abolishing the Provisional Regulations on Business Tax of the People’s Republic of China and Amending the Provisional Regulations on Value-Added Tax of the People’s Republic of China. As a result of the VAT, an entity or individual rendering services in China is subject to VAT at the rate of 17%, 11% or 6%, as applicable. According to the Notice of the Ministry of Finance and the SAT on Adjusting Value added Tax Rates, issued on April 4, 2018, and became effective on May 1, 2018, the value-add tax rates of 17%, 11% or 6% applicable to the taxpayers who render services are adjusted to 16%, 10% or 6% respectively. According to the Notice of the Ministry of Finance, the SAT and the General Administration of Customs on Relevant Policies for Deepening Value Added Tax Reform, issued on March 20, 2019, and became effective on April 1, 2019, such value added tax rate was reduced to 13%, 9% or 6%, respectively.


Regulations on PRC Enterprise Income Tax



The PRC enterprise income tax is calculated based on the taxable income determined under the PRC laws and accounting standards. On March 16, 2007, the National People’s Congress of China enacted a new Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC, which became effective on January 1, 2008 and amended the Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC on December 29, 2018. On December 6, 2007, the State Council promulgated the Implementation Rules to the Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC, or the Implementation Rules, which also became effective on January 1, 2008 and amended the Implementation Rules to the Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC on April 23, 2019. On December 26, 2007, the State Council issued the Notice on Implementation of Enterprise Income Tax Transition Preferential Policy under the Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC, or the Transition Preferential Policy Circular, which became effective simultaneously with the Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC. On October 17, 2017, the State Administration of Taxation promulgated the Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Issues Relating to Withholding at Source of Income Tax of Non-resident Enterprises, which became effective on December 1, 2017 and amended Withholding at Source of Income Tax of Non-resident Enterprises on June 15, 2018. The Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC imposes a uniform enterprise income tax rate of 25% on all domestic enterprises, including foreign-invested enterprises unless they qualify for certain exceptions, and terminates most of the tax exemptions, reductions and preferential treatments available under previous tax laws and regulations.





12







Moreover, under the Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC, enterprises organized under the laws of jurisdictions outside China with their “de facto management bodies” located within China may be considered PRC resident enterprises and therefore subject to PRC enterprise income tax at the rate of 25% on their worldwide income. The Implementation Rules define the term “de facto management body” as the management body that exercises full and substantial control and overall management over the business, productions, personnel, accounts and properties of an enterprise. In addition, the Circular Related to Relevant Issues on the Identification of a Chinese holding Company Incorporated Overseas as a Residential Enterprise under the Criterion of De Facto Management Bodies Recognizing issued by the State Administration of Taxation on April 22, 2009 provides that a foreign enterprise controlled by a PRC company or a PRC company group will be classified as a “resident enterprise” with its “de facto management bodies” located within China if the following requirements are satisfied: (i) the senior management and core management departments in charge of its daily operations function mainly in China; (ii) its financial and human resources decisions are subject to determination or approval by persons or bodies in China; (iii) its major assets, accounting books, company seals and minutes and files of its board and shareholders’ meetings are located or kept in China; and (iv) more than half of the enterprise’s directors or senior management with voting rights reside in China. Although the circular only applies to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises and not those controlled by PRC individuals or foreigners, the determining criteria set forth in the circular may reflect the State Administration of Taxation’s general position on how the “de facto management body” test should be applied in determining the tax resident status of offshore enterprises, regardless of whether they are controlled by PRC enterprises, individuals or foreigners.




Regulations on Foreign Currency Exchange and Dividend Distribution




Foreign Currency Exchange



The principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in China are the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations, which was most recently amended in August 2008. Under the PRC Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations, Renminbi is freely convertible for payments of current account items, such as distribution of dividends, interest payments and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from SAFE. In contrast, approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required where Renminbi is to convert into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital account items, such as direct investments, repayment of foreign currency-denominated loans, repatriation of investments and investments in securities outside of China.



In November 2012, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Improving and Adjusting Foreign Exchange Administration Policies on Foreign Direct Investment, or Circular on Improving and Adjusting Foreign Exchange Policies, which was latest amended on December 30, 2019. Circular on Improving and Adjusting Foreign Exchange Policies substantially amends and simplifies the foreign exchange procedure. Pursuant to Circular on Improving and Adjusting Foreign Exchange Policies, the opening of various foreign exchange accounts for designated purposes, such as pre-establishment expenses accounts, foreign exchange capital accounts and guarantee accounts, the reinvestment of Renminbi proceeds derived by foreign investors in the PRC, and remittance of foreign exchange profits and dividends by foreign-invested enterprises to their foreign shareholders, no longer require approval or verification from SAFE, and the same entity may open multiple capital accounts in different provinces.



On May 10, 2013, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Printing and Distributing the Provisions on Foreign Exchange Administration Over Domestic Direct Investment by Foreign Investors and the Supporting Documents, which specifies that the administration by SAFE or its local branches over foreign direct investment in the PRC shall be conducted by way of registration. Institutions and individuals shall register with SAFE and/or its branches for their direct investment in China. Banks shall process foreign exchange business relating to the direct investment in China based on the registration information provided by SAFE and its branches.



In February 2015, SAFE promulgated the Circular of Further Simplifying and Improving the Policies of Foreign Exchange Administration Applicable to Direct Investment, or Circular 13, which became effective on June 1, 2015 and was amended on December 30, 2019. Upon the implementation of Circular 13, the current foreign exchange procedures will be further simplified, foreign exchange registrations of direct investment will be handled by designated foreign exchange settlement banks instead of SAFE and its branches.





13







On March 30, 2015, SAFE issued the Circular on Reform of the Administrative Rules of the Payment and Settlement of Foreign Exchange Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises (“SAFE Circular 19”), which became effective on June 1, 2015 and was amended on December 30, 2019. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 19, foreign-invested enterprises may either continue to follow the current payment-based foreign currency settlement system or elect to follow the “conversion-at-will” regime of foreign currency settlement. Where a foreign-invested enterprise follows the conversion-at-will regime of foreign currency settlement, it may convert part or all of the amount of the foreign currency in its capital account into Renminbi at any time. The converted Renminbi will be kept in a designated account labeled as settled but pending payment, and if the foreign-invested enterprise needs to make payment from such designated account, it still needs to go through the review process with its bank and provide necessary supporting documents. SAFE Circular 19, therefore, has substantially lifted the restrictions on the usage by a foreign-invested enterprise of its RMB registered capital converted from foreign currencies. According to SAFE Circular 19, such Renminbi capital may be used at the discretion of the foreign-invested enterprise and SAFE will eliminate the prior approval requirement and only examine the authenticity of the declared usage afterwards. Nevertheless, foreign-invested enterprises are still not allowed to extend intercompany loans to PRC consolidated entities. In addition, as Circular 19 was promulgated recently, there remain substantial uncertainties with respect to the interpretation and implementation of this circular by relevant authorities.



On June 9, 2016, SAFE issued the Circular on Reforming and Regulating Policies on the Control over Foreign Exchange Settlement of Capital Accounts (“Circular 16”), which became effective simultaneously. Pursuant to Circular 16, enterprises registered in the PRC may also convert their foreign debts from foreign currency to RMB on self-discretionary basis. Circular 16 provides an integrated standard for conversion of foreign exchange under capital account items (including but not limited to foreign currency capital and foreign debts) on self-discretionary basis which applies to all enterprises registered in the PRC. Circular 16 reiterates the principle that RMB converted from foreign currency-denominated capital of a company may not be directly or indirectly used for purpose beyond its business scope or prohibited by PRC Laws or regulations, while such converted RMB shall not be provide as loans to its non-affiliated entities.



On January 26, 2017, SAFE issued the Notice of State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Improving the Check of Authenticity and Compliance to further Promote Foreign Exchange Control, or SAFE Circular 3, which stipulates several capital control measures with respect to the outbound remittance of profit from domestic entities to offshore entities, including (i) under the principle of genuine transaction, banks must check board resolutions regarding profit distribution, the original version of tax filing records and audited financial statements; and (ii) domestic entities must hold income to account for previous years’ losses before remitting the profits. Moreover, pursuant to SAFE Circular 3, domestic entities shall make detailed explanations of the sources of capital and utilization arrangements, and provide board resolutions, contracts and other proof when completing the registration procedures in connection with an outbound investment.

Under these laws and regulations, wholly foreign-owned companies in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, these wholly foreign-owned companies are required to set aside no less than 10% of the after-tax profits, if any, to fund certain reserve funds, until the accumulative amount of such fund reaches 50% of its registered capital. Although the statutory reserves can be used, among other ways, to increase the registered capital and eliminate future losses in excess of retained earnings of the respective companies, the reserve funds are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation. At the discretion of these wholly foreign-owned companies, they may allocate a portion of their after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards to staff welfare and bonus funds. These reserve funds and staff welfare and bonus funds are not distributable as cash dividends.




Regulations on Employee Share Incentive Plans of Overseas Publicly-listed Company



In February 2012, SAFE promulgated the Notice on Issues Concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participation in Share Incentive Plan of Companies Listed Overseas, or the 2012 SAFE Notice. Under such notice and other relevant rules and regulations, PRC residents, including PRC citizens or non-PRC citizens who reside in China for a continuous period of not less than one year, that participate in any share incentive plan of any overseas publicly-listed company are required to register with SAFE or its local branches and complete certain other procedures. Participants of a share incentive plan who are PRC residents must retain a qualified PRC agent, which could be a PRC subsidiary of the overseas publicly listed company or another qualified institution selected by the PRC subsidiary, to conduct the SAFE registration and other procedures with respect to the share incentive plan on behalf of the participants. We and our executive officers and other employees who are PRC residents that have been granted share incentive awards will be subject to these regulations upon the completion of this offering. Failure by these individuals to complete their SAFE registrations may subject such individuals and us to fines and other legal sanctions.



The SAT has issued certain circulars concerning employee share incentive awards. Under these circulars, our employees working in China who exercise share incentive awards will be subject to PRC individual income tax. Our PRC subsidiary has the obligation to make filings related to employee share incentive awards with relevant tax authorities and to withhold individual income taxes of those employees who exercise their share incentive awards. If our employees fail to pay or we fail to withhold their income taxes according to relevant laws and regulations, we may face sanctions imposed by the tax authorities or other PRC governmental authorities.




Regulations on Offshore Investment by PRC Residents



Pursuant to the SAFE’s Notice on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration for PRC Residents to Engage in Financing and Round Trip Investment via Overseas Special Purpose Companies and its subsequent amendments, supplements or implementation rules, or SAFE Circular 75, issued on October 21, 2005, a PRC resident (whether a natural person or legal persons) shall register with the local branch of the SAFE before it establishes or controls an overseas SPV, with assets or equity interests in a PRC company, for the purpose of overseas equity financing. On July 4, 2014, SAFE issued the SAFE’s Notice on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration for PRC Residents to Engage in Outbound Investment and Financing and Inbound Investment via Special Purpose Vehicles (“SPV”), or SAFE Circular 37, which has superseded SAFE Circular 75. According to SAFE Circular 37, the PRC domestic resident shall apply for SAFE registration for overseas investment before paying capital to SPV by using his, her or its legal assets whether overseas or domestic. The SPV is defined as “offshore enterprise directly established or indirectly controlled by the domestic residents (including domestic institutions and individuals) with their legally owned assets and equity of the domestic enterprise, or legally owned offshore assets or equity, for the purpose of offshore investment and financing”. In addition, in the event that the SPV undergoes changes of its basic information such as the individual shareholder, name, operation term, etc., or material events including increase or decrease by domestic individual shareholder in investment amount, equity transfer or swap, merge, spinoff, etc., the domestic resident shall timely complete the change of foreign exchange registration formality for offshore investment.




15







According to SAFE Circular 37, failure to make such registration or truthfully disclose actual controllers of the round-trip enterprises may subject PRC residents to fines up to RMB300,000 in case of domestic institutions or RMB50,000 in case of domestic individuals. If the registered or beneficial shareholders of the offshore holding company who are PRC residents do not complete their registration with the local SAFE branches, the PRC subsidiary may be prohibited from distributing their profits and proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to the offshore company, and the offshore company may be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital to its PRC subsidiary. Moreover, failure to comply with SAFE registration and amendment requirements described above could result in liability under PRC law for violating applicable foreign exchange restrictions.




Regulations on Cross-border Direct Investment in Renminbi



On October 12, 2011, MOFCOM issued the Notice of the Ministry of Commerce on Issues concerning Cross border Direct Investment in Renminbi which was abolished in 2013 and on December 3, 2013 the MOFCOM promulgated the Announcement on Issues relating to Cross-border Direct Investment in RMB, effective from January 1, 2014. Under this announcement, the “cross- border direct investment in RMB “shall refer to the direct investment activities conducted by foreign investors (including the investors from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan) in China with offshore RMB funds obtained legally, including, among other things, the establishment of new enterprises, increase of capital, shareholding or merger and acquisition of domestic enterprises. The cross-border direct investment in RMB by a foreign investor or reinvestment by its foreign-invested enterprise shall conform to the requirements of laws, regulations and relevant provisions on foreign investment and comply with the foreign investment industry policies of China and the provisions on security review of foreign investment mergers and acquisitions and anti-monopoly review. No foreign-invested enterprise is allowed to use the funds of cross-border direct investment in RMB for investment, directly or indirectly, in negotiable securities and financial derivatives in China (except for strategic investment in listed companies) or for entrusted loans. On October 13, 2011, the PBOC issued the Management Rules on the Settlement of Foreign Direct Invested Renminbi, which provide those foreign invested enterprises with RMB-dominated foreign direct investment must register with the PBOC or its local branch after obtaining the permit from MOFCOM and the business license. The Management Rules on the Settlement of Foreign Direct Invested Renminbi was amended on June 5, 2015.
