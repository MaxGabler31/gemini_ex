ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
DXC, a Nevada corporation, is a global IT services market leader. We provide mission-critical IT services that transform global businesses. We deliver excellence for our customers and colleagues around the world. 
Our more than 130,000 people in approximately 70 countries are entrusted by our customers, nearly half of today’s Fortune 500 companies, to provide solutions across the Enterprise Technology Stack for new levels of performance, scale and competitiveness.
DXC was formed on April 1, 2017 by the merger of CSC and HPES (the "HPES Merger").
Transformation Journey
DXC's transformation journey focuses on building stronger relationships with customers, its people, and unlocking value across the Enterprise Technology Stack.
Key transformation journey priorities include: 
•Inspire and Take Care of our Colleagues – Ensuring the health and safety of our people is a top priority, especially in the current environment
Continuing to bring in new technology, account and delivery talent across the world, and making investments that recognize and reward our people
•Focus on Customers – Strengthening our customer relationships and ensuring we are proactively delivering for customers
•Optimize Costs – Optimizing value to better serve our customers by eliminating confusion and complexity
•Seize the Market – Seizing the market opportunity by cross-selling and expanding what we do with our customers across the Enterprise Technology Stack
•Financial Foundation – Unlocking value by pursuing strategic alternatives, rationalizing our portfolio, and strengthening our balance sheet through creating a firm foundation that reflects our commitment to running a long-term sustainable business
The Company will continue to focus on execution of its transformation journey in the next fiscal year, with a continued focus on our people, revenue stabilization, cost optimization and winning in the market. The Company is continuing with its portfolio shaping efforts, making the right investments and divesting assets that the Company does not believe are well integrated with its enterprise technology stack and its strategic direction in order to better focus on its strategy. 
Important Acquisitions and Divestitures
During the third quarter of fiscal 2022, a subsidiary of DXC entered into a purchase agreement to sell (the "FDB Sale") its German financial services subsidiary ("FDB" or the "FDB Business") to the FNZ Group ("FNZ") for €300 million (approximately $335 million as of March 31, 2022), subject to certain adjustments. The closing of the transaction is subject to certain conditions, including receipt of certain regulatory consents. At March 31, 2022, FDB held approximately $572 million in cash which primarily related to customer deposit liabilities. The Company expects to complete the FDB Sale in fiscal 2023.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, DXC completed the sale of its healthcare provider software business (“HPS” or the “HPS Business”) to Dedalus Holding S.p.A. (“Dedalus”). The sale was accomplished by the cash purchase of all equity interests and assets attributable to the HPS Business for €468 million (approximately $551 million), subject to certain adjustments. 
During fiscal 2021, DXC completed the sale of its U.S. State and Local Health and Human Services business ("HHS" or the "HHS Business") to Veritas Capital Fund Management, L.L.C. ("Veritas Capital") to form Gainwell Technologies. The sale was accomplished by the cash purchase of all equity interests and assets attributable to the HHS Business together with future services to be provided by the Company for a total enterprise value of $5.0 billion, subject to net working capital adjustments and assumed liabilities.
During fiscal 2020, DXC completed the acquisition of Luxoft Holding, Inc., a global scale digital service provider whose offerings encompass strategic consulting, custom software development, and digital solution engineering services. We also completed other acquisitions during fiscal 2020 to complement our offerings and to provide opportunities for future growth.

See Note 20 - "Segment and Geographic Information" for additional information related to our reportable segments, including the disclosure of segment revenues, segment profit, and financial information by geographic area.
Sales and Marketing
We market and sell our services to customers through our direct sales force, which operates out of various locations around the world. Our customers include commercial businesses of many sizes and across many industries, as well as public sector enterprises. No individual customer exceeded 10% of our consolidated revenues for fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, or fiscal 2020.
Seasonality
General economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results. The markets in which we sell our solutions, services and products occasionally experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales. We also experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our services. For example, contract awards and certain revenue are often tied to the timing of our customers' fiscal year-ends, and we also experience seasonality related to our own fiscal year-end selling activities.
Competition 
The IT and professional services markets we compete in are highly competitive and are not dominated by a single company or a small number of companies. A substantial number of companies offer services that overlap our offerings and are competitive with our services. In addition, the increased importance of offshore labor centers has brought several foreign-based competitors into our markets.
Our competitors include:
•large multinational enterprises that offer some or all of the services and solutions that we offer;
•smaller companies that offer focused services and solutions similar to those that we offer;
•offshore service providers in lower-cost locations, particularly in India that sell directly to end-users;
•solution or service providers that compete with us in a specific industry segment or service area; and
•in-house functions of corporations that use their own resources rather than engaging an outside IT services provider.
The principal methods of competition in the markets for our solutions and services include:
•vision and strategic advisory ability;
•integrated solutions capabilities;
•performance and reliability;
•global and diverse talent;
•delivery excellence and ongoing support;
•responsiveness to customer needs;
•competitive pricing of services;
•technical and industry expertise;
•reputation and experience;
•quality of solutions and services; and
•financial stability and strong corporate governance.
Our ability to obtain new business and retain existing business is dependent upon the following:
•technology, industry and systems know-how with an independent perspective on best solutions across software, hardware, and service providers;
•ability to offer improved strategic frameworks and technical solutions;
•investments in our services and solutions;
•focus on responsiveness to proactively address customer needs, provide quality services and competitive prices;
•successful management of our relationships with leading strategic and solution partners in hardware, networking, cloud, applications and software;
•project management experience and capabilities, including delivery;
•end-to-end spectrum of IT and professional services we provide; and
•financial stability and strong corporate governance.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyrights, and trademarks, as well as contractual protections to protect our business interests. While our technical services and products are not generally dependent upon patent protection, we do selectively seek patent protection for certain inventions likely to be incorporated into products and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position.
As our patent portfolio has been built over time, the remaining terms of the individual patents across the patent portfolio vary. We believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our solutions and services and enhancing our freedom to sell solutions and services in markets in which we choose to participate.
Additionally, we own or have rights to various trademarks, service marks, and trade names that are used in the operation of our business. We also own or have the rights to copyrights that protect the content of our products and other proprietary materials.
In addition to developing our intellectual property portfolio, we license intellectual property rights from third parties as we deem appropriate. We have also granted and plan to continue to grant licenses to others under our intellectual property rights when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest.
Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG")
In 2021, we enhanced the governance of our ESG program to include a multitiered process involving the Board of Directors, members of our executive staff and internal leadership. Our Board of Directors provides oversight of our ESG program, enabling us to have the governance, long-term strategy and processes to manage ESG outcomes and meet the needs of our stakeholders. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors has specific oversight of ESG. Our ESG leadership team regularly updates the committee on ESG status and provides an update to the full board annually.
Our ESG strategy reflects our ongoing commitment to being a responsible corporate citizen. We are proud to be part of the global movement to minimize the impact of climate change on the world, and we are dedicated to driving sustainable growth by setting ambitious, science-based emissions reduction targets in the next two years. 
We strive to minimize our impact on the environment and improve resource efficiency in the areas of energy consumption, data center management and travel and transportation. Our conservation efforts are supported in part by our shift to a virtual-first operating model, which enables our workforce to be largely remote and helps us reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and our overall energy consumption. While the virtual-first model mainly helps reduce the size of our office footprint, we are also pursuing efficiency programs for data centers and data center rationalization programs to reduce energy consumption.
DXC also partners with customers to help them achieve their own climate-related goals. In response to shifting customer demand, we offer a number of products and services that can have a significant impact on our customers’ sustainability objectives, delivering climate-related benefits far greater than what we could achieve alone through our internal carbon-reduction efforts. Offerings such as DXC Modern Workplace, cloud migration services and data-driven sustainability services directly reduce carbon emissions for our customers.(1)
Additional information about our ESG initiatives is available on our website at http://dxc.com/us/en/about-us/corporate-responsibility. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference into, and is not a part of, this report.
Environmental Regulation
Our operations are subject to regulation under various federal, state, local, and foreign laws concerning the environment and sustainability, including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the clean-up of contaminated sites. Environmental costs and accruals are presently not material to our operations, cash flows or financial position; and, we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. However, we could incur substantial costs including clean-up costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions and third-party damage or personal injury claims if we were to violate or become liable under existing and future environmental laws or legislation. To limit future risks, DXC has committed to set near-term company-wide emission reductions in line with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). 
Human Capital Management
As a leading global information technology services company, we attract highly skilled and educated people. As of March 31, 2022, we employed more than 130,000 people worldwide. At DXC we value our people and the opportunity to engage with them - we are at our best when our people feel valued and respected.
Value of Employee Engagement
We value our people and take various actions for employee engagement. We assess employee engagement at least annually through a global engagement survey. During the past surveys, we have approximately 80% of our people participating in the survey with an employee engagement score measuring above 70%, and employees rated DXC highly on career path, communication, and culture. Based on feedback received through periodic engagement surveys, management has implemented several initiatives to improve the employee experience through rewards and recognition, open communications and process improvement. Various platforms like Global Talent Management, Coaching & Mentoring, Career Development programs, and global recognition are also used to improve employee experiences and engagement.

Management During COVID-19
We are committed to keeping our people safe and well. DXC employees are equipped and enabled to work virtually and flexibly from home and continue to deliver results for our customers. Science and data will remain the drivers of our approach as we continue to navigate through COVID-19, and promote the safety and well-being of our people. We will remain flexible and ready to react quickly if required to deliver for our customers. We recognize that this is an opportunity for DXC to change employee experience in an impactful way.
Training and Education
We view professional development as a corporate responsibility — a strategic investment in our employees’ and the company’s future. Through our global learning management ecosystem, we offer hundreds of learning programs as well as a career development system to help employees reach their potential. Providing ways to learn, grow, and explore new and challenging opportunities contribute to our ability to retain a motivated, knowledgeable workforce. Assessing employee abilities and contributions is a cornerstone of development at DXC. Our self-directed learning culture encourages employees to learn at their own pace and in a learning environment of their preference. Key to our people development is the role managers play – we remain focused on equipping and enabling our people leaders so that our people have leaders that guide and support them in their development and success.
Inclusion & Diversity
We are committed to an Inclusive and Diverse workforce. The DXC Global Diversity and Non-Discrimination Policy guides our engagement in management and hiring practices that promote diversity and inclusion.
Human Rights
We are committed to the protection and advancement of human rights and to enabling our operations in communities around the world to function with integrity. DXC is firmly committed to preventing the exploitation of vulnerable groups. Our main human rights–related focus areas are promoting good practice through our large and diverse global supply chain and supporting a diverse and inclusive corporate culture.
