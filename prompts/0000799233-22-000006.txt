ITEM 1.    Business
General
Heartland Express, Inc. is a holding company incorporated in Nevada, which owns directly or through subsidiaries, all of the stock of Heartland Express, Inc. of Iowa, Heartland Express Services, Inc., Heartland Express Maintenance Services, Inc., Midwest Holding Group, LLC and Millis Transfer, LLC. On August 26, 2019, Heartland Express, Inc. of Iowa acquired Midwest Holding Group, Inc. and Millis Real Estate Leasing, LLC (together, "Millis Transfer"), a truckload carrier headquartered in Black River Falls, Wisconsin. Effective December 31, 2019, Millis Transfer, Inc. and Midwest Holding Group, Inc. were converted to Millis Transfer, LLC and Midwest Holding Group, LLC, respectively. Further, effective December 31, 2019, Millis Real Estate Leasing, LLC, Rivera Real Estate, LLC, and Great River Leasing, LLC were merged into Millis Transfer, LLC.
We, together with our subsidiaries, are a short-to-medium haul truckload carrier (predominately 500 miles or less per load). We operate our consolidated operations under the brand names of Heartland Express and Millis Transfer. We primarily provide 
nationwide asset-based dry van truckload service for major shippers from Washington to Florida and New England to California. Approximately 99.9% of our operating revenue is derived from shipments within the United States ("U.S.") with the remainder being Canada. We do not have any operations in Mexico. We focus on providing high quality service to targeted customers with a high density of freight in our regional operating areas. We also offer limited temperature-controlled truckload services, which are not significant to our operations and have been reduced to serving select dedicated customers specifically in the western part of the U.S. since 2019. Further, we do not operate a non-asset-based freight brokerage business. We generally earn revenue based on the number of miles per load delivered and the revenue per mile paid.  We believe the keys to success are maintaining high levels of customer service and safety, which are generally predicated on the availability of experienced drivers and late-model equipment.  We believe that our service standards, safety record, and equipment accessibility have made us a core carrier to many of our major customers, as well as allowed us to build solid, long-term relationships with customers and brand ourselves as an industry leader for on-time service.
Our headquarters is located in North Liberty, Iowa, in a lower-cost environment with ready access to a skilled, educated, and industrious workforce. Our other terminals are located near major shipping corridors nationwide, affording proximity to customer locations, driver domiciles, and distribution centers. Approximately 80% of our terminals are located within 200 miles of the 25 largest metropolitan areas in the U.S. We believe our geographic reach and terminal locations assist us with driver recruiting and retention, efficient fleet maintenance, and consistent customer engagement.
We were founded by Russell A. Gerdin in 1978 and became publicly traded in November 1986. Over the thirty-five years from 1986 to 2021, we have grown our revenues to $607.3 million from $21.6 million and our net income has increased to $79.3 million from $3.0 million. For the five year period 2017 through 2021 we had the highest net income, $370.9 million, of any previous five year period. Much of our growth has been attributable to expanding service for existing customers, acquiring new customers, and continued expansion of our operating regions through new and existing customers as well as strategic acquisitions. More information regarding our total assets, revenues and profits for the past three years can be found in our “Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income” that is included in this report.
In addition to organic growth through the development of our regional operating areas, we have completed eight acquisitions since 1986, with the most recent and our third acquisition within the last eight years, Millis Transfer, occurring on August 26, 2019. These eight acquisitions have enabled us to solidify our position within existing regions, expand into new operating regions, pursue new customer relationships in new markets, as well as expand business relationships with current customers in new markets. We are highly selective about acquisitions, with our main criteria being (i) safe operations, (ii) high quality professional truck drivers, (iii) fleet profile that is compatible with our philosophy or can be replaced economically, and (iv) freight profile that will allow a path to a low-80s operating ratio upon full integration, application of our cost structure, and freight optimization, including exiting certain loads that fail to meet our operating profile. We expect to continue to evaluate acquisition candidates presented to us. We believe future growth depends upon several factors including the level of economic growth and the related customer demand, the available capacity in the trucking industry, our ability to identify and consummate future acquisitions, our ability to integrate operations of acquired companies to realize efficiencies, and our ability to attract and retain experienced drivers that meet our hiring standards. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”), Michael Gerdin, our President and Chief Executive Officer, oversees and manages all of our transportation services, on a combined basis, including previously acquired entities.
Operations
Our operations department focuses on the successful execution of customer expectations and providing consistent opportunities for our drivers, in conjunction with maximizing equipment utilization. These objectives require a combined effort of marketing, regional operations managers, and fleet management.
Our customer service department is responsible for maintaining the continuity between the customer’s needs and our ability to meet those needs by communicating the customer’s expectations to the fleet management group. Collectively, the marketing and operations groups (customer service and fleet management) are charged with developing customer relationships, ensuring service standards, coordinating proper freight-to-capacity balancing, trailer asset management, and daily tactical decisions to match customer demand with revenue equipment availability across our entire network. Fleet management assigns orders to drivers based on well-defined criteria, such as United States Department of Transportation (the “DOT”) hours of service ("HOS") compliance, customer requirements, equipment utilization, driver “home time” and other driver needs, limiting non-revenue miles, and equipment maintenance needs.
Fleet management employees are responsible for driver management, development, and retention. Additionally, they maximize the capacity that is available to meet the service needs of our customers. Their responsibilities include meeting the needs of the 
drivers within the standards that have been set by the organization and communicating the requirements of the customers to the drivers on each order to ensure successful execution.

Serving the short-to-medium haul market permits us to use primarily single rather than team drivers and dispatch most loads directly from origin to destination without an intermediate equipment change other than for driver scheduling purposes. Approximately 75% of our loads are less than 500 miles in length of haul. Substantially all of our revenue is, and for the last three fiscal years has been, generated from within the U.S. with immaterial revenue derived from Canada. We do not have, nor have we during the last three fiscal years had, any long-lived assets permanently located outside the U.S. 
We operate twenty-four terminal facilities throughout the contiguous U.S. in addition to our terminal and corporate headquarters in North Liberty, Iowa. These terminal locations are strategically located to concentrate on regional freight movements generally within a 500-mile radius of the terminals. This allows us to meet the needs of our customers in those regions while allowing our drivers to primarily stay within an operating region which provides them with more “home time.” This also allows us to service and maintain revenue equipment at our facilities on a frequent basis.
Personnel at the individual terminal locations manage these operations based on the overall corporate operating and maintenance goals and objectives. Our CODM evaluates the operational efficiencies of the Company's transportation services and operating performance of terminals on a combined basis based on consolidated operating ratio and reports detailing all of the Company’s load movements, rate per mile, and non-revenue miles. Both Heartland Express and Millis Transfer operate centralized computer networks and regular communication to achieve enterprise-wide load coordination.
We emphasize customer satisfaction through on-time performance, dependable late-model equipment, and consistent equipment availability to meet the volume requirements of our customers. We also maintain a trailer to tractor ratio that allows us to position trailers at customer locations for convenient loading and unloading. Most of the freight we transport is non-perishable and predominantly does not require driver handling. These factors help minimize waiting time, which increases tractor utilization and promotes driver retention.
Customers, Marketing, Safety and Diversity
We seek to transport freight that will complement traffic in our existing service areas and remain consistent with our focus on short-to-medium haul and regional distribution markets.  Management believes that building lane density in our primary traffic lanes will minimize empty miles and enhance driver “home time.” 
We target customers with multiple, time-sensitive shipments, including those utilizing “just-in-time” manufacturing and inventory management. In seeking these customers, we have positioned our business as a provider of premium service at compensatory rates, rather than competing solely on the basis of price. We believe our reputation for quality service, reliable equipment, and equipment availability makes us a core carrier for many of our customers.  This past year we once again were recognized for customer service by several of our customers as a testament to our service standards. These awards include: 
•FedEx Express - 2021 National Carrier of the Year (11 years in a row)
•FedEx Express - Platinum Service Level Award (99.99% On-Time Delivery)
•Transplace - 2020 Carrier of the Year
•Tosca - 2020 Carrier of the Year
•Unilever - Carrier Award (Asset Division)
During 2021, we were also recognized with the following safety, operational, community service, and environmental awards:
•US EPA SmartWay Excellence Award (7 of the last 9 years)
•Commercial Carrier Journal Top 250 Award (#42)
•Wreaths Across America Honor Fleet
Our primary customers include retailers and manufacturers. Our 25, 10, and 5 largest customers accounted for approximately 75%, 52%, and 36% of our operating revenues, respectively, in 2021. During 2020, our 25, 10, and 5 largest customers were approximately 74%, 50%, and 34%, of our operating revenues respectively. Our broad capacity network and customer base has allowed us to remain appropriately diversified as only one customer accounted for more than 10% of our operating revenues in 2021 at 10.0%. No customer accounted for more than 10% of our operating revenues in 2020 while one customer accounted for more than 10% of our 2019 operating revenues at 10.9%.
Environmental and Sustainability
We have adopted an "Environmental and Sustainability Mission". This document portrays our commitment to the environment and sustainability through our long track record of successful business practices. Through equipment designs, equipment replacement strategies, idle reduction techniques, solar energy and battery usage, and practices at each of our terminals, we are focused on reducing waste and conserving energy. Heartland's sustainability efforts are endorsed and overseen by senior management throughout the Company. Our efforts have been recognized by the US EPA SmartWay Excellence Award in 7 of the last 9 years.
Human Rights
We have adopted a "Human Rights Mission". This document portrays our commitment to human rights through diversity and inclusion, workplace safety and health, and prohibitions on forced labor and human trafficking. Heartland's human rights efforts are endorsed and overseen by senior management throughout the Company.
Seasonality
In the trucking industry, revenue typically follows a seasonal pattern for various commodities and customer businesses. Peak freight demand has historically occurred in the months of September, October and November. After the December holiday season and during the remaining winter months, freight volumes are typically lower as many customers reduce shipment levels. Although this is the general pattern of revenues, demand for freight services dropped significantly in the first part of the second quarter of 2020 and then began to increase. We have now been in a positive freight environment for approximately two years. Operating expenses have historically been higher in the winter months due primarily to decreased fuel efficiency, increased cold weather-related maintenance costs of revenue equipment and increased insurance and claims costs attributed to adverse winter driving conditions. Revenue can also be impacted by weather, holidays and the number of business days that occur during a given period, as revenue is directly related to the available working days of shippers. Weather-related events, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, blizzards, ice storms, floods, and fires, could increase in frequency and severity due to climate change.
Drivers, Independent Contractors, and Other Employees
We rely on our workforce in achieving our business objectives. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we employed an average of approximately 3,180 people compared to approximately 3,780 people during the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in employees as of December 31, 2021 was predominantly due to a decline in drivers due to the challenging qualified driver recruiting and retention environment. In addition, the ongoing right-sizing of support staff following the decrease in overall fleet size further contributed to the reduction. We also contracted with independent contractors to provide and operate tractors which provides us additional revenue equipment capacity, although not material to our operations. Independent contractors own their own tractors and are responsible for all associated expenses, including financing costs, fuel, maintenance, insurance, and highway use taxes. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, independent contractors accounted for approximately 0.7% of our total miles.

Historically our strategy for both employee drivers and independent contractors is to (i) hire and engage safe and experienced drivers (the majority of drivers we hire and engage must have at least six months of qualifying over-the-road experience); (ii) promote retention with an industry-competitive compensation package, positive working conditions, driver amenities at terminal locations, and freight that requires little or no handling; and (iii) minimize safety problems through careful screening, mandatory drug testing, continuous training, the ease of use of electronic logging devices ("ELDs") platform, and financial rewards for accident-free driving. We also seek to minimize turnover of our employee drivers by providing quality pay for their time with additional pay for safety, modern equipment, and by regularly scheduling "home time." Our drivers are generally compensated on the basis of miles driven including empty miles, with the added benefit of compensation for circumstances outside of their control, such as inclement weather and equipment breakdowns. This provides an incentive for us to minimize empty miles and at the same time does not penalize drivers for inefficiencies of operations that are beyond their control.
In addition to hiring experienced drivers, the acquisition of Millis Transfer in 2019, included a commercial driver's license ("CDL") training school. They have operated Millis Training Institute since 1989. Millis Training Institute is a driver training program dedicated to identifying, training, and developing capable individuals into obtaining their commercial driving license and becoming professional truck drivers. We operate in a cyclical industry and competition for drivers, which has historically been intense, escalates during periods of increased freight demand. Competition for professional drivers that meet our qualification standards is challenging due to the current trend of decreasing numbers of qualified drivers in our industry. This driver training program currently provides a source of qualified professional drivers for Millis Transfer and Heartland Express as we expanded the current training program in 2021.
We are not a party to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that we have good relationships with our employees.
Driver Compensation
Our comprehensive driver compensation program rewards drivers for years of service and safe operating mileage benchmarks, which are critical to our operational and financial performance. Our driver pay package generally includes weekly base pay minimums for mileage based drivers, future pay increases based on years of continued service with us, increased rates for accident-free miles of operation, detention pay, and other pay programs to assist drivers with unproductive time. In addition to the scheduled pay increases based on years of continued service, we have increased the base pay package and enhanced the compensation for our drivers multiple times during the last three years. We believe that our driver compensation package, compared to others in our industry, is consistently among the best in the industry. We are committed to investing in our drivers and compensating them for safety as both are key to our operational and financial performance. We also invest a significant amount of capital in our terminal facilities as we strive to offer our driver employees up to date and convenient amenities throughout our terminal network across the country while they are away from home.
Revenue Equipment
Our industry is very capital intensive as it relates to tractors and trailers. One of our core operating goals is to maintain a modern fleet of tractor and trailer equipment. The overall performance and reliability of tractor equipment typically has increased with each new model year of tractors that we have acquired in the last 5 years. By maintaining late model year tractors, a low average age, we experience better operating performance. Our drivers, along with the Company, benefit from the latest safety technologies and features that we choose to equip our tractors with. The modern fleet appeals to new drivers and aids in the retention of current drivers. Deploying this core strategy, along with idle management technology, also allows us to reduce our carbon footprint. This is evidenced by us being awarded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency SmartWay Excellence Award seven times in the last nine years.
We have historically owned our tractors and trailers and do not lease revenue equipment, other than when we have acquired companies that have utilized leases. Historically, we have paid cash for the acquisition of new revenue equipment. These strategies allow us the flexibility to buy and sell tractors (and trailers) opportunistically to capitalize on new and used equipment markets, size our fleet to the volume of attractive freight, and manage cash tax expense. One method we use to accomplish these goals is to depreciate our new tractors (excludes assets acquired through an acquisition) for financial reporting purposes using the 125% declining balance method, in which depreciation is higher in early periods and tapers off in later periods. We believe this method more accurately reflects actual asset values and affords us the flexibility to sell tractors at most points during their life cycle without experiencing losses. In addition, the decline in depreciation during later periods is typically offset by increased repairs and maintenance expense as the tractors age, which keeps our total operating costs more uniform over the operating life of the equipment. Trailers are depreciated using the straight-line method.
Revenue equipment acquired through acquisitions is generally revalued to current market values as of the acquisition date. These acquired assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis aligned with the remaining period of expected use. As acquired equipment is replaced, our fleet returns to our base methods of declining balance depreciation for tractors and straight-line depreciation for trailers. We believe our revenue equipment strategy is sound over the long term. However, it can contribute to volatility in gain on sale of equipment and quarterly earnings per share.
At December 31, 2021, the majority of our operating tractor fleet was equipped with idle management controls. All over-the-road tractors are equipped with mobile communication systems that comply with the latest ELD regulations. These units are the base communication with our drivers. This technology allows for efficient communication with our drivers regarding freight and safety (e.g. weather shutdowns), as well as fueling decisions, and provides the ability to manage the needs of our customers based on real-time information on load status. Our mobile communication systems also allow us to obtain information regarding equipment for better planning and efficient maintenance time as well as information regarding driver performance and efficiency.
As of December 31, 2021 the average age of our tractor fleet was 1.4 years compared to 1.7 years at December 31, 2020. We have historically operated the majority of our tractors while under warranty to minimize repair and maintenance cost and reduce service interruptions caused by breakdowns. The average age of our trailer fleet was 3.4 years at December 31, 2021 compared to 3.7 years at December 31, 2020. During 2022, we expect the age of both our tractor and trailer fleets to increase compared to 2021, based on estimated net capital expenditures in 2022 due to our expectation of a shortage of reasonably priced new revenue equipment availability.
We obtain a small portion of our tractor capacity through the use of independent contractors who own their own tractor equipment, although our use of independent contractors is not material to our overall operations. Independent contractors are responsible for the maintenance of their equipment.
The "Regulation" section in this Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report discusses in detail several regulations that have impacted and could continue to affect our cost and use of revenue equipment.
Fuel
We purchase diesel fuel ("fuel") over-the-road through a network of fuel stops throughout the U.S. at which we have negotiated price discounts. In addition, bulk fuel sites are maintained at the majority of our twenty-five terminal locations. We strategically manage fuel purchase decisions based on pricing of over-the-road fuel prices, bulk fuel prices, and the routing of equipment. Both above ground and underground storage tanks are utilized at the bulk fuel sites. We believe exposure to environmental cleanup costs is minimized by periodic inspection and monitoring of the tanks. We also have insurance policies in place for the operation of our tanks located at terminal locations. Increases in fuel prices can have an adverse effect on the results of operations. We have fuel surcharge agreements with most customers that enable us to pass through most long-term price increases. For the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, fuel expense was $99.6 million and $86.1 million, or 19.8% and 15.6%, respectively, of our total operating expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, fuel surcharge revenues were $76.1 million and $61.7 million, respectively. Department of Energy (“DOE”) average price of fuel increased 28.9% in 2021 compared to 2020, which had a corresponding negative impact on our net fuel cost, before the impacts of improved fleet efficiency, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. Fuel consumed by empty and out-of-route miles and by truck engine idling time is not recoverable and therefore any increases or decreases in fuel costs related to empty and out-of-route miles and idling time will directly impact our operating results. The increase in the DOE diesel fuel prices seen in 2021 was due to steadily rising fuel costs throughout the year compared to 2020 when fuel prices were at comparatively lower rates from the second quarter through the end of the year. This trend of fuel price increases has continued through February 2022. The latest DOE diesel fuel price in February 2022 is up 12.2% compared to the end of 2021, is up 23.4% compared to the 2021 yearly average, and is up 42.4% to the February 2021 average.
Competition and Industry
The truckload industry is highly competitive and fragmented with thousands of carriers of varying sizes. We compete with other truckload carriers; primarily those serving the regional, short-to-medium haul market. Logistics providers, railroads, less-than-truckload carriers, and private fleets provide additional competition but to a lesser extent. The industry is highly competitive based primarily upon freight rates, qualified drivers, service, and equipment availability. We specialize in time-sensitive shipments, including "just-in-time" and similar types of freight. We provide premium service at compensatory rates, rather than competing solely on the basis of price.
We operate in a cyclical industry. Throughout 2019, the general demand for freight services was at a level much lower than what has been experienced since. During 2020, the demand for freight services was volatile. Freight volumes in early 2020 were comparative to seasonal volumes of the first quarter of 2019. Then in March 2020 the demand for freight services dramatically increased as concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic escalated. In response to the outbreak of COVID-19, there was a short term drop in the demand for freight services in early second quarter of 2020, due to many businesses temporarily shutting down or scaling back operations with much of the working population of the United States working from home. By the end of the second quarter of 2020, demand for freight services began to improve as most businesses implemented their respective responses and protections against the pandemic which continued to build throughout the back half of 2020 and into 2021. Freight demand generally increased further throughout 2021. This led to an overall favorable pricing environment as freight rates increased throughout the second half of 2020 and continued to be strong throughout 2021.
The trucking industry has been faced with a qualified driver shortage. The pandemic events of 2020-2021 intensified an already challenging qualified driver market. Competition for drivers, which has historically been intense, escalates during periods of increased freight demand which intensified during the second half of 2020 and continued throughout 2021. Competition for qualified drivers will continue to be challenging going forward due to the decreasing numbers of qualified drivers in our industry. We continually explore new strategies to attract and retain qualified drivers with changes in market conditions and demands. We hire the majority of our drivers with at least six months of over-the-road experience and safe driving records. As previously discussed, our driver training program will provide an additional source of future potential professional drivers. In order to attract and retain experienced drivers who understand the importance of customer service, we have sought to solidify our position as an industry leader in driver compensation in our operating markets. In addition to the scheduled pay increases based on years of continued service, we have increased the base pay package and enhanced the compensation for our drivers multiple times during the last three years and anticipate further enhancements in 2022. Our comprehensive driver compensation 
and benefits program rewards drivers for years of service and safe operating mileage benchmarks, which are critical to our operational and financial performance. Our driver pay package includes future pay increases based on years of continued service with us, increased rates for accident-free miles of operation, detention pay, and other pay programs to assist drivers with unproductive time associated with circumstances outside of their control, such as inclement weather and equipment breakdowns. We believe that our driver compensation and benefits package is consistently among the best in the industry. We are committed to investing in our drivers and compensating them for safety as both are key to our operational and financial performance.
We expect freight demand to remain strong throughout 2022 based-upon the freight demand experienced in January and February of 2022 and expected normal seasonal trends. Other contributing factors include the shortage of qualified drivers and availability of new revenue equipment.
Safety and Risk Management
Our safety program is designed to minimize accidents and to conduct our business within governmental safety regulations. We communicate safety issues with drivers on a regular basis and also emphasize safety through equipment specifications and regularly scheduled maintenance intervals. Our drivers are compensated and recognized for achieving and maintaining a safe driving record.
The primary risks associated with our business include cargo loss and physical damage, personal injury, property damage, and workers’ compensation claims. We self-insure a portion of the exposure related to all of the aforementioned risks. Insurance coverage, including self-insurance retention levels, is evaluated on an annual basis. We actively participate in the settlement of each claim incurred.
We act as a self-insurer for auto liability involving property damage, personal injury, or cargo based on defined insurance retention of $1.0 million under our Millis policy or $2.0 million under our Heartland policy for any individual claim based on the insured party, accident date, and circumstances of the loss event. Within the Heartland policy, there is an additional one-time $1.0 million aggregate self-insurance corridor for auto liability claims between $2.0 million and $3.0 million. For both Heartland and Millis claims, liabilities in excess of these deductibles are covered by insurance up to $60.0 million, including retention of 50% of exposure from $5.0 million to $10.0 million. We retain any liability in excess of $60.0 million. We act as a self-insurer for workers' compensation liability claims based on defined insurance retention of $1.0 million. We act as a self-insurer for property damage to our tractors and trailers. We maintain a general insurance coverage policy for our terminal facilities with a $0.25 million deductible.
Regulation
Transportation Regulations
We are a common and contract motor carrier regulated by the DOT and various state and local agencies. The DOT generally governs matters such as safety requirements, registration to engage in motor carrier operations, insurance requirements, and periodic financial reporting. Our Company drivers and independent contractors also must comply with the safety and fitness regulations of the DOT, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and HOS. Such matters as weight and equipment dimensions are also subject to U.S. regulations. We also may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to fuel emissions, drivers' HOS, ergonomics, or other matters affecting safety or operating methods. Other agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and the Department of Homeland Security ("DHS") also regulate our equipment, operations, and drivers.
The DOT, through the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”), imposes safety and fitness regulations on us and our drivers, including rules that restrict driver HOS. Changes to such HOS rules can negatively impact our productivity and affect our operations and profitability by reducing the number of hours per day or week our drivers may operate and/or disrupting our network. However, in August 2019, the FMCSA issued a proposal to make changes to its hours-of-service rules that would allow truck drivers more flexibility with their 30-minute rest break and with dividing their time in the sleeper berth. It also would extend by two hours the duty time for drivers encountering adverse weather, and extend the shorthaul exemption by lengthening the drivers’ maximum on-duty period from 12 hours to 14 hours. In June 2020, the FMCSA adopted a final rule substantially as proposed, which became effective in September 2020. Certain industry groups have challenged these rules in court, and it remains unclear what, if anything, will come from such challenges. Since that time, we have seen a slight increase in the productivity of our drivers. Any future changes to HOS rules could materially and adversely affect our operations and profitability. 
There are two methods of evaluating the safety and fitness of carriers. The first method is the application of a safety rating that is based on an onsite investigation and affects a carrier’s ability to operate in interstate commerce. We currently have a satisfactory DOT safety rating under this method, which is the highest available rating under the current safety rating scale. If we received a conditional or unsatisfactory DOT safety rating, it could adversely affect our business, as some of our existing customer contracts require a satisfactory DOT safety rating. In January 2016, the FMCSA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking outlining a revised safety rating measurement system which would replace the current methodology. Under the proposed rule, the current three safety ratings of “satisfactory,” “conditional,” and “unsatisfactory” would be replaced with a single safety rating of “unfit.” Thus, a carrier with no rating would be deemed fit. Moreover, data from roadside inspections and the results of all investigations would be used to determine a carrier’s fitness on an ongoing basis. This would replace the current methodology of determining a carrier’s fitness based solely on infrequent comprehensive onsite reviews. The proposed rule underwent a public comment period that ended in June 2016 and several industry groups and lawmakers expressed their disagreement with the proposed rule, arguing that it violates the requirements of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (“FAST Act”) and that the FMCSA must first finalize its review of the Compliance Safety Accountability program (“CSA”) scoring system, described in further detail below. Based on this feedback and other concerns raised by industry stakeholders, in March 2017, the FMCSA withdrew the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking related to the new safety rating system. In its notice of withdrawal, the FMCSA noted that a new rulemaking related to a similar process may be initiated in the future. Therefore, it is uncertain if, when, or under what form any such rule could be implemented. The FMCSA has also indicated that it is in the early phases of a new study on the causation of crashes. Although it remains unclear whether such a study will ultimately be completed, the results of such study could spur further proposed and/or final rules in regards to safety and fitness.
In addition to the safety rating system, the FMCSA has adopted the CSA program as an additional safety enforcement and compliance model that evaluates and ranks fleets on certain safety-related standards. The CSA program analyzes data from roadside inspections, moving violations, crash reports from the last two years, and investigation results. The data is organized into seven categories. Carriers are grouped by category with other carriers that have a similar number of safety events (e.g., crashes, inspections, or violations) and carriers are ranked and assigned a rating percentile to prioritize them for interventions if they are above a certain threshold. Currently, these scores do not have a direct impact on a carrier’s safety rating. However, the occurrence of unfavorable scores in one or more categories may (i) affect driver recruiting and retention by causing high-quality drivers to seek employment with other carriers, (ii) cause our customers to direct their business away from us and to carriers with higher fleet rankings (iii), subject us to an increase in compliance reviews and roadside inspections, or (iv) cause us to incur greater than expected expenses in our attempts to improve unfavorable scores, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.
Under CSA, these scores were initially made available to the public in five of the seven categories. However, pursuant to the FAST Act which was signed into law in December 2015, the FMCSA was required to remove from public view the previously available CSA scores while it reviews the reliability of the scoring system. During this period of review by the FMCSA, we will continue to have access to our own scores and will still be subject to intervention by the FMCSA when such scores are above the intervention thresholds. We will continue to monitor our CSA scores and compliance through results from roadside inspections and other data available to detect positive or negative trends in compliance issues on an ongoing basis. A study was conducted and delivered to the FMCSA in June 2017 with several recommendations to make the CSA program more fair, accurate, and reliable. In late June 2018, the FMCSA provided a report to Congress outlining the changes it may make to the CSA program in response to the study. Such changes include the testing and possible adoption of a revised risk modeling theory, potential collection and dissemination of additional carrier data, and revised measures for intervention thresholds. The adoption of such changes is contingent on the results of the new modeling theory and additional public feedback. Therefore, it is unclear if, when, and to what extent such changes to the CSA program will occur. However, any changes that increase the likelihood of us receiving unfavorable scores could adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.
In May 2020, the FMCSA announced that effective immediately it is making permanent a pilot program that will not count a crash in which a motor carrier was not at fault when calculating the carrier’s safety measurement profile, called the Crash Preventability Demonstration Program (“CPDP”). The CPDP expands the types of eligible crashes, modify the Safety Measurement System to exclude crashes with not preventable determinations from the prioritization algorithm and note the not preventable determinations in the Pre-Employment Screening Program. Under the program, carriers with eligible crashes that occurred on or after August 2019, may submit a Request for Data Review with the required police accident report and other supporting documents, photos or videos through the FMCSA’s DataQs website. If the FMCSA determines the crash was not preventable, it will be listed on the Safety Measurement System but not included when calculating a carrier’s Crash Indicator Behavior Analysis and Safety Improvement Category measure in SMS. Additionally, the not preventable determinations will be noted on a driver’s Pre-Employment Screening Program report.
The FMCSA published a final rule in December 2015 that required the use of ELDs or automatic onboard recording devices ("AOBRs") by nearly all carriers by December 2017 (the "2015 ELD Rule"). The use of AOBRs was permitted until December 
2019, at which time the use of ELDs was required. We were compliant with both aspects of the 2015 ELD Rule within the requisite deadlines. We believe that more effective HOS enforcement under the 2015 ELD Rule may improve our competitive position by causing all carriers to adhere more closely to HOS requirements and may further reduce industry capacity.
In December 2016, the FMCSA issued a final rule establishing a national clearinghouse for drug and alcohol testing results and requiring motor carriers and medical review officers to provide records of violations by commercial drivers of FMCSA drug and alcohol testing requirements. Motor carriers are required to query the clearinghouse to ensure drivers and driver applicants do not have violations of federal drug and alcohol testing regulations that prohibit them from operating commercial motor vehicles. The final rule became effective in January 2017, with a compliance date in January 2020. In December 2019, however, the FMCSA announced a final rule extending by three years the date for state driver’s licensing agencies to comply with certain Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse requirements. The December 2016 commercial driver’s license rule required states to request information from the Clearinghouse about individuals prior to issuing, renewing, upgrading, or transferring to a CDL. This new action will allow states’ compliance with the requirement, which was set to begin January 2020, to be delayed until January 2023. That being said, the FMCSA has indicated that it will allow states the option to voluntarily query Clearinghouse information beginning January 2020. The compliance date of January 2020 remained in place for all other requirements set forth in the Clearinghouse final rule. However, upon implementation, the rule may reduce the number of available drivers in an already constrained driver market. Pursuant to a new rule finalized by the FMCSA, effective November 2021, states are required to query the Clearinghouse when issuing, renewing, transferring, or upgrading a commercial driver’s license and must revoke a driver’s commercial driving privileges if such driver is prohibited from driving a motor vehicle for one or more drug or alcohol violations.
In September 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (“DHHS”) announced proposed mandatory guidelines to allow employers to drug test truck drivers and other federal workers for pre-employment and random testing using hair specimens. However, the proposal also requires a second sample using either urine or an oral swab test if a hair test is positive, if a donor is unable to provide a sufficient amount of hair for faith-based or medical reasons, or due to an insufficient amount or length of hair. The proposal specifically requires that the second test be done simultaneously at the collection event or when directed by the medical review officer after review and verification of laboratory-reported results for the hair specimen. DHHS indicated the two-test approach is intended to protect federal workers from issues that have been identified as limitations of hair testing, and related legal deficiencies identified in two prior court cases. The American Trucking Associations (“ATA”) has voiced concerns with the new guidelines, characterizing them as “weak” and “misguided,” and specially taking issue with the second sample requirement, which the ATA feels diminishes the value of hair testing. It is unclear if, and when, a final rule may be put in place. Any final rule may reduce the number of available drivers.
Other rules have been recently proposed or made final by the FMCSA, including (i) a rule requiring the use of speed limiting devices on heavy duty tractors to restrict maximum speeds, which was proposed in 2016, and (ii) a rule setting forth minimum driver training standards for new drivers applying for commercial driver’s licenses for the first time and to experienced drivers upgrading their licenses or seeking certain endorsements, including a hazardous materials endorsement, which was made final in December 2016, with an initial compliance date in February 2020. However, in May 2020, the FMCSA approved an interim rule delaying implementation of the final rule by two years which extended the compliance date to February 2022. These recently effective entry level driver training regulations, among other things, unify driver training curriculum nationwide by mandating certain theory and behind-the-wheel training standards prior to taking the skills test, and require commercial driving schools and other training programs (including ours) to implement such curriculum and register with the FMCSA’s Training Provider Registry, certifying that their curriculum meets the new standards. The rules generally do not apply retroactively, however, so current holders of commercial driver’s licenses will largely be unaffected. That being said, these rules could result in a decrease in fleet production and driver availability, either of which could adversely affect our business or operations. They may also result in an increase in the time and expense required to operate or expand our driver training schools and programs, which could adversely affect our results and profitability. In July 2017, the DOT announced that it would no longer pursue a speed limiter rule, but left open the possibility that it could resume such a pursuit in the future. In May 2021, however, the Cullum Owings Large Truck Safe Operating Speed Act was reintroduced into the U.S. House of Representatives and would require commercial motor vehicles with a gross weight of more than 26,000 pounds to be equipped with a speed limiter that would limit the vehicle’s speed to no more than 65 M.P.H. The effect of these rules, to the extent they become effective, could result in a decrease in fleet production and driver availability, either of which could adversely affect our business or operations.
The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (“IIJA”), signed into law by President Biden in November 2021, created an apprenticeship program for drivers younger than 21 to eventually qualify to drive commercial trucks in interstate commerce. The provision drew certain mechanics from the bills introduced in Congress in 2019 related to lowering the age requirements for interstate commercial driving. The FMCSA announced the establishment of this apprenticeship program in January 2022 in an effort to help the industry’s ongoing driver shortage. The program is open to 18 to 20-year-old drivers who already hold intrastate commercial driver’s licenses and sets a strict training regimen for participating drivers and carriers to comply with. 
Motor carriers interested in participating must complete an application for participation and submit monthly data on an apprentice’s driver activity, safety outcomes, and additional supporting information. It remains unclear whether any regulatory changes will stem from the apprenticeship program.
In December 2018, the FMCSA granted a petition filed by the ATA and in doing so determined that federal law does preempt California’s wage and hour laws, and interstate truck drivers are not subject to such laws. The FMCSA’s decision has been appealed by labor groups and multiple lawsuits have been filed in federal courts seeking to overturn the decision. In January 2021, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has since upheld the FMCSA's determination that federal law does preempt California's meal and rest break laws, as applied to drivers of property-carrying commercial motor vehicles. Other current and future state and local laws, including laws related to employee meal breaks and rest periods, may also vary significantly from federal law. Further, driver piece rate compensation, which is an industry standard, has been attacked as non-compliant with state minimum wage laws and lawsuits have recently been filed and/or adjudicated against carriers demanding compensation for sleeper berth time, layovers, rest breaks and pre-trip and post-trip inspections, the outcome of which could have major implications for the treatment of time that drivers spend off-duty (whether in a truck’s sleeper berth or otherwise) under applicable wage laws. Both of these issues are adversely impacting the Company and the industry as a whole, with respect to the practical application of the laws, thereby resulting in additional cost. As a result, we, along with other companies in the industry, could become subject to an uneven patchwork of laws throughout the U.S. Federal legislation has been proposed in the past to preempt certain state and local laws; however, passage of such legislation is uncertain. If federal legislation is not passed, we will either need to comply with the most restrictive state and local laws across our entire network, or overhaul our management systems to comply with varying state and local laws. Either solution could result in increased compliance and labor costs, driver turnover, decreased efficiency, and amplified legal exposure.
Tax and other regulatory authorities, as well as independent contractors themselves, have increasingly asserted that independent contractor drivers in the trucking industry are employees rather than independent contractors, for a variety of purposes, including income tax withholding, workers' compensation, wage and hour compensation, unemployment, and other issues. Federal legislators have introduced legislation in the past to make it easier for tax and other authorities to reclassify independent contractor drivers as employees, including legislation to increase the recordkeeping requirements for those that engage independent contractor drivers and to heighten the penalties of companies who misclassify their employees and are found to have violated employees' overtime and/or wage requirements. The most recent example being the Protecting the Rights to Organize (“PRO”) Act, which was passed by the House of Representatives and received by the Senate in March 2021 and remains with the Senate’s Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. The PRO Act proposes to apply the “ABC Test” for classifying workers under Federal Fair Labor Standards Act claims. It is unknown whether any of the proposed legislation will become law or whether any industry-based exemptions from any resulting law will be granted. Additionally, federal legislators have sought to abolish the current safe harbor allowing taxpayers meeting certain criteria to treat individuals as independent contractors if they are following a long-standing, recognized practice, extend the Fair Labor Standards Act to independent contractors, and impose notice requirements based upon employment or independent contractor status and fines for failure to comply. Some states have put initiatives in place to increase their revenues from items such as unemployment, workers' compensation, and income taxes, and a reclassification of independent contractor drivers as employees would help states with these initiatives. 
Recently, courts in certain states have issued decisions that could result in a greater likelihood that independent contractors would be judicially classified as employees in such states. In September 2019, California enacted A.B. 5 (“AB5”), a new law that changed the landscape of the state’s treatment of employees and independent contractors. AB5 provides that the three-pronged “ABC Test” must be used to determine worker classification in wage-order claims. Under the ABC Test, a worker is presumed to be an employee, and the burden to demonstrate their independent contractor status is on the hiring company through satisfying all three of the following criteria:
•the worker is free from control and direction in the performance of services; and
•the worker is performing work outside the usual course of business of the hiring company; and
•the worker is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business.
How AB5 will be enforced is still to be determined. In January 2021, however, the California Supreme Court ruled that the ABC Test could apply retroactively to all cases not yet final as of the date the original decision was rendered, April 30, 2018. While AB5 was set to go into effect in January 2020, a federal judge in California issued a preliminary injunction barring the enforcement of AB5 on the trucking industry while the California Trucking Association (“CTA”) moves forward with its suit seeking to invalidate AB5. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the reasoning behind the injunction in April 2021, ruling that AB5 is not pre-empted by federal law, but granted a stay of the AB5 mandate in June 2021 (preventing its application and temporarily continuing the injunction) while the CTA petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court (the “Supreme Court”) to review the decision. In November 2021, the Supreme Court requested that the U.S. solicitor general weigh in on the case. 
The injunction will remain in place until the Supreme Court makes a decision on whether to proceed in hearing the case. While the stay of the AB5 mandate provides temporary relief to the enforcement of AB5, it remains unclear how long such relief will last, and whether the CTA will ultimately be successful in invalidating the law. It is also possible AB5 will spur similar legislation in states other than California, which could adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.
Further, class actions and other lawsuits have been filed against certain members of our industry seeking to reclassify independent contractors as employees for a variety of purposes, including workers' compensation and health care coverage. Taxing and other regulatory authorities and courts apply a variety of standards in their determination of independent contractor status. Our classification of independent contractors has been the subject of audits by such authorities from time to time. While we have been successful in continuing to classify our independent contractor drivers as independent contractors and not employees, we may be unsuccessful in defending that position in the future. If our independent contractor drivers are determined to be our employees, we would incur additional exposure under federal and state tax, workers' compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment, and tort laws, including for prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings. Our use of independent contractors is not significant to our total operations.
Environmental Regulations
We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the hauling and handling of hazardous materials, fuel storage tanks, air emissions from our vehicles and facilities, engine idling, and discharge and retention of storm water. Our truck terminals often are located in industrial areas where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination could occur. Our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage, environmental damage, and hazardous waste disposal, among others. Certain facilities have waste oil, new oil, diesel exhaust fluid ("DEF"), or fuel storage tanks and fueling islands. We do not know of any environmental regulations that would have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Additionally, increasing efforts to control emissions of greenhouse gases may have an adverse effect on us. We maintain a young fleet age of tractors to ensure we are using the most up-to-date technology deployed by manufacturers to reduce emissions. Although we have instituted programs to monitor and control environmental risks and promote compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, if we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances, if there are releases of hazardous substances we transport, if soil or groundwater contamination is found at our facilities or results from our operations, or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to cleanup costs and liabilities, including substantial fines or penalties or civil and criminal liability, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results.
In August 2011, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ("NHTSA") and the EPA adopted final rules that established the first-ever fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards for medium and heavy-duty vehicles, including the tractors we employ (the “Phase 1 Standards”). The Phase 1 Standards apply to tractor model years 2014 to 2018 and require the achievement of an approximate 20 percent reduction in fuel consumption by the 2018 model year, which equates to approximately four gallons of fuel for every 100 miles traveled. In addition, in February 2014, President Obama announced that his administration would begin developing the next phase of tighter fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas standards for medium-and heavy-duty tractors and trailers (the “Phase 2 Standards”). In October 2016, the EPA and NHTSA published the final rule mandating that the Phase 2 Standards will apply to trailers beginning with model year 2018 and tractors beginning with model year 2021. The Phase 2 Standards require nine percent and 25 percent reductions in emissions and fuel consumption for trailers and tractors, respectively, by 2027. The final rule was effective in December 2016 but has since faced challenges and delays. In October 2017, the EPA announced a proposal to repeal the Phase 2 Standards as they relate to gliders (which mix refurbished older components, including transmissions and pre-emission-rule engines, with a new frame, cab, steer axle, wheels, and other standard equipment). The outcome of such proposal is still undetermined. Additionally, implementation of the Phase 2 Standards as they relate to trailers has been challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. In November 2021, a panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled in favor of the association challenging the standards and vacated all portions of the Phase 2 Standards that applied to trailers, and consequently, the Phase 2 Standards will only require reductions in emissions and fuel consumption for tractors. Even though the trailer provisions of the Phase 2 standards have been removed, we will still need to ensure the majority of our fleet is compliant with the California Phase 2 standards.
In January 2020, the EPA announced it is seeking input on reducing emissions of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants from heavy-duty trucks. The EPA anticipates taking final action on the new plan, commonly referred to as the “Cleaner Trucks Initiative,” as soon as 2022. The EPA is targeting 2027 for these new standards to take effect and is also working on enacting more stringent greenhouse gas emission standards (beginning with model year 2030 vehicles) by the end of 2024.
The California Air Resources Board ("CARB") also adopted emission control regulations that will be applicable to all heavy-duty tractors that pull 53-foot or longer box-type trailers within the State of California. The tractors and trailers subject to these 
CARB regulations must be either EPA SmartWay certified or equipped with low-rolling resistance tires and retrofitted with SmartWay-approved aerodynamic technologies. Enforcement of these CARB regulations for model year 2011 equipment began in January 2010 and have been phased in over several years for older equipment. In addition, in February 2017 CARB proposed California Phase 2 standards that would generally align with the federal Phase 2 Standards, with some minor additional requirements, and as proposed would stay in place even if the federal Phase 2 Standards are affected. In February 2019, the California Phase 2 standards became final. Thus, even though the trailer provisions of the Phase 2 Standards were removed, we will still need to ensure the majority of our fleet is compliant with the California Phase 2 standards, which may result in increased equipment costs and could adversely affect our operating results and profitability. CARB has also recently announced intentions to adopt regulations ensuring that 100% of tractors operating in California are operating with battery or fuel cell-electric engines in the future. Whether these regulations will ultimately be adopted remains unclear. Federal and state lawmakers also are considering a variety of other climate-change proposals. Compliance with such regulations could increase the cost of new tractors and trailers, impair equipment productivity, and increase operating expenses. These effects, combined with the uncertainty as to the operating results that will be produced by the newly designed diesel engines and the residual values of these vehicles, could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations. In June 2020, CARB also passed the Advanced Clean Trucks (“ACT”) regulation, which became effective in March 2021 and generally requires original equipment manufacturers to begin shifting towards greater production of zero-emission heavy duty tractors starting in 2024. Under ACT, by 2045, every new tractor sold in California will need to be zero-emission. While ACT does not apply to those simply operating tractors in California, it could affect the cost and/or supply of traditional diesel tractors and may lead to similar legislation in other states or at the federal level.
In order to reduce exhaust emissions, some states and municipalities have begun to restrict the locations and amount of time where diesel-powered tractors may idle. These restrictions could force us to purchase on-board power units that do not require the engine to idle or to alter our drivers' behavior, which could result in a decrease in productivity or increase in driver turnover.
Executive and Legislative Climate
It is still to be determined how President Biden’s leadership will impact our industry. That being said, President Biden has indicated his intent to make a green infrastructure package a top priority for his administration. Any measure in furtherance thereof could draw from the Build Back Better Act (the “BBB”), which passed the U.S. House of Representatives, but is facing resistance in the U.S. Senate. As currently proposed, the BBB would impact transportation by allocating funds to address various industry related issues such as port congestion and traffic safety enforcement. The bill also promotes a myriad of low-emission programs, transit services and clean energy projects, as well as funding for climate change research. It is unclear whether these legislative initiatives will be signed into law and what changes they may undergo. However, adoption and implementation could negatively impact our business by increasing our compliance obligations and related expenses.
President Biden has also indicated an intention to make substantial changes to the current U.S. tax laws during his administration, including changes to the way capital gains are treated. Any changes to U.S. tax laws may have an adverse impact on our business and profitability.
The United States Mexico Canada Agreement (“USMCA”) was entered into effect in July 2020. The USMCA is designed to modernize food and agriculture trade, advance rules of origin for automobiles and trucks, and enhance intellectual property protections, among other matters, according to the Office of U.S. Trade Representative. It is difficult to predict at this stage what could be the impact of the USMCA on the economy, including the transportation industry. However, given the amount of North American trade that moves by truck, it could have a significant impact on supply and demand in the transportation industry, and could adversely impact the amount, movement, and patterns of freight we transport.
The IIJA was signed into law by President Biden in November 2021. The roughly $1.2 trillion bill contains an estimated $550 billion in new spending, which will impact transportation. In particular, it dedicates more than $100 billion for surface transportation networks and roughly $66 billion for freight and passenger rail operations. Among provisions in the law specific to trucking is the aforementioned apprenticeship program for drivers younger than 21 to eventually qualify to drive commercial trucks in interstate commerce. It remains unclear how the IIJA will be implemented into and effect our industry. The IIJA may result in increased compliance and implementation related expenses, which could have a negative impact on our operations.
Given COVID-19’s considerable effect on our industry, the FMCSA issued and/or extended various temporary responsive measures throughout the year. Although, to date, these measures have largely been enacted in order to assist industry participants in operating under adverse circumstances, any further responsive measures remain unclear and could have a negative impact on our operations.
In November 2021 the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) published an emergency temporary standard (the “Emergency Rule”) requiring all employers with at least 100 employees to ensure that their employees are fully vaccinated or require any employees who remain unvaccinated to produce a negative COVID-19 test result on at least a weekly basis before coming to work. The Emergency Rule has been blocked by the Supreme Court. Effective January 2022, the U.S. is prohibiting unvaccinated foreigners from crossing the U.S.-Mexico border and U.S.-Canada border. The Company does not have any Mexican or Canadian domiciled drivers that will be impacted by this requirement. Furthermore, effective January 2022, Canada is prohibiting unvaccinated foreigners, including U.S. citizens, from crossing their border. The Company has a minimal volume of freight into Canada, therefore border restrictions will not significantly impact our operations. These border requirements, as well as any future vaccination, testing or mask mandates that are allowed to go into effect, could, among other things, (i) cause our unvaccinated employees to go to smaller employers, if such employers are not subject to future mandates, or leave us or the trucking industry, especially our unvaccinated drivers, (ii) result in logistical issues, increased expenses, and operational issues from arranging for weekly tests of our unvaccinated employees, especially our unvaccinated drivers, (iii) result in increased costs for recruiting and retention of drivers, as well as the cost of weekly testing, and (iv) result in decreased revenue if we are unable to recruit and retain drivers. Any vaccination, testing or mask mandates that are interpreted as applying to drivers would significantly reduce the pool of drivers available to us and our industry, which would further impact the extreme shortage of available drivers. Accordingly, any vaccination, testing or mask mandates, if allowed to go into effect, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
