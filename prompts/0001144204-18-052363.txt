Overview 
 
RMR Industrials, Inc. was incorporated on August 6, 2012 as a Nevada corporation. We are a growth stage company dedicated to operating industrial assets in the United States (U.S.) which include minerals, materials and services. Our vision is to become a key provider of industrial materials and services in the Rocky Mountain region. We utilize differentiated operational capabilities, which we believe will allow us to outperform conventional operators through diverse markets.
 
We have a strategy to own, operate, develop, acquire and vertically integrate complementary industrial businesses. The experienced management team of RMR Industrials, Inc. brings a multi-cycle track record of operating natural resource businesses.
 
We operate the Mid-Continent Quarry in Garfield County, Colorado, producing chemical-grade calcium carbonate that currently services local and regional customers in a variety of end markets, including but not limited to: mining, manufacturing, construction, and agriculture. The Mid-Continent Quarry in Glenwood Springs, Colorado consists of 41 unpatented mining claims owned by the Bureau of Land Management and controlled by RMR. The mine’s deposit contains chemical-grade calcium carbonate, with mineral resources estimated at 106 million tons of high calcium limestone and 189 million tons of dolomite. The operation currently serves Arch Coal, Hickman Farms, local construction firms, and various city and county government construction projects. The quarry is currently undergoing an expansion and modernization effort.
 
RMR Industrials, Inc., is actively developing Rocky Mountain Rail Park (“Rail Park”), a dedicated rail-served industrial business park serving the great Denver market. In January 2018, we acquired the 470 acres of land in Bennett, Colorado, which serves as the foundation for the Rail Park. The development acreage is in the process of being entitled and rezoned for appropriate industrial use. The Company’s development of the Rail Park is intended to expand our customer base for our products by utilizing rail freight capabilities to reach customers in the greater Denver area and by expanding our business to include rail transportation solutions and services. We will be the permanent owner and operator of the Rail Park and once operational, the facility will seek to establish a new industrial hub for rail transportation and related services serving Adams County, Colorado and the greater Denver metropolitan area.
 
Rail freight capabilities allow the Mid-Continent Quarry’s products to access the Denver market, where demand outpaces supply. The market opportunity is primarily centered on front range infrastructure demands, but also includes fertilizer, animal feed, and multiple other industrial applications. The Denver Metro area’s current demand for construction aggregate is approximately 29 million tons per year while experiencing a supply shortage in peak seasons, creating a natural market for our products. We have unique positioning and assets to accomplish this.
 
In addition to developing and expanding our existing assets, we expect to supplement our growth with strategic acquisitions of related business and integrating these businesses to achieve economies of scale and synergies. We target companies in various sectors directed towards industrial and/or infrastructure applications, including but not limited to: construction materials, industrial minerals, natural resources, logistical solutions, and transportation.
 
Competitive Strengths 
 
Our principals have extensive experience and also collaborated in investing in and operating natural resource assets for many years. We believe our potential competitive strengths to be the following:
Application of Intellectual Property. We have a background in engineering, operations, finance and general management all within the natural resource sectors.
 
Management Operating and Investing Experience.  Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have developed a broad international network of contacts and corporate relationships which we believe will serve as a useful source of investment opportunities. The management team has applied their deep understanding of historical precedents to the natural resources markets. Certain management team members have been working together for the last ten years, over such time they have assembled a team of natural resources and investment professionals to pursue investments across the industry.
Revenues and Customers
 
For the year ended March 31, 2018, 74% of our revenue was from one customer. At March 31, 2018, approximately 84 % of our accounts receivable was due from the same customer.

Industry and Competition
 
Limestone
 
Limestone, or calcium carbonate is used in a variety of applications including coal mining, coal fired power plants, construction aggregates, glass bottle and steel manufacturing, and agriculture. Regional Competitors include Pete Lien & Sons, Inc., and United States Lime & Minerals, Inc.
Construction Aggregates
 
Aggregates are key material components used in the production of cement, ready-mixed concrete and asphalt paving mixes for the residential, nonresidential and public infrastructure markets and are also widely used for various applications and products, such as road and building foundations, railroad ballast, erosion control, filtration, roofing granules and in solutions for snow and ice control. Generally extracted from the earth using surface or underground mining methods, aggregates are produced from natural deposits of various materials such as limestone, sand and gravel, granite and trap rock.
 
Markets are typically local due to high transport costs and are generally fragmented, with numerous participants operating in localized markets. According to the 2018 U.S. Geological Survey Minerals Yearbook, the U.S. market for these products was estimated at approximately 2.2 billion tons in 2017 valued at $23.0 billion. Relative to other construction materials, such as cement, aggregates consumption is more heavily weighted towards public infrastructure and maintenance repair. However, the mix of end uses can vary widely by geographic location, based on the nature of construction activity in each market. Typically, three to six competitors comprise the majority market share of each local market because of the constraints around the availability of natural resources and transportation. Regional competitors for construction aggregates in Colorado include Martin Marietta Materials, Inc., Albert Frei & Sons, Inc., Aggregate Industries, Brannan Sand & Gravel Co., LLC, L.G. Everist, Inc., and BURNCO.
 
Industrial Minerals
 
The industrial minerals sector encompasses a large variety of minerals including: limestone, chamottes, ball clay, feldspar, graphite, ground silica, kaolin, pegmatite, quartz, mica, bauxite, bentonite, metakaolins, zeolite, frac sand, aggregates and dolomite. Industrial minerals are used in a variety of end projects for a variety of purposes. These minerals are used in ceramics, paints, plastics, paper, rubber, food, cosmetics, and many other products.
 
There are significant barriers to entry into industrial mineral production due to the scarcity of economically viable resources from which to extract the minerals. Geographical location of the resource drives a large portion of the competitive advantages or disadvantages of an operation. Large companies in this sector include Imerys, W.R. Grace, and Minerals Technologies.
 
Environmental and Government Regulation
 
Our operations will be subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances in the United States and abroad relating to the protection of the environment and human health and to safety, including those pertaining to chemical manufacture and distribution, waste generation, storage and disposal, discharges to waterways, and air emissions and various other health and safety matters. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations, and violators may be subject to civil, criminal and administrative penalties, injunctions or both. We will devote significant financial resources to ensure compliance. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all the applicable laws and regulations.
 
We anticipate that the regulation of our business operations under federal, state and local environmental laws in the United States and abroad will increase and become more stringent over time. We cannot estimate the impact of increased and more stringent regulation on our operations, future capital expenditure requirements or the cost of compliance.
 
United States Regulation. Statutory programs relating to protection of the environment and human health and to safety in the United States include, among others, the following. 
 
CERCLA. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, also known as “CERCLA” and “Superfund”, and comparable state laws generally impose joint and several liability for costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damages, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons with respect to the release into the environment of specified substances, including under CERCLA those designated as “hazardous substances.” These persons include the present and certain former owners or operators of the site where the release occurred and those that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance at the site. These liabilities can arise in association with the properties where operations were conducted, as well as disposal facilities where wastes were sent. Many states have adopted comparable or more stringent state statutes. In the course of our operations, we generated materials that fall within CERCLA’s definition of hazardous substances. We may be the owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released and may have generated hazardous substances that have been transported to or otherwise released upon offsite facilities. We may be responsible under CERCLA for all or part of the costs to clean up facilities at which such substances have been released by previous owners or operators and offsite facilities to which our wastes were transported and for associated damages to natural resources.

Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (“RCRA”) and comparable state laws regulate the treatment, storage, disposal, remediation and transportation of wastes, specifically under RCRA those designated as “hazardous wastes.” The EPA and various state agencies have limited the disposal options for these wastes and impose numerous regulations upon the treatment, storage, disposal, remediation and transportation of them. Our operations generate wastes that are subject to RCRA and comparable state statutes. Furthermore, wastes generated by our operations that are currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may be designated in the future as hazardous wastes under RCRA or other applicable statutes and, therefore, may be subject to more rigorous and costly treatment, storage and disposal requirements. Governmental agencies (and in the case of civil suits, private parties in certain circumstances) can bring actions for failure to comply with RCRA requirements, seeking administrative, civil, or criminal penalties and injunctive relief, to compel us to abate a solid or hazardous waste situation that presents an imminent or substantial endangerment to health or the environment.
Clean Water Act. The federal Clean Water Act imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of wastes and fill materials into waters of the United States. Under the Clean Water Act, and comparable state laws, the government (and in the case of civil suits, private parties in certain circumstances) can bring actions for failure to comply with Clean Water Act requirements and enforce compliance through civil, criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges of hazardous substances and of other pollutants. In the event of an unauthorized discharge of wastes, we may be liable for penalties and subject to injunctive relief.
Clean Air Act. The federal Clean Air Act (CAA), as amended and comparable state and local laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. Governmental agencies (and in the case of civil suits, private parties in certain circumstances) can bring actions for failure to strictly comply with air pollution regulations or permits and generally enforce compliance through administrative, civil or criminal enforcement actions, resulting in fines, injunctive relief (which could include requiring us to forego construction, modification or operation of sources of air pollutants) and imprisonment. While we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions-related issues, we do not believe that such requirements will have a material adverse effect on our operations.
Greenhouse Gas Regulation. More stringent laws and regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gases (GHGs) may be adopted in the future and could cause us to incur material expenses in complying with them. The EPA has begun to regulate GHGs as pollutants under the CAA. The EPA adopted rules to permit GHG emissions from stationary sources under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V permitting programs including the “Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule,” requiring that the largest sources first obtain permits for GHG emissions. The United States Supreme Court, however, ruled that the EPA did not have the authority to require permits for GHG emissions and also did not have the authority to adopt that rule. The Court did hold that if a source required a permit under the program because of other pollutants, the EPA had the authority to require that the source demonstrate that it would use the best available control technology to minimize GHG emissions that exceeded a minimal amount.
 
Because of the lack of any comprehensive legislation program addressing GHGs, the EPA is using its existing regulatory authority to promulgate regulations requiring reduction in GHG emissions from various categories of sources, starting with fossil fuel-fired power plants. There is a great deal of uncertainty as to how and when additional federal regulation of GHGs might take place. Some members of Congress have expressed the intention to promote legislation to curb the EPA’s authority to regulate GHGs. In addition to federal regulation, a number of states, individually and regionally, and localities also are considering implementing or have implemented GHG regulatory programs. These regional and state initiatives may result in so–called cap–and–trade programs, under which overall GHG emissions are limited and GHG emission “allowances” are then allocated and sold to and between persons subject to the program. These and possibly other regulatory requirements could result in our incurring material expenses to comply, for example by being required to purchase or to surrender allowances for GHGs resulting from other operations or otherwise being required to control or reduce emissions.
 
Health and Safety. Our operations are also governed by laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health, principally regulations and requirements from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”). The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA’s community right-to-know regulations and similar state programs may require us to organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations. Failure to comply with requirements from these laws and regulations can result in sanctions such as fines and penalties and claims for personal injury and property damage. These requirements may also result in increased operating and capital costs in the future. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these applicable requirements. 
Licenses, Permits and Product Registrations. Certain licenses, permits and product registrations are required for our products and operations in the United States, and in other countries where we do business. The licenses, permits and product registrations are subject to revocation, modification and renewal by governmental authorities. In the United States in particular, producers and distributors of chemicals such as penta and creosote are subject to registration and notification requirements under federal law (including under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”) and the Toxic Substances Control Act, and comparable state law) in order to sell those products in the United States. Compliance with these laws has had, and in the future will continue to have, a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Under FIFRA, the law’s registration system requires an ongoing submission to the EPA of substantial scientific research and testing data regarding the chemistry and toxicology of pesticide products by manufacturers.
