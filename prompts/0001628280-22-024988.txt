Item 1. Business
Overview 
We are the world’s largest operator of bowling entertainment centers. Since the acquisition of the original Bowlmor Lanes location in 1997 in Greenwich Village, New York City, our journey has continued to revolutionize bowling entertainment. We operate traditional bowling centers and more upscale entertainment concepts with lounge seating, arcades, enhanced food and beverage offerings, and more robust customer service for individuals and group events, as well as hosting and overseeing professional and non-professional bowling tournaments and related broadcasting. Our bowling business is our only reporting segment. All amounts are in thousands, except share, per share or as otherwise specifically noted.
Competitive Strengths
We believe our key competitive strengths include our highly loyal customers, strong branding, diverse product offerings, excellent and well-diversified geographic locations, proven business model and experienced management team, all of which contribute to our solid track record of sustainable growth and generating positive earnings.
Loyal Customers: With the over 26-million customers (pre-pandemic) we serve each year, we are well-positioned in highly attractive markets across North America to capitalize on the very large addressable markets for bowling and out-of-home entertainment. With our strong market position, we are able to leverage our competitive strengths to grow our business by, among other things, differentiating our bowling, dining and amusement video game entertainment offerings for our retail, league and group event customers. Retail consists of our walk-in customers and is by far our largest and most diverse audience. Leagues are a large and stable source of recurring revenue and group events, such as birthday parties and corporate events, are a consistent revenue stream with significant growth potential.

Strong Branding: Our centers operate under different brand names and our strong branding plays an integral role in the success of our business. The Bowlero branded centers offer a more upscale entertainment concept with lounge seating, enhanced food and beverage offerings, and a more robust customer service for individual and group events. The AMF centers are traditional bowling centers in an updated format.
Diverse Product Offerings: We attribute our success to our many competitive strengths and our ongoing efforts to grow and revitalize all aspects of the bowling industry. We are well positioned in the marketplace with our well-located centers, combined with our strong branding and highly loyal customer base. We have made significant investments over the years in upgrading and converting our centers and training our staff to provide our guests with world-class customer experiences. Our gaming operations pioneer in-center gaming, apps and new technology to bring gaming into our centers and beyond our bowling centers. Our food and beverage offerings are a key element to the overall experience at our centers for which we are well positioned for the price, quality and value. Our iconic branding extends to media, as we own, operate and produce all of the content for the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA Tour). As the leader in bowling entertainment, the PBA is a strategic part of our operations, as the PBA has thousands of members and millions of fans across the globe. The PBA is the major sanctioning body for the sport of professional ten-pin bowling in the United States, a membership organization for professional bowlers, and oversees professional bowling tournaments and related broadcasting.
Proven Business Model: Bowlero has a lengthy history since our founding in 1997. For the five-year period from March 29, 2015 to March 29, 2020, which was the last five-year fiscal period which was not affected by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our revenue increased from $544,200 to $657,100. However, when including COVID-19 pandemic-impacted periods, for the five-year period beginning July 1, 2018 and ended July 3, 2022, our revenue increased from $619,100 to $911,705. We remain focused on creating long-term shareholder value by driving organic growth through conversions and upgrading of centers to more upscale entertainment concepts offering a broader range of offerings, as well as through the opening of new centers. Additionally, we have implemented several initiatives, including self-service kiosks, robotic process automation, online reservations and event sales, as well as other technologies to optimize our resources so as to operate with a leaner staffing model, further improving margins and operating cash flows.
A key part of our growth strategy is center acquisitions, as we continually evaluate potential acquisitions that strategically fit within our overall growth strategy. We also have an established blueprint for in-market acquisitions, including entering markets through direct purchases or through leasing arrangements. To that end, we entered into an agreement on May 27, 2021 to acquire Bowl America Incorporated (NYSE American: BWL-A) which operated 17 bowling centers in Florida, Virginia and Maryland. We completed this acquisition on August 16, 2021, as well as a number of other acquisitions in various markets throughout the year as detailed in Note 3 - Business Combinations and Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report in Form 10-K.
Proven Management Team: Our executive management team is well proven and highly experienced with a long track record of driving positive results for increased shareholder value and world-class experiences for our guests. Our founder continues to drive the entrepreneurial culture which underpins our ongoing success. Our management team is committed to constantly improving our world-class company. We also have a team of skilled, loyal and committed managers and other associates at each of our centers. We have developed and maintain as a key initiative the training of our center managers and associates to attract and retain talent, create high-performance center leadership teams and maintain a culture to build upon our inspiring purpose, vision and values.
Our Industry
We operate in the leisure industry, which includes entertainment, restaurants and amusements. The leisure industry is comprised of a large number of venues ranging from small to large, heavily themed destinations. We are the world’s largest owner and operator of bowling centers and we are approximately six times larger than the next largest operator of U.S. based bowling centers. The out-of-home entertainment market includes concepts that are broad family entertainment centers, such as amusement parks, movie theaters, sporting events, sports activity centers and arcades. The addressable market in the United States is estimated to be $4,000,000 (pre-COVID-19 pandemic) for bowling and over $100,000,000 for the out-of-home entertainment. We believe we are well-positioned with our competitive advantages to grow our revenues and profitability, especially in light of the secular shift in consumer spending from products to experiential spending.
COVID-19
We believe our bowling centers provide ideal venues for entertainment, even with the COVID-19 pandemic and its variants, when considering social distancing and other such measures. Our centers are large open buildings with the

structural separation of lanes and ventilation systems, which became apparent with the strong rebound in our business as we were allowed to return to operation after the COVID-19 mandated closures.
E-commerce or online shopping continues to increase and negatively impact consumer traffic at traditional “brick and mortar” retail sites located in regional malls, lifestyle centers, big box shopping centers and entertainment centers. Vacancies have also increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A decline in development or closures of businesses in these settings or a decline in visitors to retail areas near our centers could negatively affect our sales. However, those vacancies can also create opportunities for us to construct new centers on favorable terms. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business are discussed in further detail throughout this Business section, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this report.
Foreign Operations
We currently operate five centers in Mexico and two in Canada. Our Mexican and Canadian centers, combined, represented approximately $8,800 and $1,200 in revenues for the fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively, and have combined net assets of $23,000 and $24,400 as of July 3, 2022 and June 27, 2021, respectively. Our foreign operations are subject to various risks of conducting businesses in foreign countries, including changes in foreign currencies, laws, regulations, and economic and political stability. See “Risk Factors” for more information regarding the risks.
Competition
The out-of-home entertainment industries are highly competitive, with a number of major national and regional chains operating in each of these spaces. In this regard, we compete for customers on the basis of (a) our name recognition; (b) the price, quality, variety and perceived value of our food and entertainment offerings; (c) the quality of our customer service; and (d) the convenience and attractiveness of our facilities. Although there are other concepts that presently utilize the combined family dining and entertainment format, these competitors primarily operate on a regional or market-by-market basis. To a lesser extent, we also compete directly and/or indirectly with other dining and entertainment formats, including full-service and quick-service restaurants appealing to families with young children, the quick service pizza segment, movie theaters, themed amusement attractions and other entertainment facilities.
We believe that our principal competitive strengths consist of the quality, variety and unique nature of our entertainment offerings, our established and well recognized brand, the quality and value of the food and service we provide, the location and attractiveness of our centers and their cleanliness, and the whole family fun we offer our guests.
Intellectual Property
We own various trademarks, used in connection with our business, which have been registered with the appropriate patent and trademark offices. The duration of such trademarks is unlimited, subject to continued use and renewal. To further protect our brand, we have registered internet domain names, including www.bowlero.com. We believe that we hold the necessary rights for protection of the trademarks considered essential to conduct our business. We believe our trade name and our ownership of trademarks are an important competitive advantage, and we actively seek to protect our interests in such property.
Seasonality
Our operating results fluctuate seasonally. We typically generate our highest sales volumes during the third quarter of each fiscal year due to the timing of leagues, holidays and changing weather conditions. School operating schedules, holidays and weather conditions may also affect our sales volumes in some operating regions differently than others. Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for our full fiscal year.
Government Regulation
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting the development and operation of our centers. For a discussion of government regulation risks to our business, see “Risk Factors.”
Human Capital Resources
Environmental, Social, Governance (“ESG”) Oversight
We are committed to advancing a purpose-led vision and fostering a culture that encourages our employees to enhance our business and the communities in which we operate. We endeavor to integrate ESG practices that create 
Index to Financial Statements

sustainable economic value to our employees, stockholders, communities, and other stakeholders. Our dedicated environmental and community stewardship is an integral component of our delivering excellence, driving strategic innovation, and growing long-term stockholder value. We believe that our impact on the environment, how we manage our relationships with employees, suppliers, guests and the communities where we operate, and the accountability of our leadership to our stockholders are all critically important to our business. We have undertaken a number of initiatives to further these goals.
From an environmental perspective, we have implemented and plan to continue to implement policies and practices with the goal of supporting the continued reduction of energy consumption (thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions), water, and waste production across the portfolio. Initiatives we have taken include the installation of solar panels on the roofs of our bowling centers, electric vehicle charging stations in the parking lots of our bowling centers and LED lighting. Additionally, we are continuing to research solar and alternative energy options to further reduce our consumption and carbon footprint. We are committed to maintaining sustainable operations and believe that our long-term sustainability goals will provide positive financial and environmental outcomes for shareholders, associates and the communities in which we invest.
Oversight of Human Capital Management
As of July 3, 2022, we employed approximately 9,390 employees, including approximately 8,938 in the operation of our centers and approximately 452 at the corporate level. We had 2,965 full-time employees and 6,422 part-time employees, of whom 55 were based in Canada and 127 in Mexico. We had 71 employees who are members of a union. We believe that our employee relations are satisfactory, and we have not experienced any work stoppages at any of our centers. Each center typically employs a center General Manager, two operation managers, a facilities manager who oversees the maintenance of the facility and bowling equipment, and approximately 20 to 30 associates to handle food and beverage preparation, customer service and maintenance. Our staffing requirements are seasonal, and the number of people we employ at our stores will fluctuate throughout the year. 
Our reputation for exceptional quality relies on having exceptional people who support our guest-focused mission in our bowling centers, so we ensure that our team is rewarded, engaged and developed to build fulfilling careers. We provide competitive associate wages that are appropriate to employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge and geographic location. In the United States, we offer our associates a wide array of health, and welfare benefits, which we believe are competitive relative to others in our industry. We benchmark our benefits plan annually to ensure our associate value proposition remains competitive and attractive to new talent. In our operations in Canada and Mexico, we offer benefits that may vary from those offered to our U.S. associates due to customary local practices and statutory requirements. In all locations, we provide time off benefits, company-paid holidays, recognition programs and career development opportunities.
Workforce
Diversity, equality, inclusion and belonging are fundamental principles in our culture. We strive to create a workplace where all our associates can thrive and to employ a workforce that represents the communities where we operate and the customers we serve. We are committed to fostering, cultivating, celebrating and preserving a culture of diversity, equality, inclusion and belonging among our associates, customers and suppliers. We embrace our associates’ differences in age, color, disability, ethnicity, family or marital status, gender identity or expression, language, national origin, physical and mental ability, political affiliation, race, religion, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, caste, veteran status, and other characteristics that make our associates unique. Bowlero’s diversity initiatives include, but are not limited to, our practices and policies on recruitment and selection; compensation and benefits; professional development and training; promotions; transfers; social and recreational programs; terminations; and the ongoing development of a work environment that encourages and enforces respectful communication, teamwork, work/life balance and engaging in community efforts that promote a greater understanding and respect for the principles of diversity.
