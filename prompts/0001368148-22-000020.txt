ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
We are a biotechnology company that is focused primarily in the field of regenerative medicine. We are committed to the discovery and development of best-in-class therapies designed to extend and enhance the quality of human life and have established a portfolio of therapeutic product development programs to address significant unmet medical needs in multiple disease areas. Our MultiStem® (invimestrocel) cell therapy, a patented and proprietary allogeneic stem cell product candidate, is our lead platform product and is currently in late-stage clinical development. Our most advanced therapeutic program is focused on the treatment of ischemic stroke, which is currently being evaluated in a potential registrational trial in Japan and a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial ongoing in North America under a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, Europe and certain other international locations. All of our current clinical development programs are focused on treating critical care and other conditions where current standard of care is limited or inadequate for many patients. These represent major areas of clinical need, as well as substantial commercial opportunities.
We believe our MultiStem cell therapy product candidate represents a potential breakthrough in the field of regenerative medicine and stem cell therapy and could be used to treat a range of disease indications. MultiStem treatment has shown the potential to enhance tissue repair and healing in multiple ways, including reducing inflammatory damage, protecting tissue that is at risk following acute or ischemic injury, and promoting formation of new blood vessels in regions of ischemic injury. These cells appear to be responsive to the environment in which they are administered, by homing to sites of injury and/or organs involved in injury response and providing active disease response. These cells also produce proteins that may provide benefit in both acute and chronic conditions and regulate other cell types. In contrast to traditional pharmaceutical products or biologics that generally act through a single biological mechanism of action, MultiStem cell therapy may enhance healing and tissue repair through several distinct mechanisms acting in parallel, resulting in a more effective therapeutic response.
We believe the therapeutic and commercial potential for MultiStem cell therapy to be very broad, applying to many areas of significant unmet medical need, and we are pursuing opportunities in several potential multi-billion dollar markets. While traditional pharmaceuticals and biologic therapies typically may be used to treat only a single disease or a narrowly defined set of related conditions, MultiStem cell therapy may have far broader potential and could be developed in different formulations and with different delivery approaches to effectively treat a wide range of disease indications.
The MultiStem product candidate under development may be unique among regenerative medicine approaches because it has the potential to be manufactured on a large scale, can be administered in an “off-the-shelf” manner with minimal processing, and has the potential to augment healing by providing biological potency and therapeutic effects that other cell therapy approaches may not be able to achieve. Additionally, MultiStem treatment has consistently demonstrated good tolerability in both preclinical and clinical studies. Like conventional drugs and biologics, the product candidate is cleared from the body over time, which we believe may enhance product safety relative to other types of stem cell therapy. While the product candidate does not permanently engraft in the patient, the therapeutic effects of treatment with MultiStem cells appear to be durable based on both clinical and preclinical results.
We have evaluated the use of MultiStem cell therapy as a potential treatment in several disease areas. Working with an international network of leading investigators and prominent research and clinical institutions, and through our own internal efforts, we have explored the potential for MultiStem cell therapy to be used as a treatment of acute and chronic forms of neurological conditions or injury, inflammatory and immune disorders, certain pulmonary conditions and cardiovascular disease. We have advanced several MultiStem programs into clinical development, targeting areas of significant medical need and major commercial market opportunities, and have three ongoing clinical trials in the critical care area. We have a collaboration with HEALIOS K.K., or Healios, to develop and commercialize MultiStem for the treatment of certain indications in Japan. Among other things, Healios has a license to our technology and is responsible for the development and commercialization of MultiStem for ischemic stroke and acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS, in Japan on an exclusive basis. 
Our lead program is our pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the potential for MultiStem treatment of patients who have suffered neurological damage from an ischemic stroke entitled, “MultiStem Administration for Stroke Treatment and Enhanced Recovery Study-2,” or MASTERS-2. The results from our completed Phase 2 study demonstrated favorable tolerability for MultiStem, consistent with the results from prior studies. Though the Phase 2 study did not achieve the primary endpoints for the intent-to-treat population, MultiStem treatment was associated with lower rates of mortality and life-threatening adverse events, infections and pulmonary events, and a reduction in hospitalization and time in the intensive care unit, or ICU. In addition, analyses show that patients who received MultiStem treatment earlier in the study’s treatment window (24 to 36 hours post-stroke, in accordance with the original study protocol) had better recovery in comparison to placebo. Furthermore, analysis of biomarker data obtained from samples of study subjects indicated that MultiStem treatment reduced post-stroke inflammation compared to placebo, and the results suggest that this effect was more pronounced for subjects who received MultiStem earlier within the treatment window. This effect is consistent with our hypothesis regarding mechanisms of action 
and related preclinical data, and with the clinical data suggesting faster and improved recovery for MultiStem-treated patients relative to current standard of care.
The one-year follow-up data from the Phase 2 trial demonstrated that MultiStem-treated subjects on average continued to improve through one year and had a significantly higher rate of “Excellent Outcome,” as defined below, compared to placebo subjects at one year when evaluating all of the intent-to-treat subjects enrolled in the study. Achievement of an Excellent Outcome is important because it means that a patient has substantially improved (i.e., receiving an “Excellent” score in each of the three clinical rating scales used to assess patient improvement) and has regained the ability to live and function independently with a high quality of life. The relative improvement in Excellent Outcome was even more pronounced in the study subjects who received MultiStem treatment within 36 hours of the stroke. If the MultiStem cell therapy candidate is proven effective in our ongoing Phase 3 registrational study, and if it receives a marketing authorization from the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, this treatment window and its favorable administration profile would make this therapy available to most ischemic stroke patients in contrast to other therapies (e.g., tissue plasminogen activator, or tPA, or mechanical thrombectomy), which have shorter treatment windows or are limited to certain patients.
Our MASTERS-2 trial treating ischemic stroke patients is ongoing in the United States and certain other international locations. We received agreement from the FDA under a SPA for the design and planned analysis of MASTERS-2, meaning that the trial is adequately designed to support a Biologic License Application, or BLA, submission for registration if it is successful. The FDA also granted us Fast Track designation for our clinical product for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Fast Track is an important designation given to qualified investigational therapies that show promise in providing benefit to patients in areas of significant unmet medical need. Fast Track designation allows for an expedited regulatory review process after the clinical data is submitted to help speed development of promising therapies to the market in order to help patients in areas where current standard of care is limited. Such designation for a new biologic product means that the FDA will take such actions as are appropriate to expedite the development and review of our application to approve the product, and specifically, under Fast Track designation, the program becomes eligible for rolling submission, accelerated approval and priority review of the BLA, facilitating a timely regulatory review. This program subsequently received the Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy, or RMAT, designation from the FDA that was established under the 21st Century Cures Legislation. The RMAT designation may be obtained for eligible cell therapy and other regenerative medicine and advanced therapies when the FDA agrees that preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the therapy has demonstrated the potential to effectively address unmet medical needs for a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. The RMAT designation is the equivalent of the non-regenerative medicine product’s Breakthrough Therapy designation, and designated products benefit from all Breakthrough Therapy features. The designation enables sponsors to discuss with the FDA multidisciplinary strategic development plans, including expediting manufacturing development plans for commercialization to support priority review and accelerated approval. 
The design of MASTERS-2 has also received a Final Scientific Advice positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, representing the EMA’s agreement that successful results from the trial could result in registration and marketing approval of the MultiStem cell therapy. This positive opinion provides further alignment among the key regulators regarding potential commercialization of the MultiStem product candidate upon success of this single pivotal trial. We believe these designations could accelerate the development, regulatory review and subsequent commercialization of products, like MultiStem cell therapy for ischemic stroke and ARDS, if future clinical evaluation demonstrates appropriate safety and therapeutic effectiveness. 
Enrollment in our MASTERS-2 study is ongoing. In prior periods, we have faced challenges to clinical site initiations, as well as patient screening and enrollment, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and supply interruptions, among other things. As COVID-19 case numbers decline and supply has stabilized, we have undertaken initiatives intended to accelerate new site openings in the U.S. and abroad and increase patient enrollment at sites currently open, including by addressing site-specific operations and inventory management issues. These plans are intended to enable us to finish enrollment of the MASTERS-2 study by the end of 2022 or as soon as possible thereafter; however, completion continues to depend on the impact of the results of Healios’ TREASURE study, discussed below, and the possible resurgence of COVID-19. We would expect, for instance, that favorable TREASURE study results would have a positive effect on site initiations and patient accruals as success drives further interest in and focus on the study among investigators and clinical research groups.
We have also worked closely with Healios to support their development efforts in Japan. In 2016, the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency in Japan, or the PMDA, authorized the Clinical Trial Notification for Healios’ Phase 2/3 trial of MultiStem (referred to in Japan as HLCM051) entitled, “Treatment Evaluation of Acute Stroke for Using in Regenerative Cell Elements,” or TREASURE. This clinical trial is currently ongoing in Japan and patient enrollment was completed in August 2021. In November 2021, Healios announced that, based on the advice of the PMDA to avoid any potential bias to the 365-day data (and related secondary endpoints) that could result from unblinding and disclosure of 90-day data (primary endpoint), the decision was made that the 90-day unblinding, data analysis and release would take place after the 365-day data is locked. This will follow the last patient’s one-year follow-up visit. Healios expects this last patient visit to occur in March of 2022. Japan’s regenerative medicine regulatory framework is designed to enable rapid development of qualified regenerative medicine 
therapies by providing either conditional or full approval of qualified therapies. Under the framework, Healios’ ischemic stroke program has been awarded the Sakigake designation by the PMDA, which is designed to expedite regulatory review and development and is analogous to FAST Track designation from the FDA. 
In January 2019 and January 2020, we announced summary results and one-year follow-up results, respectively, from our exploratory clinical study of the intravenous administration of MultiStem cell therapy to treat patients who are suffering from ARDS, which is referred to as the MUST-ARDS study. ARDS is a serious immunological and inflammatory condition characterized by widespread inflammation in the lungs. ARDS can be triggered by COVID-19, pneumonia, sepsis, trauma or other events, and represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the critical care setting. It has significant implications, as it prolongs ICU and hospital stays and requires convalescence in the hospital and rehabilitation. According to the World Health Organization and other recent clinical and epidemiological data, ARDS is the leading cause of death among COVID-19 infected patients. Given the limited interventions and drug treatments for ARDS, it is an area of high unmet clinical need. Due to the high treatment costs of ARDS, a successful cell therapy could be expected to generate significant savings for the healthcare system by reducing the number of days on a ventilator and in the ICU and importantly, could reduce mortality and improve quality of life for those suffering from the condition. Our exploratory study results provide further confirmation that the MultiStem treatment was well-tolerated, and lower mortality and a greater number of ventilator-free and ICU-free days were observed in the MultiStem-treated patient group compared to the placebo group. Average quality-of-life outcomes observed were higher in the MultiStem group compared to placebo through one year. Our clinical program evaluating MultiStem cell therapy for the treatment of ARDS received Fast Track designation from the FDA in May 2019 and the RMAT designation in September 2020.
Further, in August 2021, Healios reported top-line data from its ONE-BRIDGE study in Japan for patients with pneumonia-induced and COVID-induced ARDS. Healios continues ongoing consultations with the regulatory authorities to prepare for the potential application for manufacturing and marketing approval. We are working with Healios to prepare the regulatory applications for approval and for potential commercialization in Japan. 
We and Healios have conducted thorough analyses of the data from the MUST-ARDS and ONE-BRIDGE studies. The studies had comparable patient populations receiving the same MultiStem dose amount shortly following an ARDS diagnosis. Between the studies, excluding the COVID-ARDS cohort in the ONE-BRIDGE study, 60 ARDS subjects were enrolled in the studies, 40 receiving MultiStem treatment and the remaining 20 receiving placebo or standard of care. On a pooled basis, strong trends were observed in ventilator-free days, or VFD, survival, improved quality-of-life and reduction of key inflammatory biomarkers. For example, MultiStem-treated subjects had, on average, 5.5 more VFD in the first 28 days following diagnosis than non-treated subjects (p=0.07) and, on a median basis, 10.5 more VFD.
In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA authorized the initiation of our MACOVIA study to assess the safety and efficacy of MultiStem therapy in subjects with moderate to severe ARDS induced by COVID-19. The MACOVIA study features an open-label lead-in followed by a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 and 3 portions, and the study is presently designed to enroll up to approximately 400 patients. During 2021, we amended the protocol with the FDA to adjust the scope of the MACOVIA study to include subjects with ARDS from causes other than COVID-19. Recently, we received approval from the FDA to use MultiStem product manufactured with our bioreactor-based technology in the study, an important development milestone. The study is being conducted at leading pulmonary critical care centers throughout the United States. However, the scope and timing of our MACOVIA study may be adjusted to reflect rapidly changing standards of care for ARDS patients and depending on regulatory discussions and business considerations. Currently, we are working to complete enrollment of the Phase 2 part of the MACOVIA trial before the end of 2022. 
Under our collaboration with Healios to develop and commercialize MultiStem for the treatment of certain indications in Japan, Healios has a license to our technology and is responsible for the development and commercialization of MultiStem for certain indications in Japan on an exclusive basis. Healios’ license includes MultiStem cell therapy for ischemic stroke and ARDS in Japan and the use of our technology for Healios’ organ bud program targeted to liver disease and other indications, as well as certain other rights, including a license for the use of our MultiStem product to treat certain ophthalmological indications and a license to treat diseases of the liver, kidney, pancreas and intestinal tissue through administration of our products in combination with cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPSC-derived cells. We have provided manufacturing services and supplied Healios with clinical product for the licensed indications.
We and Healios are preparing for potential commercialization of the MultiStem product candidate, and we are actively preparing the regulatory documents to support a BLA in the United States, Europe and Japan. We are also investing in process development and commercial manufacturing initiatives intended to enable us to supply product to address the large potential critical care markets. We have been developing a bioreactor-based manufacturing platform for such commercialization. In our clinical studies, we are continuing to use cell factory-based material and plan to use bioreactor manufactured product, for which we now have FDA approval for use in our ARDS and trauma clinical trials in the United States. As we continue to prepare for commercialization, we believe that the cell factory-based approach for production is not well suited for serving, on more than a limited basis, large markets or conditions requiring higher dose treatments due to the limited potential for scale-up, relatively 
high costs and the possibility of reliability issues due to the complexity of the cell factory-based manufacturing process. A full transition to bioreactor-based material for the commercial setting will require a demonstration of comparability, which could include the requirement for analytical and in vitro data, some non-clinical studies and possibly data from additional clinical studies. Our commercial product supply strategy envisions both third-party contractor and internal manufacturing to provide redundancy and accelerate capacity development. For our internal manufacturing, in January 2021, we entered into a lease for a building that could potentially be developed into a state-of-the-art, commercial-scale manufacturing facility for our cell therapy product. We are evaluating the building out of the facility in stages as we complete our pivotal clinical trials, and assuming success, submit the required regulatory filings for commercialization.
In April 2020, the FDA authorized the initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating MultiStem cell therapy for the early treatment of traumatic injuries and the subsequent complications that result following severe trauma, and patient enrollment commenced in December 2020. This first-ever study of a cell therapy for treatment for a variety of traumatic injuries is being conducted by The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, or UTHealth, at the Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center in Houston, Texas, one of the busiest Level 1 trauma centers in the United States. This study is being supported under a grant awarded to the McGovern Medical School at UTHealth from the Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium, and the Memorial Hermann Foundation is providing additional funding. We are providing the investigational clinical product for the trial, as well as regulatory and operational support. 
While development of our clinical programs for human health indications remains our priority, based on our research to date and work performed at our Belgian subsidiary, ReGenesys BV, or ReGenesys, we are also evaluating our cell therapy for use in treating disease and conditions in the animal health segment. We have established research and development collaborations and are pursuing commercial partnership opportunities to further develop this program. 
Our development approach has historically involved establishing collaborative relationships with leading research and clinical centers in the United States and internationally. This has enabled us to advance multiple programs in areas of defined unmet medical need in a resource efficient manner. Furthermore, by emphasizing the potential application of our technologies in areas of significant clinical need, we believe we are well positioned to utilize recent regulatory initiatives that are designed to promote the rapid and cost-effective development of innovative new therapies, and actively pursue such initiatives. These include recent programs in the United States and Europe being implemented by the FDA and the EMA involving existing and potentially broadened application of accelerated review and approval pathways, as well as the accelerated Regenerative Medicine regulatory framework in Japan that is designed to enable rapid conditional authorization of qualified regenerative medicine therapies. We believe such initiatives could accelerate the development and commercialization of products like MultiStem cell therapy, if clinical results demonstrate appropriate safety and therapeutic effectiveness. Japan’s regenerative medicine regulatory framework, enacted in 2014, has already resulted in the commercial approval of several cell therapy products developed by other companies that we are aware of, along with coverage and reimbursement of those products, and we and Healios intend to utilize this framework.
In August 2021, we entered into a Comprehensive Framework Agreement for Commercial Manufacturing and Ongoing Support, or the Framework Agreement, with Healios, which better aligns the collaboration structure for potential commercial success in Japan. The Framework Agreement provides Healios, among other things, access to our manufacturing technology to enable Healios to manufacture MultiStem products using a qualified manufacturer, clarifies our role in providing support services to Healios necessary for regulatory approval, manufacturing readiness and commercial launch in Japan, provides for the deferral of certain milestones and royalties to enable Healios to invest in certain manufacturing activities, and expands Healios’ license in Japan to include two new unspecified additional indications under certain conditions. To increase alignment between the companies and create incentives for accelerated execution and investment, the agreement provides for up to $8.0 million in new milestone payments available to us that are tied to certain Japanese commercial manufacturing activities and the establishment of large-scale manufacturing relevant to Japan, and warrants issued to Healios to purchase up to a total of 10,000,000 shares of our common stock, which we refer to as the 2021 Warrants. One of the 2021 Warrants is for the purchase of up to 3,000,000 shares at an exercise price of $1.80 per share, subject to specified increases, and generally is only exercisable within 60 days of receipt of either conditional or full marketing approval from the PMDA for the intravenous administration of MultiStem to treat patients who are suffering from ARDS. The other 2021 Warrant is for the purchase of up to 7,000,000 shares at an exercise price of $2.40 per share, subject to specified increases, and generally is only exercisable within 60 days of receipt of either conditional or full marketing approval from the PMDA for the intravenous administration of MultiStem to treat patients who are suffering from ischemic stroke. The 2021 Warrants may be terminated by us under certain conditions and have an exercise cap triggered at Healios’ ownership of 19.9% of our common stock.
Business Strategy
Our principal business objective is to discover, develop and commercialize novel therapeutic products for disease indications that represent significant areas of clinical need and where we believe there is a substantial commercial opportunity. The key elements of our strategy are outlined below:
•Advance our Lead Programs through Clinical Development to Registration and Commercialization. We are focused on the design and execution of clinical studies, e.g., ischemic stroke, ARDS and trauma, intended to enable product registration in major markets. We are also engaged in activities intended to enable effective commercialization, e.g., preparation for scaled commercial manufacturing, product branding, product reimbursement and marketing strategies. We may partner with other companies to complete such development and preparation activities, and to market the product upon regulatory approval.
•Efficiently Conduct Clinical Development to Establish Clinical Proof-of-Concept and Biological Activity for Other Applications of our Product Candidates. We conduct our clinical studies with the intent to establish safety and efficacy proof-of-concept and/or evidence of biological activity in a number of important disease areas where our cell therapies are expected to have benefit, such as we have done with ARDS. Our strategy is to conduct well-designed studies beginning early in the clinical development process, thus establishing a robust foundation for later-stage development, partnering activity and expansion into complementary areas. We are committed to a rigorous clinical and regulatory approach, which we believe has helped us to advance our programs efficiently, providing high quality, transparent communications and regulatory submissions. Our discussions with the FDA, EMA and PMDA have resulted in productive interactions and important designations that have helped to advance our programs efficiently.
•Continue to Refine and Improve our Manufacturing and Related Processes and Deepen our Understanding of Therapeutic Mechanisms of Action. A key aspect of MultiStem cell therapy is the ex vivo expansion capacity of the cells that comprise the product. This enables large-scale production of the clinical product, which is associated with greater consistency, specificity and cost of goods advantages over other cell therapies. We are building on this intrinsic biological advantage by advancing and optimizing our production and process development approaches, through our internal capabilities and efforts, and working with contract manufacturers. We are focused on development and optimization of new and proprietary manufacturing techniques and the pharmacy-to-bedside approach to support late-stage development and potential commercialization of the MultiStem product. Additionally, we will continue to refine our understanding of our products’ activities and mechanisms of action to prepare the foundation for product enhancements and next generation opportunities.
•Enter into Arrangements with Business Partners to Accelerate Development and Create Value. In addition to our internal development efforts, an important part of our strategy is to work with collaborators and partners to accelerate product development, reduce our development costs and broaden our commercial access. We have entered into licensing and collaborative arrangements with qualified partners to achieve these objectives. We anticipate that this strategy will help us to develop a portfolio of high-quality product development opportunities, enhance our clinical development and commercialization capabilities and increase our ability to generate value from our proprietary technologies. Historically, we have entered into licensing arrangements with companies such as Healios, Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Pfizer Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Johnson & Johnson, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc. (now part of Pfizer), RTI Surgical, Inc. and others. Licensing partnerships generate revenue and provide capital that helps enable us to advance our programs further in development.
•Efficiently Explore New High Potential Therapeutic Applications, Leveraging Third-Party Research Collaborations and our Results from Related Areas. Our MultiStem cell therapy has shown promise in many disease areas, including in treating neurological conditions, inflammatory and immune disorders, certain pulmonary conditions, cardiovascular disease and other conditions where the current standard of care is limited or inadequate for many patients. We are committed to exploring potential clinical indications where our therapies may achieve best-in-class profile and where we believe we can effectively address significant unmet medical needs. In order to achieve this goal, we established collaborative research relationships with investigators from many leading research and clinical institutions across the United States and Europe, including the Cleveland Clinic, Case Western Reserve University, University of Minnesota, the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University, the University of Oregon Health Sciences Center, UTHealth, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, University of Regensburg, and other institutions. Through this network of collaborations, we have evaluated MultiStem cell therapy in a range of preclinical models that reflect various types of human disease or injury. These collaborative relationships have enabled us to cost effectively explore where MultiStem cell therapy may have relevance and how it may be utilized to advance treatment over current standard of care. Additionally, we have shown that we can leverage clinical safety data and preclinical results from some programs to support accelerated clinical development efforts in other areas, saving substantial development time and resources compared to traditional drug development where each program is separately developed.
•Continue to Expand our Intellectual Property Portfolio. We have a broad intellectual property estate that covers our proprietary products and technologies, as well as methods of production and methods of use. Our intellectual property is important to our business and we take significant steps to protect its value. We have ongoing research and development efforts, both through internal activities and through collaborative research activities with others, which aim to develop new technologies, applications and intellectual property and enable us to file patent applications that cover new applications of our existing technologies or product candidates, including MultiStem cell therapy and other opportunities. We currently have over 435 patents related to our technologies, providing protection in the United States, Europe, Japan and other areas.
Our Current Programs
By applying our proprietary MultiStem cell therapy product, we established therapeutic product development programs treating neurological conditions, inflammatory and immune disorders, certain pulmonary conditions, cardiovascular disease and other conditions where the current standard of care is limited or inadequate for many patients. Our lead programs are focused in the critical care area, with treatment provided in hospitals often in intensive care situations. Our programs in clinical development include the following:
• Ischemic Stroke: We are conducting a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of MultiStem cell therapy for the treatment of ischemic stroke, referred to as MASTERS-2. We initiated the study with a limited number of high-enrolling sites and continue to bring on additional sites in line with clinical operations objectives. In prior periods, we have faced challenges to clinical site initiations, as well as patient screening and enrollment, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and supply interruptions, among other things. As COVID-19 case numbers decline and supply has stabilized, we have undertaken initiatives intended to accelerate new site openings in the U.S. and abroad and increase patient enrollment at sites currently open, including by addressing site-specific operations and inventory management issues. These plans are intended to enable us to finish enrollment of the MASTERS-2 study by the end of 2022 or as soon as possible thereafter; however, completion continues to depend on the impact of the results of Healios’ TREASURE study, discussed below, and the possible resurgence of COVID-19. We would expect, for instance, that favorable TREASURE study results would have a positive effect on site initiations and patient accruals as success drives further interest in and focus on the study among investigators and clinical research groups. 
 The MASTERS-2 study has received several regulatory distinctions including SPA, Fast Track and RMAT designations from the FDA, as well as a Final Scientific Advice positive opinion from the EMA, each described further below. We believe these designations could accelerate the development, regulatory review and subsequent commercialization of products like MultiStem cell therapy for ischemic stroke, if future clinical evaluation demonstrates appropriate safety and therapeutic effectiveness.
We received agreement from the FDA under a SPA for the design and planned analysis of our MASTERS-2 pivotal Phase 3 trial. The SPA provides agreement from the FDA that the protocol design, clinical endpoints, planned conduct and statistical analyses encompassed in MASTERS-2 are sufficient to meet the objectives in support of a regulatory submission for approval of the MultiStem product for treating ischemic stroke patients if the trial is successful. The FDA has also granted us Fast Track designation for our clinical product for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Such designation for a new biologic product means that the FDA will take such actions as are appropriate to expedite the development and review of our application to approve the product, and specifically, under Fast Track designation, the program becomes eligible for rolling submission, accelerated approval and priority review of the BLA facilitating a timely regulatory review. The design of MASTERS-2 has also received a Final Scientific Advice positive opinion from the EMA, representing the EMA’s agreement that successful results from the trial could result in registration and marketing approval of the MultiStem cell therapy. This positive opinion provides further alignment among the key regulators regarding potential commercialization of the MultiStem product upon success of this single pivotal trial. We subsequently received RMAT designation from the FDA, which was established under the 21st Century Cures Act. The RMAT designation may be obtained for eligible cell therapy and other regenerative medicine and advanced therapies when the FDA agrees that preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the therapy has demonstrated the potential to effectively address unmet medical needs for a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. The RMAT designation is the equivalent of the non-regenerative medicine product’s Breakthrough Therapy designation, and designated products benefit from all Breakthrough Therapy features. The designation enables sponsors to discuss with the FDA multidisciplinary strategic development plans, including expediting manufacturing development plans for commercialization to support priority review and accelerated approval.
Our MASTERS-2 clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to enroll 300 patients in the United States and certain other international locations who have suffered moderate to moderate-severe ischemic stroke. The enrolled subjects are receiving either a single intravenous dose of MultiStem cell therapy or placebo, administered within 18-36 hours of the occurrence of the stroke, in addition to the standard of care. The 
primary endpoint will evaluate disability using modified Rankin Scale, or mRS, scores at three months, comparing the distribution, or the “shift,” between the MultiStem treatment and placebo groups. The mRS shift analyzes patient improvement across the full disability spectrum, enabling recognition of improvements in disability and differences in mortality and other serious outcomes among strokes of different severities. The study will also assess Excellent Outcome (the achievement of mRS ≤1, NIHSS ≤1, and Barthel Index ≥95) at three months and one year as key secondary endpoints. Additionally, the study will consider other measures of functional recovery, biomarker data and clinical outcomes, including hospitalization, mortality and life-threatening adverse events, and post-stroke complications such as infection.
Healios’ TREASURE study in Japan has been conducted at hospitals in Japan that have extensive experience in providing care for stroke victims and the study was planned for 220 patients. Enrolled subjects received either a single dose of MultiStem or placebo, administered within 18-36 hours of the occurrence of the stroke, in addition to standard of care in these patients, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The study is evaluating patient recovery through approximately 90 days and at one year following initial treatment based on Excellent Outcome and other neurological, functional and clinical endpoints. The trial could lead to registration under Japan’s regenerative medicine regulatory framework, which is designed to enable rapid development of qualified regenerative medicine therapies by providing either conditional or full approval of qualified therapies. Under the framework, Healios’ ischemic stroke program has been awarded the Sakigake designation by the PMDA, which is designed to expedite regulatory review and approval, and is analogous to Fast Track designation from the FDA. Healios has completed enrollment in the TREASURE study. In November 2021, Healios announced that, based on the advice of the PMDA, to avoid any potential bias to the 365-day data (and related secondary endpoints) that could result from unblinding and disclosure of 90-day data (primary endpoint), the decision was made that the 90-day unblinding, data analysis and release would take place after the 365-day data is locked. This will follow the last patient’s one-year follow-up visit. Healios expects this last patient visit to occur in March of 2022. We look forward to completing both the MASTERS-2 and TREASURE trials and using the accelerated pathway afforded to us by the regulators in the United States, Europe and Japan.
• ARDS: In January 2020, we announced one-year follow-up results from our exploratory MUST-ARDS study. The study results provide further confirmation that the MultiStem treatment was well-tolerated and importantly, there were lower mortality and a greater number of ventilator-free and ICU-free days in the MultiStem-treated patient group compared to the placebo group. In 2020, the FDA authorized the MACOVIA study. In May 2019, our clinical program evaluating MultiStem cell therapy for the treatment of ARDS received Fast Track designation from the FDA and in September 2020 received RMAT designation. The MACOVIA study features an open-label lead-in followed by a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 and 3 portions, and the study is currently designed to enroll up to approximately 400 patients at leading pulmonary critical care centers throughout the United States. During 2021, the study was amended to expand enrollment to patients with ARDS induced by pathogens other than COVID-19. Recently, we received approval from the FDA to use MultiStem product manufactured with our bioreactor-based technology in the study, an important development milestone. Further adjustments to the study will depend on regulatory discussions and business considerations. Currently, we are working to complete enrollment of the Phase 2 part of the MACOVIA trial before the end of 2022. 
Further, in 2019, Healios initiated the ONE-BRIDGE study in Japan for patients with pneumonia-induced and COVID-induced ARDS and, in August 2021, Healios reported top-line data from the ONE-BRIDGE study. Healios continues ongoing consultations with the regulatory authorities to prepare for the potential application for manufacturing and marketing approval. We are working with Healios to prepare the regulatory applications for approval and for potential commercialization in Japan.
We and Healios have conducted thorough analyses of the data from the MUST-ARDS and ONE-BRIDGE studies. The studies had comparable patient populations receiving the same MultiStem dose amount shortly following an ARDS diagnosis. Between the studies, excluding the COVID-ARDS cohort in the ONE-BRIDGE study, 60 ARDS subjects were enrolled in the studies, 40 receiving MultiStem treatment and the remaining 20 receiving placebo or standard of care. On a pooled basis, strong trends were observed in VFDs, survival, improved quality-of-life and reduction of key inflammatory biomarkers. For example, MultiStem-treated subjects had, on average, 5.5 more VFD in the first 28 days following diagnosis than non-treated subjects (p=0.07) and, on a median basis, 10.5 more VFD.
• Trauma: In April 2020, the FDA authorized the initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating MultiStem cell therapy for the early treatment of traumatic injuries and the subsequent complications that result following severe traumatic injury, and patient enrollment commenced in December 2020. This first-ever study of a cell therapy for the treatment of a wide range of traumatic injuries is being conducted by UTHealth at the Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center in Houston, Texas, one of the busiest Level 1 trauma centers in the United States. The study is being supported under a grant awarded to the McGovern Medical School at UTHealth from the Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium, 
and the Memorial Hermann Foundation is providing additional funding. We are providing the investigational clinical product for the trial, as well as regulatory and operational support. Enrollment is ongoing. 
While development of our clinical programs for human health indications remains our priority, based on our research to date and work performed at our wholly-owned subsidiary, ReGenesys, we are also evaluating our cell therapy for use in treating diseases and conditions in the animal health area. We have demonstrated in preclinical animal health models that our cell therapy can promote tissue repair and healing that could provide meaningful benefits to animal patients, including those suffering from conditions with unmet medical need. We have established research and development collaborations and are pursuing commercial partnership opportunities to further develop this program. 
While the MultiStem product platform continues to advance, we are engaged in process development initiatives intended to increase manufacturing scale, reduce production costs, and enhance process controls and product quality, among other things. These initiatives are being conducted both internally and outsourced to select contractors, and the related investments are meant to enable us to meet potential commercial demand in the event of eventual regulatory approval. We have been developing a bioreactor-based manufacturing platform for such commercialization. In our clinical studies, we are continuing to use cell factory-based material and plan to use bioreactor manufactured product. In January 2022, we received FDA approval for use of our bioreactor manufactured product in our ARDS and trauma clinical trials in the United States. As we prepare for potential commercialization, we believe that the cell factory-based approach for production is not well suited for serving, on more than a limited basis, large markets or conditions requiring higher dose treatments due to the limited potential for scale-up, relatively high costs and the possibility of reliability issues due to the complexity of the cell factory-based manufacturing process. A full transition to bioreactor-based material for the commercial setting will require a demonstration of comparability, which could include the requirement for analytical and in vitro data, some non-clinical studies and possibly data from additional clinical studies. Until such time as we can manufacture products ourselves in accordance with good manufacturing practices, or GMP, we will continue to rely on third-party manufacturers to make our MultiStem product for clinical trials and eventual commercial sales. 
We have a collaboration with Healios that licenses MultiStem cell therapy for ischemic stroke and ARDS in Japan and the use of our technology for Healios’ organ bud program targeted to liver disease and other indications, as well as certain other rights, including a license for the use of our MultiStem product to treat certain ophthalmological indications and a license to treat diseases of the liver, kidney, pancreas and intestinal tissue through administration of our products in combination with iPSC-derived cells.
We and Healios are preparing for potential commercialization of the MultiStem product candidate, and we are actively preparing the regulatory documents to support a BLA in the United States, Europe and Japan. 
MultiStem Therapy — A Novel Therapeutic Modality
We are developing our MultiStem cell therapy, a proprietary non-embryonic, allogeneic stem cell product candidate, that we believe has potential utility for treating a broad range of diseases and could have widespread application in the field of regenerative medicine. Unlike traditional bone marrow transplants or other stem cell therapies, MultiStem cells may be manufactured on a large scale and may be administered without tissue matching or the need for immune suppression, analogous to type O blood. Potential applications of MultiStem cell therapy include the treatment of critical care indications, neurological conditions, inflammatory and immune disorders, certain pulmonary conditions, cardiovascular disease and other conditions where the current standard of care is limited or inadequate for many patients. We believe that MultiStem cell therapy represents a significant advancement in the field of stem cell therapy. We currently have open Investigational New Drug Applications, or INDs, for the study of MultiStem administration in distinct clinical indications, and several clinical trials are ongoing.
MultiStem cell therapy is a patented biologic product that is manufactured from human stem cells obtained from adult bone marrow, although these cells may alternatively be obtained from other tissue sources. The product consists of a special class of human stem cells that have the ability to express a range of therapeutically relevant proteins and other factors, as well as form multiple cell types. Factors expressed by the cells have the potential to deliver a therapeutic benefit in several ways, such as the reduction of inflammation, regulation of immune system function, protection of damaged or injured tissue, the formation of new blood vessels in regions of ischemic injury and augmentation of tissue repair and healing in other ways. Stability studies have demonstrated that these cells may be stored for an extended period of time in frozen form and are straightforward to prepare and administer, resulting in an “off-the-shelf” profile. Following administration, the cells have been shown to express multiple therapeutically relevant proteins, but unlike a traditional transplant, are subsequently cleared from the body over time, analogous to a drug or other biologics.
We believe that MultiStem represents a potential best-in-class stem cell therapy because it exhibits each of the following characteristics based on research and development conducted to date:
•Broad plasticity and multiple potential mechanisms of action. MultiStem cells have a demonstrated ability in animal models to deliver therapeutic benefit by producing factors that protect tissues against damage and 
inflammation, as well as enhancing or playing a direct role in revascularization or tissue regeneration, and have also shown the capacity to form a range of other cell types.
•Large-scale production. Unlike conventional stem cells, such as blood-forming or HSCs, mesenchymal stem cells or other cell types, MultiStem cells have the potential to be produced on a large scale, processed, and cryogenically preserved, and then used clinically in a rapid and efficient manner. Material obtained from a single donor may be used to produce hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of individual doses, representing a yield far greater than we believe other stem cell technologies have been able to achieve.
•“Off-the-shelf” utility. Unlike traditional bone marrow or HSC transplants that require extensive genetic matching between donor and recipient, MultiStem administration does not require tissue matching or administration of immune suppressive drugs. The MultiStem product is administered as a cryogenically preserved allogeneic product, meaning that these cells are not genetically matched between donor and recipient. This feature, combined with the ability to establish large MultiStem banks, could make it practical for clinicians to efficiently administer this cell therapy to a large number of patients.
•Safety. Certain other stem cell types, such as undifferentiated embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells, have shown the capacity to form ectopic tissue or teratomas, which are tumor-like growths. These could pose serious safety risks to patients. In contrast, MultiStem cells have shown a consistent and favorable tolerability profile that has been compiled over many years of preclinical study in a range of animal models by a variety of investigators and that is supported by clinical data from multiple studies to date.
At each step of the MultiStem production process, cells are analyzed according to pre-established criteria to ensure that a consistent, well-characterized product candidate is produced. Cells are harvested from a prequalified, healthy, consenting donor, and these cells are then expanded to form a master cell bank from which we subsequently produce clinical grade material. We have demonstrated the ability to harvest cells that meet our rigorous criteria from healthy donors with a high degree of consistency. Furthermore, in multiple animal models, MultiStem has been shown to be nonimmunogenic and is administered without the genetic matching that is typically required for conventional bone marrow or stem cell transplantation.
The distinctive profile of the MultiStem product allows us to pursue multiple high value commercial opportunities from a single product platform. Based upon work that we and independent collaborators have conducted over the years, we believe that MultiStem cell therapy has the potential to treat a range of distinct disease indications. As a result, we believe we will be able to leverage our foundation of a consistent tolerability profile and efficacy data to add clinical indications efficiently, enabling us to reduce development costs and timelines substantially.
Health care represents a significant part of the global economy. In the United States, in 2020, health care spending reached $4.1 trillion, or $12,530 per person, and as a share of gross domestic product, health spending accounted for approximately 19.7%, according to the National Health Expenditure Accounts. The United States, along with many other nations, is experiencing an unprecedented demographic shift that is resulting in a significantly expanded population of older individuals. According to United States Census Bureau 2017 National Population Projections, 2035 will be a turning point for demographics in the United States, particularly for the elderly population. By the year 2035, people ages 65 and older are projected to outnumber children for the first time in United States history. By 2035, there will be 78.0 million people 65 years and older compared to 76.7 million under the age of 18 in the United States. The aging of the population will create enormous financial and operational pressure on the healthcare system in the United States and other countries around the world, resulting in significant clinical challenges, but also resulting in substantial commercial opportunities.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, reports that older adults are more likely to experience multiple chronic diseases such as coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, arthritis and kidney disease. As a consequence, as people age they spend far more on healthcare. Additionally, according to the CDC, in the United States, 90% of the $3.8 trillion in annual health care expenditures are for people with chronic and mental health conditions. 
We have worked with independent investigators at many leading institutions to study the impact of MultiStem cell therapy in a range of preclinical models that reflect various types of human disease or injury. To date, we and our collaborators have published research results illustrating the potential benefits of MultiStem cell therapy in a range of indications including ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, or TBI, brain damage due to restricted blood flow in newborns, spinal cord injury, myocardial infarction, vascular disease, acute pulmonary distress, bone marrow transplant support/GvHD, wound healing, organ reperfusion and other indications. 
Based on preclinical results, we have advanced MultiStem cell therapy to clinical development stage in several clinical indications or disease areas, including treatment of ischemic stroke caused by a blockage of blood flow in the brain, ARDS, complications from trauma, damage caused by myocardial infarction, certain complications associated with traditional bone marrow or HSC transplantation, inflammatory bowel disease, initially focused on patients suffering from severe, treatment 
refractory ulcerative colitis and to treat or prevent certain complications associated with solid organ transplant. We highlight priority areas below. We may expand to other clinical indication areas as results warrant and resources permit.
Neurological Injury and Disease — MultiStem for Ischemic Stroke
Another focus of our regenerative medicine program is MultiStem administration for the treatment of neurological injury as a result of acute or chronic conditions. Neurological injury and disease represent an area of significant unmet medical need, a major burden on the healthcare system, and also represents a substantial commercial opportunity.
Many neurological conditions require extensive long-term therapy, and many require extended hospitalization and/or institutional care, creating an enormous quality of life and cost burden. Stroke represents an area where the clinical need is particularly significant, since it represents a leading cause of death and significant long-term disability. We have published research with independent collaborating investigators that demonstrates that MultiStem administration conveys biological benefits in preclinical models of ischemic stroke, as well as other models of neurological damage and injury, including TBI, neonatal hypoxic ischemia (a cause of neurological damage in infants), and spinal cord injury. We also conducted preclinical work in other neurological areas and have been awarded grants from time-to-time in support of this work, including the potential of MultiStem cells to address chronic conditions such as Multiple Sclerosis, or MS, or Parkinson’s disease. Our research has shown that MultiStem cells convey benefits through distinct mechanisms, including reducing inflammatory damage, protecting at risk tissue at the site of injury, and through direct neurotrophic effects that stimulate the recovery of damaged neurons. As a result, we believe that MultiStem cell therapy may have relevance to multiple forms of neurological injury and disease.
Our initial clinical focus in the neurological area involves evaluating MultiStem administration to treat ischemic stroke. According to the CDC, every year, more than 795,000 people in the United States have a stroke and approximately 610,000 of these are first or new strokes. Stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term disability. The vast majority of these (approximately 87%) are ischemic strokes, that are caused by a blockage of blood flow in the brain, that cuts off the supply of oxygen and nutrients, and can result in tissue loss and neurological damage, as well as long-term or permanent disability. 
Even though ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the United States, there has been limited progress toward the development of new treatments that improve the prognosis for stroke victims. The only FDA-approved drug currently available for treating ischemic stroke is the anti-clotting factor, tPA. According to current clinical guidelines, tPA must be administered to stroke patients within several hours after the occurrence of the ischemic stroke to dissolve the clot. Administration of tPA beyond the early treatment window is not recommended, since it can cause cerebral bleeding or even death. Recent advancements in the development of mechanical clot retrievers and extraction devices have also shown benefit to patients, but these devices are limited to certain types of strokes and also in a constrained time window. Because of these limitations, only a small percentage of stroke victims are treated successfully with the currently available therapies—most simply receive supportive or “palliative” care. The long-term costs of stroke are substantial, with many patients requiring extended hospitalization, extended physical therapy or rehabilitation for those patients that are capable of entering such programs, and many require long-term institutional or family care.
In preclinical studies, significant functional improvements have been observed in rodents that have undergone an experimentally-induced stroke, or that have incurred significant neurological damage due to similar types of ischemic events or acute injury, such as a result of neonatal hypoxic ischemia, or TBI, and then received MultiStem treatment. Published research has demonstrated that MultiStem administration even one week after a surgically induced stroke results in substantial long-term therapeutic benefit, as evidenced by the improvement of treated animals compared with controls in a battery of tests examining mobility, strength, fine motor skills, and other aspects of neurological functional improvement. We believe MultiStem treatment conveys significant benefits through several mechanisms, including reduction of inflammation and immune system modulation in the ischemic area, and the protection and rescue of damaged or injured cells, including neuronal tissue. Preclinical research results demonstrated that MultiStem administration 24 hours following a stroke reduced inflammatory damage in the brain and resulted in significant functional improvement, and that some of these results were achieved by reducing the inflammatory response emanating from the spleen in animal models. These results confirmed that MultiStem treatment is well tolerated, does not require immunosuppression and results in a robust and durable therapeutic benefit, and these results are consistent with prior results that show MultiStem can provide significant benefits even when administered up to one week after the initial stroke event, although earlier treatment (e.g., within 24 hours post-stroke) provided more substantial benefits in these preclinical studies.
We completed our first clinical study in ischemic stroke, MASTERS-1, which was a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial exploring the administration of MultiStem to patients that have suffered an ischemic stroke in the United States and Europe. The results of this study demonstrated favorable tolerability for MultiStem, consistent with prior clinical studies in other indications. While the study did not achieve the primary and component secondary endpoints for the intent-to-treat population, the MultiStem treatment was associated with lower rates of mortality and life-threatening adverse events, infections and pulmonary events, and also a reduction in hospitalization. In addition, analyses show that patients who received MultiStem 
treatment earlier in the study’s treatment window (i.e., 24 to 36 hours post-stroke, as specified in the original study protocol) had better recovery in comparison to placebo, and this treatment effect appeared to be more pronounced the earlier the MultiStem administration occurred within this timeframe. Analysis of biomarker data obtained from samples of study subjects indicated that MultiStem treatment reduces post-stroke inflammation compared to placebo. Furthermore, it appears that this effect is more pronounced for subjects receiving MultiStem earlier than 36 hours post-stroke. This effect is consistent with our hypothesis regarding mechanisms of action and related preclinical data, and with the clinical data suggesting faster recovery for MultiStem-treated patients. One-year follow-up data demonstrated that MultiStem-treated subjects on average continued to improve through one-year post-treatment and achieved a significantly higher rate of Excellent Outcome compared to placebo subjects in the intent-to-treat population. We have an ongoing pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, referred to as MASTERS-2, which if successful and if the product is approved for commercialization, could make therapy available to most stroke patients in contrast to other therapies (e.g., tPA), which have substantially shorter treatment windows.
We are also interested in the application of MultiStem for other neurological indications that represent areas of significant unmet medical need, such as TBI, which represents the leading cause of disability among children and young adults, and a leading cause of death. In preclinical studies of TBI, administration of MultiStem dramatically reduced the extent of damage caused by a TBI and promoted accelerated healing of the blood-brain barrier. With grant funding from the National Institutes of Health, we further advanced our MultiStem programs and cell therapy platform, including further development of MultiStem cell therapy for the treatment of TBI and further development of our cell therapy formulations and manufacturing capabilities. 
We are also conducting preclinical work exploring the application of MultiStem treatment in other neurological indications and have presented data at leading scientific conferences that demonstrated that intravenous MultiStem administration one day after spinal cord injury, or SCI, results in statistically significant and sustained improvements in gross locomotor function, fine locomotor function and bladder control compared to control treated animals. We have published findings that showed that MultiStem cell therapy was effective in improving the health and recovery of animals following an acute SCI. Intravenous administration of our cells one day after injury prevented loss of spinal cord tissue, resulting in significant improvement of walking function and urinary control. Further, we also published an article that provides further evidence that our cell therapy has the potential to provide benefit following hypoxic ischemia, an injury caused by oxygen deprivation to the brain before or during birth and a leading cause of cerebral palsy. The article also describes the biological mechanisms through which this cell therapy delivers benefit. These findings are consistent with previous findings in related areas, such as ischemic stroke, and add to the scientific foundation supporting MultiStem cell therapy for the treatment of acute neurological injuries.
We have also used grant funding to investigate the potential for MultiStem treatment for chronic progressive MS based on initial results in preclinical models. Our previous work, supported by Fast Forward and the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, demonstrated the potential benefits of MultiStem cell therapy for treating MS. Using several preclinical animal models that mimic the demyelination associated with MS, researchers observed that MultiStem cell administration results in sustained behavioral improvements, arrests the demyelination process and supports remyelination and repair of affected axons. More recently, we have focused on the mechanisms of action underlying the enhanced remyelination in vivo and in vitro.
Inflammatory and Immunological Disorders — MultiStem for Acute Respiratory Distress, Trauma Complications, HSC Transplant Support and other indications
Inflammatory and immune disorders represent a significant burden to society. There are over 80 recognized autoimmune disorders, which are conditions caused by an acute or chronic imbalance in the immune system. In these conditions, cells of the immune system begin to attack certain tissues or organs in the body, resulting in tissue damage and loss of function. Some inflammatory and immune conditions are associated with age-related conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis), but some are due to other causes that may be genetic, environmental or a combination of both (e.g., Type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease). Still other conditions may reflect complications associated with other diseases or trauma or the treatment of other conditions (e.g., GvHD, a frequent complication associated with transplant procedures used to treat leukemia or related blood-borne cancers). Each of these conditions shares certain biological characteristics, in that the immune system imbalance results from the inappropriate activation of certain populations of immune cells that subsequently results in significant tissue damage and destruction. This immune imbalance may result in a complex cascade of inflammation that can result in pain, progressive tissue deterioration and loss of function. While currently available immunomodulatory drugs have proven to be effective for some patients, they have failed to adequately address the needs of many other patients that suffer from inflammatory and immune disorders.
In both preclinical and clinical studies, MultiStem cells have shown potent immunomodulatory properties, including the ability to reduce active inflammation through various modes of action, stimulate tissue repair and restore immune system balance. Accordingly, we believe that MultiStem cell therapy could have broad application in the area of treating immune system disorders, including certain acute inflammatory conditions, autoimmune diseases and other conditions.
In animal models, MultiStem cells have demonstrated an ability to reduce the severity of pulmonary distress, reduce alveolar edema and return lung endothelial permeability to normal. Intravenous MultiStem treatment early following the onset of the 
condition may ameliorate the initial hyper-inflammation and reduce the fibrotic activity that follows, thereby speeding the return to and improving the likelihood of more normal lung function and helping patient recovery.
ARDS is a serious immunological and inflammatory condition characterized by widespread inflammation in the lungs. ARDS can be triggered by COVID-19, pneumonia, sepsis, or other trauma and represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality in critical care settings. It has significant implications, as it prolongs ICU and hospital stays, and requires convalescence in the hospital and rehabilitation. There are limited interventions and no effective drug treatments for ARDS, making it an area of high unmet clinical need with high treatment costs. Given the high treatment costs of ARDS, a successful cell therapy could be expected to generate significant savings for the healthcare system by reducing days on a ventilator, days in the intensive care unit and total days in the hospital, and could reduce mortality and morbidity, as well as improve quality of life for those suffering from the condition. 
In January 2019 and January 2020, we announced summary results and one-year follow up results, respectively from our exploratory MUST-ARDS clinical study of the intravenous administration of MultiStem cell therapy to treat patients who are suffering from ARDS. The study results provide further confirmation of tolerability associated with MultiStem treatment. Importantly, MultiStem subjects had lower mortality and a greater number of ventilator-free and ICU-free days compared to patients receiving placebo. Furthermore, analysis of initial biomarker data reflects lower levels of inflammatory markers/cytokines following MultiStem treatment, an expected mechanism of action in this patient population.
Further, in 2019, Healios initiated the ONE-BRIDGE study in Japan for patients with pneumonia-induced and COVID-induced ARDS and, in August 2021, Healios reported top-line data from the ONE-BRIDGE study. Healios continues ongoing consultations with the regulatory authorities to prepare for the potential application for manufacturing and marketing approval. We are working with Healios to prepare the regulatory applications for approval and for potential commercialization in Japan.
We and Healios have conducted thorough analyses of the data from the MUST-ARDS and ONE-BRIDGE studies. The studies had comparable patient populations receiving the same MultiStem dose amount shortly following an ARDS diagnosis. Between the studies, excluding the COVID-ARDS cohort in the ONE-BRIDGE study, 60 ARDS subjects were enrolled in the studies, 40 receiving MultiStem treatment and the remaining 20 receiving placebo or standard of care. On a pooled basis, strong trends were observed in VFDs, survival, improved quality-of-life and reduction of key inflammatory biomarkers. For example, MultiStem-treated subjects had, on average, 5.5 more VFD in the first 28 days following diagnosis than non-treated subjects (p=0.07) and, on a median basis, 10.5 more VFD.
Our research and others’ research suggest that the activation of an acute hyperinflammatory response involving the peripheral immune system is a conserved biological response that occurs across multiple forms of trauma. For example, a common complication among trauma victims is Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome, which can contribute to or play a causative role in impaired organ system function, organ failure, or even multi-organ failure. We believe MultiStem can help address this systemic inflammatory response and its complications, and promote better recovery following trauma. In April 2020, the FDA authorized the initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating MultiStem cell therapy for the early treatment of traumatic injuries and the subsequent complications that result following severe trauma. This first-ever study of a cell therapy for treatment for a variety of traumatic injuries is being conducted by UTHealth at the Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center in Houston, Texas, one of the busiest Level 1 trauma centers in the United States. This study is being supported under a grant awarded to the McGovern Medical School at UTHealth from the Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium, and the Memorial Hermann Foundation is providing additional funding. The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial estimated to enroll approximately 150 severely injured trauma patients within hours of hospitalization who have survived initial treatment and are admitted to the ICU. We are providing the investigational clinical product for the trial, as well as regulatory and operational support. Enrollment commenced in December 2020 and is ongoing. 
Another area of focus is the use of MultiStem cell therapy as adjunctive treatment for HSC/bone marrow transplant used as therapy in hematologic malignancy. For many types of cancer, such as leukemia or other blood-borne cancers, treatment typically involves radiation therapy or chemotherapy, alone or in combination. Such treatment can substantially deplete the cells of the blood and immune system, by reducing the number of stem cells in the bone marrow from which they arise. The more intense the radiation treatment or chemotherapy, the more severe the resulting depletion is of the bone marrow, blood and immune system. Other tissues may also be affected, such as cells in the digestive tract and in the pulmonary system. The result may be severe anemia, immunodeficiency, substantial reduction in digestive capacity, and other problems that may result in significant disability or death.
One strategy for treating the depletion of bone marrow is to perform a peripheral blood stem cell transplant or a bone marrow transplant. This approach may augment the patient’s ability to form new blood and immune cells and provide a significant survival advantage. However, finding a closely matched donor is frequently difficult or even impossible. Even when such a donor is found, in many cases there are immunological complications, such as GvHD, which may result in serious disability or death.
Working with leading experts in the stem cell and bone marrow transplantation field, we studied MultiStem in animal models of radiation therapy and GvHD. In multiple animal models, MultiStem cells have been shown to be non-immunogenic, even when administered without the genetic matching that is typically required for conventional bone marrow or stem cell transplantation. Furthermore, in animal model systems testing immune reactivity of T-cells against unrelated donor tissue, MultiStem has been shown to suppress the T-cell-mediated immune responses that are an important factor in causing GvHD. MultiStem-treated animals also displayed a significant increase in survival relative to controls. As a result, we believe that MultiStem administration in conjunction with or following standard HSC transplantation may have the potential to reduce the incidence or severity of complications and may enhance gastrointestinal function, which is frequently compromised as a result of radiation treatment or chemotherapy.
We completed a Phase 1 clinical trial examining the safety and tolerability of a single dose or repeat dosing of MultiStem cells administered intravenously to patients receiving a bone marrow or HSC transplant as part of their treatment of leukemia or other hematological condition. The trial was an open-label, multicenter trial that involved leading experts in the field of bone marrow transplantation. We observed a consistent favorable tolerability profile in both the single and multiple dose arms of the study, and at all dose levels tested. Although the trial was not specifically designed to demonstrate efficacy, we also observed clinically meaningful improvement in medically important parameters relative to historical clinical experience, including reduced incidence and severity of acute GvHD, improved relapse free survival, no graft failures and enhanced engraftment rates relative to other forms of treatment.
We were granted orphan drug designation by the FDA and the EMA for MultiStem treatment in the prevention of GvHD, and the MultiStem product was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA for prophylaxis therapy against GvHD following HSC transplantation. Subsequently, our registration study design received a positive opinion from the EMA through the Protocol Assessment/Scientific Advice procedure. Furthermore, the proposed registration study received SPA designation from the FDA, meaning that the trial is adequately designed to support a BLA submission for registration if it is successful.
Other Programs
Animal Health Care
While development of our clinical programs for human health indications remains our priority, based on our research to date and work performed at our Belgian subsidiary, ReGenesys, we have demonstrated in preclinical animal health models that MultiStem cell therapy can promote tissue repair and healing that could provide meaningful benefits to animal patients, including those suffering from serious conditions with unmet medical needs. According to Global Market Insights, the global animal healthcare market for the forecast period 2021 to 2027 is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 4.7% during this period and is estimated to be valued at approximately $190.0 billion in 2027. We have established research and development collaborations and are pursuing commercial partnership opportunities to further develop this program. 
Collaborations and Partnerships
Healios
We have entered into a series of agreements with Healios, our collaborator in Japan and currently our largest stockholder. Under the collaboration that began in 2016, Healios is responsible for the development and commercialization of the MultiStem product for the licensed fields in the licensed territories, and we provide support and other services to Healios, including preparations for commercial supply in Japan and the transfer of technology to a Japanese contract manufacturer. 
In 2016, we entered into a license agreement, or First License Agreement, with Healios to develop and commercialize MultiStem cell therapy for ischemic stroke in Japan and to provide Healios with access to our proprietary Multipotent Adult Progenitor Cell, or MAPC, technology for use in Healios’ organ bud program worldwide, initially for transplantation to treat liver disease or dysfunction. Under the First License Agreement, Healios also obtained a right to expand the scope of the collaboration, and Healios exercised this right in 2018 when we entered into the Collaboration Expansion Agreement, or CEA. Through the CEA, Healios (i) expanded its First License Agreement to include ARDS in Japan and expanded the organ bud license to include additional transplantation indications covered under Healios organ bud technology; (ii) obtained a worldwide exclusive license, or the Ophthalmology License Agreement, for use of MultiStem product to treat certain ophthalmological indications; (iii) obtained an exclusive license in Japan, or the Combination Product License Agreement, for use of the MultiStem product to treat diseases of the liver, kidney, pancreas and intestinal tissue through local administration of MultiStem cell therapy in combination with iPSC-derived cells; (iv) obtained an exclusive, time-limited right of first negotiation, or ROFN Period, to enter into an option for a license to develop and commercialize certain MultiStem treatments in China, which expired in June 2019; and (v) certain other rights, including an option for an additional non-therapeutic technology license, which also expired. For all indications, Healios is responsible for the costs of clinical development in its licensed territories, and we provide manufacturing services to Healios. 
Each license agreement with Healios has defined economic terms. Under the First License Agreement that related primarily to the license to ischemic stroke in Japan, we received a nonrefundable, up-front cash payment of $15.0 million, and upon the inclusion of the ARDS field in Japan, we received a nonrefundable, up-front cash payment of $10.0 million. For the additional rights granted to Healios under the CEA, including the Ophthalmology License Agreement and the Combination Product License Agreement, Healios paid us an additional nonrefundable, up-front payment of $10.0 million, which was paid in four quarterly installment payments of $2.5 million. Healios may elect to credit up to $10.0 million against milestone payments that may become due under the First License Agreement, as expanded to include ARDS, with limitations on amounts that may be credited to earlier milestone payments versus later milestone payments.
For each of the ischemic stroke indication and the ARDS indication, we may receive aggregate success-based regulatory filing and approval milestones up to $50.0 million and potential sales milestones up to $175.0 million, amounting to $225.0 million for each indication (or $450.0 million in aggregate), subject to potential milestone credits. On August 5, 2021, we entered into the Framework Agreement with Healios that provides for resolution of certain issues under the existing agreements between the parties and improves the collaboration structure to set the stage for productive efforts as Healios moves closer to potential commercialization of MultiStem in Japan. The Framework Agreement provides for the deferral of certain of the milestones payments during the expensive commercial launch period. For each of the ischemic stroke indication and the ARDS indication, we are entitled to receive tiered royalties on product sales, starting in the low double digits and increasing incrementally into the high teens or potentially higher depending on net sales levels and other factors. The Framework Agreement also provides for the deferral of certain of the tiered royalty payments. Under the Framework Agreement, we are entitled to new milestone payments in the amount of $3.0 million by June 2022 and $5.0 million upon completion of certain commercial manufacturing activities. 
The Ophthalmology License Agreement granted Healios worldwide, exclusive rights to treat certain ophthalmological diseases, by using either MultiStem cell therapy on a standalone basis or MultiStem in combination with retinal pigment epithelium cells derived from either iPSC or embryonic stem cells. For the standalone products, we will be entitled to receive success-based regulatory filing and approval milestones aggregating up to $48.1 million, potential sales milestones of up to $87.5 million, and tiered royalties on product sales in the single digits depending on net sales levels. For the combination ophthalmology products, we are entitled to receive a low single-digit royalty, but no milestone payments.
The Combination Product License Agreement granted Healios exclusive rights in Japan to treat diseases of the liver, kidney, pancreas and intestinal tissue through local administration of MultiStem cell therapy in combination with iPSC-derived cells through certain delivery methods. We are entitled to receive a low single-digit royalty on net sales of the combination product treatments, but no milestone payments. 
For the organ bud product, we are entitled to receive a fractional royalty on net sales of the organ bud products. For all indications covered by the Healios organ bud technology that utilize our technology, we may receive payments for manufactured product supplied to Healios under a manufacturing supply agreement. Additionally, we have a right of first negotiation for commercialization of an organ bud product in North America, with such right expiring on the later of (i) the date five years from the effective date of the First License Agreement and (ii) 30 days after authorization to initiate clinical studies on an organ bud product under the first investigational new drug application or equivalent in Japan, North America or the European Union, or EU.
In 2018, Healios purchased 12,000,000 shares of our common stock and the 2018 Warrant to purchase up to 20,000,000 additional shares of common stock for $21.1 million, or approximately $1.76 per share. Based upon the expiration of the ROFN Period at June 30, 2019, the 2018 Warrant was no longer exercisable for up to 16,000,000 warrant shares. In March 2020, Healios exercised the remaining warrant shares, and we issued 4,000,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price equal to the reference price of $1.76 as defined in the 2018 Warrant. Proceeds of approximately $7.0 million were received in April 2020 in accordance with the terms of the 2018 Warrant. In connection with the Framework Agreement, we issued two warrants, or the 2021 Warrants, to Healios to purchase up to a total of 10,000,000 shares of our common stock. One of the 2021 Warrants is for the purchase of up to 3,000,000 shares at an exercise price of $1.80 per share, subject to specified increases, and generally is only exercisable within 60 days of receipt of either conditional or full marketing approval from the PMDA for the intravenous administration of MultiStem to treat patients who are suffering from ARDS. The other 2021 Warrant is for the purchase of up to 7,000,000 shares at an exercise price of $2.40 per share, subject to specified increases, and generally is only exercisable within 60 days of receipt of either conditional or full marketing approval from the PMDA for the intravenous administration of MultiStem to treat patients who are suffering from ischemic stroke. 
In 2017, we signed a clinical trial supply agreement for delivering the planned manufacturing services for Healios’ clinical trial in Japan treating ischemic stroke patients, which was amended in 2018 to also include the clinical trial supply for Healios’ clinical trial treating ARDS patients. The agreement includes a cost-sharing arrangement associated with our supply of clinical product for Healios’ TREASURE study in Japan, including Healios’ right to apply cost-share payments as a credit against certain milestone payments that may become due for the stroke indication under the First License Agreement, and if so applied, 
a stroke sales milestone would be increased, as defined. Alternatively, such cost-share payments may be repaid by us at our election. We successfully delivered all product required by Healios to complete the TREASURE and ONE-BRIDGE studies in 2019. 
Also in 2017, we entered into a technology transfer services agreement with Healios, in which Healios provides financial support to establish a contract manufacturer in Japan to manufacture product for Healios. At that time, we also amended the First License Agreement to confer to Healios a limited license to manufacture MultiStem in the event that we are acquired by a third-party. 
The First License Agreement will expire automatically when there are no remaining intellectual property rights subject to the license. Additionally, Healios may terminate the First License Agreement under certain circumstances, including for material breach and without cause upon advance written notice. We may terminate the First License Agreement if there is an uncured material breach of the agreement by Healios. Following the expiration or termination of the First License Agreement, Healios shall pay reduced royalties for continued use of our trademarks. 
Following termination of the First License Agreement, the licenses granted to Healios to develop and commercialize MultiStem in Japan for ischemic stroke and for ARDS will terminate. Healios will transfer ownership to us of its documents related to the product, the field and the Japan territory, such as regulatory filings, correspondence, approvals and documents; investigator brochures clinical data; and information related to the product. Further, the nonexclusive license to intellectual property developed by Healios during the collaboration shall survive termination and become our confidential information. 
The Ophthalmology License Agreement and Combination Product License Agreement will expire with respect to each licensed product in each country upon the latest of four events: (i) expiration of our applicable pre-existing patents, (ii) expiration of our applicable patents filed after the effective date, (iii) loss of all data or other regulatory exclusivity, and (iv) 10 years after first commercial sale. Each agreement may expire earlier for products in territories upon certain defined conditions related to the availability of alternative products. Each agreement would terminate in its entirety when all such product terms for each territory have expired. After expiration of a product in a territory, or the agreement as a whole, Healios’ licenses remain in effect and Healios remains obligated to pay royalties at a reduced rate, and for a limited time, at which time the exclusive nature of the licenses convert to non-exclusive. Additionally, Healios may terminate the agreements under certain circumstances, including for material breach and without cause upon advance written notice (in which case Healios’ licenses do not survive). We may terminate either of these agreements if there is an uncured material breach of an agreement by Healios (in which case Healios’ licenses would not survive).
University of Minnesota
In 2003, we acquired the exclusive rights to the MAPC technology originally developed at the University of Minnesota pursuant to a license agreement with the University. We subsequently further developed this technology, including refining and establishing proprietary methods related to the manufacturing of the cells, creating new intellectual property and patents outside of the license. We are obligated to pay the University of Minnesota a royalty based on worldwide commercial sales of licensed products if covered by a valid licensed patent, as well as sublicensing fees and fees related to manufactured product proceeds, as defined. The low single-digit royalty and sublicense fee rate may be reduced if third-party payments for intellectual property rights are necessary or commercially desirable to permit the manufacture or sale of the product. The royalty payment obligation and the term of the license agreement expire upon the last to expire licensed patent. Based on our current patent portfolio, and absent any continuations, renewals or extensions of existing patents, the last licensed patent to expire under this license agreement is currently expected to expire in 2036. The license agreement does not have a specific termination date, but the University of Minnesota can terminate the license agreement for an uncured event of default, as defined, or upon our bankruptcy and we can terminate the license agreement at any time.
Manufacturing
We work with third parties to manufacture our MultiStem product candidates in accordance with GMP, and until such time as we are able to manufacture products ourselves in accordance with GMP, we will rely on such third-party manufacturers to make our MultiStem product for clinical trials and eventual commercial sales. These third parties may not deliver sufficient quantities of our MultiStem product, manufacture MultiStem product in accordance with specifications, or maintain compliance with applicable government regulations. From time to time, such third-party manufacturers, or their material suppliers, may be subject to inspection by the FDA or other regulators, which under certain circumstances could result in production stoppages and interruptions in supply, affecting the initiation, execution and timing of completion of clinical trials and commercial activities. Furthermore, material supply constraints could result in production delays. We attempt to mitigate risk to our product supply by careful planning of our production and raw material requirements with sufficient lead times for ramp-up by third-party manufacturers. Additionally, we work with and qualify other third-party manufacturers to provide alternative manufacturing capacity, if needed, due to delays or interruptions in supply, but such alternative manufacturers may be subject to similar constraints or issues.
We are also investing in process development initiatives intended to increase manufacturing scale, reduce production costs, and enhance process controls and product quality, among other things. These initiatives are being conducted both internally and outsourced to select contractors, and the related investments are meant to enable us to meet potential commercial demand in the event of regulatory approval. We are continuing to develop a bioreactor-based manufacturing platform for such commercialization. In our clinical studies, we are continuing to use cell factory-based material and plan to use bioreactor manufactured product, for which we now have FDA approval for use in our ARDS and trauma clinical trials in the United States. As we continue to prepare for commercialization, we believe that the cell factory-based approach for production is not well suited for serving, on more than a limited basis, large markets or conditions requiring higher dose treatments due to the limited potential for scale-up, relatively high costs and the possibility of reliability issues due to the complexity of the cell factory-based manufacturing process. A full transition to bioreactor-based material for the commercial setting will require a demonstration of comparability, which could include the requirement for analytical and in vitro data, some non-clinical studies and possibly data from additional clinical studies. In January 2021, we entered into a lease for a building that could potentially be developed into a state-of-the-art, commercial-scale manufacturing facility for our cell therapy product. We are considering the feasibility of building out the facility in stages as we complete our pivotal clinical trials, and assuming success, submit the required regulatory filings for commercialization. We believe that we have ownership, control and access to the technologies and intellectual properties that would enable us, or our contract manufacturing partners, to manufacture product needed to serve the indications targeted by our therapy. 
Competition
We face significant competition with respect to the various dimensions of our business. With regard to our efforts to develop MultiStem as a novel stem cell therapy, currently, there are a number of companies that are actively developing stem cell products, which encompass a range of different cell types, including embryonic stem cells, umbilical cord stem cells, adult-derived stem cells and processed bone marrow derived cells.
Mesoblast Limited, or Mesoblast, is currently engaged in clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of Revascor, an allogeneic stem cell product based on mesenchymal stem cell precursors that are obtained from healthy consenting donors. These cells also appear to display limited expansion potential and biological plasticity. Additionally, Mesoblast is developing Remestemcel-L, a mesenchymal stem cell product candidate.
Other public companies are or may be developing stem-related therapies, including SanBio, Vericel Corporation, Caladrius Biosciences, Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Cryo-Cell International, Inc., Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics, Inc., ReNeuron Group plc, Cynata Therapeutics Limited, Gamida Cell Ltd. and Pluristem Therapeutics, Inc. In addition, private companies, such as Plureon Corporation and others, are also developing cell therapy related products or capabilities. Given the magnitude of the potential opportunity for stem cell therapy, we expect competition in this area to intensify in the coming years. In addition, our other earlier-stage programs may face competition, including from larger pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.
Many of our competitors may have substantially greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, and human resources than we do. These companies may succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for competitive products more rapidly than we can for our products. In addition, our competitors may develop technologies and products that are cheaper, safer or more effective than those being developed by us or that would render our technology obsolete. Furthermore, some of these companies may feel threatened by our activities and attempt to delay or impede our efforts to develop our products or apply our technologies.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent applications, patents, trademarks, and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. We believe that to have a competitive advantage, we must develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technologies. Currently, we require our officers, employees, consultants, contractors, manufacturers, outside scientific collaborators and sponsored researchers, and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment, consulting, manufacturing or advisory relationships with us, where appropriate. We also require our employees, consultants, and advisors that we expect to work on our products to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived during the workday, developed using our property, or which relate to our business. We currently have over 435 patents for our technologies.
We have a broad patent estate with claims directed to compositions, methods of production, and methods of use of certain non-embryonic stem cells and related technologies. We developed, acquired and exclusively licensed intellectual property covering our cell therapy product candidates and other applications in the field. Our broad intellectual property portfolio consists of over 410 issued patents and more than 140 global patent applications around our stem cell technology and MultiStem product platform. This includes 38 United States patents and more than 375 international patents that apply to MAPC and related products, such as MultiStem. The current intellectual property estate, which incorporates additional filings and may broaden over time, could provide coverage for our stem cell product candidates, manufacturing processes and methods of use through 2036 and beyond. Furthermore, an extended period of market exclusivity may apply for certain products (e.g., exclusivity periods for orphan drug designation or biologics).
We also have an intellectual property portfolio related to our small molecule product candidates, functional genomics and other technologies, with 24 global patents with claims directed to compositions, methods of making, and methods of using our candidates and technologies, among other claims.
We have been active in the development, improvement and protection of our intellectual property portfolio through our prosecution efforts, collaborative research efforts, and in-licensing, among other things. From time-to-time, we will also engage in adversarial processes, such as interference or litigation, to protect or advance certain patents or applications. These activities represent an important cost of doing business and can result in successes and setbacks due to the nature of the processes. Over time, we expect to be involved in similar proceedings with the objective of developing the portfolio to support and protect development and commercialization of our or our licensees’ cell therapy products.
We believe that we have broad freedom to use and commercially develop our technologies and product candidates. However, in the event that we or our collaborators are developing, manufacturing, or selling potential products that are claimed to infringe a third party’s intellectual property, a loss in litigation may prevent us from commercializing our products, unless that party grants us rights to use its intellectual property. Further, we may not be able to obtain any licenses required under any patents or proprietary rights of third parties on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we were able to obtain rights to the third party’s intellectual property, these rights may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we may be unable to commercialize some of our potential products or may have to cease some of our business operations as a result of patent infringement claims, which could severely harm our business.
Research and Development
Our research and development costs, which consist primarily of costs associated with clinical trials, preclinical research, product manufacturing and process development for manufacturing, salaries and related personnel costs, legal expenses resulting from intellectual property application and maintenance processes, and laboratory supply and reagent costs, were $71.1 million in 2021, $63.0 million in 2020 and $39.0 million in 2019. The increase in research and development costs in 2021 related primarily to the clinical trials underway and increased manufacturing and process development activities.
Government Regulation
Our research and development activities, and any products we may develop, are subject to stringent government regulation in the United States by the FDA and, in many instances, by corresponding foreign and state regulatory agencies. The European Union, or EU, has vested centralized authority in the EMA and Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, to standardize review and approval across EU member nations. In Japan, PDMA, a division of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, or MHLW, regulates the development and commercialization of medical therapies. Recently, Japan’s parliament enacted new legislation to promote the safe and accelerated development of treatments using stem cells. The new regenerative medicine law and revised pharmaceutical affairs law define products containing stem cells as regenerative medicine products and allow for the conditional approval of such products if safety has been confirmed in clinical trials, even if their efficacy has not been fully demonstrated. The legislation creates a new, faster pathway for cell therapy product approval, and offers the potential to enable more rapid entry in the Japanese market. The MHLW has been directed to develop and adopt new rules and procedures to implement this legislation.
These regulatory agencies enforce comprehensive statutes, regulations and guidelines governing the drug development process. This process involves several steps. Initially, a company must generate preclinical data to show safety and potential efficacy before human testing may be initiated. In the United States, for example, a drug company must submit an IND application to the FDA prior to securing authorization for human testing. The IND must contain adequate data on product candidate chemistry, manufacturing and control, safety, toxicology, metabolism and, where appropriate, animal research testing to support potential initial effectiveness.
Any of our product candidates will require regulatory approval and compliance with regulations made by United States and foreign government agencies prior to commercialization in such countries. The process of obtaining FDA or foreign regulatory agency approval has historically been extremely costly and time consuming. The FDA and equivalent foreign regulatory authorities (such as EMA or PMDA) regulate, among other things, the development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, safety, efficacy, record keeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of biologics and drugs.
The standard process required by the FDA before a pharmaceutical agent may be marketed in the United States includes:
•preclinical tests in animals that demonstrate a reasonable likelihood of safety and effectiveness (if possible) in human patients;
•submission to the FDA of an IND, which must be approved before clinical trials in humans can commence. If Phase 1 clinical trials are to be conducted initially outside the United States, a different regulatory filing such as a clinical trial application is required, depending on the location of the trial;
•adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug or biologic product for the intended disease indication;
•for drugs (including biologics), submission of a New Drug Application, or NDA, for new small molecules, and of a BLA, for biologics, with the FDA; and
•FDA approval of the NDA or BLA before any commercial sale or shipment of the drug.
Preclinical studies can take several years to complete, and there is no guarantee that an IND based on those studies will become effective to permit clinical trials to begin. The clinical development phase generally takes ten to fifteen years, or longer, to complete (i.e., from the initiation of Phase 1 through completion of Phase 3 studies), and such sequential studies may overlap or be combined. After successful completion of clinical trials for a new drug or biologic product, FDA approval of the NDA or BLA must be obtained. This process requires substantial time and effort and there is no assurance that the FDA will accept the NDA or BLA for filing and, even if filed, that the FDA will grant approval. In the past, the FDA’s approval of an NDA or BLA has taken, on average, one to two years, but in some instances may take substantially longer. If questions regarding safety or efficacy arise, additional studies may be required, followed by a resubmission of the NDA or BLA. Review and approval of an NDA or BLA can take up to several years. The FDA and other regulatory agencies such as the EMA and the PMDA have regulations that allow for faster or expedited approval paths and review cycles that may reduce clinical development phase completion to between five and seven years to commercialization. Such regulations include but are not limited to special expedited paths and designations such as Fast Track (FDA), Break Through (FDA), RMAT (FDA), Prime (EMA), Accelerated (FDA)/Conditional (EMA), Sakigake (PMDA), which provide approval paths and review cycles of between six to ten months. However, there are specific criteria that must be met to qualify for these paths, such as the indication being a serious condition, with limited or no treatment options, and a high unmet medical need, or in addition is an orphan indication (FDA/EMA/PMDA), or qualified under, exceptional circumstances (EMA) or Sakigake designation (Japan).
In addition to obtaining FDA approval for each product being sold in the United States, each drug manufacturing facility must be inspected and approved by the FDA. All manufacturing establishments are subject to inspections by the FDA and by other federal, state, and local agencies, and must comply with GMP requirements. We do not currently have any GMP manufacturing capabilities and rely on contract manufacturers to produce material for any clinical trials that we conduct.
We must also obtain regulatory approval in other countries in which we intend to market any drug. The requirements governing conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. FDA approval does not ensure regulatory approval in other countries. The current approval process varies from country to country, and the time spent in gaining approval varies from that required for FDA approval. In some countries, the sale price of the drug must also be approved. The pricing review period often begins after market approval is granted. Even if a foreign regulatory authority approves a drug product, it may not approve satisfactory prices for the product.
In addition to regulations enforced by the FDA and international regulatory agencies, we are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and other present and potential future federal, state, or local regulations. Our research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, biological materials, and various radioactive compounds. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials currently comply in all material respects with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our available resources.
Human Capital Resources 
We believe that our success will be based on, among other things, the quality of our clinical programs, our ability to invent and develop superior and innovative technologies and products, and our ability to develop, attract and retain talented employees. We have assembled an exceptional team of individuals in all functional areas and levels of the business with significant experience across a number of industries, including biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. We welcomed 19 new employees in 2021, several of them in key leadership positions. We hired in the areas of process development, research, manufacturing, operations and supply chain, regulatory affairs and other administrative functions. 
As of December 31, 2021, we employed 104 full-time employees, including 16 with Ph.D. degrees. Our workforce is approximately 64% diverse by race, ethnicity or gender. We offer a competitive total reward program which consists of base salary, incentive cash bonus potential, a comprehensive health benefit package, paid time off, 401(k) retirement plan participation and equity compensation for all full-time employees. We also utilize the service and support of outside consultants and advisors. We annually evaluate the consistency and competitiveness of our compensation and benefits programs that serve to attract, retain, motivate and reward employees. We sustain our cultural engagement and performance by actively seeking and responding to employee feedback, measuring performance, recognizing employee achievements and identifying areas of 
development and professional growth. None of our employees are represented by a union, and we believe we have positive and engaging relationships with our employees.
Health, Safety and Wellness
We are committed to the health and safety of our employees. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of health, wellness and other benefit programs that support physical, mental and financial well-being. We maintain a disciplined safety program and all of our employees must comply with annual safety training.
Response to COVID-19
Our focus has been to ensure a safe work environment for our employees in alignment with government and health authority COVID-19 policies and recommendations. We will continue to monitor the CDC guidance and will adjust our policies and practices as necessary.
