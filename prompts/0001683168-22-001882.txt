ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are an all-electric, off-road powersports vehicle company developing and building electric two and four-wheel motorcycles and utility terrain vehicles (UTVs), also known as side-by-sides, along with a complete line of upgrades and accessories. In October 2020, we began building and testing prototypes for our future offerings with two off-road motorcycles – the Grunt and the Runt. Our motorcycles feature unique frame designs protected by design patents. Additional utility and design patents have been filed for other aspects of Volcon’s vehicles.
 
We initially began to sell and distribute the Grunt and related accessories in the U.S. on a direct-to-consumer sales platform. We terminated our direct-to-consumer sales platform in November 2021. Prior to the termination of our direct-to-consumer sales platform, U.S. customers made deposits for 360 Grunts (net of cancellations), plus accessories and a delivery fee representing total deposits of $2.2 million. These orders are cancelable by the customer until the vehicle is delivered and after a 14-day acceptance period, therefore the deposits have been recorded as deferred revenue. Based on our current production capacity, we believe we will deliver all the Grunts that have previously been ordered by customers during the early part of the second quarter of 2022. Due to delays in developing the Runt, we refunded the deposits made for all Runts that were previously ordered by customers.
 
We are continuing to evaluate development on the Runt including the selection of a supplier, and whether we can produce the Runt at a cost that meets our profit targets. If we cannot produce the Runt at an acceptable profit margin, we will cease development efforts on this product. We expect to determine in the first half of 2022 whether we will finalize the development, production and sale of the Runt.
 
Also in 2022, we expect to expand our offerings with the introduction of the Volcon Stag UTV, which we anticipate will be available for delivery in the second half of 2023, followed by the introduction of a higher performance, longer range UTV (to be named) which we expect to begin delivering in 2024.
 
Beginning in November 2021, we began negotiating dealership agreements with powersports dealers to display and sell our vehicles and accessories. Customers can now, or will soon be able to, buy our vehicles and accessories directly from a local dealership. Some of these dealers will also provide warranty and repair services to customers. Through December 31, 2021, we have entered into 33 dealership agreements covering 13 states. Each dealer has agreed to initially order 2 Grunts. We expect that once we have increased manufacturing capacity that dealers will be able to order in higher quantities to support their customer demand. We also expect to be able to offer the dealers a financing option, or “floor plan” to make higher purchases of our vehicles but we do not currently have this financing option available. We have an agreement with a third-party financing company to provide financing to qualified customers of each dealer. There is no recourse to the Company or the dealer if the dealer’s customer defaults on the financing agreement with this third-party.
 
We anticipate our vehicles and accessories will be sold globally in a three-phase rollout of export sales– Latin America importers started in 2021, Canada and Europe expected in 2022 and Australia expected in 2023. Certain countries will require that vehicles be homologated to meet their vehicle standards which may cause a delay in, or impact our ability, to export products in these expected timelines. Export sales are expected to be executed through individual importers in each country that purchase vehicles from us by the container. Each importer is expected to sell vehicles to local dealers or directly to customers. Local dealers are intended to provide warranty and repair services for vehicles purchased within their markets.
 
As of December 31, 2021, we have received orders from Latin America importers for 92 Grunts and we have shipped 24 of these units. Payment for these orders is due prior to shipment and are cancelable until shipped. Based on our current production capacity, we believe we will be able to fulfill all pending orders by the April 2022.

The estimated fulfillment of all orders that we have received as of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K assumes we are successfully able to increase our production capacity in the future, of which there is no assurance. We only recently commenced assembling the Grunt and we may encounter delays or setbacks as we increase production. In addition, we will need to obtain parts sufficient to build the quantity of Grunts needed to fulfill orders, some of which are manufactured in Asia, where manufacturing lead times and shipping delays have occurred and continue to occur. If we are unable to satisfy pending orders on a timely basis, customers may cancel their orders.

We are currently evaluating third-party vendors to identify second source suppliers to ensure supply chain continuity as well as to reduce the cost of parts, yet still retain the quality that is important to us and our customers. We currently estimate that we will be able to reduce parts cost and improve our assembly process where we will be able to sell the Grunt profitably by the second half of 2022.
 
We are assembling the Grunt in a leased production facility in Round Rock, Texas. We have entered into a lease for a built-to-suit manufacturing facility on 53 acres in Liberty Hill, Texas, 25 miles northwest of downtown Austin, from an entity controlled by our founders. We are currently evaluating a modification to the lease to expand the facility and the available acreage. If we sign the modification, we expect to begin production of the Stag, and possibly other vehicles, at this facility in the second half of 2023. We are also evaluating other manufacturing options for the Stag including the possibility of outsourcing the production to a third-party manufacturer.
 
Our Industry
 
The powersports industry is made up of on-road and off-road motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), UTVs, personal watercraft, snow machines, and portable generators. We are focusing solely on off-road motorcycles and UTVs. The ATV market, in which a single rider sits on top of a four-wheeled vehicle (as opposed to sitting inside a UTV), is not a market we currently intend to pursue but will continue to evaluate our lineup of vehicles in the future.
 
The off-road powersports industry has grown steadily on an annual basis since the recession of 2008. Off-road new unit sales have grown 46.5% over 2019. We believe this growth has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, as more consumers seek safe, outdoor recreation. 
 
Outdoor recreation is a major driver of the American economy. In 2019, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) found that outdoor recreation drives $788 billion of economic activity in America. The bureau noted that two and four-wheel powersports make up $39 billion of that total–the fourth largest total of all outdoor recreation activities.
 
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for off-road powersports grew steadily year-over-year. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, that growth accelerated rapidly. Year-over-year growth for off-road motorcycling, despite a short contraction in March and April of 2020, has risen 46.5%.
 
While post-COVID pandemic our industry may not experience such steady growth, we believe the new culture of escape and outdoor activities will continue to drive off-road powersports recreation. While a few traditional powersports companies make electric products, we believe there are currently no all-electric off-road powersports companies. As such, off-road electric vehicle market data is limited.
 
Our Products
 
We will feature motorcycle and UTV products that are all-electric and for off-road use only. The off-road market is growing faster than on-road and on-road products require costly levels of certification, homologation and compliance with the Department of Transportation (DOT), the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and other government regulators. As such, we are solely focusing on the off-road market. Due to these regulations, our vehicles are not legal for on-road use. All vehicles will come with a warning label stating “This vehicle is designed and manufactured for off road use only. It does not conform to federal motor vehicle safety standards and operation on public streets, roads, or highways is illegal”, and therefore our vehicles cannot be legally registered for on-road use in any state in the U.S and in many countries. In addition to powersports vehicles, we will source, market and sell a complete line of accessories and upgrades. These will feature parts designed to increase performance or appearance, in addition to practical add-ons to equip Volcon vehicles for hunters, anglers, ranchers and farmers.

The Grunt
 
Our first product to market, the Grunt, began shipping to customers in the third quarter of 2021. The Grunt is an electric off-road motorcycle with unique design features and capabilities.
 
The Grunt’s distinctive low height and oversize tires are designed to make it look like the fat tire bikes of the 1970s and ‘80s. These unique elements of the Grunt are not just for styling, but we believe they help make it easier to ride as compared to other off-road motorcycles on the market. The low seat height and large tires are designed to make the Grunt stable at all speeds on all surfaces in the off-road environment. The electric drivetrain has no clutch and no gears, making it easy for almost any customer to operate.
 
Although the Grunt and Runt can be used as delivered, we have developed an app, which can be downloaded at no additional cost, that we believe will enhance the riding experience. The Grunt has a small, optional, dash with limited data; however, the rider can use their smart phones and the app (subject to the rider’s cellular connectivity) as a dashboard by mounting it on the handlebars. The app makes it easier for users to set ride modes, check battery status, and update the bike’s firmware.  In the future we plan to add a trip navigation feature to the app.
 
The Grunt is designed for family off-road adventures, work on the farm or fun transport around private land. Its range can be up to 35 miles (with an optional second battery that provides an additional 35 miles) in its “explore” mode setting and it can be completely charged in less than three hours from a standard wall outlet.
 
We are designing an upgraded Grunt, the 2023 Grunt EVO, that will have a belt drive rather than a chain drive, an upgraded rear shock, a new seat and will be available in additional colors and have aftermarket accessory upgrades such as handlebars, grips, foot pegs and seats. The pricing for the 2023 Grunt EVO and accessories has not yet been determined. We expect the Grunt EVO to be available beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022.
 
We are also designing, and expect to introduce, the 2023 Grunt LE in the first quarter of 2023 which, like the Grunt EVO, will have a belt drive, but will also have a larger, integrated battery, black frame and additional color schemes along with other aftermarket upgrades. Pricing for the Grunt LE and related accessories have not yet determined. In addition, we are evaluating an additional model, 2023 Grunt XL (Hunt/Fish edition), and the features and release of this model has not been determined but would be focused on features attractive to hunters and anglers.
 
The Runt
 
We are continuing to evaluate development on the Runt including the selection of a supplier, and whether we can produce the Runt at a cost that meets our profit targets. If we cannot produce the Runt at an acceptable profit margin, we will cease development of this product. We expect to determine in the first half of 2022 whether we will finalize the development, production and sale of the Runt. If we conclude that we will complete the development and production of the Runt, we anticipate that the 2023 Volcon Runt will be available for sale in the fourth quarter of 2022.
 
The current design of the Runt, like the Grunt, includes large tires and low-slung chassis make it easier to ride than traditional off-road motorcycles. Due to its smaller size, the Runt is intended for drivers from seven to 14-year-olds. The app developed for the Grunt is designed to be used with the Runt and allows the rider to monitor speed, battery charge and ride mode. We expect to develop additional features to the app that will permit the parents of the minor Runt operator to login on their own phones to control the maximum acceleration and speed of the Runt and provide notifications of the minor Runt operator exceeding a certain speed or tipping over the bike can also be sent to the parents via text. The final features of the app could change as we continue our development of the Runt and features of the app. Based on the current design, the Runt is expected to have a range of up to 35 miles in its “explore” mode setting and charges in less than three hours from a standard wall outlet.
 
The Brat
 
In the fourth quarter of 2022, we expect to begin selling the 2023 Volcon Brat E-Bike. Similar to the lineup of Volcon motorcycles, the Brat will have a low seat height, large tires, hydraulic front and rear disc brakes and will be a Class 2 E-Bike capable of achieving 20 mph maximum speed from throttle assistance. Pricing for the Brat has not yet been determined and this will be manufactured by a third-party.

Future Products
 
In December 2021 we received the first prototype of the Volcon Stag, and we expect to publicly introduce a prototype of the Stag in the second half of 2022, with delivery of the first Stag model to customers beginning in the second half of 2023. The Stag will be Volcon’s utility/sport UTV with a 64” width to ensure it is able to operate in states with 65”-maximum-width trails. It will feature hauling and towing abilities for work on a farm or job site, but also fold-up seating for four so it can be used for weekend family adventures.
 
The 2023 Stag Trail LE, will be one of two Stag models initially launched in the second half of 2023, and will seat up to four people, with folding rear seats, a four point harness system, high performance shocks and tires, on demand all-wheel drive, variable power steering, a quick attach cargo system and a full line of accessories. The 2023 Stag Trail Base will be lower performance version of the Stag Trail LE with smaller tires and shocks but still include features like on demand all-wheel drive, a quick attach cargo system, folding rear seats, a 3 point harness system and a full line of accessories. The 2023 Stag Trail Base is expected to be available in the fourth quarter of 2023.
 
In the first quarter of 2024 we expect to launch the 2024 Stag Armageddon, a high performance model designed for off road racing. This model will include a larger motor and battery system, high performance shocks and tires, full time all-wheel drive, locking front and rear differentials, variable power steering and a full line of accessories.
 
We also expect to release the 2024 Stag Hunt in the first quarter of 2024. The Stag Hunt is being designed for mountain terrain, forest roads and back acreage. Like the Stag Trail Base, the Stag Hunt will have smaller tires and shocks but will have higher payload and towing capacity than the Stag Trail LE or Stag Armageddon. Finally, in the fourth quarter of 2024 we expect to launch the 2024 Stag Ranch, a utility version of the Stag that will have a configurable tilt flatbed system that will be designed for work on the ranch or jobsite.
 
We expect to introduce a larger, longer range UTV (to be named) in late 2023, which will be our flagship model in the Volcon line, with delivery to customers anticipated in the second half of 2024. We are designing this vehicle to have superior range and speed, but still be able to haul and tow far more than a traditional UTV.
 
Our ability to release new future products is dependent on our ability to receive future financing of which there is no assurance.
 
Assembly and Manufacturing
We source the parts for our vehicles from component manufacturers worldwide primarily in the United States, China and Southeast Asia. We do not have long-term supply agreements with our component suppliers. Although we currently rely on a single-source for certain of our components, we believe there are multiple sources for each of our critical components. We assemble the Grunt in a leased facility in Round Rock, Texas. We produced over 100 Grunts during 2021. We believe we can increase production to approximately 375 units per month by June 2022 and could produce up to 750 units per month when at full production capacity.
 
We provide a one-year warranty on the Grunt, and a two-year warranty on the battery pack and we expect the warranty for our other vehicles will be consistent with the warranty on the Grunt. We will accrue warranty reserves at the time a vehicle is delivered to the customer. Warranty reserves include our best estimate of the projected cost to repair or to replace any items under warranty, based on actual warranty experience as it becomes available and other known factors that may impact our evaluation of historical data. We review our reserves quarterly to ensure that our accruals are adequate in meeting expected future warranty obligations, and we will adjust our estimates as needed. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenues in the statement of operations. The portion of the warranty provision which is expected to be incurred within 12 months from the balance sheet date will be classified as current, while the remaining amount will be classified as long-term liabilities.
 
We are currently evaluating suppliers to manufacture the Runt and the level of assembly that will be completed by the supplier and whether we will need to perform any assembly once it is shipped to us, should we determine that we will sell this product.
 
We have selected a supplier for the Brat and expect to receive protypes in the second quarter of 2022. The supplier will complete the assembly such that the Brat will be packaged and shipped where it can be delivered to dealers or Latin America distributors without any additional assembly required by us and minimal assembly required by the dealer or end customer.

If we agree to the amendment of the lease for a facility and land in Liberty Hill, Texas, this facility will be used to assemble the Stag, and possibly other vehicles, beginning in the second quarter of 2023. We are also evaluating other options for facilities to manufacture the Stag including the possibility of outsourcing the manufacturing altogether to a third-party.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Beginning in November 2021, we began negotiating dealership agreements with powersports dealers to display and sell our vehicles and accessories. Customers can now, or will soon be able to, buy our vehicles and accessories directly from a local dealership. Through December 31, 2021, we have entered into 33 dealership agreements covering 13 states. We are currently negotiating additional dealership agreements with retail partners to display and sell our vehicles and accessories. Some of these dealers will also provide warranty and repair services to our customers.
 
We anticipate our vehicles and accessories will be sold globally in a three-phase rollout of export sales– Latin American importers started in 2021, Canada and Europe expected in 2022 and Australia expected in 2023, subject to meeting each countries homologation requirements, if any. Export sales are expected to be executed through individual importers in each country that purchase vehicles from us by the container. Each importer is expected to sell vehicles to local dealers or directly to customers. Local dealers are intended to provide warranty and repair services for vehicles purchased within their markets.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we currently rely on a combination of trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology.
 
Our industrial designs are protected by design patents. In addition, we intend to file for additional utility patents. There is no assurance that we will be granted any such patents. We do not know whether any patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. Even if granted, there can be no assurance that our issued patents or new patent applications will provide us with protection.
 
The names “Grunt” and “Runt” have been granted trademark rights in the United States. We have applied for trademark rights for the “Volcon” brand name and our logo in the United States and Latin America. We have received notice from two entities who have indicated they will protest the issuance of a trademark for the Volcon name due to the similarity of Volcon to their trademarks, even though our products are different. We are working with these entities to obtain an agreement that our Volcon trademark can co-exist with their trademarks. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining agreement with these entities, we will need to consider the use of a different trademark for our Company and our products.
 
Competition
 
There are dozens of manufacturers that sell off-road motorcycles and UTVs in the United States and even more globally. The markets for powersport vehicles are highly competitive based on a number of factors, including innovation, performance, price, technology, product features, styling, fit and finish, brand recognition, quality and distribution. We believe our ability to compete successfully in these markets depends on our ability to capitalize on our competitive strengths and build brand recognition.
 
Many companies, which have greater financial and marketing resources than Volcon, make electric street motorcycles, including Zero Motorcycles. Some companies make electric UTVs as part of their product line. Polaris has recently announced a joint venture with Zero Motorcycles to help them design dedicated electric UTVs, the first product of which was released in December 2021.
 
Government regulations
 
We have focused on the off-road-only portion of the market because it is free of many of the homologation issues and highway certifications required to produce and sell an on-road vehicle. In some states, off-road vehicles do have legislative restrictions, but they are related to noise and exhaust emissions, two things our vehicles do not produce.

Federal, state and local governments have promulgated and/or are considering promulgating laws and regulations relating to the safety of our products. In the United States, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has federal oversight over product safety issues related to off-road vehicles. We believe that our products comply with all applicable CPSC safety standards as well as all other applicable safety standards in the United States.
 
The assembly, use, storage, transport and disposal of battery packs is subject to extensive regulation. Complying with these requirements involves substantial costs, and any failure to do so may result in heavy fines or other restrictions on our operations. Additionally, we may be responsible for the recycling and proper disposal of expended batteries from our vehicles. We may enter into agreements with third-parties to manage such recycling and disposal; however, we may be found liable for any failures in compliance by these third parties and subject to fines or remediation liabilities, which costs may be substantial.
 
We intend to sell and distribute our vehicles internationally through international distributors. As such, we will be subject to the local laws of each jurisdiction in which we sell our vehicles. These regulations may result in increased costs and expenses, which may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 
Human Capital
 
Volcon Mission
 People are at the core of our DNA. This is the driving principle that brings purpose and dedication to our most valuable asset, our employees. Our vision is to amplify the powersports experience for all. Our mission is to build industry-leading products that connect people to outdoor experiences through the intentional blending of leading technology and design. Our values are building the future of powersports, together. Everyone is someone’s customer, which is why our goal is for each employee at Volcon to live by the Golden Rule.
Professional Employer Organization
 We use a professional employer organization ("PEO") to outsource our employee base, including processing of payroll and administration of benefits. As of March 15, 2022, we have 75 employees under our PEO arrangement, all of whom are located in the continental United States. Currently, our employees have not chosen representation by a labor union. We also use an ongoing rotation of approximately 15 contract workers to supplement our assembly operations and other positions within our organization, as needed. We also retain consultants for certain positions.
 
Our employees and contractors focus on customer care, developing and manufacturing our products, and building our sales channels. Through our PEO, we believe we offer competitive benefits and training programs to develop employees’ expertise, performance, and engagement, while implementing corporate policies to provide a safe, harassment-free work environment. This work environment is guided by principles of fair and equal treatment and prioritizes effective communication and employee engagement.
 
 Employee Engagement and Diversity
 As a developing organization, we are committed to building a strong culture with high levels of employee engagement. We distribute a survey quarterly to all employees to evaluate employee satisfaction. This assessment provides employees the ability to grade commitment to our mission and values. We believe that our employees are our greatest asset and are striving to consistently evaluate our progress in developing and maintaining engagement. Our first survey was conducted in the first quarter of 2022, and our survey results showed high levels of engagement with the overall score in the top quartile, which we believe is indicative of a positive engagement trajectory.
 
Volcon experiences a low employee turnover rate, less than 25% of our employee headcount as of December 31, 2021. A guiding value that influences hiring practices for Volcon is inclusivity. We believe our diverse human capital base is a testimony to the ongoing efforts toward diversity, equity and inclusion within the hiring practices and demographics of Volcon employees.
