Pipeline and Anticipated Milestones
 

Strategy
 Our goal is to become a leading orphan lung disease company, through the development and commercialization of novel and best-in-class therapeutics to address unmet medical needs in our field. The key elements of our strategy include:

• | Advance current pipeline. Our highest priority and focus is to advance our current pipeline products. Specifically, for Moldradex/PAP as well as AeroVanc, we are focused on completing the current Phase 3 studies, preparing New Drug Applications (“NDAs”) for submission to the FDA, ensuring our product supply chains will support commercialization, and preparing for potential commercialization of Molgradex and AeroVanc in the US, Europe, Japan and other countries. For Molgradex/NTM our focus is on the completion of the current Phase 2 study, and pending positive results, preparing for and executing a well-controlled Phase 2b study.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursue AeroVanc and Molgradex indication expansion. While our immediate priority is to obtain regulatory approvals in the primary indications described above, we believe both AeroVanc and Molgradex have the potential to be used for the treatment of other lung diseases. As was the case with the expansion of Molgradex into NTM, we are exploring the utility of these compounds in other difficult to treat lung infections.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand the product pipeline through strategic product acquisitions. In addition to broadening our current pipeline through indication expansion, our strategy includes expansion of our product pipeline through strategic partnerships and product acquisitions, such as our acquisition of the Molgradex program through the acquisition of Serendex Pharmaceuticals A/S in July 2016. A key priority has been to exploit known chemical entities or classes in novel ways, such as delivery of drug directly into the lungs, for the treatment of serious or life-threatening lung diseases. While we

have developed an internal core competence in inhaled drug development, we are technology and route of delivery agnostic. Future pipeline expansion decisions will be based on the unmet medical need within a specific disease, the commercial opportunity, and the ability to rapidly develop and commercialize a product candidate.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Operate by outsourcing capital intensive operations. We plan to continue to pursue the development and manufacturing of our product candidates by outsourcing most clinical development and manufacturing operations. We believe our business model has facilitated effective development of our pipeline by using high quality specialist vendors and consultants in a capital efficient manner.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Establish our own sales and marketing capabilities to commercialize our products in the United States. We plan to commercialize our pipeline through our own specialty salesforce or strategic marketing partnerships in the United States. Outside the United States, we plan to commercialize our products in collaboration with partners that have the resources and infrastructure to successfully commercialize our innovative therapeutics.

 Molgradex - PAP
 Our lead product candidate, Molgradex, an inhaled formulation of recombinant human GM-CSF, is being developed for the treatment of autoimmune PAP and NTM lung infection. Molgradex is currently being investigated in a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, IMPALA, for the treatment of PAP. Molgradex has been granted Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of PAP in the United States and the European Union, which allows for seven and ten years of exclusivity from approval, respectively. 
 PAP is a rare lung disease which is characterized by the build-up of lung surfactant in the alveoli, or air sacs, of the lungs with an estimated prevalence of approximately 2,500 patients in the United States. The disease process underlying PAP involves an autoimmune response against a naturally occurring protein, GM-CSF, suppressing the stimulating activity of GM-CSF on lung macrophages which function to clear excess surfactant from the alveoli. The surfactant consists of proteins and lipids, and is an important physiological substance that lines the inside of the alveoli to prevent the lungs from collapsing. In a healthy lung, the old and inactivated surfactant is cleared and digested by immune cells called alveolar macrophages. Alveolar macrophages need to be stimulated by GM-CSF to function properly in clearing surfactant, but in autoimmune PAP, GM-CSF is neutralized by antibodies against GM-CSF, rendering the macrophages unable to perform their tasks. As a result, an excess of surfactant accumulates in the alveoli, causing obstruction of gas exchange, and patients start to experience shortness of breath, and decreased exercise tolerance. Patients may also experience chronic cough, as well as episodes of fever, chest pain, or coughing blood, especially if secondary lung infection develops. In the long term, the disease can lead to serious complications, including lung fibrosis and the need for lung transplant. The best treatment currently available for PAP is a procedure called whole lung lavage, or WLL, which entails washing out the lungs bronchoscopically with saline, segment by segment, under general anesthesia. By its nature, WLL is an invasive and inconvenient procedure that requires hospitalization, and highly experienced physicians at specialist sites. Based on published investigator-sponsored treatment experience with inhaled GM-CSF, we believe Molgradex has the potential to replace the inactivated GM-CSF in PAP patients, and thereby to restore the surfactant clearing activity of the alveolar macrophages, and to become the treatment of choice for PAP. 
 We are currently conducting a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial in the U.S., Europe and Japan, the IMPALA study, of Molgradex. The IMPALA study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to compare the efficacy and safety of Molgradex with placebo in patients with PAP. Last year, we announced our expedited U.S. development strategy for Molgradex, which enables the ongoing IMPALA study to serve as a pivotal study also for U.S. registration purposes. In support of this strategy, we submitted an IND application to the FDA in December 2017 to expand the study into U.S. sites. The IMPALA study is now being conducted in approximately 20 countries globally. The primary endpoint of the study is the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient, a commonly used measure of oxygenation impairment. In addition, the FDA will focus its review on three key secondary endpoints that will be assessed to show improvement in clinical symptoms and function. To help ensure adequate statistical power by confirming or modifying the study sample size, the IND submission also added a blinded interim check of the variability of two of the key secondary endpoints, the six-minute walk distance and St. George’s respiratory questionnaire. This blinded analysis indicated that the current sample size of 90 patients is sufficient to achieve 90% power for one of these two endpoints. In order to help achieve 90% power for both endpoints, and thereby further increase the likelihood of a robust and convincing study outcome, in February 2018 the sample size was increased to a total of 135 patients, or 45 patients per treatment arm. Patients are randomized to receive treatment for up to 24 weeks in one of three treatment arms: 1) Molgradex 300 µg administered once daily, 2) Molgradex 300 µg and matching placebo administered daily in 7-day intermittent cycles of each, or 3) inhaled placebo administered once daily. We anticipate that patient enrollment in the IMPALA study will now be completed by Q3 2018 and top line results would be expected in Q2 2019. 
 Molgradex - NTM
 Molgradex, an inhaled formulation of recombinant human GM-CSF, is also currently being investigated in a Phase 2a study for NTM lung infection, OPTIMA. NTM lung infection is a rare and serious lung disorder associated with increased rates of morbidity and 
 3


mortality. Nontuberculous mycobacteria are naturally-occurring organisms and NTM lung infection can occur when an individual inhales the organism from their environment and develops a slowly progressive and destructive lung disease. NTM lung infection is typically characterized by cough, fatigue, and weight loss. NTM infections often become chronic and require long courses of multiple antibiotics, and despite the aggressive treatment regimens, treatment failure rates are high, and recurrence of infection common. Chronic NTM lung infection can have a significant impact on quality of life. There are approximately 50,000 to 80,000 individuals affected by NTM lung infection in the U.S, the most common types involving Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), and Mycobacterium abscessus (“M. abscessus”). There have been few advancements in new systemic treatments for NTM lung infection. However, in a recent Phase 3 clinical trial by Insmed (NASDAQ: INSM), local delivery of an inhaled form of amikacin directly to the lung was shown to be effective in approximately one third of treatment refractory patients with pulmonary MAC infection, suggesting administration of high local concentrations of drug directly at the site of infection provides an attractive new avenue to improve clinical outcomes in this and other difficult to treat chronic lung infections. 
 Notably, NTM lung infections are a considerable therapeutic challenge due to the unique ability of these bacteria to evade the normal killing mechanisms of alveolar macrophages, a type of immune cell responsible for killing bacteria in the lungs. There is increasing scientific literature suggesting that GM-CSF plays an important role in enhancing the ability of macrophages to clear mycobacteria. For instance, GM-CSF knock out mice inoculated with M. abscessus develop a chronic lung disease resembling human chronic infection, whereas wild type mice with intact GM-CSF production typically clear the bacteria quickly, and fail to develop chronic infection. In animal studies, GM-CSF has been shown to kill NTM with similar efficacy compared to commonly used NTM antibiotics, and the simultaneous use of GM-CSF with antibiotics can further improve the antibacterial effect of either GM-CSF or antibiotics given alone. In two published clinical case reports in the European Respiratory Journal by Dr. Wylam of the Mayo Clinic, inhaled GM-CSF was shown to eradicate or dramatically reduce the bacterial burden in patients with chronic M. abscessus lung infection, which suggests the promising animal data may be translatable to humans, and that the potential therapeutic role of GM-CSF in NTM lung infection warrants more intensive investigation. Among the various NTM species, M. abscessus is a particularly challenging clinical problem, being one of the most resistant organisms to antibiotics. Importantly, GM-CSF is not an antibiotic, but instead targets the human immune response, not the bacteria directly, thus potentially avoiding the increasing problem of antibiotic resistance.
 The Phase 2a OPTIMA multi-center clinical trial was initiated in Q1 2018 investigating the efficacy of Molgradex on NTM sputum culture conversion to negative, reduction of NTM bacterial load in sputum, exercise capacity as well as its effect on patient reported outcomes, and safety. Treatment in the Phase 2a clinical trial consists of 24 weeks of treatment and a follow-up of 12 weeks after end of treatment. The primary endpoint is sputum culture conversion during the treatment period defined as at least three consecutive negative sputum samples. Enrollment is expected to complete by Q3 2018.
 AeroVanc
 Our second Phase 3 product candidate, AeroVanc, a vancomycin hydrochloride inhalation powder, is the first inhaled antibiotic in development for the treatment of MRSA lung infection in individuals living with CF. AeroVanc has been granted Orphan Drug Designation and Qualified Infectious Disease Product, or QIDP, status for the treatment of persistent MRSA lung infection in individuals living with CF in the United States. The Orphan Drug Designation makes AeroVanc eligible for seven years of exclusivity from approval in the United States, and the QIDP designation makes AeroVanc eligible for an additional five years of exclusivity in the United States. In 2017, a composition of matter patent covering AeroVanc was issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office which affords us important protection for the program in the U.S., the largest market for the product, augments our market protection strategy, and will expire no earlier than 2032. 
 CF is a genetic disease that involves sticky mucus buildup in the lungs, persistent lung infections and permanent and progressive respiratory disability. There are approximately 30,000 patients affected by CF in the United States, and MRSA infection has become increasingly common in these patients, with a prevalence of approximately 26%. Persistent MRSA infection in individuals living with CF is associated with increased use of intravenous, or IV, antibiotics, increased hospitalizations, a faster decline of lung function, as well as shortened life-expectancy. Due to the lung pathology associated with CF, persistent MRSA lung infection is difficult to eradicate or manage using oral or IV antibiotics, and there is no standard of care to manage this condition. Whereas inhaled antibiotics have become a cornerstone of treating the most prevalent chronic pathogen in individuals living with CF, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (“Pseudomonas”), there are no approved inhaled antibiotics addressing MRSA lung infection. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study in individuals living with CF with persistent MRSA infection, AeroVanc met a primary endpoint to reduce MRSA density in sputum, and showed encouraging trends of improvement in lung function, and respiratory symptoms, as well as prolongation of the time to use of other antibiotics, with best responses in subjects under 21 years of age. 
 AeroVanc is currently being investigated in a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial in the U.S. and Canada, the AVAIL Study, for the treatment of persistent MRSA lung infection in individuals living with CF. The study began enrolling patients at U.S. clinical sites in September 2017 and at Canadian clinical sites in December 2017. The AVAIL study is expected to enroll approximately 200 subjects (150 
 4


subjects ≤ 21 years old, 50 subjects > 21 years old). During Period 1 of the study, subjects will be randomly assigned in a blinded 1:1 fashion to receive either AeroVanc (30 mg) twice daily, or placebo, by inhalation for 24 weeks or 3 dosing cycles. A dosing cycle is defined as 28 days of treatment followed by 28 days of observation. During Period 2 of the study, subjects will receive open-label AeroVanc (30 mg) twice daily for an additional 24 weeks or 3 dosing cycles, to evaluate the long-term safety of AeroVanc. The Coordinating Investigator of the study is Dr. Patrick Flume, Professor of Medicine and Director of the Cystic Fibrosis Program, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC. The primary efficacy endpoint in the AVAIL study is the mean absolute change in FEV1 percent predicted from baseline, which will be analyzed sequentially at week 4 (the end of cycle 1) and at week 20 (the end of cycle 3). The primary efficacy analysis will be based on patients between 6 - 21 years of age, using all observed data at weeks 4 and 20, as appropriate. Secondary efficacy endpoints include: (i) time to use of another antibiotic medication (oral, IV, and/or inhaled) for pulmonary infection, (ii) the number of successful FEV1-response cycles a subject achieves over Period 1 (weeks 4, 12, and 20), (iii) relative change from baseline in FEV1 percent predicted at weeks 4 and 20, (iv) change from baseline Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised scores at weeks 4 and 20 and (v) change from Baseline in Cystic Fibrosis Respiratory Symptom Diary-Chronic Respiratory Symptom Score scores at weeks 4 and 20.
We anticipate that patient enrollment in the AVAIL Study will be completed in Q1 2019, and we expect top line results late in the second half of 2019.
 Aironite
 Aironite (sodium nitrite inhalation solution) is an investigational product that was added to our pipeline as part of our acquisition of Mast in April 2017.
 In March 2018, topline results from a Phase 2 clinical trial of Aironite, the Inorganic Nitrite Delivery to Improve Exercise Capacity in HFpEF (INDIE) study, were presented at the American College of Cardiology 67th Annual Scientific Sessions & Expo. The INDIE study did not meet its primary endpoint of improvement in peak exercise capacity assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), or its secondary endpoints. The study was sponsored by Duke Clinical Research Institute as the Coordinating Center for the Heart Failure Clinical Research Network and was conducted primarily with grant funding from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Following the negative outcome of the INDIE study, we do not plan to support any new development of Aironite. 
 The INDIE study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study to
 evaluate the effect of Aironite on peak exercise capacity as assessed by CPET. One hundred five patients with a diagnosis of HFpEF were enrolled across 17 clinical centers in the United States. The primary endpoint was peak oxygen consumption (VO2) after four weeks of treatment with Aironite or placebo as assessed by CPET performed at peak drug levels. Secondary objectives included (i) submaximal activity tolerance chronically, (ii) quality of life, (iii) chronic filling pressures as assessed by echocardiography and natriuretic peptide levels, (iv) ventilatory efficiency at maximal exercise, and (v) submaximal exercise capacity at peak drug levels; as well as evaluation of the safety and tolerability of Aironite.
 Program Descriptions
 Molgradex
 Background on PAP
 PAP is a rare lung disease, which affects up to seven out of a million people in the United States1, and has a similar prevalence in Japan2. PAP is characterized by the build-up of lung surfactant in the alveoli, or air sacs, of the lungs. The surfactant consists of proteins and lipids, and is an important physiological substance that coats the inside of the alveoli to prevent the lungs from collapsing. The lungs continuously produce new active surfactant. In a healthy lung, the old and inactivated surfactant is cleared and digested by immune cells called alveolar macrophages. In PAP lungs, however, the macrophages fail to clear the surfactant from the alveoli, leading to gradual accumulation of excess surfactant in the alveoli. The root cause of PAP is an autoimmune response against a naturally occurring protein of the body, GM-CSF. Pulmonary macrophages need to be stimulated by GM-CSF to function properly, but in autoimmune PAP, GM-CSF is deactivated by antibodies against GM-CSF, rendering the macrophages unable to perform their tasks, such as clearing the surfactant from the alveoli.
 PAP commonly affects men in early middle age, but both sexes and subjects of any age can be affected. As a result of the accumulation of excess surfactant, gas exchange in the lungs is obstructed, and patients start to experience shortness of breath, and

decreased exercise tolerance. Shortness of breath is typically first observed upon exertion, but as the disease progresses, also at rest. Patients may experience chronic cough, as well as episodes of fever, chest pain, or coughing blood, especially if secondary lung infection develops. In the long term, the disease can lead to serious complications, including lung fibrosis and the need for lung transplant. Mortality due to PAP has decreased over the last decades with better clinical management, but in rare cases serious lung infections or respiratory insufficiency may lead to death.
 Current treatment options of PAP
 The current standard of care for PAP is WLL, which entails washing out the lungs with saline under general anesthesia. WLL is an invasive and inconvenient procedure that requires highly experienced physicians at specialist sites. The procedure in conducted in an operating room, thereby requiring hospitalization, and admission to intensive care after the procedure. In many patients, WLL only provides temporary symptomatic relief, and once the lungs refill with surfactant, the WLL procedure needs to be repeated.
 As there are no approved drug treatments available for PAP, we believe there is a high need for a convenient and efficacious medicinal treatment. We believe that inhalation of GM-CSF directly into the lungs has the potential to replace the inactivated GM-CSF, and thereby to restore the surfactant clearing activity of the alveolar macrophages. As a result, we believe that inhaled GM-CSF has the potential for considerable improvement in oxygenation and exercise tolerance. An injectable form of GM-CSF, sargramostim (Leukine®), is approved and on the market in the United States for IV and subcutaneous administration for the treatment of neutropenia caused by cancer chemotherapy, but there is currently no inhalation formulation of GM-CSF available.
 The potential benefits of inhaled GM-CSF in PAP, together with the availability of sargramostim, have stimulated independent clinicians and academic researchers in the United States, Europe, and Japan to study the safety and efficacy of GM-CSF, administered by inhalation, in PAP patients. Several such investigator-sponsored open-label clinical studies and case studies of inhaled GM-CSF treatment have been published, with promising results on the efficacy and safety of the treatment.3,4,5 In total, treatment of more than 80 PAP patients with inhaled GM-CSF has been reported in open-label studies or retrospective cohorts, as well as several individual case reports. Whereas the majority of the patients described in the literature received sargramostim, the results indicate that both sargramostim and molgramostim have the potential for a positive impact on oxygenation and clinical symptoms in PAP patients.
 According to our review of published literature, few safety issues related with molgramostim or sargramostim inhalation in patients with PAP have been reported. However, there is still limited information available on the long-term safety of inhaled GM-CSF. In indications other than PAP, more than 100 patients, mainly with a cancer diagnosis, have received inhaled sargramostim, in doses up to 4000 µg/day. Pulmonary toxicity was the most frequently reported toxicity at high doses. An increase in both number and severity of adverse events with increasing dose has been observed. However, due to the underlying diseases it was often difficult for the investigators to assess causality of the adverse event cases.
 Molgradex Product Description
 Molgradex is a novel inhaled formulation of recombinant human GM-CSF being developed for the treatment of PAP and NTM. The active drug substance, molgramostim, is a non-glycosylated form of GM-CSF. GM-CSF is an endogenous growth factor that stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells (blood and immune cells), mainly granulocytic and monocytic cell lines, which serve as the body’s first line of defense against bacteria and viruses, and also function to clear cellular debris and waste substances from the body. Molgramostim is produced in a strain of Escherichia coli bearing a genetically engineered plasmid containing a human GM-CSF gene.
 Molgradex, is a sterile nebulizer solution in a vial containing 300 µg of molgramostim, designed to be administered once daily by inhalation via a high efficiency Investigational eFlow Nebuliser System (PARI Pharma GmbH, Germany). The PARI eFlow Nebulizer system for use with investigational drug products is a reusable electronic inhalation system that has been optimized for administration of Molgradex.
 Molgradex was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA in October 2012, and by EMA in July, 2013, for the treatment of PAP. Safety and tolerability of inhaled Molgradex has been tested in a Phase 1 clinical study in 42 healthy human volunteers. The safety

and efficacy of inhaled Molgradex in PAP patients is currently being tested in a pivotal Phase 3 clinical study, IMPALA, in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Since 2014, Molgradex has been available in several European countries for the treatment of PAP for named patients following unsolicited physician requests.
 We anticipate that Molgradex will be used as a long-term therapy in patients with PAP. The optimal duration of treatment is currently not known, and is likely to vary between patients depending on the disease severity and the natural course of their disease. Molgradex treatment may not entirely eliminate the need for WLL in all patients, but based on interviews conducted by us, PAP centers that have experimented with long-term inhaled GM-CSF have seen a considerable reduction of WLL procedures.
 Molgradex Key Advantages 
Building upon the published investigator-sponsored treatment experience with inhaled GM-CSF, we believe Molgradex has the potential to become the treatment of choice for PAP. Molgradex has the following characteristics that we believe will contribute to our clinical profile, as well as facilitate our regulatory approval and successful commercialization. Specifically, Molgradex offers:

• | Strong product foundation, applying a previously approved active drug substance class and previously approved drug delivery technology.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | GM-CSF is delivered directly to the lungs, the primary site of macrophage function deficiency, which we believe can result in high clinical efficacy with limited systemic adverse effects.

• | High efficiency nebulizer providing a fast and convenient method of administration, which is highly desirable for long-term treatment in a chronic disease, such as PAP.

• | Eligible for strong market protection via orphan drug status, a proprietary cell bank used in the production of the drug substance, and an exclusive device supply agreement.

Clinical Development of Molgradex
 Phase 3 IMPALA Study
 We are currently conducting a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial in the U.S., Europe and Japan, the IMPALA study, of Molgradex. The IMPALA study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to compare the efficacy and safety of Molgradex with placebo in patients with PAP. The study began enrolling patients in Europe and Japan in 2016. In 2017, we announced our expedited U.S. development strategy for Molgradex, which enables the ongoing IMPALA study to serve as a pivotal study also for U.S. registration purposes. In support of this strategy, we submitted an IND application to the FDA in December 2017 to expand the study into U.S. sites. The IMPALA study is now being conducted in 20 countries globally. The primary endpoint of the study is the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient, a commonly used measure of oxygenation impairment. In addition, the FDA will focus its review on three key secondary endpoints that will be assessed to show improvement in clinical symptoms and function. To help ensure adequate statistical power by confirming or modifying the study sample size, the IND submission also added a blinded interim check of the variability of two of the key secondary endpoints, the six-minute walk distance and St. George’s respiratory questionnaire. This blinded analysis indicated that the current sample size of 90 patients is sufficient to achieve 90% power for one of these two endpoints. However, to achieve 90% power for both endpoints, and thereby further increase the likelihood of a robust and convincing study outcome, the sample size will be increased to a total of 135 patients, or 45 patients per treatment arm. Patients are randomized to receive treatment for up to 24 weeks in one of three treatment arms: 1) Molgradex 300 µg administered once daily, 2) Molgradex 300 µg and matching placebo administered daily in 7-day intermittent cycles of each, or 3) inhaled placebo administered once daily. 
 We anticipate that patient enrollment in the IMPALA study will be completed by Q3 2018 and top line results would be expected in Q2 2019. 
 Completed Clinical Studies
 Phase 1
 In a Phase 1 Molgradex study in 42 healthy adult volunteers, the drug was generally well tolerated and produced dose-dependent increases in total and differential white blood cell (“WBC”) counts consistent with the known pharmacologic effect of GM-CSF. The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of Molgradex. In the SAD part, 18 subjects were included with four subjects in each of the three SAD dose levels (150 µg, 300 µg and 600 µg) and six subjects received placebo. In the MAD part, 24 subjects were included with nine subjects in each of the two MAD dose levels (300 µg or 600 µg) and six subjects received placebo for six days.

In the SAD part, GM-CSF was absorbed into the systemic circulation with a t max of two hours after inhalation of Molgradex, however, at picogram levels, 50 to 100 times lower than has been observed after similar doses of GM-CSF administered intravenously. Total systemic exposure (AUC last) increased with dose, ranging between 13 and 138 pg•h/mL and maximum concentration (C max) ranging between 9.1 and 41 pg/mL (C max was similar for the 300 and 600 µg dose levels). In the MAD part, there was evidence of some accumulation after multiple dosing; C max increased from 32 pg/mL on Day 1 to 90 pg/mL on Day 6 at the 300 µg dose, and from 96 pg/mL on Day 1 to 251 pg/mL on Day 6 at the 600 µg dose level. Likewise, AUC last increased from 97 to 248 pg•h/mL from Days 1 to 6 for the 300 µg dose level and from 350 to 802 pg•h/mL for the 600 µg dose level. Minimum measurable plasma concentrations (C min) on Day 6 were 3.6 and 5.1 pg/mL measured at 8 and 12 hours, respectively for the 300 and 600 µg dose levels. In subjects treated with Molgradex, a slight increase in total WBC and differential counts (primarily within normal reference ranges) was observed in a dose-dependent manner, in-line with the known biological mode-of-action of GM-CSF.
 
The primary aim of the Phase 1 study was to assess the safety and tolerability of Molgradex. No meaningful difference in the frequency or severity of AEs was observed between Molgradex 300 µg and placebo. The most common AE was cough, reported in 21 out of 30 (70%) subjects receiving Molgradex and 8 out of 12 (67%) patients receiving placebo, and there was no difference in the causality assessment between the treatment arms. A higher number of treatment-related AEs were observed at the 600 µg dose compared to the 300 µg dose and placebo in the MAD part. There were no serious or severe adverse events, dose-limiting toxicity or other remarkable findings of clinical concern in the safety data.

 NTM lung infection is a rare and serious lung disorder associated with increased rates of morbidity and mortality. NTM naturally-occurring organisms and NTM lung infection can occur when an individual inhales the organism from their environment and develops a slowly progressive and destructive lung disease.

NTM infections often become chronic and require long courses of multiple antibiotics, and despite the aggressive treatment regimens, treatment failure rates are high, and recurrence of infection common. Chronic NTM lung infection can have a significant impact on quality of life. There are approximately 50,000 to 80,000 individuals affected by NTM lung infection in the U.S, the most common types involving MAC, and M.abscessus. There have been few advancements in new systemic treatments for NTM lung infection. However, in a recent Phase 3 clinical trial by Insmed (NASDAQ: INSM), local delivery of an inhaled form of amikacin directly to the lung was shown to be effective in approximately one third of treatment refractory patients with pulmonary MAC infection, suggesting administration of high local concentrations of drug directly at the site of infection provides an attractive new avenue to improve clinical outcomes in this and other difficult to treat chronic lung infections. 
 Notably, nontuberculous mycobacterial lung infections are a considerable therapeutic challenge due to the unique ability of these bacteria to evade the normal killing mechanisms of alveolar macrophages, a type of immune cells responsible for killing bacteria in the lungs. There is increasing scientific literature suggesting that GM-CSF plays an important role in enhancing the ability of macrophages to clear mycobacteria6. For instance, GM-CSF knock out mice inoculated with M. abscessus develop a chronic lung disease resembling human chronic infection, whereas wild type mice with intact GM-CSF production typically clear the bacteria quickly, and fail to develop chronic infection. In animal studies, GM-CSF has been shown to kill NTM with similar efficacy compared to commonly used NTM antibiotics, and the simultaneous use of GM-CSF with antibiotics can further improve the antibacterial effect of either GM-CSF or antibiotics given alone. In two published clinical case reports in the European Respiratory Journal by Dr. Wylam of the Mayo Clinic7, inhaled GM-CSF was shown to eradicate or dramatically reduce the bacterial burden in patients with refractory M. abscessus lung infection, which suggests the promising animal data may be translatable to humans, and that the potential therapeutic role of GM-CSF in NTM lung infection warrants more intensive investigation. Among the various NTM species, M. abscessus is a particularly challenging clinical problem, being one of the most resistant organisms to antibiotics. Importantly, GM-CSF is not an antibiotic, but instead targets the human immune response, not the bacteria directly, thus avoiding the increasing problem of antibiotic resistance.
 Clinical Development of Molgradex on NTM
 A Phase 2a multi-center clinical trial, OPTIMA, was initiated in Q1 2018, investigating the efficacy of Molgradex on NTM sputum culture conversion to negative, reduction of NTM bacterial load in sputum, exercise capacity as well as its effect on patient reported outcomes, and safety. Treatment in the Phase 2a clinical trial consists of 24 weeks of treatment and a follow-up of 12 weeks after end of treatment. The primary endpoint is sputum culture conversion during the treatment period defined as at least three consecutive negative sputum samples.  Enrollment is expected to complete by Q3 2018.

Overview of AeroVanc
 Background on MRSA infection in CF
 CF is a genetic disease characterized, in part, by the prevalence of thick, sticky mucus produced in the lung, frequent lung infections, and a resultant decline in pulmonary function. As the disease progresses, patients’ lungs are typically infected with bacteria that are difficult to eradicate. Inhaled antibiotics, including tobramycin (TOBI, Novartis AG), and aztreonam (Cayston, Gilead Sciences), have become a cornerstone of the treatment of the most common chronic pathogen, Pseudomonas, in order to control the infection and improve lung function and quality of life. In recent years, MRSA lung infection has become increasingly common in CF, with a prevalence of 26% according to the most recent (2015) data report of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Importantly, persistent MRSA lung infection has been associated with worse clinical outcomes in CF, including a faster decline of lung function8 and a shorter life expectancy.9 The increasing prevalence and high clinical impact of MRSA infection in CF have created an unmet need for improved therapies to help address the condition. Considering the established practice of treating chronic Pseudomonas infection in CF using inhaled antibiotics, all of which have limited activity against MRSA, it would be logical to attempt treatment of chronic MRSA infection with an inhaled antibiotic active against MRSA. We believe that AeroVanc is the first inhaled antibiotic being developed to specifically treat MRSA infection of the lungs.
 Current MRSA treatment options in CF
 Persistent MRSA lung infection in individuals living with CF is difficult to eradicate or manage using oral or IV antibiotics, and there is currently no standard of care to manage the infection in individuals living with CF despite the high need.10 In contrast to the established treatment of Pseudomonas infection with inhaled antibiotics, there is no FDA-approved inhaled antibiotic treatment available for MRSA infection.
 IV vancomycin or linezolid are the most commonly used drugs for the treatment of acute pulmonary exacerbation in individuals living with CF with MRSA infection, and they may be used in combination with other IV antibiotics in patients with simultaneous Gram-negative infections, such as Pseudomonas. For MRSA lung infection, vancomycin is available only in IV form, and while highly effective against MRSA and other Gram-positive bacteria, chronic home-based use of IV vancomycin is not practical, and chronic use has also been associated with systemic toxicity, especially renal toxicity and ototoxicity.
 According to research conducted by us, there is increasing clinical need to treat chronic MRSA infection in CF. In the absence of an inhaled antibiotic, there is emerging use of oral anti-MRSA antibiotics in an attempt to suppress the MRSA infection, and in hope of reducing the occurrence of acute pulmonary exacerbations. In a survey conducted by us, 27% of the surveyed CF specialists in the US regularly utilize antibiotics targeting MRSA as a suppressive treatment (any dosage form) in patients with frequent exacerbations or other symptoms for which MRSA is considered a cause or contributing factor. This practice is emerging despite the absence of established consensus or guidelines relating to the use of oral anti-MRSA antibiotics in CF, or evidence of efficacy established in controlled studies.
 As with current inhaled anti-pseudomonal drugs, we believe that there is significant clinical advantage in delivering an anti-MRSA antibiotic, such as vancomycin, directly to the site of infection to maximize the clinical efficacy, reduce systemic exposure and the risk of adverse effects, and to enable convenient use of the product outside of the hospital setting. The aerosolized IV form of vancomycin, administered by nebulization, has been used in multiple small published clinical studies, mainly to treat ventilator-associated pneumonia in an intensive care setting. In these studies and case reports, nebulized vancomycin had good antibacterial efficacy and was generally well tolerated. In recent years, according to interviews conducted by us, many of the leading CF centers in the United States have explored the use of inhaled vancomycin to treat MRSA in infected individuals living with CF on a chronic basis, by nebulizing the IV form of vancomycin. The experience gained from this type of treatment has been encouraging, and provides anecdotal reports of the safety and clinical utility of inhaled vancomycin for periods exceeding many years in some patients. Similarly, in the 1990’s, nebulized IV tobramycin was explored as a treatment of Pseudomonas infections in individuals living with CF. This experience stimulated the development of TOBI®, which has become the most widely used inhaled antibiotic worldwide, and a cornerstone of chronic treatment of Pseudomonas lung infection in CF.

We believe that inhaled antibiotics, as well as other palliative treatments, will continue to have a central role in the management of CF. Various disease modifying drugs, such as CF Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) modulators, that attempt to address the underlying cause of CF, i.e. to restore or improve the function of the CFTR protein that is defective or dysfunctional in individuals living with CF, have recently been launched. Whereas these disease-modifying drugs on average result in modest improvement in lung function and potentially slower rate of lung function decline, patients on these drugs continue to have chronic infections that require antibiotic treatment, and their lung function continues to decline.
 AeroVanc Product Description
 AeroVanc, or Vancomycin Hydrochloride Inhalation Powder, is a novel inhaled formulation of vancomycin being developed for the treatment of persistent MRSA lung infection in patients with CF. Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that was discovered in the mid-1950’s and is commonly used in the prophylaxis and treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria. Vancomycin acts by inhibiting proper cell wall synthesis of aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, and is generally not active against Gram-negative bacteria.
 AeroVanc consists of a capsule dosage form containing a proprietary dry powder formulation of vancomycin hydrochloride intended for oral inhalation with the AeroVanc inhaler. The AeroVanc inhaler is a commercialized, hand-held, manually operated, breath-activated device.
 We anticipate that AeroVanc will be used predominantly to suppress chronic MRSA lung infection, which has the potential to improve patients’ lung function and respiratory symptoms, and to prolong the time to pulmonary exacerbation and need of systemic antibiotics. AeroVanc is not intended to replace IV vancomycin or other IV antibiotics in the treatment of acute pulmonary exacerbations associated with MRSA. However, chronic AeroVanc use has the potential to reduce the occurrence of these exacerbations, and thereby reduce the need for IV treatments and hospitalizations.
 We believe there will be broad adoption of AeroVanc in CF once available based on a high level of interest for the product from direct clinician surveys, as well as market research of key opinion leaders in the field of CF. Notably, a clear majority (94%) of the surveyed CF physicians in the United States would expect to prescribe AeroVanc to their patients with MRSA lung infection, if approved by the FDA. Likewise, according to payer interviews conducted in the United States, an AeroVanc launch would receive reimbursement support given the high unmet need in an orphan indication and a current lack of comparable products.
 AeroVanc Key Advantages
We believe that AeroVanc has a number of important characteristics that contribute to our clinical profile and clinical data to date, and that facilitate our regulatory approval and successful commercialization. Specifically, AeroVanc offers:

• | Strong product foundation, applying a previously approved active substance and previously approved drug delivery technologies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | High concentration of antibiotic is delivered directly to the lungs, the primary site of infection, which we believe can result in higher clinical efficacy and reduced systemic toxicity, as compared with oral or IV delivery of antibiotics.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Capsule based powder inhaler providing a fast and convenient method of administration, which is very desirable in the CF population, who have a high treatment burden.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Eligible for strong market protection via orphan drug status, QIDP status, a formulation patent, and an exclusive device supply agreement.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Clinical Development of AeroVanc
 Phase 3
 AeroVanc is currently being investigated in a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial in the U.S. and Canada, the AVAIL Study, for the treatment of persistent MRSA lung infection in individuals living with CF. The study began enrolling patients at U.S. clinical sites in September 2017 and at Canadian clinical sites in December 2017. 
 The AVAIL study is currently enrolling approximately 200 subjects (150 subjects ≤ 21 years old, 50 subjects > 21 years old). During Period 1 of the study, subjects will be randomly assigned in a blinded 1:1 fashion to receive either AeroVanc (30 mg) twice daily, or placebo, by inhalation for 24 weeks or 3 dosing cycles. A dosing cycle is defined as 28 days of treatment followed by 28 days of observation. During Period 2 of the study, subjects will receive open-label AeroVanc (30 mg) twice daily for an additional 24 weeks 
 10


or 3 dosing cycles, to evaluate the long-term safety of AeroVanc. The Coordinating Investigator of the study is Dr. Patrick Flume, Professor of Medicine and Director of the Cystic Fibrosis Program, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC. 
 The primary efficacy endpoint in the AVAIL study is the mean absolute change in FEV1 percent predicted from baseline, which will be analyzed sequentially at week 4 (the end of cycle 1) and at week 20 (the end of cycle 3). The primary efficacy analysis will be based on patients between 6 - 21 years of age, using all observed data at weeks 4 and 20, as appropriate. Secondary efficacy endpoints include: (i) time to use of another antibiotic medication (oral, IV, and/or inhaled) for pulmonary infection, (ii) the number of successful FEV1-response cycles a subject achieves over Period 1 (weeks 4, 12, and 20), (iii) relative change from baseline in FEV1 percent predicted at weeks 4 and 20, (iv) change from baseline Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised scores at weeks 4 and 20 and (v) change from Baseline in Cystic Fibrosis Respiratory Symptom Diary-Chronic Respiratory Symptom Score scores at weeks 4 and 20. 
 We anticipate that patient enrollment in the AVAIL Study will be completed in Q1 2019 and top line results would be expected in the second half of 2019.
 Completed Clinical Studies
 Phase 1
 In a Phase 1 single escalating dose study, AeroVanc was shown to be generally well tolerated and safe, with a favorable pharmacokinetic profile. In the study, AeroVanc inhalation powder was administered to 18 healthy volunteers (doses of 16 mg, 32 mg, and 80 mg), and seven patients with CF (doses of 32 mg, and 80 mg). AeroVanc demonstrated a relatively slow pulmonary absorption phase (t max of 1.33 h — 2.08 h), followed by distribution and elimination comparable to IV administration. The mean absolute bioavailability across all AeroVanc doses was 49% (SD 8%), with no apparent differences observed between the doses. The absolute bioavailability closely corresponds with the pulmonary absorption of vancomycin, considering that vancomycin is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The mean C max of AeroVanc after an 80 mg dose was 618 ng/mL, corresponding to approximately one fifth of the dose adjusted C max after a 250 mg dose of IV vancomycin. The dose linearity of AeroVanc in terms of C max and AUC values was excellent (R 2 > 0.99). In the CF patients, all subjects had sputum vancomycin concentrations in high excess of the minimum inhibitory concentration, or MIC, of vancomycin for MRSA (2 µg/mL) at one hour after the administration of AeroVanc with both the 32 mg and the 80 mg dose (mean of 106 µg/mL, and 261 µg/mL, respectively). At later time points, the concentrations decreased, but on average remained above the MIC values for up to 24 hours. Variability in sputum concentrations was high, as expected.
 All adverse events in the healthy volunteers were classified as mild, and all events that were considered probably drug-related involved local irritation effects and resolved spontaneously and rapidly (between 15 and 60 minutes).
 Small reduction in the post-dose FEV 1 (7% — 11%) was observed in three subjects after the 80 mg dose. None of the subjects required bronchodilator treatment, and the changes were considered by the independent Drug Safety Monitoring Board to be clinically non-significant. In CF patients, chest congestion and/or chest tightness were reported by four of the seven patients, and there appeared to be a slight trend towards more adverse events at the higher dose (80 mg). All reported respiratory adverse events were mild, none of the patients felt distressed, and the events either did not require treatment or resolved after airway clearance and/or albuterol inhalation. Based on the sputum concentration data, dose levels of 32 mg and 64 mg twice a day were selected for use in the Phase 2 study.
 Phase 2
 In a Phase 2 clinical study in CF patients with persistent MRSA lung infection, AeroVanc met a primary endpoint to reduce MRSA density in sputum, and showed encouraging trends of improvement in lung function, prolongation of the time to use of other antibiotics, and respiratory symptoms, with best responses in subjects below 21 years of age. We believe that the consistency of the responses across the different endpoints, as well as the magnitude of change in the younger subjects, supports advancing the product into a Phase 3 clinical study. The results of the Phase 2 study have been summarized and presented to the FDA in an End of Phase 2 Meeting, and the FDA has subsequently given us detailed guidance on the design and analysis of a Phase 3 study, as presented above in section “Phase 3”. The key findings of the Phase 2 study are described below.
 The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 87 CF patients with persistently positive MRSA culture from their sputum samples. The Phase 2 study consisted of a 28-day AeroVanc treatment at a dose level of 32 mg bid or 64 mg bid, with an eight-week follow-up. The study was conducted at 40 sites in the United States. Quantitative MRSA cultures from spontaneously expectorated sputum samples were used as the primary endpoint of the study. The average baseline values in both active drug cohorts, as well as the placebo cohorts were high, ranging from 6.78 to 7.65 log 10 CFU/mL. In the primary endpoint analyses (MITT population), a reduction from baseline in MRSA CFU was observed in the 32 mg and 64 mg dose cohorts pooled compared to placebo 
 11


by -0.52 log 10 CFU/mL and -0.06 log 10 CFU/mL for the AeroVanc and placebo doses, respectively (p = 0.0312); in the 64 mg dose cohort by -0.63 log 10 CFU/mL and 0.16 log 10 CFU/mL for the AeroVanc and placebo doses, respectively (p = 0.0145); in the 32 mg dose cohort by -0.25 log 10 CFU/mL and -0.30 log 10 CFU/mL for the AeroVanc and placebo doses, respectively (p = 0.8352).
 MICs of vancomycin for MRSA cultured from the sputum samples were determined using a broth microdilution technique at baseline, at each visit during the administration of AeroVanc, as well as at the post-administration follow-up time points. The distribution of MIC values was very narrow, with the MIC 50 and MIC 90 both at 0.5 µg/mL at baseline. At baseline, all strains were susceptible to vancomycin, with MIC values £ 1 µg/mL, and there were no notable changes in the MIC distribution at any of the time points following the baseline sample, suggesting the susceptibility of MRSA to vancomycin was not affected by the 28 days of pulmonary administration of AeroVanc.
 Vancomycin peak and trough concentrations in sputum at Day 8 and Day 29 were in high excess over the generally accepted level of MIC (mean C trough /MIC ratio > 35) after multiple dosing in all subjects at both dose levels, with apparent dose-dependency, but no notable difference in C trough between the two time points.
 
In terms of safety, the most frequent adverse events reported were related to the respiratory system. The AeroVanc 32 mg bid dose was well tolerated, with no significant difference in adverse events as compared with placebo. However, a higher incidence of adverse events, most frequently consistent with signs and symptoms of bronchoconstriction, and a significantly higher rate of premature study drug discontinuations were seen in adult patients with the 64 mg bid AeroVanc dose, as compared with placebo and the 32 mg AeroVanc dose. The discontinuations were most commonly reported to be due to drug intolerability (mainly bronchoconstriction and/or chest tightness) or pulmonary exacerbation, and typically occurred within the first two weeks from the start of drug administration.
 Based on the observed clinical results in the 32 mg cohort of subjects below 21 years of age, the observed high vancomycin concentrations in sputum at both dose levels, and the high discontinuation frequency in adult subjects at the 64 mg dose, the Phase 3 study is planned to be conducted using the 32 mg dose, and will focus enrollment on subjects below 21 years of age. Accordingly, the key Phase 2 data from this cohort, below 21 years of age, are summarized below.
 To assess effects of AeroVanc on lung function, absolute change in FEV 1 percent predicted from baseline was measured at each study visit. While AeroVanc reduced MRSA density in sputum, the change in FEV 1 compared with placebo did not reach statistical significance in subjects of all ages. Notably, post hoc analyses identified encouraging improvement in FEV 1 in subjects 21 years of age or younger, consistently across all time points during the treatment period, as illustrated below. The mean absolute change in FEV 1 percent predicted observed in the AeroVanc arm is considered clinically meaningful, with an improvement ranging between 4% and 6% (or 6% and 10% on a relative change basis). In this subgroup, the difference between AeroVanc and placebo was statistically significant at the 2-week time point (p = 0.05). A mean reduction of 0.8 log 10 CFU/mL from baseline in MRSA CFUs, the primary endpoint, was also observed after 28 days of AeroVanc administration in subjects below 21 years of age, as illustrated below, the difference between AeroVanc and placebo being statistically significant (p = 0.05).

Change from baseline in FEV 1
 (Per Protocol Population, 32 mg dose cohort, below 21 years of age, n = 16)
 

These results are consistent with previous studies using inhaled tobramycin (TOBI® or TOBI Podhaler®) for the treatment of P. aeruginosa infection in CF, where improvement in FEV 1 was predominantly seen in younger subjects11. In the early TOBI trials, reported in the 1990’s, during an era when the use of inhaled antibiotics was not yet prevalent, children and adolescents (below 18 years of age) showed relative improvements of greater than 14% as compared with only 6% in adults12. However, in more recent studies, reported in 2012, the relative FEV 1 improvements have been considerably smaller, either being absent or less than 2% in adults13.
 As illustrated below, a mean reduction of 0.8 log 10 CFU/mL from baseline in MRSA CFUs, the primary endpoint, was observed after 28 days of AeroVanc administration in subjects below 21 years of age, the difference between AeroVanc and placebo being statistically significant (p = 0.05).

Change in MRSA density in sputum
 (Intent-to-treat Population, 32 mg dose cohort, below 21 years of age, n = 20)
 

A greater reduction in CFRSD-CRISS, the respiratory symptom score, was observed in the below 21-year age group consistently at all time points, as compared with placebo, but the difference was not statistically significant.
 A trend of prolongation of the time to use of another antibiotic for respiratory symptoms was observed in the AeroVanc arm of the 32 mg dose cohort, as compared with placebo, illustrated below. Whereas in this single cycle study several subjects in the AeroVanc arm were prescribed other antibiotics at the scheduled one-month post-treatment visit (approximately Day 56), such treatment would not be expected to be prescribed during chronic AeroVanc treatment, or in a multiple-cycle study, because the timing would coincide with the start of a new AeroVanc treatment period.
 14


Time to use of other antibiotics for respiratory infection
 (Intent-to-treat Population, 32 mg dose cohort, below 21 years of age, n = 20)
 

In summary, AeroVanc reduced MRSA density in sputum, and showed encouraging trends of improvement in lung function, prolongation of the time to use of other antibiotics, and respiratory symptom, with best responses in subjects below 21 years of age. We believe that the consistency of the responses across the different endpoints, as well as the magnitude of change in the younger subjects, supports advancing the product into a Phase 3 clinical study.
 Human Factor Study
 We have performed a human factor study to better understand patient reactions to the AeroVanc inhaler device, the drug capsule and written instructions. 14 individuals living with CF, representing a variety of sex, ethnicity and dominant hand preference and ranging in age from 12 to 56 years participated in the study. Patients were given the device, capsules and instructions to simulate use (no drug) and provide feedback. In summary, all patients were able to use the device properly and no device design issues were identified that could impact proper use.
Nonclinical Studies
 AeroVanc Inhalation Toxicology Studies
 The nonclinical toxicology profile of AeroVanc has been characterized in a series of acute and repeated dose inhalation toxicity studies in rats and dogs, as well as ICH/FDA prescribed safety pharmacology studies involving the cardiovascular, pulmonary, and central nervous systems. In these studies, a gradation of dose levels, including the maximum tolerated dose or the maximum technically achievable dose, were evaluated in both species.
 15


Following 28 days of inhalation exposure, there were no indications of systemic toxicity noted in either the rats or dogs. As expected, there were a number of microscopic changes noted along the respiratory tract and in the lungs that were considered to represent local irritative effects, adaptive changes, and normal physiological responses to the impaction of particles along the respiratory tract and deposition of particles in the lungs. A 28-day recovery period showed complete to partial reversibility of the findings, with no notable difference between the active dose groups and the vehicle control group when compared to the air control. Based on the results of these 28-day studies, the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) was established for both species, and AeroVanc was considered safe for the purpose of conducting the Phase 2 study.
 After completion of the Phase 2 clinical study, we received guidance from the FDA regarding the necessary toxicology studies to support the planned Phase 3 study and NDA submission. In accordance with the FDA’s guidance, a 91-day inhalation toxicology study was conducted in rats. We believe that the NOAEL established in this study supports the proposed Phase 3 study with the intended dose level.
 A two-year GLP inhalation carcinogenicity study of AeroVanc in rats is mandated by the FDA prior to submission of an NDA. The purpose of this study is to determine whether lifetime pulmonary exposure to AeroVanc at high doses may result in any gross or microscopic indications of neoplasia in rats. The 91-day inhalation toxicology report and the carcinogenicity study protocol have been evaluated by the FDA Carcinogenicity Assessment Committee (CAC) in a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) to confirm that the study design and dose levels are adequate to meet scientific and regulatory requirements. The CAC has notified us of their feedback, which has been considered in finalizing the protocol. The study will be conducted by a specialized contract research organization that has conducted all prior inhalation toxicology studies of AeroVanc, and has the required capabilities and operating procedures in place.
 Molgradex Pharmacology Studies
 The pharmacology of GM-CSF in the lungs involves stimulation of alveolar macrophage and neutrophil function to maintain alveolar surfactant homeostasis, alveolar stability, lung function, and lung host defense. For example, pulmonary GM-CSF is required for the terminal differentiation of alveolar macrophages and acquisition of numerous functions including expression of multiple receptors, non-specific and receptor-mediated endocytosis and phagocytosis, for pulmonary neutrophil recruitment during infection, clearance of bacteria, viruses, mycobacteria, and other pathogens, as well as for surfactant clearance.
 The pharmacodynamics of human GM-CSF receptor activation by Molgradex was determined as part of our studies of species evaluation and selection for inhalation toxicology and reproductive toxicology studies. As illustrated below, the effective concentration of molgramostim from Molgradex required to stimulate a half maximal receptor signaling response (EC 50), as measured by phosphorylation of STAT5, was similar to that of commercially available rhGM-CSF. Thus, Molgradex is expected to possess the expected biological regulatory action of GM-CSF on alveolar macrophages in the lungs.

Further in vitro or in vivo nonclinical studies investigating the pharmacological activity of Molgradex are not planned.

Molgradex Toxicology Studies
 The nonclinical toxicology profile of Molgradex has been characterized in a series of repeated dose inhalation toxicology studies and safety pharmacology studies in cynomolgus monkeys, as well as reproductive toxicology studies in rabbits. In these studies, a gradation of dose levels was evaluated in the respective species.
 Three GLP-compliant inhalation toxicology studies were conducted, including a 6-week inhalation toxicity study in young sexually immature monkeys, a 13-week inhalation toxicity study in sexually mature monkeys used to explore effects on male and female reproductive organs, and a 26-week inhalation toxicity study to investigate chronic toxicity. All studies are fully compliant with relevant guidelines from ICH/FDA.
 After inhalation of Molgradex, local effects in the lungs were characterized by infiltrating inflammatory cells, mostly macrophages, accompanied by an increased cellularity in the lymphoid tissue that is associated with the respiratory tract and minimal to mild exudation of red blood cells into the alveoli. The infiltration of inflammatory cells was not associated with any other signs of inflammation or impaired lung function, and it was considered an exaggerated pharmacological effect of molgramostim. The severity of the findings was graded slight at the lowest dose level, and moderate above this level. Duration of treatment did not affect the severity of this finding. Reduced severity of the lung and tracheobronchial changes following a four-week recovery period suggested partial resolution of the changes.
 Based on the three studies conducted in monkeys, a NOAEL was established, and Molgradex was considered safe for the purpose of conducting Phase 1 and Phase 2/3 studies, with a safety margin of greater than five-fold using a clinical dose of 300 µg once daily.
 Cardiovascular and respiratory parameters and effects on the central nervous system were evaluated in the 6-week and 26-week repeat dose inhalation toxicology studies. It was concluded that repeated daily inhalation of Molgradex does not exert any clinically relevant effects on the heart, the lung or the central nervous system in cynomolgus monkeys.
 An embryo-fetal and developmental (EFD) toxicity study with Molgradex was conducted in rabbits, which show a similar pharmacological response as humans or monkeys, although at a lower potency. The EFD study revealed increases in post implantation loss, decreases in the number of live implants, effects on sex ratio and a slight increase in the incidence of major malformations in fetuses at the highest dose (150 µg/kg/day), consistent with findings from other rhGM-CSF products. Studies in sexually mature monkeys have shown that molgramostim has no effect on male and female reproductive organs. Accordingly, appropriate risk minimization strategies are implemented for the clinical studies, and will be implemented for commercial stage use.
 In addition to the studies conducted, a pre- and postnatal development study will be conducted prior to NDA submission.
 Manufacturing and Supply
 We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities to produce clinical or commercial quantities of any of our product candidates. We have fee-for-service contracts with well-established drug substance manufacturers, as well as drug product manufacturers covering all steps of the manufacturing process of our product candidates, and expects to continue utilizing this outsourcing model in the foreseeable future. All of the vendors used by us conduct their operations under current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, a regulatory standard for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals.
Molgradex Manufacturing
 The drug substance in Molgradex, molgramostim, is currently manufactured by Gema Biotech S.A. (GEMA, Buenos Aires, Argentina). All clinical and nonclinical studies to date have used material sourced from GEMA. In 2015, we decided to transfer the production to a European manufacturer, Synco Bio Partners B.V. (Synco, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), to secure commercial supply of the drug substance. The technology transfer process from GEMA to Synco is currently ongoing. Upon successful transfer of the technology, GEMA and Synco may potentially provide dual sources for molgramostim, and at such time, we will evaluate both suppliers for commercial scalability.  
 The drug product, Molgradex, is currently manufactured at Miltenyi Biotec GmbH (Berglisch Gladbach, Germany). The Molgradex formulation was initially developed to contain several excipients commonly used in freeze-dried formulations used for IV administration. More detailed formulation studies of the inhaled product showed that the physico-chemical stability and potency of the drug product was independent of the presence of these excipients. Accordingly, a simplified formulation without these excipients is in development, and we may explore options to use of this formulation for commercial supply. The selection of the commercial drug product manufacturer is in progress. A master services agreement covering the drug substance has been established with Synco. A long-term commercial supply agreement will be established following the technology transfer.

Molgradex is administered to the lungs using the investigational eFlow Nebulizer System, manufactured by PARI Pharma GmbH (Stamberg, Germany). The eFlow nebulizer has been CE certified (CE 0123) according to the Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC (as amended by Directive 2007/47/EC) as a class IIa device. The device has a 510(k) approval in US as a general device. We have an exclusive license and a long-term supply agreement with PARI covering the eFlow nebulizer for the administration of recombinant human GM-CSF.
 AeroVanc Manufacturing
 AeroVanc is a high-performance inhalation powder formulation of vancomycin hydrochloride, applying a commercially-available capsule inhaler. The drug substance used in AeroVanc, Vancomycin Hydrochloride USP, is produced using microbial fermentation followed by purification, and is sourced from Xellia Pharmaceuticals ApS (Copenhagen, Denmark), a commercial manufacturer with two manufacturing facilities, one in China and one in Denmark. Both sites use the same cell line and manufacturing processes, and produce material of comparable quality. A long-term commercial supply agreement has been established with Xellia Pharmaceuticals ApS.
 AeroVanc inhalation powder is a spray-dried powder containing a ratio of 9:1 by weight of vancomycin hydrochloride and l-leucine. L-leucine is an essential amino acid and has GRAS status as a food additive. Formulation studies showed that the addition of l-leucine improves inhalation performance in vitro, as measured by improved emitted dose and fine particle dose. The powder manufacturing is carried out by Hovione LLC (East Windsor, NJ), a vendor with two operational sites, one in the United States and one in Europe, with the same base equipment in each facility, that could be upgraded to produce material of comparable quality. The proprietary AeroVanc spray drying process creates very fine particles (smaller than five microns) required for efficient delivery to the lungs. Proprietary nozzle and cyclone technologies were developed to meet product performance and manufacturing throughput requirements. The powder production process has been successfully scaled-up from laboratory to commercial equipment. A long-term commercial supply agreement is under negotiation with Hovione LLC.
 The finished product is manufactured from bulk AeroVanc powder by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK, Brentford, UK). At this final part of the manufacturing process, AeroVanc powder is conditioned and automatically filled into capsules each containing 16 mg of vancomycin. The capsules are then packaged into aluminum foil blisters to protect them from light and moisture. A long-term commercial supply agreement has been established with GSK for the finished product.
 The inhaler device used for AeroVanc is manufactured by Plastiape S.p.A. (Lecco, Italy). The device was approved in the United States as part of the Aridol ® new drug application (NDA 022368) on October 5, 2010. A cosmetically modified version of the device was approved in the United States as part of the Arcapta ® Neohaler ® new drug application (NDA 022383) on July 1, 2011. An exclusive long-term commercial supply agreement has been established with Plastiape S.p.A.
 We have worked with our manufacturing partners to scale up processes, improve yields and production rates, and to transfer processes to commercial facilities with commercial equipment. We have produced the supplies for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical study utilizing the same manufacturing sites, equipment and processes that will be used for commercial supply.
 Commercialization
 We own exclusive rights to AeroVanc and Molgradex in the United States, and all other major markets, except for Japan, where we have licensed the Molgradex rights to Nobelpharma Co., Ltd (Tokyo, Japan). We plan to pursue regulatory approvals for our products in the United States and the European Union, and to independently commercialize AeroVanc and Molgradex in the United States. In doing so, we may engage with strategic partners to help implement optimal sales and promotion activities. 
 Our commercialization strategy will target key prescribing physicians, as well as provide patients with support programs to ensure product access. Outside of the United States, we plan to seek partners to commercialize our products via out-licensing agreements or other similar commercial arrangements.

Xellia Pharmaceuticals ApS
 In September 2016, we entered into a supply agreement related to the supply of the API for AeroVanc with Xellia Pharmaceuticals (the “Xellia Agreement”). Pursuant to the Xellia Agreement, we are obligated to purchase all of our requirements of the API from Xellia. The pricing under the Xellia Agreement is a set price per kg, with the price decreasing upon the commercial launch of AeroVanc.
 PARI Pharma GmbH
 In November 2014, Serendex (refer to note 7 of the consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this report) entered into a license and collaboration agreement related to Molgradex with PARI Pharma GmbH (the “PARI License Agreement”), which we assumed as part of the Serendex Acquisition (refer to note 7 of the consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this report). Under the PARI License Agreement, we have a worldwide, exclusive license to commercialize PARI’s investigational eFlow Nebulizer device for the pulmonary delivery of any liquid formulation containing hGM-CSF as the sole active pharmaceutical ingredient for nebulization for PAP. Additionally, we have the option to change the device subject to the PARI License Agreement to PARI’s eFlow Technology Nebulizer CS and, until marketing approval, the option to negotiate an extension to the license to cover commercialization of the drug for pulmonary delivery via the PARI eFlow Inline device for the treatment of VAP and/or ARDS.
 Under the terms of the PARI License Agreement, we are not permitted to work with third parties to develop any inhalation device or nebulizer for the pulmonary delivery of a pharmaceutical product containing hGM-CSF as the sole active ingredient. This restriction extends until (i) in the European Economic Area, marketing approval of the product in Europe or the United States, whichever is later, or (ii) in the rest of the world, the term of the PARI License Agreement.
 In consideration of rights granted by PARI, Serendex paid a onetime upfront fee and agreed to pay an hourly rate for work performed by PARI under work orders issued pursuant to the PARI License Agreement. Additionally, we are obligated to make future milestone payments to PARI based upon (i) the successful completion of certain clinical trials, (ii) submissions for regulatory approval in the United States, the European Union or Japan, and (iii) the first marketing approval for the product in the United States, the European Union or Japan.
 If we successfully commercialize any product candidate subject to the PARI License Agreement in a country, we are responsible for royalty payments equal to a percentage of net sales. We are obligated to make such royalty payments until the later of (i) the expiration of the last valid claim in an issued patent covering a portion of the PARI device in the applicable country or (ii) 15 years after the first commercial sale of Molgradex with the PARI device in that country (the “PARI Royalty Period”). If there is no such valid patent claim covering the applicable PARI device, the royalty owed to PARI will be decreased by a specified percentage.
 The license term extends on a country by country basis until the end of the PARI Royalty Period or until mutually agreed by the parties.
 In April 2015, Serendex entered into a commercial supply agreement with PARI (the “PARI Supply Agreement”) related to the supply of the investigational PARI eFlow Technology Nebulizer and related accessories for commercial use with our products after marketing approval is obtained. We assumed the PARI Supply Agreement as part of the Serendex Acquisition. Pursuant to the terms of the PARI Supply Agreement, we are obligated to purchase from PARI (i) within the European Economic Area, (a) during the first five years from marketing approval, all of our requirements for the device and related accessories and (b) thereafter 80% and (ii) in the rest of the world, all of our requirements during the PARI Royalty Period. Pricing is on a per unit basis, with a reduction in price once purchasing volumes reach over 5,000 for devices and starter kits and over 40,000 for nebulizer handsets in a twelve month period.
 GEMA Biotech S.A.
 In December 2012, Serendex entered into a supply and license agreement related to supplying the API for Molgradex with GEMA Biotech S.A., which was subsequently amended by addendums in February 2016 and September 20, 2017 (the “GEMA Agreement”). We assumed the GEMA Agreement as part of the Serendex Acquisition. Under the GEMA Agreement, we have an exclusive license to market, distribute and sell products based on GEMA recombinant hGM-CSF for any disease to be treated by inhalation, local pulmonary administration, parenteral administration, or local administration of the API in any territory except Latin America, Central America and Mexico. Under the original GEMA Agreement, GEMA is the sole supplier of the API.
 As consideration for the rights granted by GEMA, we are required to pay GEMA an agreed upon price per vial of 1 gram of the API. Additionally, if we successfully develop, register and obtain approval by the proper health authorities, we must pay GEMA a single digit percentage royalty on annual net sales. There is no minimum royalty, and no signing fee or milestones are included in the royalty 
 19


payments. Additionally, we have milestone based commitments to GEMA in the amount of $600,000 upon the successful release of the first GMP grade API batch and $2,000,000 upon the first regulatory approval on Molgradex in Europe or the U.S.  
 Pursuant to the terms of the February 2016 addendum, GEMA granted an exclusive worldwide license to Serendex to transfer the manufacture of the API to Synco Bio Partners B.V., and agreed to transfer the master cell bank and working cell bank to Serendex (now us). Upon the completion of the transfer of the master cell bank and working cell bank, the royalty payable to GEMA set forth above decreases.
 Government Regulation
 The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting of drugs, such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
Government Regulation of Drugs
 The process required by the FDA before drug product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, regulation;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or ethics committee for each clinical site before a clinical trial can begin;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed product candidate for its intended purpose;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation of and submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application, or NDA, after completion of all required clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the application for review;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigational sites to assess compliance with current Good Clinical Practices, or cGCPs; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States, which must be updated annually and when significant changes are made.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
 20


Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with cGCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.
 For purposes of NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap. Additionally, in certain instances, a fourth phase, post approval, may be necessary or required.
  
• | Phase 1. The drug product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The drug product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk to benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4. In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies may be required as a condition to approval of the NDA.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within a specified period, if at all, and there can be no assurance that the data collected will support FDA approval or licensure of the product. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the drug characteristics of the product candidate, and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 NDA Submission and Review by the FDA
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The NDA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. The submission of an NDA requires payment of a substantial User Fee to the FDA, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. These fees are typically increased annually. A waiver of user fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
 Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews an NDA to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. Once an NDA has been filed, the FDA’s goal is to review the application within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for the indication being pursued, and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued 
 21


safety and effectiveness. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cGCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all, and we may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products. After the FDA evaluates an NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or our drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may request additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
 If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of its products under development.
 A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate FDA’s review and approval of new drugs that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drug products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. For a fast track product, the FDA may consider sections of the NDA for review on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted if relevant criteria are met. A fast track designated product candidate may also qualify for priority review, under which the FDA sets the target date for FDA action on the NDA at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review is granted when there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of 10 months after FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
 Under the accelerated approval program, the FDA may approve an NDA on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after marketing approval are generally required to verify the biologic’s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, which was enacted and signed into law in 2012, established breakthrough therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the product candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the therapy may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Sponsors may request the FDA to designate a breakthrough therapy at the time of or any time after the submission of an IND, but ideally before an end-of-phase 2 meeting with FDA. If the FDA designates a breakthrough therapy, it may take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the therapy; providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable; 
 22


involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor; and considering alternative clinical trial designs when scientifically appropriate, which may result in smaller or more efficient clinical trials that require less time to complete and may minimize the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment. Breakthrough designation also allows the sponsor to file sections of the NDA for review on a rolling basis. We may seek designation as a breakthrough therapy for some or all of our product candidates.
 Fast Track designation, priority review and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
 Orphan Drug Status
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drug candidates intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that costs of research and development of the drug for the indication can be recovered by sales of the drug in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Although there may be some increased communication opportunities, orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 If a drug candidate that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in very limited circumstances, such as if the second applicant demonstrates the clinical superiority of its product or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.
 Orphan drug exclusivity could block the approval of our drug candidates for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same product as defined by the FDA or if our drug candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease.
 As in the United States, designation as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the European Union, must be made before the application for marketing authorization is made. Orphan drugs in Europe enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to 10 years of market exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan designated product.
 The FDA and foreign regulators expect holders of exclusivity for orphan drugs to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of their orphan drugs to meet the needs of patients. Failure to do so could result in the withdrawal of marketing exclusivity for the orphan drug.
 GAIN Exclusivity for Antibiotics
 In 2012, Congress passed legislation known as the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act, or GAIN Act. This legislation is designed to encourage the development of antibacterial and antifungal drug products that treat pathogens that cause serious and life-threatening infections. To that end, the new law grants an additional five years of exclusivity upon the approval of an NDA for a drug product designated by FDA as a QIDP. Thus, for a QIDP with Orphan Designation, the periods of five-year exclusivity and seven-year orphan drug exclusivity, would become 12 years.
 A QIDP is defined in the GAIN Act to mean “an antibacterial or antifungal drug for human use intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections, including those caused by (1) an antibacterial or antifungal resistant pathogen, including novel or emerging infectious pathogens” or (2) certain “qualifying pathogens.” A “qualifying pathogen” is a pathogen that has the potential to pose a serious threat to public health (such as resistant Gram-positive pathogens, multi-drug resistant Gram-negative bacteria, multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, and C. difficile) and that is included in a list established and maintained by FDA. A drug sponsor may request the FDA to designate its product as a QIDP any time before the submission of an NDA. The FDA must make a QIDP determination within 60 days of the designation request. A product designated as a QIDP will be granted priority review by the FDA and can qualify for “fast track” status.
 23


The additional five years of exclusivity under the GAIN Act for drug products designated by the FDA as QIDPs applies only to a drug that is first approved on or after July 9, 2012. Additionally, the five year exclusivity extension does not apply to: a supplement to an application under FDCA Section 505(b) for any QIDP for which an extension is in effect or has expired; a subsequent application filed with respect to a product approved by the FDA for a change that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength; or a product that does not meet the definition of a QIDP under Section 505(g) based upon its approved uses.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with GMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements. If our present or future suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may, among other things, halt our clinical trials, require them to recall a product from distribution, or withdraw approval of the NDA.
 Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing.
 The FDA may withdraw approval of an NDA if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drugs and biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.

Government Regulation of Combination Products
 Our products under development will be regulated as combination products, which means that they are comprised of two or more different components that, if marketed individually, would be subject to different regulatory paths and would require approval of independent marketing applications by the FDA. A combination product, however, is assigned to a Center with the FDA that will have primary jurisdiction over its regulation on a determination of the combination product’s primary mode of action, which is the single mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action. We believe our product candidates include both a drug and medical device component, and will be regulated as a drug, subject to the review of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, which will have primary jurisdiction over premarket development and approval. The FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, or CDRH, will provide support and review of the inhaler component of the product candidate.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 Our sales, promotion, medical education, clinical research and other activities following product approval will be subject to regulation by numerous regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including potentially the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and state and local governments. Our promotional and scientific/educational programs and interactions with healthcare professionals must comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the civil False Claims Act, physician payment transparency laws, privacy laws, security laws, and additional federal and state laws similar to the foregoing.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, the knowing and willing, direct or indirect offer, receipt, solicitation or payment of remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of patients, including the purchase, order or lease of any good, facility, item or service that would be paid for in whole or part by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs. Remuneration has been broadly defined to include anything of value, including cash, improper discounts, and free or reduced price items and services. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and beneficiaries on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to increased scrutiny and review if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. The government has enforced the federal Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham research or consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. Many states have similar laws that apply to their state health care programs as well as private payers.
 Federal false claims and false statement laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, or FCA, imposes liability on persons and/or entities that, among other things, knowingly present or cause to be presented claims that are false or fraudulent or not provided as claimed for payment or approval by a federal health care program. The FCA has been used to prosecute persons or entities that “cause” the submission of claims for payment that are inaccurate or fraudulent, by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, promoting a product off-label, submitting claims for services not provided as claimed, or submitting claims for services that were provided but not medically necessary. Actions under the FCA may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual, or whistleblower, in the name of the government. Violations of the FCA can result in significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the FCA, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other illegal sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the FCA in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. In addition, certain companies that were found to be in violation of the FCA have been forced to implement extensive corrective action plans, and have often become subject to consent decrees or corporate integrity agreements, restricting the manner in which they conduct their business.
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers; knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or 
 25


services; and willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Affordable Care Act amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payer, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Additionally, to the extent that our products, once commercialized, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
 In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposed new reporting requirements on certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, for payments or other transfers of value made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Covered manufacturers are required to collect and report detailed payment data and submit legal attestation to the accuracy of such data to the government each year. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures”), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Additionally, entities that do not comply with mandatory reporting requirements may be subject to a corporate integrity agreement. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on covered manufacturers’ marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians and other healthcare professionals.
 We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business and the EU with the General Data Protection Regulation rules set to become effective in May, 2018. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, imposes specified requirements on certain health care providers, plans and clearinghouses (collectively, “covered entities”) and their “business associates,” relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, certain states have their own laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other and/or HIPAA in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to them, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, and diminished profits and future earnings, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
 In addition to the foregoing health care laws, we are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or private-sector recipients for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have adopted an anti-corruption policy which mandates compliance with the FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws applicable to our business throughout the world. However, we cannot assure that such a policy or procedures implemented to enforce such a policy will protect against intentional, reckless or negligent acts committed by our employees, distributors, partners, collaborators or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in fines, penalties or prosecution and have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, and reputation.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Sales of pharmaceutical products depend significantly on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement are provided by third-party payers. Third-party payers include state and federal government health care programs, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Although we currently believe that third-party payers will provide coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates, if approved, we cannot be certain of this. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging 
 26


the price, examining the cost-effectiveness, and reducing reimbursement for medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. We may need to conduct expensive clinical studies to demonstrate the comparative cost-effectiveness of our products. The product candidates that we develop may not be considered cost-effective and thus may not be covered or sufficiently reimbursed. It is time consuming and expensive for third party payers to seek coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, as each payer will make its own determination as to whether to cover a product and at what level of reimbursement. Thus, one payer’s decision to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for a product does not assure that another payer will provide coverage or that the reimbursement levels will be adequate. Moreover, a payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow third party payers to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis.
 Healthcare Reform
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could materially affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
 By way of example, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Among the provisions of the Affordable Care Act of importance to our potential drug candidates are:
  
• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for a manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | extension of a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. These changes include, among others, the Budget Control Act of 2011, which mandates aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year effective April 1, 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our product candidates, if approved, and, accordingly, our financial operations.
 27


We expect that healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future, including the possible repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act, are unpredictable, and the potential impact on our operations and financial position are uncertain, but may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and place additional downward pressure on the price that it receives for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our drugs.
 Foreign Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to develop or sell any products outside of the United States. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
Intellectual Property
 We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including our product candidates and our processes. We seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for our products, their methods of use and processes of manufacture and any other technology to which we have rights, as appropriate, such as device exclusivity. We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business.
 We own six issued patents and additional pending patent applications worldwide for a proprietary formulation of AeroVanc. The patents and pending applications are derived from a PCT application (Pub. No. WO2012159103) entitled “Dry Powder Vancomycin Compositions and Associated Methods.” In May 2017, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued United States Patent No. 9,572,774 for “Dry Powder Vancomycin Compositions and Associated Methods” which will provide key intellectual property protection in the U.S. for the AeroVanc program and will expire no earlier than 2032. This affords us important composition of matter protection for our AeroVanc program in the U.S., the largest market for the product, and is a key component of our market protection strategy which also includes Orphan Drug and Qualified Infectious Disease Product protection. We have also received a Notice of Allowance from the Canadian Intellectual Property Office for our Canadian Patent Application No. 2,836,643 entitled “Dry Powder Vancomycin Compositions and Associated Methods.” This notice serves as official communication that the examination of the patent application has been successfully completed. Once issued, the patent will provide protection for AeroVanc in Canada until 2032. We also have corresponding patent applications for AeroVanc in different stages of prosecution in other key markets throughout the world. As of March 12, 2018, patents have issued in the United States, Canada, Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand, and Singapore.
 While we do not have any issued patents or pending applications covering Molgradex or its use in pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), we do own a family of issued patents and pending applications derived from a PCT application (Pub. No. WO2008052567) entitled “Enhancing Pulmonary Host Defense via Administration of Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor” covering inhaled GM-CSF for treatment of bacterial, mycobacterial (including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and non-tuberculous Mycobacterium), yeast, and virus infections in the lungs. Patents have been granted in Japan, Australia, and Mexico. Patent applications are currently pending in several other countries, including the United States. An application is also pending in the European Union, where an allowance has been indicated. In addition, several new patent applications were filed in 2017 on the use of Molgradex for NTM lung infection.  Molgradex is also a registered trademark in most European countries.
 Our success will in part depend on the ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary rights in commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, the validity and enforceability of our patents, the continued confidentiality of our trade secrets as well as our ability to operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
 We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may own or license in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents we may own or license in the future will be useful in protecting our technology and products. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 Trade Secrets
 In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. For example, significant aspects of our processes and proprietary technology portfolio are based on unpatented trade secrets and know-how. Trade 
 28


secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and commercial partners. These agreements are designed to protect the proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. While we have confidence in our key individuals, consultants, partner organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and there may not be adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
 Competition
 The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to continuous technological change. Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions. We believe that key competitive factors affecting the commercial success of our product candidates will be efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement. Many of our potential competitors, either alone or with their collaboration partners have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than us, and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, manufacturing, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Accordingly, our competitors may be faster and more successful in obtaining FDA approval for therapies and achieving widespread market acceptance. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of very capable competitors. We anticipate facing intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. Our competitors’ products may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any product candidate we may commercialize and may render our therapies obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover development and commercialization expenses.
 We are not aware of any other companies developing inhaled forms of vancomycin. There are several inhaled antibiotics on the market or in development, but we are not aware of any other inhaled antibiotic product that would be specifically developed for the treatment of MRSA infection. Certain inhaled antibiotics in development, including levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin inhalation formulations, may possess some level of in vitro or in vivo activity against MRSA, even though the compounds are not generally considered MRSA-antibiotics. It is therefore possible that such products, if approved, may present a competitive threat to AeroVanc. A combination product containing fosfomycin and tobramycin for inhalation (FTI) was developed by Gilead Sciences (Foster City, CA), and shown in a Phase 2 study to possess activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA. Gilead terminated the development of the product, and licensed it to CURx Pharmaceuticals (San Diego, CA) in February, 2014. No clinical studies on FTI have been initiated by CURx. If FTI is developed, and approved, for the treatment of MRSA lung infection in CF, we believe it has the potential to present a competitive threat to the commercial success of AeroVanc.
 Many small and large pharmaceutical companies have intravenously or orally administered MRSA-antibiotics on the market, and/or in development. Whereas such antibiotics are important in the treatment of many acute and chronic MRSA-infections, such as skin and soft tissue infections, pneumonia, or endocarditis, we do not believe these products are practical or sufficiently efficacious and/or safe for long-term management of chronic MRSA lung infection in individuals living with CF. Therefore, we do not believe these products and product candidates are a material competitive threat to the commercial success of AeroVanc.
 We are not aware of any other companies developing an inhaled form of GM-CSF. A glycosylated GM-CSF product, sargramostim (Leukine), is available on the market in the United States, intended for IV or subcutaneous delivery in patients with neutropenia following cancer chemotherapy. Leukine has not been approved, and according to our knowledge, is not being developed for the treatment of PAP or any other acute or chronic lung disease. The drug substance in Leukine, sargramostim, has been used in a nonclinical research project conducted by NIH/TRND in collaboration with the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine on the potential application of inhaled GM-CSF as a treatment for PAP. No clinical studies have been conducted to date under this collaboration project. We are aware of a multicenter clinical study of inhaled Leukine, using a standard commercially available nebulizer, which is currently ongoing in Japan, conducted by a consortium of independent clinical investigators. It is not known to us if this study, together with other possibly available related clinical or nonclinical information, may be, or will be, used to support a potential new product approval in Japan. If such a new product would be approved and launched in Japan, we believe it has the potential to present a material competitive threat to the commercial success of Molgradex in Japan.

Merger with Mast Therapeutics and Corporate Information
 On April 27, 2017, Savara (“Private Savara”) completed its business combination with Mast Therapeutics, Inc. (“Mast”), a publicly held company, in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the "Merger Agreement"), dated January 6, 2017 (the "Merger"). In connection with and immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, Mast implemented a reverse stock split at a ratio of one new share for every 70 shares of its common stock outstanding. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each outstanding share of Savara common stock was then converted into Mast common stock at the Exchange Ratio (refer to note 1 of the consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this report). As a result of the Merger, the Mast equity holders owned approximately 23% of the combined company, and Savara’s pre-existing equity holders owned approximately 77%. In connection with the Merger, Mast changed its name to Savara Inc.  
 Savara was formed as a corporation in Delaware in 2007.  Mast was originally incorporated in Delaware in December 1995. In October 2000, Mast merged its wholly-owned subsidiary, Biokeys Acquisition Corp., with and into Biokeys, Inc. and changed its name to Biokeys Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In May 2003, Mast merged Biokeys, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary, with and into the company and changed the company’s name to ADVENTRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In March 2013, the company merged Mast Therapeutics, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary, with and into the company and changed the company’s name to Mast Therapeutics, Inc. In April 2017, the Mast merged its wholly-owned subsidiary, Victoria Merger Corp., with and into Aravas Inc. (formerly, Savara Inc.) and changed the name of the company to Savara Inc.
