ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
General
 
Reviv3 Procare is engaged in the manufacturing, marketing, sale and distribution of professional quality hair and skin care products under various trademarks and brands, and has adopted and used the trademark products for distribution throughout the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia pursuant to the terms of 12 exclusive distribution agreements with various parties throughout our targeted markets. Our manufacturing operations are outsourced and fulfilled through our co-packers and manufacturing partners. The Company purchased inventories and products from four vendors totaling approximately $343,015 (97% of the purchases at 10%, 23%, 30% and 34%) during the year ended May 31, 2022. Currently, we produce 7 products with 16 separate stock keeping units (“SKUs”) and plan to expand our product lines over the next 12 months.
 
The personal care product industry boasts roughly 750 companies that generate a combined annual revenue of more than $40 billion. The 50 largest companies comprise almost 70% of the entire revenue. Still, we believe the market will bear competition from small companies able to offer specialized products or cater to particular niche markets.
 
Makeup, deodorant and nail products comprise 33% of health and beauty care industry revenue. Hair care products generate 25% of personal care product revenue, while creams and lotions comprise 21%. Perfumes, mouthwashes, shaving preparations and other products make up the remaining revenue for beauty skin care product revenues.
 
Reviv3 Procare stands for skin health and benefits of healthy scalp and hair follicles. Currently, we sell our hair and skincare products under the Reviv3 Procare brand which includes 7 distinct products. Our Reviv3 System is a series of products which are meant to be used together or on a stand-alone basis. The hair care products consist of PREP shampoo, PRIME conditioner, and TREAT maintenance care. We also sell an introductory kit which includes all three Reviv3 System products. In addition, we have products dedicated to hair treatment and repair. Currently we have 3 products in our treatment and repair line. BOOST is designed to deliver nutrients and increase circulation to the scalp, MEND Deep Hair Repair Mask for added moisture and PROTECT, a heat protectant product to prevent damage from irons and dryers. We also have a stand-alone Thickening Spray for giving hair more volume and body.
 
On May 1, 2022, Reviv3 Procare Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Axil & Associated Brands Corp. (“Axil”), a Delaware corporation, and a leader in hearing protection and enhancement products, for the acquisition of both the hearing protection business of Axil consisting of ear plugs and ear muffs, and Axil’s ear bud business. These businesses constituted substantially all of the business operations of Axil. The acquisition did not include Axil’s hearing aid line of business, which Axil will continue to operate following the completion of the acquisition. The acquisition was completed subsequently on June 16, 2022.
 
AXIL creates high-tech hearing and audio innovations to provide cutting-edge solutions for people with varied applications across many industries. AXIL designs, innovates, engineers, manufactures, markets and services specialized systems in hearing enhancement, hearing protection, wireless audio, and communication. AXIL distributes its products through direct-to-consumer eCommerce channels and local, regional, and national retail chains. AXIL serves the sporting goods market, military, federal agents, law enforcement, tactical, fitness, outdoor, industrial, sporting, and stadium events. AXIL focuses primarily on US markets, followed by Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Africa.

Governmental Regulation
 
Currently there are no governmental regulations which materially affect our operations.
 
Customers 
 
Two customers accounted for 15% and 16%, respectively, of our net sales in the year ended May 31, 2022. No other individual customer accounted for 10% or more of our net sales in the year ended May 31, 2022. We expect that these two customers along with small number of other customers, will, in the aggregate, continue to account for a large portion of our net sales in the future. As is customary in the industry, none of our customers is under any obligation to continue purchasing products from us in the future.
 
The beauty industry is known to be resilient during economic downturns - even faring well during the Great Recession of 2008. Though consumers tend to be more price conscious during those times, they do not stop spending. In today’s environment of rising per capita incomes, the beauty business continues to be booming, although sales may be negatively impacted by rising inflation and associated decreased consumer discretionary spending.
 
The global hair care market size is projected to reach $111.98 billion by 2026, exhibiting a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 5.2% during the forecast period. Rising incidence of hair problems in urban areas is expected to be the central growth driver for the hair maintenance market, finds Fortune Business Insights™ in its recent report, titled ”Hair Care Market Size, Share & Industry Analysis, By Products (Hair Colorants, Shampoo, Conditioner, Hair Oil, and Others), By Distribution Channel (Supermarket/ Hypermarkets, Specialty Stores, Online Stores, and Others), and Regional Forecast, 2019 – 2026”. Urban spaces are a hotbed for pollution and extreme weather changes, which has led to long-term health hazards for humans and for the environment. Compounding to this is the expanding number of people in the working age group of 15 to 60 years, which has raised the overall stress quotient in big cities. A study published in the Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research in 2018 revealed that 60.3% of the working-class males reported that they are suffering from a hair loss problem, while 17.1% said that have a dandruff problem. Thus, growing prevalence of hair-related issues is emerging as one of the leading hair care market trends. The report states that the value of this market stood at $75.33 billion in 2018.

Market and Revenue Generation
 
Reviv3 Procare is focused on expanding its business-to-business salon sales through its network of domestic and international distributors. We are also continuing our focus on direct-to-consumer marketing programs through our own ecommerce site and various third-party online platforms. In addition, we are exploring other revenue channels such as co-branding and private-label manufacturing.
Employees
 
We currently have eight (8) full time employees, including our officers and a director. There are no formal employment agreements in place. Our employees are not represented by a labor union or other collective bargaining groups, and we consider relations with our employees to be good. We have currently engaged seventeen (17) individuals as outside consultants for sales, marketing and design. No formal agreements are in place.
 
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. We have recently implemented a stock options plan in order to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives. The safety, health and wellness of our employees is a top priority. 
 
Seasonality and Cyclical Nature of our Business
 
We do not believe our business is subject to substantial seasonal fluctuations. We may experience lower sales in difficult economic scenarios, but we do not foresee the seasonality of our products to be a significant factor. In the future, seasonality trends could however have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations, but we are not currently aware of the total impact that could affect our business.
 
Impact of COVID-19
 
During the year ended May 31, 2020, the effects of a new coronavirus (“COVID-19”) and related actions to attempt to control its spread began to impact our business. The impact of COVID-19 on our operating results for the year ended May 31, 2022, was limited, in all material respects, but we did experience some impact due to the government mandated measures, including closures of businesses, limitations on movements of individuals and goods, and the imposition of other restrictive measures, in efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.
 
The occurrence of an uncontrollable event such as the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively affect our future operations. A pandemic typically results in social distancing, travel bans and quarantine, and this may limit access to our facilities, customers, management, support staff and professional advisors, as well as within our vendors’ facilities. These factors, in turn, may not only impact our operations, financial condition and demand for our goods and services but our overall ability to react timely to mitigate the impact of this event. Also, it may hamper our efforts to comply with our filing obligations with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization designated COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Governments around the world have mandated, and continue to introduce, orders to slow the transmission of the virus, including but not limited to shelter-in-place orders, quarantines, significant restrictions on travel, as well as work restrictions that prohibit many employees from going to work. Uncertainty with respect to the economic effects of the pandemic has introduced significant volatility in the financial markets.
