     Item 1.  Business
     General Development of Business
     AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (“Holdings”), through its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including American Multi Cinema, Inc. and its subsidiaries, (collectively with Holdings, unless the context otherwise requires, the “Company” or “AMC”), is principally involved in the theatrical exhibition business and owns, operates or has interests in theatres primarily located in the United States and Europe. AMC is an indirect subsidiary of Dalian Wanda Group Co., Ltd. (“Wanda”), a Chinese private conglomerate. 
     As of December 31, 2017, Wanda owned approximately 59.37% of Holdings’ outstanding common stock and 81.43% of the combined voting power of Holdings’ outstanding common stock and has the power to control Holdings’ affairs and policies, including with respect to the election of directors (and, through the election of directors, the appointment of management), entering into of mergers, sales of substantially all of our assets and other extraordinary transactions.
     Our business was founded in Kansas City, Missouri in 1920. Holdings was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on June 6, 2007. We maintain our principal executive offices at One AMC Way, 11500 Ash Street, Leawood, Kansas 66211.
     Recent Developments
    
Income Taxes:  In the fourth quarter of calendar 2017, we recorded the impact of the change in the U.S. enacted federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% which reduced our deferred tax assets. In the fourth quarter and in connection with the preparation of our 2017 consolidated financial statements, we also determined that realization of our deferred tax assets in the U.S. tax jurisdictions was not more likely than not, primarily as a result of cumulative net losses recorded for three years and we recorded a full valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets in U.S. tax jurisdictions. As a result of the change in enacted tax rate and recording a full valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets in U.S. tax jurisdictions, we recorded a charge to our income tax provision of approximately $310 million in our U.S. markets for the fourth quarter of calendar 2017. See Note 9 – Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, hereof for further information.
     Nordic Acquisition:  On March 28, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Nordic Cinema Group Holding AB (“Nordic”) for cash. The purchase price for Nordic was SEK 5,756 million ($654.9 million), which includes payment of interest on the equity value and repayment of shareholder loans. As a result of the acquisition, we assumed the indebtedness of Nordic of approximately SEK 1,269 million ($144.4 million) and indebtedness of approximately €156 million ($169.5 million) as of March 28, 2017, which was refinanced subsequent to the acquisition. We also repaid approximately SEK 13.5 million ($1.6 million) and approximately €1.0 million ($1.1 million) of interest rate swaps related to the indebtedness, which were repaid following the acquisition. All amounts have been converted into U.S. Dollar amounts assuming an SEK/USD exchange rate of 0.11378 and an EUR/USD exchange rate of 1.0865, which were the exchange rates on March 27, 2017. Nordic operated or held a partial interest in 122 theatres with 683 screens in seven European countries: Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway and Denmark. This acquisition is now included within our International markets operating segment. 
     Department of Justice Final Judgment:  In connection with the acquisition of Carmike Cinemas, Inc. (“Carmike”) we entered into a Final Judgment with the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) on March 7, 2017, pursuant to which we agreed to take certain actions to enable us to complete our acquisition of Carmike, including the divestiture of 17 movie theatres (and certain related assets) in the 15 local markets where AMC and Carmike were direct competitors to one or more acquirers acceptable to the DOJ (we received gross proceeds of $25.1 million related to divested theatre assets that were held for sale and sold during the year ended December 31, 2017); establish firewalls to ensure we do not obtain National CineMedia, LLC’s (“NCM”), National CineMedia, Inc.’s (“NCM, Inc” and collectively with NCM LLC “NCM”), Screenvision’s or other exhibitors competitively sensitive information; relinquish seats on NCM’s board of directors and all other NCM governance rights; and transfer 24 theatres comprising 384 screens (which represent less than 2% of NCM’s total network) to the Screenvision network. This includes five Carmike theatres that implemented the Screenvision network prior to completion of the Carmike acquisition, an AMC theatre

required to extend its existing term with the Screenvision network, and an AMC theatre that was also included in the divestitures. The settlement agreement also requires us  to divest the majority of our equity interests in NCM, so that by June 20, 2019, we own no more than 4.99% of NCM’s outstanding equity interests on a fully converted basis per the following schedule: (i) on or before December 20, 2017, AMC must own no more than 15% of NCM’s outstanding equity interests; (ii) on or before December 20, 2018, AMC must own no more than 7.5% of NCM’s outstanding equity interests; and (iii) on or before June 20, 2019 AMC must own no more than 4.99% of NCM’s outstanding equity interests. We sold 14,800,000 NCM, Inc. common shares during the year ended December 31, 2017 and have satisfied the DOJ divestiture requirements related to NCM for calendar 2017, as calculated pursuant to the Final Judgment. In addition, in accordance with the terms of the settlement, effective December 20, 2016, Craig R. Ramsey, executive vice president and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, resigned his position as a member of the Board of Directors of NCM, Inc. and we relinquished certain other governance rights.
     NCM Agreement:  On March 9, 2017, we reached an agreement with NCM to implement the requirements of the Final Judgment entered in connection with the DOJ approval of the Carmike transaction. Pursuant to the agreement, we received 18,425,423 NCM common units in March 2017 related to annual attendance at the Carmike theatres and 361,892 NCM common units related to the 2016 common unit adjustment. Because the Carmike theatres were subject to a pre-existing agreement with a third-party and will not receive advertising services from NCM, we will be obligated to make quarterly payments to NCM reflecting the estimated value of the advertising services at the Carmike theatres as if NCM had provided such services. The quarterly payments will continue until the earlier of (i) the date the theatres are transferred to the NCM network or (ii) expiration of the ESA with NCM. All calculations will be made pursuant to the terms of the existing ESA and Common Unit Adjustment Agreement with NCM. With regard to the existing AMC theatres on the NCM network that are required under the Final Judgment to be transferred to another advertising provider, we returned 2,850,453 NCM LLC common units (valued at $36.4 million) to NCM in March 2017, calculated under the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement as if such theatres had been disposed of on March 3, 2017. We are not obligated to make quarterly payments with respect to the transferred theatres. In addition, we returned 1,807,220 additional NCM LLC common units (valued at $22.6 million) in exchange for a waiver of exclusivity by NCM as to the required transferred theatres for the term of the Final Judgment, which was classified as General and administrative: Merger, acquisition and transaction costs when the common units were returned to NCM during the three months ended March 31, 2017. 
     NCM Disposition: On September 18, 2017, we entered into an agreement to sell 12,000,000 common shares in NCM, Inc. for approximately $73.1 million, representing a price per share of $6.09. The sale was completed on September 20, 2017, and we recognized a loss on sale of approximately $17.4 million including transaction costs on the sale of the shares. On September 29, 2017, we sold an additional 2,800,000 common shares of NCM, Inc. for approximately $18.2 million representing a price per share of $6.49. We recognized a loss on sale of approximately $3.1 million including transaction costs on the sale of the shares. 
     Additional Public Offering:  On February 13, 2017, we completed an additional public offering of 19,047,619 shares of Class A common stock at a price of $31.50 per share. In connection with the additional public offering, the underwriters partially exercised their option to purchase an additional 1,283,255 shares of Class A common stock. As a result, the total size of the offering was 20,330,874 shares of Class A common stock and the net proceeds to Holdings were approximately $616.8 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. We used a portion of the net proceeds to repay the aggregate principal amount of an interim bridge loan of $350.0 million for the Carmike acquisition and for general corporate purposes.  
     Carmike Acquisition: On December 21, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Carmike for cash and stock. The purchase price for Carmike was $858.2 million comprised of cash of $584.3 million and 8,189,808 shares of our Class A common stock with a fair value of $273.9 million (based on a closing share price of $33.45 per share on December 20, 2016). We also assumed debt of $230.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Senior Secured Notes due June 15, 2023 (the “Senior Secured Notes due 2023”) in connection with the acquisition of Carmike. As of the acquisition date, Carmike operated 271 theatres and 2,923 screens located in 41 states. 
     Odeon Acquisition:  On November 30, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Odeon and UCI Cinemas Holdings Limited (“Odeon”) for cash and stock. The purchase price for Odeon was $637.1 million, comprised of cash of $480.3 million and 4,536,466 shares of Class A common stock with a fair value of $156.7 million (based on a closing sale price of $34.55 per share on November 29, 2017). In addition, we repaid indebtedness of Odeon of $593.2 million at closing. As of the acquisition date, Odeon operated 242 theatres with 2,243 screens in four major markets:

United Kingdom, Spain, Italy and Germany; and three smaller markets: Austria, Portugal and Ireland. This acquisition is now included within our International markets reportable segment. In May 2017, we disposed of one theatre acquired from Odeon as required by the United Kingdom’s Competition and Markets Authority requiring a payment by us of $11.0 million for the sale.  
     See Other Acquisitions, Dispositions, Financings and Developments below for additional information about financing for the Odeon, Carmike and Nordic acquisitions. The Odeon, Carmike and Nordic acquisitions are referred to herein as the “Acquisitions”. 
     Financial Information about Segments
     Beginning with our Odeon acquisition in 2016, we identified two reportable segments for our theatrical exhibition operations, U.S. markets and International markets. Our International markets segment includes the operations of Nordic this year as a result of the Nordic acquisition. For information about our operating segments, see Note 15 – Operating Segments in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 hereof.     Narrative Description of Business
     We are the world’s largest theatrical exhibition company and an industry leader in innovation and operational excellence. Over the course of our nearly 100 year history, we have pioneered many of the theatrical exhibition industry’s most important innovations. We introduced Multiplex theatres in the 1960s and the North American stadium-seated Megaplex theatre format in the 1990s. Most recently, we revolutionized movie-going with the deployment of our theatre renovations featuring plush, powered recliner seating. Our growth has been driven by a combination of organic growth through reinvestment in our existing assets and through the acquisition of some of the most respected companies in the theatrical exhibition industry.
     The combination of AMC, Odeon, Carmike and Nordic makes us the largest theatre operator in the world with 1,014 theatres and 11,169 screens in 15 countries as of December 31, 2017. We are the #1 theatre operator in the United States, the #1 theatre operator in the United Kingdom-Ireland, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania; the #2 theatre operator in Norway, Austria and Portugal and the #4 theatre operator in Germany. We have operations in four of the world’s ten largest economies, including four of the five largest European economies (the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy and Germany). Additionally, the combined company is the largest global procurer in theatrical exhibition of film, food and beverage items, lighting and theatre supplies.
     As of December 31, 2017, we owned, operated or held interests in 649 theatres with a total of 8,224 screens in the United States and 365 theatres and 2,945 screens in European markets. With operations in 44 states and the District of Columbia, approximately 52% of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles of one of our theatres. We have a diversified footprint with complementary global geographic and guest demographic profiles, which we believe gives our circuit a unique profile and offers strategic and operational advantages. We operate productive theaters in the top markets in the United States and have the #1 market share in the top three markets: New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. Our top five markets, in each of which we hold the #1 or #2 share position, are New York (44% share), Los Angeles (27%), Chicago (44%), Philadelphia (35%) and Dallas (29%). Strategically, these markets and our theatres in them are diverse, operationally complex and, in many cases, the scarcity of new theatre opportunities creates a significant competitive advantage for established locations against newcomers or alternative entertainment options.
     Our theatrical exhibition revenues are generated primarily from box office admissions and theatre food and beverage sales. We offer consumers a broad range of entertainment alternatives including traditional film programming, independent and foreign films, performing arts, music and sports. We also offer food and beverage alternatives beyond traditional concession items, including made-to-order meals, customized coffee, healthy snacks, beer, wine, premium cocktails and dine-in theatre options. The balance of our revenues is generated from ancillary sources, including on‑screen advertising, fees earned from our AMC Stubs® customer loyalty program, rental of theatre auditoriums, income from gift card and exchange ticket sales, and on‑line ticketing fees.
     Approximately 347 million consumers have attended AMC, Odeon and Nordic theatre circuits, combined for the year ended December 31, 2017.

 As a result of our ongoing focus to improve the quality of the movie-going experience, AMC theatres continue to maintain top-box customer satisfaction scores of nearly 60% and industry leading theatre productivity metrics. Over the period from the beginning of 2011 to December 31, 2017, we believe we have invested more than our comparable peers and believe our investments are yielding higher rates of return. According to publicly available information for our most comparable peers in the U.S. market, for the year ended December 31, 2017, our U.S. markets were #1 or #2 in revenues per patron ($15.45), food and beverage per patron ($5.06), and average ticket price ($9.67). We believe that it is the quality of our theatre locations and our customer‑focused innovation that continue to drive improved productivity per location (which we measure as increases in admissions revenues per screen relative to the industry and/or food and beverage revenues per patron).
     To ensure that we are an imaginative and bold innovator today and in the years ahead, we have established the following key priorities.
    
· | Through our marketing programs we plan to strengthen the bonds with our current guests and create new connections with potential guests, to drive more attendance and increase market share. Our focus is to capture guests’ attention before they even leave their homes by paying close attention to our brands, our loyalty program and our communication with movie-goers via the internet, either directly or through social media;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We have a keen focus on the quality of on‑screen presentation and programing content. We plan to continue investing in technical innovation that will allow us to enhance the consumer experience through premium formats such as IMAX®, Dolby Cinema™, 3D and other premium format offerings. Additionally, in recognizing the varied tastes of our guests we will continue to explore offerings of alternative content such as live concerts, sporting events, Broadway shows, opera and other non‑traditional programming to provide incremental revenue;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We expect to continue deployment of our proven theatre innovations while simultaneously developing new concepts and initiatives that will elevate the movie-going experience at our theatres;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We are committed to deploying new technologies that will allow us to prosper and thrive even as consumers look to other ways to watch movies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We plan for our growth to be driven through our guest‑focused strategy and will continue to explore growth through profitable acquisitions. We believe that acquisitions offer us additional opportunities to introduce our proven guest focused strategies to new movie-goers and will generate meaningful benefits to guests, associates, studio partners and our shareholders;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Studios, film makers and other institutions of the movie industry, whether in Hollywood or abroad, are valued partners with whom we must have cooperative and productive relationships; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We will continue to motivate our associates by generating pride in their employment at AMC. Because so much of our guest satisfaction is determined by the service delivery of our theatre teams, taking good care of our associates should translate in turn to their taking good care of our guests.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      We plan to continue investing in our theatres and upgrading the consumer experience to take greater advantage of incremental revenue-generating opportunities, primarily through an array of improved and differentiated customer experiences in (1) more comfort and convenience; (2) food and beverage; (3) engagement and loyalty; (4) sight and

      Our historic growth also has been driven by a combination of organic growth and acquisition strategies, in addition to strategic alliances and partnerships that highlight our ability to capture innovation and value beyond the traditional exhibition space. For example:
    
· | We own an interest in NCM along with Cinemark Holdings, Inc. (“Cinemark”) and Regal Entertainment Group (“Regal”) as the “Founding Members” of NCM.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      We believe that the reach, scope and digital delivery capability of NCM’s network provides an effective platform for national, regional and local advertisers to reach an engaged audience. We receive a monthly theatre access fee for participation in the NCM network. In addition, we are entitled to receive mandatory quarterly distributions of excess cash from NCM.
    
· | In December 2013, NCM spun-off its Fathom Events (“Fathom”) business to a newly formed limited liability company AC JV, LLC (“AC JV”). AC JV focuses exclusively on alternative content programming, including live and pre-recorded concerts, sporting events and other non-film entertainment.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We hold an interest in Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, LLC (“DCIP”), a joint venture charged with implementing digital cinema in our theatres, which has allowed us to substantially complete our planned digital deployments. Future digital cinema developments will be managed by DCIP, subject to certain approvals.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We own an interest in Digital Cinema Distribution Coalition, LLC (“DCDC”), a joint venture with certain other exhibitors and film distributors. DCDC was formed to develop a satellite distribution network for feature films and other digital cinema content. As of December 31, 2017, 611 of our theatre locations are equipped to receive content via the DCDC network.

      Our Strategy
     We are committed to maintaining a leadership position in the exhibition industry by focusing on forward thinking initiatives for the benefit of our guests. Improving the guest experience remains at our core and is now supported by three strategic elements: (1) Enhance, (2) Engage and (3) Expand. Consistent with our history and culture of innovation, we believe our vision and relentless focus on these three elements, which apply strategic and marketing components to traditional theatrical exhibition, will drive our future success.
1) | Enhance
---+--------

      We plan to continue investing in our theatres and enhancing the consumer experience to take greater advantage of incremental revenue-generating opportunities, primarily through comfort and convenience innovations, imaginative food and beverage initiatives, and exciting PLF offerings. 
     Comfort and Convenience Innovations - Recliner seating is the key feature of our theatre renovations. We believe that maximizing comfort and convenience for our customers will be increasingly necessary to maintain and improve our relevance. These renovations, in conjunction with capital contributions from our landlords, involve stripping theatres to their basic structure in order to replace finishes throughout, upgrade the sight and sound experience, installing modernized points of sale and, most importantly, replacing traditional theatre seats with plush, electric recliners that allow customers to deploy a leg rest and fully recline at the push of a button. The quality improvement in the customer experience drives a 30% to 50% increase in attendance, on average, at these locations in their first-year post renovation. Our customers have responded favorably to the significant personal space gains from ample row depths, ability to recline or stretch their legs, extra-wide pillowed chaise and oversized armrests. The reseated theatres attract more midweek audiences than normal theatres and tend to draw more adults who pay higher ticket prices than teens or young children. We typically do not change ticket prices in the first year after renovation, however, in subsequent years we typically increase our ticket prices by amounts well in excess of price adjustments for our non‑renovated theatres.
     We plan to continue investing in our theatres and upgrading the consumer experience to take greater advantage of incremental revenue-generating opportunities, primarily through an array of improved and differentiated customer experiences. These experiences include greater engagement and loyalty through world class marketing, a keen focus on the quality of on-screen presentation and programming content, more and faster deployment of comfort and convenience and food and beverage initiatives, all while developing and utilizing new technologies across these platforms for the benefit of our consumers.
     We also plan to open new-build theatres, explore profitable acquisitions, and expand through disciplined spot-acquisitions. A spot-acquisition is usually a single theatre that is currently leased by another party that is nearing the end of its lease term. The landlord desires to have AMC replace the existing theatre operator and assume the lease, with term extensions and perform renovations consistent with our recliner renovation program. We believe new-build construction, spot-acquisitions, and other acquisitive activity offer us additional opportunities to introduce our proven guest focused strategies to new movie-goers and will generate meaningful benefits to guests, associates, studio partners and our shareholders.
     As of December 31, 2017, we now feature recliner seating in approximately 268 theatres, including Dine-in-Theatres, totaling approximately 2,631 screens and representing approximately 25% of total screens. By the end of 2018, 

 
  10

 
we expect AMC theatres to operate 3,296 screens with recliner seating. Based on feedback from our guests, we believe there is universal appeal for the ample space, comfort and convenience of our powered recliners, and that appeal will translate into additional attendance in new markets both domestically and in Europe. As such, deploying powered recliners will be an integral strategy in the former Carmike and Odeon circuits going forward as we are targeting approximately 42% of our total screens to be comprised of screens with recliner seating by the end of 2021.
     We are currently testing new recliner seat designs and innovations that will continue to provide guests with an improved level of comfort and convenience while optimizing the number of seats available for guests post renovation. Reducing the number of seats removed during renovation, would expand the number of theatres we could renovate, allowing us to introduce our guest centered amenities to more movie-goers.
     Rebalancing of the new supply-and-demand relationship created by recliner seating presents us two further opportunities to improve customer convenience and maximize operating results: open-source internet ticketing and reserved seating.
     Open-source internet ticketing makes legacy AMC’s entire universe of seats (over 1,220,000 as of December 31, 2017), for all our show times, as available as possible, on as many websites and mobile applications as possible. Our tickets are currently on sale over the internet, either directly or through mobile apps, at our own website and app and Fandango®, Movietickets.com®, and Atom Tickets. We believe increased online access is important because it captures customers’ purchase intent more immediately and directly than if we wait for their arrival at the theatre box office to make a purchase. Carefully monitoring internet pre-sales also lets us adjust capacity in real time, moving movies that are poised to over perform to larger capacity auditoriums or more additional auditoriums, thereby maximizing yield. During calendar 2017, our internet and mobile ticketing app services sold approximately 70 million tickets for AMC.
     Reserved seating at some of AMC’s busiest theatre locations, allows our customers to choose a specific seat in advance of the movie. We believe that knowing there is a specifically chosen seat waiting for a show that promises to be a sellout is comforting to our customers, reduces anxiety around the experience and compels ticket purchases. We believe reserved seating will become increasingly prevalent to the point of being a prerequisite in the medium-term future.
     We believe the comfort and personal space gains from recliner seating, coupled with the immediacy of demand captured from open-source internet ticketing and the appeal of reserved seating make a powerful economic combination for us.
 Imaginative Food and Beverage Initiatives - Our deployment initiatives apply to food and beverage enhancements. To address recent consumer trends, we have expanded our menu of enhanced food and beverage products to include meals, healthy snacks, premium beers, wine and mixed drinks and other gourmet products. We plan to invest across a spectrum of enhanced food and beverage formats, ranging from simple, less capital‑intensive food and beverage design improvements to the development of new dine‑in theatre options. We launched the AMC Feature Fare menu in 2017 to over 300 AMC brand locations with an additional 50-100 planned in 2018. This was the largest menu overall in AMC history. The new menu included flatbread pizzas, burgers, sandwiches, more pretzel variety and healthy snack options.
     Leading the charge are our MacGuffins Bar and Lounges (“MacGuffins”) which give us a fresh opportunity to engage our over-21 customers. We believe that few innovations have won over the adult movie goer more decisively than our full-service bars featuring premium beers, wines and liquors. Extremely versatile in design with a significant impact on theatre economics, MacGuffins is our fastest growing idea in the enhanced food and beverage space. As of December 31, 2017, we offer alcohol in approximately 309 AMC theatres in the U.S. markets. We expect to increase that number to approximately 325 by the end of 2018. We believe there is ample opportunity to introduce premium beers, wines and liquors throughout the former Carmike and Odeon circuits, and we would like to install our MacGuffins concept in as many theatres globally as we can. We will continue to work with state and local officials in the United States, and the necessary officials in Europe to expand the number of theatres with this appealing amenity. Due to our success in operating MacGuffins, we believe we can leverage our substantial experience when it comes to permitting, installing and commissioning these improvements.
     Coca Cola Freestyle® puts customers in charge with over 100 drink flavor options in a technologically advanced compact footprint. Our operational excellence and history of innovation rewarded us with first-mover advantage on this 

 
  11

 
new technology, which, as of December 31, 2017, was deployed in substantially all of our AMC theatres. This technology improves the guest experience, shortens lines in our concession areas and allows for more efficient staffing.
     Our commitment to participate in new technologies is evident in the recent testing of new food and beverage functionality for our new website and mobile apps. In our reserved seat auditoriums, our innovative new service allows for advance online ordering of concession items with an advance ticket order that, in certain theatres, is then delivered to the guest’s seat at a specified time of the guest’s choosing. Initial results are encouraging, and we currently operate 40 theatres with the pre-order service. We are currently evaluating system compatibility and mobile application functionality to determine timing for deployment in Europe.
     The number of guests at legacy AMC theatres who are choosing to purchase a beverage or food item has increased from 64% of our attendance in 2011 to approximately 71% in 2017. 
     Exciting Premium Large Format Offerings - Our business is a visual and aural medium requiring a keen focus on the quality of on-screen presentation and programing content to ensure success. PLF auditoriums generate our highest customer satisfaction scores, and we believe the investment in premium formats increases the value of the movie-going experience for our guests, ultimately leading to additional ticket revenue. To that end we are committed to investing in and expanding our offerings of the best sight and sound experiences through a combination of our partnerships with IMAX® and Dolby Cinema™ and the future development of our own proprietary PLF offering.
     IMAX®—IMAX® is one of the world’s leading entertainment technology companies, specializing in motion picture technologies and presentations. IMAX® offers a unique end‑to‑end cinematic solution combining proprietary software, theater architecture and equipment to create the highest‑quality, most immersive motion picture experience for which the IMAX® brand has become known globally. Top filmmakers and studios utilize IMAX® theaters to connect with audiences in innovative ways, and as such, IMAX’s theater network is among the most important and successful theatrical distribution platforms for major event films around the world.
     As of December 31, 2017, legacy AMC was the largest IMAX® exhibitor in the U.S., with 187 (3D enabled) IMAX® screens including and a 49% market share. Each one of our IMAX® local installations is protected by geographic exclusivity, and as of December 31, 2017, our IMAX® screen count was 100% greater than our closest competitor. We also operate 22 IMAX® screens in Europe. We will also expand our IMAX® relationship into former Carmike, Odeon, and Nordic theatres as we integrate all three of the circuits, further strengthening our position as the largest IMAX® exhibitor in the U.S. and with plans to make us the largest IMAX® distributor in the United Kingdom and Europe.
     Dolby Cinema™ at AMC— Dolby Cinema™ at AMC was introduced to AMC guests in May 2015, when we partnered with Dolby Laboratories, Inc., to unveil a premium cinema offering for movie-goers that combined state‑of‑the‑art image and sound technologies with inspired theatre design and comfort. Dolby Cinema™ at AMC includes Dolby Vision™ laser projection and object‑oriented Dolby Atmos® audio technology, as well as AMC’s plush power reclining seats with seat transducers that vibrate with the action on screen.
     In August 2016, we announced the acceleration of our Dolby Cinema™ at AMC deployment and as of December 31, 2017, we operated 89 Dolby Cinema™ at AMC auditoriums. The legacy AMC circuit expects to have 160 Dolby Cinema™ at AMC auditoriums operational by the end of 2018. We expect to expand deployment of our innovative Dolby Cinema™ at AMC auditoriums into former Carmike, Odeon, and Nordic locations as we integrate all circuits.
     Prime at AMC—We believe there is considerable opportunity to add a private label PLF experience to many of our locations, with superior sight and sound technology and enhanced seating as contrasted with our traditional auditoriums. This proprietary PLF auditorium is branded Prime at AMC and offers an enhanced theatrical experience for movie-goers beyond our current core theatres, at a lower price premium as IMAX® or Dolby Cinema™ at AMC. Therefore, it may be especially relevant in smaller or more price sensitive markets.
    
2) | Engage
---+-------

      Marketing - AMC is engaging moviegoers marketing activities to strengthen the bonds with our current guests and create new connections with potential customers that drive both growth and loyalty. This effort begins with the legacy AMC loyalty program, AMC Stubs®, which we believe is one of the most popular loyalty programs in the 

 
  12

 
industry. AMC Stubs® is a customer loyalty program which allows members to earn rewards, receive discounts and participate in exclusive members‑only offerings and services. It features both a traditional paid tier called AMC Stubs Premiere™ and a new non-paid tier called AMC Stubs Insider™. Both programs reward loyal guests for their patronage of AMC theatres. The AMC Stubs Insider™ tier rewards guests for simply coming to the movies, and benefits include free refills on certain food items, discount ticket offers, a birthday gift and 20 reward points earned for every dollar spent. For a $15 annual membership fee, AMC Stubs Premiere™ members enjoy express service with specially marked shorter lines at the box office and concession stand, free size upgrades on certain food and beverage items, discount ticket offers, a birthday gift, discounted online ticketing fees and 100 points for every dollar spent. Some of the rewards earned are redeemable on future purchases at AMC locations.
     As of June 30, 2016, prior to our national relaunch, we had 2,672,000 active member households in the AMC Stubs® program. As of December 31, 2017, we had more than 11,408,000 member households enrolled in both the AMC Stubs Premiere™ and AMC Stubs Insider™ programs, combined. Our AMC Stubs® members represented approximately 23% of AMC U.S. markets attendance during the year ended December 31, 2017. We expect the number of member households to continue to increase over the next 24 to 36 months. We believe movie-goers want to be recognized and rewarded for attending our theatres and as a result, our new AMC Stubs® program is designed to strengthen guest loyalty, attract new guests and drive additional return visits. Our much larger database of identified moviegoers also provides us with additional insight into our customers’ movie preferences, and this enables us to have both a larger and a more targeted marketing effort to support our Hollywood studio partners. We intend to creatively mine this rapidly growing consumer database to increase sales and otherwise boost loyalty to AMC.
     Odeon currently has loyalty programs in all the major territories in which it operates. Odeon movie-goers can earn points for spending money at the theatre, and those points can be redeemed for tickets and concession items at a later date. Odeon currently has more than three million active members in these various loyalty programs. We are currently evaluating the Odeon loyalty programs to determine how best to reward our European movie-goers and heighten guest loyalty to drive additional attendance to Odeon theatres.
     Our marketing efforts are not limited to our loyalty program as we seek to improve our customer connections. Given the high degree of acceptance by consumers to interacting with companies through our website and apps, AMC introduced an all-new website and mobile application in 2016. The new website and app are designed to offer a more graphically rich interface, feature more robust content and improve functionality. We believe our new website and mobile application provide users with an improved online experience where they can more easily find information about movies, theatres and amenities and seamlessly purchase tickets and concessions online.
     The competitive advantage of a robust and easy‑to‑use online and mobile presence combined with an effective loyalty program that provides better market intelligence to anticipate customer’s future behavior should allow us to capture incremental share of both entertainment dollars and time. 
     Additionally, to align guest expectations and cost structures across the broader U.S. platform comprised of legacy AMC and former Carmike theatres, on March 1, 2017 we announced a differentiated multi-brand strategy.  
    
During 2017, all Carmike theatres were re-branded to be part of the AMC theatres. Every AMC location now operates under one of the following AMC brands: 
    
· | AMC Theatres – AMC Amazing. Approximately 400 theatres, located primarily in larger, more urban markets, offering the AMC amazing experience through amenities such as recliner seating, MacGuffins bars, and PLF auditoriums like IMAX® at AMC, Dolby Cinema™ at AMC, and AMC’s new proprietary PLF, “Prime at AMC.”
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | AMC Classic Theatres – America’s Hometown Theatres. Approximately 200 theatres, located primarily in smaller mid-sized and suburban markets, offering fun, friendly, amenities guests can depend on for a great movie-going experience with value in mind. These theatres will offer Coca-Cola Freestyle® machines and menu items like pretzel bites, movie nachos, and refillable annual popcorn buckets. Some AMC Classic theatres may include MacGuffins bars and Prime at AMC PLF auditoriums. The brand logo for AMC Classic incorporates the folded “C” graphical element from the legacy Carmike brand logo while adopting Carmike’s “America’s Hometown Theatres” tagline. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     
 
  13

 


· | AMC Dine-In Theatres – Movies with a Menu. Approximately 50 locations, equipped with full kitchens and MacGuffins full bars, will offer great experiences including full-service dining as well as delivery-to-seat of AMC’s menu and beverage offerings. Guests can enjoy a variety of fresh, hand-crafted menu items that rival anything they’d find at their local restaurant, as well as an exciting array of drinks and desserts; all from the comfort of their seat while taking in the latest film.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The new branding strategy is just one example of how we intend to extend our marketing strengths, including our loyalty program and our robust, easy‑to‑use online and mobile presence across our larger footprint as we work to integrate our recent acquisitions. We also expect to retain some of the existing guest engagement and marketing programs currently used at Carmike, Odeon, and Nordic to further bond with our guests.
     Target Programming - Our fundamental business, historically and now, revolves around the theatrical exhibition of Hollywood movies. If a movie is commercially available, it is likely to be playing at an AMC theatre today or tonight, because we schedule shows in the morning, afternoon and even at midnight or later, just to make sure it is convenient for our customers.
     We also are playing movies and other content originating from more sources. We believe that as diversity grows in the United States, the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe, the ability to adapt and target programming for a fragmented audience will become critical.
     For movies targeted at diverse audiences, AMC theatres frequently experience attendance levels greater than our average, national market share. AMC theatres have a strong Bollywood following with more than 60 locations serving diaspora audiences. During the year ended December 31, 2017, AMC theatres exhibited 173 popular Indian movies which generated approximately $22.0 million of box office revenue.
     Through AMC Independent™, we have also reached into the independent production and distribution community. AMC theatres played 206 films (excluding community programming and film festivals) during 2017, generating $175.0 million in U.S. box office revenue.
     Fathom is the recognized leader in the alternative entertainment industry, offering a variety of one-of-a-kind entertainment events in movie theaters nationwide that include live, high definition performances of the Metropolitan Opera, the performing arts, major sporting events, music concerts, comedy series, Broadway shows, original programming featuring entertainment’s biggest stars, socially relevant documentaries with audience Q&A and much more. We are working with Fathom to further broaden our programming options to appeal to even wider audiences.
     We believe we are a vital partner for Hollywood studios and for independent distributors because we generate more box office revenue per screen and provide stronger in theatre and online promotional exposure for their movies. To that end, we are committed to working with our studio partners to further innovation, exchange ideas and discover mutually beneficial ways to expand movie-going. 
    
3) | Expand
---+-------

      We intend to grow through the deployment of our strategic growth initiatives and will continue exploration of acquisitions. Our acquisition strategy combines discipline and purpose with a strong investment thesis for each transaction that we believe will drive value in the long term. 
     Disciplined new-build theatres and acquisitions expand the platform, whether domestically or internationally, upon which to further deploy our proven strategic initiatives while further diversifying AMC’s consumer base, leading to greater appeal for more films. 
     The additional scale achieved through new build theatres and acquisitions also serves to benefit AMC through global procurement savings and increased overhead efficiencies. We believe that expansion offers us additional opportunities to introduce our proven guest focused strategies to new movie-goers and will generate meaningful benefits to guests, associates, studio partners and our shareholders.
     We believe significant financial opportunities exist in our current portfolio of theatres both in the United States and in Europe, and we have a substantial pipeline of investments to exploit that offer incremental attendance-generating and revenue-generating prospects. By expanding through new-build development and acquisitions and deploying 

 
  14

 
building-by-building solutions from a proprietary menu of proven, customer-endorsed comfort and convenience, enhanced food and beverage, and premium sight and sound concepts, we believe we have the formula for continuing growth and success.
     Our Competitive Strengths
     We believe we have the following competitive strengths:
     Leading Market Share in Important, Affluent and Diverse Markets— Across the three biggest metropolitan markets in the United States—New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, representing 20% of the country’s total box office—we hold a 36% combined market share. As of December 31, 2017, we have theatres located in 24 of the top 25 U.S. markets, holding the #1 or #2 position in 22 of those 25 markets based on box office revenue. On any given weekend, nearly one-half of the top ten theatres for the #1 opening movie title in the United States are AMC theatres, according to data provided by Rentrak. We are also the #1 theatre operator in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy and Spain; the #2 operator in Austria and Portugal; and the #4 operator in Germany. We believe our strong presence in these top markets makes our theatres highly visible and therefore strategically more important to content providers, who rely on the large audiences and marketing momentum provided by major markets to drive opinion‑making and deliver a movie’s overall box office results.
     We have a diversified footprint with complementary global geographic and guest demographic profiles. There are inherent complexities in effectively and efficiently serving them. In some of our more densely populated major metropolitan markets, there is also a scarcity of attractive retail real estate opportunities. Taken together, these factors solidify our market share position. Further, our history and strong presence in these markets have created a greater opportunity to introduce our enhanced customer experience concepts and exhibit a broad array of programming and premium formats, all of which we believe drive higher levels of attendance and higher revenues at our theatres.
     The recent Carmike acquisition further diversifies our footprint with theatres located in complementary suburban and rural markets as well as in geographic areas of the United States like the southeast, where legacy AMC did not have a strong presence. Guests from different demographic and geographic profiles have different tastes in movies, and we believe by broadening our geographic base, we can help mitigate the impact of film genre volatility on our box office revenues.
     Well Located, Highly Productive Theatres—Our U.S. theatres are generally located in the top retail centers across the United States. We believe this provides for long-term visibility and higher productivity, and is a key element in the success of our Enhanced Food and Beverage and More Comfort and Convenience initiatives. Our location strategy, combined with our strong major market presence and our focus on a superior customer experience, enable us to deliver industry-leading theatre-level productivity. During the year ended December 31, 2017, six of the ten highest grossing theatres in the United States were AMC theatres, according to data provided by Rentrak. During the same period AMC’s U.S. markets average total revenues per theatre was approximately $6.0 million. This per unit productivity is important not only to content providers, but also to developers and landlords, for whom per location and per square foot sales numbers are critical measures. The net effect is a close relationship with the commercial real estate community, which often gives us first‑look and preferred tenant status on emerging opportunities.
     Legacy Carmike theatres, are located primarily in smaller, suburban and rural markets, which affects total revenues per theatre. However, in general, theatres located in smaller suburban and rural markets tend to have less competition and a lower cost structure, and we believe when combined with our innovative strategic initiatives that productivity will improve.
     Many Odeon theatres share similar characteristics as legacy AMC theatres in that they tend to be located in the top retail centers in major metropolitan markets with higher visibility. We believe that deploying our proven strategic initiatives in these markets will help drive attendance and greatly improve productivity. 
     The Nordic theatres are in larger and mid-sized cities and towns in affluent Northern Europe as well as in the Baltic region. The theatres are well maintained including some with AMC-like amenities already evident. With a modern, up-to-date circuit and very high market share, the Nordic theatres will require some investment but not nearly the amount expected for the Odeon theatres. Nordic has an ample pipeline of new-build and renovation opportunities 

 
  15

 
already identified, and with some investment in our enhanced food and beverage and premium sight and sound initiatives, we believe there are ample growth opportunities.
     Selectively Participating in a Consolidating Industry—Throughout the last two decades, AMC has been an active participant in our industry’s consolidation. We intend to selectively explore acquisitions in the U.S. and internationally where the characteristics of the location, overall market and facilities further enhance the quality of our theatre portfolio. 
     Additionally, our focus on improving the customer experience and our strong relationships with landlords and developers have provided opportunities to expand our footprint in existing markets by acquiring competitors’ existing theatres at the end of their lease term at little or no cost. We believe that our More Comfort and Convenience and Enhanced Food and Beverage concepts have high appeal to landlords wanting to increase traffic and sales in their retail centers. These “spot acquisitions” have given us the ability to bolster our presence in existing markets at relatively low cost and more quickly (weeks, months) as compared to new builds (months, years).
     Substantial Operating Cash Flow—For the years ended December 31, 2017, December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, AMC’s net cash provided by operating activities totaled $577.4 million, $431.7 million, and $467.6 million, respectively. We believe that our strategic initiatives, highly productive theatre circuit and continued focus on cost control will enable us to generate sufficient cash flow provided by operating activities to execute our strategy, to grow our revenues, maintain our facilities, service our indebtedness, continue our stock repurchase plan and pay dividends to our stockholders.
     Experienced and Dynamic Team—Our senior management team, led by Adam Aron, President and Chief Executive Officer, has the expertise that we believe will be required to transform movie-going from a commodity to a differentiated entertainment experience. A dynamic and balanced team of executives combines long-tenured leaders in operations, real estate and finance who contributed to building AMC’s hard-earned reputation for operations excellence with creative entertainment and restaurant industry executives in marketing, programming and food and beverage who bring to AMC business acumen and experience that support innovation in theatrical exhibition.
     Our senior management team has experience operating both domestic and international theatres. 
     With a technology platform in our Theatre Support Center that provides for real-time monitoring of AMC screens across the country and a workplace conducive to collaboration and teamwork, our management team has the organization well aligned with our strategy.
     Furthermore, we believe that our people, the nearly 39,800 AMC associates, constitute an essential strength of AMC. They strive to make movie-going experiences at AMC theatres always a treat. We create events and want our customers to always feel special at an AMC theatre. 
     Key Strategic Shareholder—Our key strategic shareholder, the Dalian Wanda Group Co. (“Wanda”), is one of the largest, privately-held conglomerates in China. Wanda is our single largest shareholder with a 59.37% ownership stake as of December 31, 2017. In addition to its core business as a prominent developer and owner of commercial real estate, Wanda also owns related businesses in entertainment, hospitality and retail. Wanda is the largest theatre exhibition operator in China through its controlling ownership interest in Wanda Cinema Line. The combined ownership and scale of AMC and Wanda Cinema Line has enabled us to enhance relationships and obtain better terms from important food and beverage, lighting and theatre supply vendors, and to expand our strategic partnerships with IMAX® and Dolby®. When our scale and Wanda’s growth are taken into account, we believe AMC is the most efficient and effective partner a content owner has. Wanda is controlled by its chairman, Mr. Jianlin Wang.
     Film Content
     Box office admissions are our largest source of revenue. We predominantly license “first-run” films from distributors owned by major film production companies and from independent distributors on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis. Film exhibition costs are accrued based on the applicable admissions revenues and estimates of the final settlement pursuant to our film licenses. Licenses that we enter into typically state that rental fees are based on aggregate terms established prior to the opening of the picture. In certain circumstances and less frequently, our rental fees are based on a mutually agreed settlement upon the conclusion of the picture. In some European territories, rental fees are 

 
  16

 
established on a weekly basis for the coming week’s percentage forecast. Some European licenses use a per capita agreement instead, paying a flat amount per ticket, where the sum is agreed in long-term agreements in advance of the film showing. Under an aggregate terms formula, we usually pay the distributor a specified percentage of box office gross or pay based on a scale of percentages tied to different amounts of box office gross, or in Europe, we pay based on the number of weeks since release. The settlement process allows for negotiation based upon how a film actually performs. 
     During the 2017 calendar year, films licensed from our seven largest distributors based on revenues accounted for approximately 88% of our U.S. admissions revenues. In Europe, approximately 77% of our box office revenue came from films attributed to our six largest distributors. Our revenues attributable to individual distributors may vary significantly from year to year depending upon the commercial success of each distributor’s films in any given year.
    
Our revenues are dependent upon the timing and popularity of film releases by distributors. The most marketable films are usually released during the summer and the calendar year-end holiday seasons. Therefore, our business is highly seasonal, with higher attendance and revenues generally occurring during the summer months and holiday seasons. Our results of operations may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year.
     North American film distributors typically establish geographic film licensing zones and license on a film-by-film basis to one theatre in each zone. In film zones where we are the sole exhibitor, we obtain film licenses by selecting a film from among those offered and negotiating directly with the distributor. In competitive zones, where we compete with one or more exhibitors to secure film, distributors generally allocate their films to the exhibitors located in that area based on screen capacity, grossing potential, and licensing terms. In Europe, local markets are not broken up into licensing zones in the same way, therefore there is rarely a restriction on cinemas opening a film in that market. The exception is smaller films opening on a limited print number. We negotiate directly with all distributors to manage for the opening of new films. 
     Food and beverage
     Food and beverage sales are our second largest source of revenue after box office admissions. Food and beverage items traditionally include popcorn, soft drinks, candy and hot dogs. Different varieties of food and beverage items are offered at our theatres based on preferences in the particular geographic region. Our traditional food and beverage strategy emphasizes prominent and appealing food and beverage offerings designed for rapid service and efficiency, including a customer friendly self-serve experience. We design our theatres to have more food and beverage capacity to make it easier to serve larger numbers of customers. Strategic placement of large food and beverage operations within theatres increases their visibility, aids in reducing the length of lines, allows flexibility to introduce new concepts and improves traffic flow around the food and beverage stands.
     To address recent consumer trends, we have expanded our menu of enhanced food and beverage products to include made-to-order drinks and meals, customized coffee, healthy snacks, premium beers, wine and mixed drinks and other gourmet products. We plan to continue investment across a spectrum of enhanced food and beverage formats, ranging from simple, less capital-intensive food and beverage design improvements to the development of new dine-in theatre options. The costs of these conversions in some cases are partially covered by investments from the theatre landlord. We currently operate 28 Dine-In Theatres that deliver chef-inspired menus with seat-side or delivery service to luxury recliners with tables. Our recent Dine-In Theatre concepts are designed to capitalize on the latest food service trend, the fast casual eating experience.
     Employees
     As of December 31, 2017, we employed 4,332 full-time and 35,511 part-time employees. We consider our employee relations to be good.
     Theatrical Exhibition Industry and Competition
     U.S. Markets
     Movie-going is embedded in the American social fabric. For over 100 years people young and old, of all races and socio-economic levels, have enjoyed the entertainment that motion pictures offer.
    
 
  17

 

 In the United States, the movie exhibition business is large, stable and mature. While in any given calendar quarter the quantity and quality of movies can drive volatile results, box office revenues have generally advanced from 2011 to 2017. The industry’s best year ever, in terms of revenues, was 2016, with box office revenues of approximately $11.4 billion, an increase of approximately 2.0% from 2015 with over 1.3 billion admissions in the U.S. and Canada. The Industry’s U.S. and Canada box office for 2017 was $11.1 billion, with over 1.2 billion admissions, a decline of approximately 2.7% from 2016.
     The movie exhibition business has survived the booms and busts of economic cycles and has adapted to myriad changes in technology and customer behavior. There is great value for the entertainment dollar in movie-going, and no replacement has been invented for the escape and fun that a night at the movies represents.
     We believe the exhibition business is in the early stages of a transition. After decades of economic models driven by quantity (number of theatres, screens and seats), we believe it is the quality of the movie-going experience that will define future success. Whether through enhanced food and beverage options (Food and Beverage Kiosks, Marketplaces, Coke Freestyle®, MacGuffins or Dine-in Theatres), more comfort and convenience (recliner seating, open-source internet ticketing, reserved seating), engagement and loyalty (AMC Stubs®, open-source internet ticketing, mobile apps, social media) or sight and sound (digital projectors, 3D, Dolby Cinema™ at AMC, other PLF screens or IMAX®), it is the ease of use and the amenities that these innovations bring to customers that we believe will drive sustained profitability in the years ahead. 
     The following table represents information about the U.S./Canada exhibition industry obtained from the National Association of Theatre Owners (“NATO”) and Box Office Mojo:
    
 | Box Office | | | | Average | | |

2010 | | 10,566 | | 1,339 | | | 7.89 | 5,399 | 38,902
2009 | | 10,596 | | 1,413 | | | 7.50 | 5,561 | 38,605
2008 | | 9,631 | | 1,341 | | | 7.18 | 5,403 | 38,201
2007 | | 9,664 | | 1,405 | | | 6.88 | 5,545 | 38,159
2006 | | 9,210 | | 1,406 | | | 6.55 | 5,543 | 37,765

      Based on information obtained from Rentrak, we believe that the four largest exhibitors, in terms of U.S. / Canada box office revenue (Regal Entertainment Group, AMC, Cinemark Holdings, Inc. and Cineplex Inc.) generated approximately 65% of the box office revenues in 2017. This statistic is up from 35% in 2000 and is evidence that the theatrical exhibition business in the U.S. / Canada have been consolidating.
     International Markets
     Movie-going is a popular leisure activity with high penetration across Odeon’s and Nordic’s key geographies. Theatre appeal has proven resilient to competition for consumers’ leisure spending and to recessionary periods and we believe we will continue to benefit from increased spending across international markets. The European market lags the U.S. market across a number of factors, including annual spend per customer, number of IMAX® screens and screens per capita that cause us to believe that the deployment of our customer initiatives will be successful in these markets. On the other hand, our European markets are more densely populated and operate with fewer screens per one million of population, making the screens we acquired more valuable.
     While in any calendar year the quantity and quality of movies can drive results, in the medium term theatre attendance has remained consistent since 2012 across Odeon’s key geographies. Additionally, International markets have become increasingly important. The percentage of total box office revenues attributable to International markets increased from 69% in 2012 to 72% in 2015 and is expected to continue to increase to 75% by 2019. U.S. films generate

the majority of the box office in Europe, but movie-goers in specific geographies welcome locally produced films with local actors and familiar story lines which can mitigate film genre attendance fluctuations. Going forward, we believe we will see positive growth in theatre attendance as we deploy our proven guest centered innovations like recliner seating, enhanced food and beverage offerings and premium large format experiences. 
     Our theatres are subject to varying degrees of competition in the geographic areas in which they operate. Competition is often intense with respect to attracting patrons, licensing motion pictures and finding new theatre sites. Where real estate is readily available, it is easier to open a theatre near one of our theatres, which may adversely affect operations at our theatre. However, in certain of our densely populated major metropolitan markets, we believe a scarcity of attractive retail real estate opportunities enhances the strategic value of our existing theatres. We also believe the complexity inherent in operating in these major metropolitan markets is a deterrent to other less sophisticated competitors, protecting our market share position.
     The theatrical exhibition industry faces competition from other forms of out-of-home entertainment, such as concerts, amusement parks and sporting events, and from other distribution channels for filmed entertainment, such as cable television, pay-per-view, video streaming services, and home video systems, as well as from all other forms of entertainment.
     Movie-going is a compelling consumer out-of-home entertainment experience. Movie theatres currently garner a relatively small share of overall consumer entertainment time and spend, leaving significant room for further expansion and growth in the United States and internationally. In addition, our industry benefits from available capacity to satisfy additional consumer demand without capital investment.
     Regulatory Environment
     The distribution of motion pictures is, in large part, regulated by federal and state antitrust laws and has been the subject of numerous antitrust cases. The consent decrees, resulting from one of those cases to which we were not a party, have a material impact on the industry and us. Those consent decrees bind certain major motion picture distributors and require the motion pictures of such distributors to be offered and licensed to exhibitors, including us, on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis. Consequently, we cannot assure ourselves of a supply of motion pictures by entering into long-term arrangements with major distributors, but must compete for our licenses on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis.
     Our theatres in the United States must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA. Compliance with the ADA requires that public accommodations “reasonably accommodate” individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations made to “commercial facilities” conform to accessibility guidelines unless “structurally impracticable” for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations. Non-compliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, fines, and awards of damages to private litigants or additional capital expenditures to remedy such noncompliance. As an employer covered by the ADA, we must make reasonable accommodations to the limitations of employees and qualified applicants with disabilities, provided that such reasonable accommodations do not pose an undue hardship on the operation of our business. In addition, many of our employees are covered by various government employment regulations, including minimum wage, overtime and working conditions regulations. In Europe, all territories have similar national regulations relating to disabilities.
     Our operations also are subject to federal, state and local laws regulating such matters as construction, renovation and operation of theatres as well as wages and working conditions, citizenship, health and sanitation requirements and licensing. We believe our theatres are in material compliance with such requirements.
     We own and operate theatres and other properties that operate in the United States, United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Germany, Austria, Portugal, Ireland, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway and Denmark, which are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations. Certain of these laws and regulations, including those relating to environmental protection, may impose joint and several liability on certain statutory classes of persons for the costs of investigation or remediation of contamination, regardless of fault or the legality of original disposal. We believe our theatres are in material compliance with such requirements.

     Seasonality
     Our revenues are dependent upon the timing of motion picture releases by distributors. The most marketable motion pictures are usually released during the summer and the year-end holiday seasons. Therefore, our business is highly seasonal, with higher attendance and revenues generally occurring during the summer months and holiday seasons. Our results of operations may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.     Financial Information About Geographic Areas
