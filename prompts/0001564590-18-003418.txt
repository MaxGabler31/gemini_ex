ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Business
 Overview
 Sun Hydraulics Corporation (“Sun,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”), founded in 1970, in Sarasota, FL, is an industrial technology leader that develops and manufactures solutions for both the hydraulics and electronics markets.  In the hydraulics market, operating under the brand Sun Hydraulics, we are a leading manufacturer of high-performance screw-in hydraulic cartridge valves, electro-hydraulics, manifolds, and integrated package solutions for the worldwide industrial and mobile hydraulics markets. In the electronics market, operating under the brands of Enovation Controls, Murphy, Zero Off and HCT, we are a global provider of innovative electronic control, display and instrumentation solutions for both recreational and off-highway vehicles, as well as stationary and power generation equipment 
 Sun has operated in the North American market for over 48 years.  We expanded our global footprint over the past 30 years to include operations in the U.K., Germany and South Korea, as well as sales offices in China, India and South America.  Enovation Controls, LLC (“Enovation Controls”), which was acquired by Sun on December 5, 2016 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sun, was formed in 2009 in connection with the reorganization of Murphy Group, Inc. and EControls Group, Inc. which were founded in 1939 and 1994, respectively.  Enovation Controls operates the majority of its manufacturing in Tulsa, OK with sales and engineering capabilities in San Antonio, TX, the U.K., China and India.  Until December 2017, High Country Tek (“HCT”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sun, operated in Nevada City, California as an independent designer and producer of modular, robust, reliable digital and analog electronic controller products for the fluid power industry sold under the brand of HCT.  Subsequent to the Enovation Controls acquisition, the activities of HCT and Enovation Controls were closely coordinated. On December 29, 2017, we merged the operations of HCT and Enovation Controls, with Enovation Controls remaining as the surviving legal entity.   Enovation Controls will continue to sell HCT products under the HCT brand. 
 Until 2016, we operated primarily in the hydraulics market with a small presence in the electronics market through HCT.   On December 5, 2016, we purchased the Power Controls and Vehicle Technologies businesses of Enovation Controls, retaining the legal entity and related brands.  The expansion of our electronic and digital capabilities through the acquisition of Enovation Controls was a significant step towards achieving our Vision 2025 goals.  The acquisition further diversified our business, granting us access to the new, highly specialized marine, power generation and recreational vehicle markets and customers seeking complete machine control.  Enovation Controls also brought a strong talent pool with a proven track record of new product development and technical innovation, complementing our existing competencies.  
 On February 19, 2018, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the shares of Polyusus Lux IV S.à r.l., a Luxembourg limited liability company, which owns Faster S.p.A., an Italian joint stock company (“Faster”), from Capvis Equity IV LP, a fund advised by the Swiss private equity firm Capvis Equity Partners AG, and other co-investors, for €430 million (approximately $531 million) in cash, less outstanding debt and unpaid transaction costs and other deductions from the purchase price as agreed to by the parties.  The acquisition will be funded with approximately $161 million of cash on hand and $370 million drawn against our revolving credit facility, including exercise of the revolver’s accordion.  
 Faster is a leading global manufacturer of quick-release hydraulic coupling solutions and is engaged in the business of designing, engineering and distributing hydraulic coupling solutions focused in the agriculture, construction equipment and industrial markets.  Its primary markets include agriculture, construction equipment and general industrial applications.  Headquartered in Milan, Italy, Faster has manufacturing operations co-located with its headquarters as well as in Toledo, Ohio and Pune, India.  Additionally, the company has sales offices in Shanghai, China; São Paulo, Brazil; and Langenfeld, Germany.
 We believe the acquisition of Faster is in alignment with our Vision 2025 goals, advancing the Company as a global technology leader in the industrial goods sector while maintaining superior profitability and financial strength.  Faster further diversifies the Company more deeply into the growing global agriculture market and broadens the Company’s global footprint, advancing its ‘in the region, for the region’ initiative.”
 Faster recorded 2017 sales of €105 million (approximately $130 million) and an adjusted 2017 EBITDA margin of 27.5%.  The acquisition is expected to be accretive to GAAP earnings in 2018 and beyond.
 2

The closing of the transaction, which is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2018, is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including, among others, the preparation and delivery of certain audited financial statements of Faster, all as determined in accordance with the Purchase Agreement.
 We have been profitable every year since 1972 and Sun has paid a dividend every quarter since going public in January 1997. 
 The Company’s executive offices are located at 1500 West University Parkway, Sarasota, Florida 34243, and our telephone number is (941) 362-1200. Our websites include www.sunhydraulics.com, www.enovationcontrols.com and www.zerogps.com.
 Strategy & Vision 2025
 In 2016, we announced our Vision 2025 for Sun.  We believe we can reach a critical mass of $1 billion in annual sales by 2025 while remaining a technology leader in the industrial goods sector.  Additionally, we believe we can maintain superior profitability and financial strength. There are two significant components to reaching the revenue goal: organic growth and acquisitions.  We expect that, by 2025, up to $650 million of the anticipated annual $1 billion in revenue will result from organic growth of our existing segments (specifically $450 million from our Hydraulics segment and $200 million from our Electronics segment), with the remaining $350 million to be derived from acquisitions of companies that advance our technology position with adjacent products for the industrial goods sector and broaden our geographic reach.  We will seek acquisition targets that will bring us advanced technologies in the industrial goods sector.  Generally, targets should be accretive in the first year and contribute to maintaining Sun’s superior profitability and financial strength long-term.  This is imperative to creating lasting shareholder value.  Our current initiatives for organic growth include new product development to expand our electro-hydraulic product offering, penetrating new geographic markets, expanding sales and marketing efforts in existing geographies, developing new channels to market to reach customers not currently in Sun’s purview and further diversifying our end market penetration. 

Sun’s strategic roadmap includes product and service differentiation, disciplined and thoughtful leadership throughout our global organization and ensuring that all processes and activities consider the view of the customer.  We have identified and have begun applying several tactics to execute our strategies which include capitalizing on our unique and deeply rooted values, structured human capital development and differentiated engineering for both products and processes.  Internal key performance indicators are used on a daily basis to align our short-term actions with our long-term strategy.
 A primary focus of our strategic thinking is the identification of megatrends, such as globalization, which will impact the future capital and industrial goods markets.  We have identified three megatrends: globalization, growing sophistication of safe machinery and equipment, and increased computing power as further described below: 
 Globalization. We believe global population growth and urbanization, driven predominantly by Asian mega-cities, will generate ongoing demand for infrastructure projects, resources and food production, all of which require equipment and machinery from our key end markets.  
 3

Sophistication of safe machinery and equipment.  Machine users increasingly demand safety, productivity, efficiency, and even automated control. Advancements in the design of these machines require continuous evolution of critical components such as hydraulic and electronic functionality control.  
 Increased computing power.  In the current electronic and digital age, electronics are increasingly used to activate processes which were once activated only manually or mechanically.  Information is increasingly being converted into a form that allows it to be processed, stored and transmitted digitally, resulting in both time and energy savings.  
 Our culture of innovation is at the core of our business. We have approximately 200 engineers in support of product innovation, as well as technical support and customer service.  We believe our product innovation will aid organic growth and fill the expected demand resulting from the identified megatrends.  All growth initiatives are intended to preserve Sun’s history of superior profitability and financial strength.
 Business Segments
 Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2016, we are now organized into two operating and reporting segments: Hydraulics and Electronics.  The Hydraulics segment consists of all of the historical Sun Hydraulics companies globally.  Nearly all of the Electronics segment consists of the recently acquired Enovation Controls business. Financial information about our business segments is presented in Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.  
Hydraulics
 Over the past 48 years, the Hydraulics segment has provided global capital goods industries with hydraulic components and systems used to transmit power and control force, speed and motion. Our products typically add a fine degree of precision and safety to the machinery and equipment in which they are used.
 Sun’s hydraulics products are sold globally through a combination of wholly-owned companies, representative sales offices, independent channel partners, which includes value-add distributors and integrators, and original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”).  Activities at Sun companies and sales offices include technical support, inventory warehousing, distributor management and custom manifold design and manufacturing. Our global channel partner network includes representation in many industrialized markets. Channel partners are the local experts in our products.  They typically hold a certain amount of local inventory and transact all business with customers. In 2016, we started adding more application specialists in the field, to facilitate problem-solving directly for OEMs, in conjunction with our channel partners. These activities are in alignment with our “In the region, for the region” initiative.
 On a component level, the Hydraulics segment designs and manufactures screw-in hydraulic cartridge valves, manifolds, and integrated fluid power packages and subsystems. Our products provide an important function within a hydraulic system: to control rates and direction of fluid flow and to regulate and control pressures.
 Our screw-in hydraulic cartridge valves use a fundamentally different design platform compared to most other competitive product offerings, which are often referred to as industry common products. The floating construction that we pioneered results in a self-alignment characteristic that provides performance and reliability advantages compared to most competitors’ product offerings. This floating construction differentiates our products from those of most of our competitors, who design and manufacture rigid screw-in cartridge valves that fit a common cavity.  Our cartridge valves, offered in five size ranges and including both electrically actuated and non-electrically actuated products, were designed to be able to operate reliably at higher pressures, making them equally suitable for both industrial and mobile applications.  Sun’s product development approach yields a product line of extreme breadth and depth compared to our competitors.  Our broad scope of product offering, coupled with the high performance characteristics of our cartridge valves, makes Sun a leader in our industry. 
 To fully leverage our cartridge product family, we routinely compete in the manifold and custom integrated package market.  A manifold is a solid block of metal, usually aluminum or ductile iron, which is machined to create threaded cavities and channels into which screw-in cartridge valves can be installed and through which the hydraulic fluid flows.  These products allow customers to easily integrate our screw-in cartridge valves into their machinery and equipment.  Once designed, standard manifolds require minimal, if any, maintenance engineering over the life of the product and can be manufactured at each of our hydraulics manufacturing operations. An integrated package consists of multiple cartridge 
 4

valves assembled into a custom designed manifold for a specific customer to provide the specific operating characteristics of a customer’s circuit.  Because of the unique nature of our cartridge valve designs, manifolds may be designed and machined to make them up to 50% smaller when compared to manifolds that use only industry common cartridge valves.  
 Additionally, we have internally-developed proprietary expert system software that we use to manufacture custom manifolds efficiently in low volumes. Integrated packages provide many benefits to end users and equipment manufacturers, including reduced assembly time, order simplification, reduced leakage points, aesthetics, potentially fewer hose and fitting connections, and more control functions in a single location.
 Hydraulic systems are increasingly taking signals from on-board electronic control systems making it necessary for hydraulic products to be capable of digital communication.  In response to this, in recent years, we have aggressively expanded our offering of electrically-actuated cartridge valves.  In 2017, we introduced two new electro-hydraulic product lines, FLeX™ and XMD.  XMD represents the first joint product development project between our Electronics and Hydraulics business segments. 
 The new Sun FLeX™ family includes competitively priced, high-performance electro-hydraulic products. These sixteen completely new solenoid-operated cartridge valves and three new coils are the first products in the FLeX Series Solenoid Valves for both the mobile and industrial hydraulics markets. The valves are designed to outperform comparable valves in the market. They are virtually leak proof poppet-style valves that deliver consistently better pressure drop. Coil options include interchangeable low-power, high power and hazardous location (explosion-proof) versions for expanded configuration flexibility.  The FLeX Series valves use Sun’s unique floating-style design, adding an extra layer of security in those harsh applications where torque and force can become excessive.
 XMD is our new compact, Bluetooth configurable electro-hydraulic driver. XMD is a high-powered, electronic control device for electrically operated hydraulic actuators that is built to stand up to extreme environmental conditions in mobile and industrial applications. The XMD is the first of its kind from Sun and was jointly engineered by a team consisting of our Hydraulics and Electronics segment personnel. The XMD Bluetooth-configurable electro-hydraulic driver meets the needs of international mobile and industrial equipment. The XMD serves actuators used in on- and off-highway equipment in numerous applications including agriculture, forestry, construction, marine, earth moving and material handling.
 We do not warrant our products for use in any of the following applications: (i) any product that comes under the Federal Highway Safety Act, such as steering or braking systems for passenger-carrying vehicles or on-highway trucks, (ii) aircraft or space vehicles, (iii) ordnance equipment, (iv) life support equipment, and (v) any product that, when sold, would be subject to the rules and regulations of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
 Electronics
 In 2016 we acquired Enovation Controls to further develop our digital and electronic capabilities in accordance with our strategy.  A portion of the product portfolio offered by Enovation Controls serves end markets also served by our Hydraulics segment such as off-highway vehicles including construction, agricultural and utility vehicles as well as material handling equipment.  However, the majority of Enovation’s products are sold into end markets not historically served by our Hydraulics segment such as marine, power generation and recreational vehicles.  This provides additional diversification of Sun’s revenue base. 
 Globally, electronics products are sold primarily direct to OEM customers, with a small portion sold through independent, authorized channel partners.  End markets within the Electronics segment are divided into two lines of business: Power Controls (“PC”) and Vehicle Technologies (“VT”).  PC serves a variety of end markets, some of which are outlined below, with products such as displays, panels, gauges, controllers, battery chargers and various end devices.  VT serves the recreational vehicles end market with products such as electronic controls, displays and instrumentation. 
 Power Controls 
 For the off-highway market, Enovation Controls offers rugged and reliable instruments, coupled with expertise in J1939 engine protocol, to produce an industry-leading array of easy-to-read displays and gauges for controller area network (CAN) transmitted engine data and faults. Our PowerView™ system goes a step further with even more focus on the operator interface: larger, full-graphic displays; flexible hardware configurations; multi-language support; class-leading environmental protection; and software tools that deliver the ultimate solution for OEM display customization and CAN control.  Product categories include traditional mechanical and electronic gauge instrumentation; plug and go CAN-based 
 5

instruments; after-market support through global distribution; complete, custom panel and console offerings; engineering and application specialists; 3D solid modeling; proprietary hardware and software development and wiring harness design and manufacturing.
 For the agricultural market, Enovation provides a compact, customizable, all-in-one unit that meets the needs of engine-driven pumping equipment applications. Using dedicated microprocessor-based, single engine controllers, we offer field-adjustable operating parameters that can be changed without the need for a computer. Enovation Controls' controllers are built tough with the ability to withstand a wide ambient temperature range. Some of them come standard in a National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) 4 rated enclosure secured by four rubber shock mounts.  Enovation Controls' products are a tested solution for pumps and irrigation.
 For the panel solutions market, we offer top-quality design and simple, turnkey solutions. Our Industrial Panel Division offers engineers dedicated to applications, wire harnesses, panels and software development. Engineers focus entirely on custom and standard solutions built to desired specifications.  Our services go beyond design and development including on-site installation and testing with reviews to ensure the solution works with the application out of the box.  
 For the fluid power industry, through our HCT brand, we design and manufacture electronic controllers, which manage the function of electrically actuated hydraulic components. HCT brand products range from simple one valve, manually adjusted controllers to fully integrated hydraulic control systems managing multiple hydraulic valves as well as other input and output products such as joysticks and displays. All controllers are potted and therefore impervious to outside influence, making them ideal for mobile, industrial and marine applications.
 Enovation Controls consistently sets and meets specification standards that are rarely matched by our competitors. Our solutions are designed to work in a variety of harsh environments: wet or dry, hot or cold, dirt or mud. Many of our products offer protection for extreme heat and cold, environmental sealing and water resistance.  In order to ensure durability across a wide range of environmental conditions, we perform extensive testing on each instrument that comes off our assembly lines so they are ready to meet the most demanding applications.
 We also offer a full line of products for the commercial marine market as boat builders move towards a more integrated solution approach. We provide instrumentation and control solutions for applications in the commercial marine market from fishing vessels and tugboats to offshore drilling workboats.
 Vehicle Technologies 
 Enovation Controls is a leader in display and control integration solutions for the recreational vehicle markets which include watercraft, all-terrain vehicles, snowmobiles and motorcycles. We offer our customers the ability to customize screens for our PowerView™ line of displays. Our displays offer easy-to-read, bonded LCD graphical views with the industry's best readability even in direct sunlight or harsh water conditions.  In addition, our Zero Off brand provides GPS-based speed control for waterski and wakeboard boats. We offer industry leading integrated solutions by combining high-quality displays with controls and instrumentation.  
 Vehicle Technologies group enables Marine and Recreational Vehicle OEMs to create solutions that outpace automotive and give end users the best of the consumer electronics world, with hardware that can withstand the environmental challenges.  Transforming the vehicles with cutting-edge technology, we connect users and their recreational vehicle more elegantly and seamlessly than the competition.  
 Custom engineered solutions include processors with enough memory to allow products to stay current, even years after launch, best-in-class sunlight viewability and touch screen technology that is adaptable for specific use, whether it be on the water in a boat, or with gloves on a motorcycle.  Our technology reaches beyond the cockpit and into the users’ environment, by integrating virtually every function into a customized infotainment interface.  This allows the Vehicle Technologies group to target large customers or industries who see value in this level of integration and ruggedness, thus our customer list contains a wide variety of OEM applications. Our unmatched commitment to testing and quality ensures that our components thrive in the rugged environments which provides us with the ability to develop products for use in any outdoor environment.  
 The growth of the Vehicle Technology group is driven by developing application expertise in targeted industries by immersing ourselves in the world of our customers to create a truly customized solution in less time than our competitors.  Ongoing revenue is achieved with the current customer base by continued advancements in software and hardware which 
 6

increases the overall Enovation Controls content, and new customers are evaluated for fit and long term viability before being pursued.    
 Engineering
 Engineers play an important role in all aspects of our business, including design, manufacturing, sales, marketing and technical support. Engineers work within a disciplined set of design parameters that encourage the repeated incorporation of existing parts into new products. Engineers work closely with manufacturing personnel to define the processes required to manufacture products reliably and consistently.
 Both of our segments have manufacturing engineers who are responsible for evaluating and changing manufacturing processes as well as implementing lean initiatives throughout global operations.   
 Hydraulics
 Our Hydraulics segment engineers are comprised of two distinct groups: sustaining and innovation.  The sustaining engineering group focuses on improving existing products, both from a design as well as a manufacturing perspective including optimizing manufacturing costs.  The innovation engineering group is responsible for new product development and evaluating future needs, from a product perspective, of the hydraulics industry.  Additionally, our field application specialists are engineers with local customer interface.
Electronics
 Our Electronics segment engineers are comprised of four distinct groups: R&D, application, software and sales.  Engineering of new products is often very fast paced and is completed in a collaborative manner with each OEM based on product release date.  All engineering groups have significant interface with the customer which enables them to understand market demands and identify opportunities for technological advancement, driving market share gains.   
 New product development generally starts in the VT line of business, driven by the need for innovative products by VT customers.  Once products are released and in use by VT customers, they become available for sale to PC customers as well.  
 Manufacturing
 Hydraulics
 We utilize a process intensive manufacturing operation that makes extensive use of automated handling and assembly technology (including robotics), where possible, to perform repetitive tasks, thus promoting manufacturing efficiencies and workplace safety. We employ lean technologies to continually improve our productivity and efficiency. We are somewhat vertically integrated and have the capability to manufacture many of the parts that go into our products, although the majority of unfinished parts are purchased from trusted suppliers.  We control most critical finishing processes in-house but rely on a small network of outside manufacturers to machine cartridge parts to varying degrees of completeness. Many high-volume machining operations are performed exclusively at outside suppliers. We are selective in establishing our supplier base and attempt to develop and maintain long-term relationships with suppliers.
 At our U.S. manufacturing plants, we have extensive testing facilities that allow us to test fully all cartridge valve products. We also utilize testing facilities in our manufacturing plants located in the U.K., Germany and South Korea.  A metallurgist and complete metallurgical laboratory support our design engineers and in-house heat treatment.
 We hold minimal finished goods inventory, typically at our overseas facilities, and rely on our channel partners  to purchase and maintain sufficient inventory to meet customers’ demands. We maintain best-in-class lead times, giving us a competitive advantage. Most raw materials, including aluminum and steel, are delivered on a just-in-time basis. These and other raw materials are commercially available from multiple sources.
 We continually review all of our suppliers to improve the quality of incoming parts and to assess opportunities for better control of price, quality and lead times. Our quality systems at our U.S. facilities are in compliance with ISO 9001:2015 for design, manufacture, and distribution of high performance screw-in hydraulic cartridge valves and manifolds used to control force, speed and motion in fluid power systems. Those in the U.K. are certified to ISO 9001:2015 for the design and 
 7

manufacture of aluminum and ferrous manifold bodies, hydraulic control valves and cartridge valves.  Quality systems in Germany are certified to ISO 9001:2015 for the design, distribution and manufacturing of hydraulic components for mobile and industrial applications.  Finally, quality systems in South Korea are certified to ISO 9001:2009 and 14001:2009 for the design, development and production of hydraulic valves.
 Electronics
 We offer a wide range of advanced manufacturing and engineering capabilities, including mechanical and electronic hardware design, software design, product testing, in-house LCD bonding, panel and harness engineering and more.  State-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities include surface mount technology, x-ray inspection and LCD bonding. Multipoint functional testing delivers higher quality products for our customers.  We are a project-based organization, backed by vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities. 
 A global integrated operating system, which utilizes intelligent approaches like lean manufacturing and six sigma for maximum productivity, allows us to identify and remove variables in our manufacturing and business processes. By pinpointing areas for improvement, we are able to provide our customers with faster delivery time and higher quality products.  
 Our facilities feature focused in-house cells dedicated to specific product production, such as Surface-Mount Technology (SMT), Panel, Wire and Sheet Metal.  Testing on a product specific basis is performed in these cells before manufacturing can be completed.  LCD bonding is performed in-house and allows for complete bonding of the LCD to the glass in order to provide long-term durability without yellowing, delamination or degradation. 
 We hold significant raw materials and finished goods inventory in our Tulsa, OK facility.  Finished goods inventory contains high demand items which require quick delivery.  Raw materials inventory generally has fairly significant lead times, therefore raw material inventory is held in significant quantities to enable us to fulfill orders based on customer request dates which are often less than three weeks.  
 Quality systems at our U.S. facilities are in compliance with ISO 9001:2015 for design, manufacture, and sale of rugged instrumentation, panels, displays, and electronic control solutions for engines and engine-driven equipment serving the commercial, industrial and recreational markets. Quality systems at our U.K facility are certified to ISO 9001:2008 for the sales, marketing, support and logistics of pressure, temperature, and level instrumentation, as well as battery chargers, power supply units and shock switches and the design and manufacture of battery chargers and power supply units.   
 Sales and Marketing
 Hydraulics
 In the U.S. market, Hydraulic products are sold primarily through independent fluid power channel partners. In most international markets, products are often sold directly to OEMs. Technical support is provided by experts based at each of our operations (U.S., U.K., Germany, South Korea, India, China and South America).
 We currently have 149 channel partners, 118 of which are located outside the United States and a majority of which have strong technical backgrounds or capabilities, which enable them to develop practical, efficient, and cost-effective fluid power systems for their customers. In 2017, sales to our largest distributor represented less than 6% of the consolidated net sales of our Hydraulics segment.  We sell approximately 22% of our products directly to OEMs, primarily located outside the US.
 In addition to channel partners and OEMs, we sell directly to other companies within the hydraulics industry, including competitors, which incorporate our products into their hydraulic products or systems. We believe that making it easy for other manufacturers to buy our products provides them with a better alternative than developing competing products themselves.  
 We provide end users with technical information through Sun’s website and catalogues in multiple languages, including all information necessary to specify and obtain our products. We believe this approach helps stimulate demand for our products.  
 8

Electronics
 Electronic products are sold globally, primarily directly to OEM customers.  Building strong partnerships with OEMs is a priority.  24-hour customer service support and an in-house technical service department is available before, during and after the initial sale to create sustainable partnerships with our customers.  
 Our VT line of business sells products to a small group of large OEMs, whereas the PC line of business sells products to a large number of customers of varying sizes.  Overall, approximately 12% of segment sales are derived from independent, authorized channel partners.
 We rely on direct customer contacts to stimulate demand for our products.  We work closely with our customers to design and deliver innovative reliable products for specific applications.  
 Competition
 Hydraulics
 Competitors in the hydraulics market are broken down into three categories:  full-line hydraulics system producers, cartridge valve only producers, and low cost producers. Most competitors market globally.  Full-line producers have the ability to provide complete hydraulic systems to their customers, including component functionally similar to those manufactured by Sun.  Cartridge valve only producers are like Sun in that they only offer cartridge valves and integrated packages, while additional parts of the hydraulics system are obtained from other manufacturers.  Low cost producers are competitors who have emerged in low cost production areas such as Asia and Eastern Europe. These competitors will typically copy both our products and like products designed by competitors to fit industry common cavities. Low cost producers typically have a limited product range compared to full line or cartridge valve only producers which also limits the opportunities for which they can be competitive. 
 We believe that we compete based upon the quality, reliability, price, value, speed of delivery and technological characteristics of our products and services.
 Electronics
 Competition within the electronics market is very broad with competitors ranging from large multi-national companies with a full electronics offering to small niche companies who specialize in one product type.  Enovation Controls is a niche player in the displays, gauges and instrumentation panel markets. 
 The market for Power Controls and Vehicle Technologies is relatively fragmented with the top four to six companies comprising 70% of the market, mostly servicing the automotive space.  Enovation Controls differentiates itself through product quality, customization ability and service with a focus on low volume niche markets that are not well served by the large competitors. 
 Our overall position in our key markets is defensible due to high barriers to switching suppliers, such as up front engineering and programming costs, and positive perceptions among core customers on key selection criteria, including quality and service. 
 Employees
 As of December 30, 2017, we have approximately 1,150 full-time employees with 950 in the Americas, 120 in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and 80 in Asia Pacific.  No employees are represented by a bargaining union in any of our operating units, and we believe that relations with our employees are good. 
Patents and Trademarks
 In addition to trade secrets, unpatented know-how, and other intellectual property rights, we own a number of patents, trademarks and copyrights relating to certain of our products and businesses.  We believe that the growth of our business is dependent upon the quality and functional performance of our products and our relationship with the marketplace, rather than on any single patent, trademark, copyright, or other item of intellectual property or group of patents, trademarks or copyrights.
