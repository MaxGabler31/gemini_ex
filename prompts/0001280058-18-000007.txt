ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Description of Business
We are the world’s leading cloud software company powering social good. Serving the entire social good community—nonprofits, foundations, corporations, education institutions, healthcare institutions and individual change agents—Blackbaud connects and empowers organizations to increase their impact through software, services, expertise, and data intelligence. Blackbaud brings more than three decades of leadership to this sector: since originally incorporating in New York in 1981 and later reincorporating as a South Carolina corporation in 1991 and as a Delaware corporation in 2004, our tailored portfolio of software and services has grown to support the unique needs of vertical markets, with solutions for fundraising and constituent relationship management ("CRM"), marketing, advocacy, accounting, peer-to-peer fundraising, corporate social responsibility ("CSR"), school management, ticketing, grantmaking, financial management, payment processing and analytics. Our solutions are designed to meet the needs of virtually all types of organizations in the social good community, from major global institutions to local soup kitchens. At the end of 2017, we had over 40,000 customers located in over 50 countries. We are deeply proud to play a part in our customers’ successes in their missions to cure diseases, advance education, preserve and share arts and culture, help animals, support those in need and more.
Market Overview
The philanthropic industry is significant, and our addressable market is substantial and growing
In the U.S. alone, there were approximately 1.6 million nonprofit organizations registered with the Internal Revenue Service in 2016, which includes nonprofit organizations, education institutions and healthcare institutions. Worldwide, there are millions more organizations in this space. Corporations and foundations are also active participants in the social good community, and billions of individuals will donate funds, volunteer their time, advocate for a cause or otherwise engage with social good organizations. According to Giving USA, donations made to U.S. nonprofit organizations in 2016 were $390 billion, amounting to 2.1% of U.S. GDP, a 2.7% increase from 2015. The average annual rate of change in total giving dollars over the last 40 years was 6.7%.
Our estimated current total addressable market ("TAM") is $8.2 billion. This includes an expansion into new and near adjacencies in 2017 from our acquisitions of AcademicWorks, Inc. ("AcademicWorks") which supports scholarship management, within the education market, and Giving Limited ("JustGiving"), which supports personal crowdfunding capabilities for individuals.
Traditional methods of fundraising and organizational management are often costly and inefficient
Many nonprofits use manual methods or stand-alone software applications not specifically designed for fundraising and organizational management for institutions like theirs. Such methods are often costly and inefficient because of the difficulties in effectively collecting, sharing, and using donation-related information. Furthermore, general purpose software applications frequently have limited functionality and do not efficiently integrate multiple databases. Some nonprofit organizations have developed proprietary software, but doing so is expensive, requiring on-site technical personnel for development, implementation and maintenance.

The nonprofit industry faces particular operational challenges
Nonprofit organizations, educational institutions and healthcare institutions must efficiently:

• | Solicit funds and build relationships with major donors;


• | Garner small cash contributions from numerous contributors;


• | Manage and develop complex relationships with large numbers of constituents;


• | Advocate for policies and behaviors that advance their cause or institution;


• | Communicate their accomplishments and the importance of their mission online and offline;


• | Comply with complex accounting, tax and reporting requirements that differ from those for traditional businesses;


• | Solicit cash and in-kind contributions from businesses to help raise money or deliver products and services;


• | Provide a wide array of programs and services to individual constituents and beneficiaries; and


• | Improve the data collection and information sharing capabilities of their employees, volunteers and donors by creating and providing distributed access to centralized databases.

Because of these challenges, we believe nonprofits, healthcare institutions and educational institutions can benefit from software applications and services specifically designed to serve their particular needs and workflows to grow revenue, work effectively and accomplish their missions.
Corporations, grant making institutions and foundations also face unique challenges
Corporations, grant making institutions and foundations, face their own unique challenges, including the need to:

• | Quantify and improve the impact of their grants;


• | Cultivate better relationships with grantees;


• | Achieve better internal collaboration and alignment with board members, reviewers and other stakeholders;


• | Illustrate the impact of their corporate philanthropy efforts to the communities they serve;


• | Engage employees in meaningful volunteering, giving and other activities;


• | Ensure that their philanthropic efforts align with their business initiatives;


• | Manage all of a foundation's activities, including fundraising and accounting;


• | Expand the reach of their fundraising efforts; and


• | Cultivate new and existing donors.

Strategy
Our objective is to maintain and extend our position as a leading provider of cloud software and services for the global social good community, supporting their missions from fundraising to delivering outcomes. Our key strategies for achieving this objective are to:
Delight our customers
We intend to make our customers' experience with us effective, efficient and satisfying from their initial interest in our solutions and services through their decision to purchase, engage with customer support and utilize solution enhancements. We continue to focus on initiatives aimed at improving the consistency and quality of user experience across the offerings we provide to our customers. We continue to evolve the manner in which we package and sell our offerings to provide high quality and value combined with flexibility to meet the different needs of our existing and prospective customers. For example, we have increased the number of our cloud solutions sold under a subscription pricing model, which can make it easier for customers to purchase our solutions. In addition, we are continuing to integrate value-adding capabilities such as payment services, analytics and business intelligence into our suite of solutions to better address our customers' needs

Blackbaud, Inc.

with comprehensive offerings. We will continue to focus on providing the highest level of solution support, enhancing our existing solutions and developing new solutions and services designed to help our customers to be more effective and achieve their missions.
Execute on our Four-Point Growth Strategy
During 2017, we continued to execute on our four-point growth strategy targeted to drive an extended period of solution and service innovation, quality enhancement, increasing operating efficiency and financial performance:

1. | Integrated and Open Solutions in the Cloud

We will continue to transition our business to predominantly serve customers through a subscription-based cloud delivery model, enabling lower cost of entry, greater scalability and lower total cost of ownership to our customers. There is a concerted effort underway to optimize our portfolio of solutions and integrate powerful capabilities — such as built-in data, analytics, payment services and tailored user-specific experiences — to bring even greater value and performance to our customers.
During 2017, we introduced SKY AI™ and SKY Analytics™, the intelligence engine behind the growing number of insights integrated into Blackbaud cloud software solutions, powered by artificial intelligence including machine learning, cognitive technology, predictive analytics and other advanced technologies. With SKY AI and SKY Analytics, we are enabling data-driven decisions by pairing one of the industry's largest data sets with an advanced set of integrated AI capabilities, ultimately having greater impact on our customers and their missions. For example, Affluence Insight, a new donor management segmentation tool enables the identification of annual, mid-level and major gift prospects. It offers the ability to use AI-powered analytics to identify high-value donor prospects and predict a prospect's likelihood to give. These embedded intelligence capabilities are one outcome of Blackbaud's Intelligence for Good™ approach — combining AI, Analytics and big data and expertise to drive insight for our customers across our solution portfolio.
We also made several portfolio announcements during 2017, ranging from solution integrations, to new capabilities for existing solutions, to new solution introductions.

2. | Drive Sales Effectiveness

We are making investments to increase the effectiveness of our sales organization, with a focus on enabling our expanding sales teams with the talent, processes and tools to accelerate our revenue growth and improve effectiveness. In 2017, we created a new Senior Vice President of Global Sales position to lead sales effectiveness across the organization. We continued to make investments in our sales, marketing and customer success organizations and improved our market coverage by deploying these resources into key markets, while bifurcating sales to focus on either finding new customers or cultivating existing customers. In addition, we are continuing to optimize our go-to-market sales strategies such as offering solutions and services tailored to the needs of customers operating within vertical markets including K-12 private schools, foundations, higher education and healthcare institutions, among others. Our sales teams are now fully running and managed on a common sales operating model. This includes common procedures, training, key operating metrics, compensation plans and reporting, which is driving increased productivity.

3. | Expand TAM into Near Adjacencies with Acquisitions and Product Investments

We will continue to evaluate compelling opportunities to acquire companies and acquire or build technologies and services. We will be guided by our acquisition criteria for considering attractive assets that expand our total addressable market ("TAM"), provide entry into new and near adjacencies, accelerate our shift to the cloud, accelerate revenue growth, are accretive to margins and present synergistic opportunities. 
In 2017, we launched Blackbaud Labs as a means to incubate new ideas and foster our strong culture of innovation and creativity, with the sole focus of bringing new capabilities to market organically. We also announced the promotion of our new Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Business Development, who led the effort for many of our acquisitions, including AcademicWorks and JustGiving.

4. | Improve Operating Efficiency

We have largely completed the installations of best-in-breed back-office solutions that consolidate and standardize our business operations utilizing scalable tools and systems. Our focus is now shifting towards optimizing those systems, as well as operational excellence and quality initiatives focused on streamlining processes to gain efficiency and scalability. Our organizational model, which we have evolved over the last few years, is largely complete and allows us to gain efficiency and consistency in how we execute. We have centralized our operations, including marketing, sustained engineering, product management, finance, customer support, customer success and professional services, which allows us to better manage the entire customer experience. 
During 2017, in an effort to improve operating efficiency and further our organizational objectives, we also initiated a plan to relocate some of our existing offices to highly modern and more collaborative workspaces with short-term financial commitments. These workspaces are also more centrally located for our employees and closer to our customers.
Attract Top Talent and Actively Engage Employee Base
Our customer's passion is our purpose, and we have incredible customers whose missions make the world a better place for all of us. Driven by this purpose, our employees come to work every day knowing they can make a real difference with our customers, and thus the world. Collaboration, innovation and high standards are core to our culture and help enable the great work we do. We strive to hire the best employees and provide a workplace where their talents and potential are realized. Our employees' engagement is a focus of every leader at Blackbaud, and we continually work to understand what matters and to make our workplace better. We believe people with a passion for purpose can join our team and have a unique career experience. Our leaders are committed to our employees' personal and career development and continually work to improve the training and tools provided to their teams.    
Build our Reputation as an Industry Thought Leader 
In our 36 years of experience in the philanthropic market, we have gained significant insight into the market and industry segments in which we operate. We produce a wide range of thought leadership materials, including blogs, monthly indices and white papers, which provide insights and guidance to the social good community. We also participate in a number of industry forums where we exchange views and engage with industry and governmental leaders. Our annual user conference, bbcon™, is used in part as a forum to offer thought leadership to our customers, as are other market specific user conferences such as our annual K-12 conference. We intend to expand these activities and further build our reputation as a thought leader within the industry. Additionally, the Blackbaud Institute for Philanthropic Impact brings together the best minds in philanthropy to develop and share leading-edge research and insight that accelerates the impact of the social good community. The research and reports the Blackbaud Institute produces serve to strengthen the social good community as a whole.
Operating Structure
Change in Reportable Segments
Prior to the fourth quarter of 2017, our three market groups, the General Markets Group ("GMG"), the Enterprise Markets Group ("EMG"), and the International Markets Group ("IMG"), represented our three operating and reportable segments. As is discussed above, we have centralized our business operations over the last few years to allow us to gain productivity, efficiency and scalability. Areas of our operations we have centralized, include, but are not limited to, marketing, finance, sales excellence, human resources, corporate IT, legal and contracting, real estate and facilities, research and development, customer support, customer success, product management, professional services and training services. With our organizational model now largely complete, we made changes to our internal reporting structure in the fourth quarter of 2017 to better support and assess the operations of our business going forward. As a result, commencing with the fourth quarter of 2017, a measure of profitability is no longer available at the market group level and our chief operating decision maker now uses consolidated financial information to make operating decisions, assess financial performance and allocate resources. Our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer ("CEO"). We assessed the resulting effect on our operating segments, reportable segments, as well as our reporting units for annual goodwill impairment testing, and determined that we now have one operating segment, one reportable segment and one reporting unit. We have restated prior period financial information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to reflect this change.

Nonprofit organizations use our performance and industry analysis reports to assess marketing and operational effectiveness and also to influence operational planning.
Payment Services
Our solutions provide our customers payment processing capabilities that enable their donors to make donations and purchase goods and services using numerous payment options, including credit card and automated clearing house (“ACH”) checking transactions, through secure online transactions.

The service also provides customers with a payment card industry (“PCI”) compliant process and streamlined bank reconciliation. As discussed above, we also provide our K-12 private school customers with student tuition payment processing services.

Our Customer Success organization is responsible for managing the business and technical relationship with our customers. Their mission is to develop and foster relationships within all levels of the customer organization to build more demonstrated value in our solutions and services.

Blackbaud, Inc.

Training
We provide a variety of onsite, instructor-led online and on-demand training services to our customers relating to the use of our solutions and application of best practices. Our instructors have extensive training in the use of our solutions and present course material that is designed to include hands-on lab exercises, as well as course materials with examples and problems to solve.
Customers
At the end of 2017, we had over 40,000 customers including nonprofits, foundations, corporations, education institutions, healthcare organizations and other charitable giving entities. Our largest single customer accounted for approximately 1% of our 2017 consolidated revenue.
Sales and Marketing
The majority of our solutions and related services are sold through our direct sales force. Our direct sales force is complemented by a team of account development representatives responsible for sales lead generation and qualification. These sales and marketing professionals are primarily located throughout the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. As of December 31, 2017, we had 434 direct sales employees. We plan to continue expanding our direct sales force in the Americas, Europe and Australia as our operations grow internationally and market demand increases.
We generally begin a customer relationship with the sale of one of our cloud solutions, such as Raiser's Edge NXT, and then offer additional solutions and services to the customer as the organization's needs increase.
We conduct marketing programs to create brand recognition and market awareness for our solutions and services. Our marketing efforts include participation at tradeshows, technical conferences and technology seminars, publication of technical and educational articles in industry journals and preparation of competitive analyses. Our customers and strategic partners provide references and recommendations that we often feature in our advertising and promotional activities.
We believe relationships with third parties can enhance our sales and marketing efforts. We have and will continue to establish additional relationships with companies that provide services to the nonprofit industry, such as consultants, educators, publishers, financial service providers, complementary technology providers and data providers. These companies promote or complement our nonprofit solutions and provide us access to new customers.
Corporate Philanthropy and Volunteerism
Blackbaud operates under a fundamental belief that the world would be better if good took over. The company is an active participant in the ecosystem of good, working to drive positive change both through what we do as a business and how we serve individually. We offer an array of philanthropy programs aimed at engaging our employees as agents of good, including matching gifts, competitive grants that honor excellent examples of volunteerism, employee-led grants committees, skills-based volunteerism initiatives, as well as science, technology, engineering and mathematics focused community programs. Blackbaud attracts people who are committed to service, with 86% saying our focus on nonprofits was a driver in their decision to join the company, 85% actively serving as volunteers and 25% serving on a nonprofit board or committee.
Competition
The market for software and related services in the nonprofit sector is competitive and highly fragmented. For certain areas of the market, entry barriers are low, as general tools for small businesses can usually be configured to manage the most basic marketing, contact management, and accounting needs of nonprofits. However, once basic needs are met, programs unique to nonprofits like fundraising, gift and grant management, and peer-to-peer activism require highly specialized tools that are more complex to build or customize out of general business software. Moreover, because nonprofits rely heavily on relationships with and among their supporters, integration of these systems drives value beyond mere efficiency. Hence, we believe our experience, the full spectrum of our current solutions and our ability to deliver on future solutions makes us a strong competitor. We expect to continue to see new competitors as the market matures and nonprofit organizations rely more heavily on technology to manage emerging revenue channels and increasingly complex operations.

2017 Form 10-K | 11

Blackbaud, Inc.

Our competition falls into four primary categories: (1) niche products that are tailored to specialized needs; (2) vertical-specific solutions; (3) general business software that can be configured to manage some nonprofit-specific processes; and (4) consumer-oriented fundraising platforms.
Niche products are usually developed as a solution for a single problem at an organization and are adopted by similar organizations to solve a specialized need. These are typically offered by vendors who may have deep industry expertise but may not have the resources to expand beyond a specialized area. We believe we compete against these solutions by offering a set of integrated solutions rather than a single point solution, which we believe improves the overall customer experience. In addition, our open platform allows integration to specialized applications so the opportunity for disruption from these competitors is minimized.
Vertical-specific solutions are offered by competitors seeking to meet the enterprise-wide needs of a specific sub-segment of nonprofits. Typically, these solutions are offered by vendors who may offer either a point solution or integrated suite of products used by a vertical. We believe we compete successfully against these competitors through a combination of our integrated suite of offerings within verticals where we compete, offering solutions with market leading robustness as well as the scale, reach, and reputation of our organization.
General business software vendors such as Salesforce.com and Oracle, compete with us in certain areas of our business. However, they generally do not have nonprofit specific focus and, therefore, do not offer or intend to offer nonprofit-specific versions. As these products are also not easily customized, the adoption of general business software is limited to nonprofits with very basic operations and simple needs. We believe our solutions compete successfully against general business software as a nonprofit’s needs grow more complex. There is a subset of general business software competitors who have introduced nonprofit-specific versions of their products. We believe that because these products were not originally designed to support the specific needs of nonprofits, they are not yet capable of meeting market needs without significant customization. As a result, we believe we are able to compete successfully to meet nonprofit-specific requirements, often integrating with general business platforms used for their more generalized operations.
Consumer-oriented fundraising platforms such as GoFundMe and Virgin Money Giving compete with our business where consumers raise funds directly. To drive adoption of their platforms, these vendors rely on a combination of direct-to-consumer marketing, marketing to nonprofits who in turn market to their supporters, and marketing to intermediate entities such as an event sponsor who will market to participants. We believe we compete well in this market through a combination of positive brand recognition among all three of these groups and the strength of our consumer-oriented tools relative to those of the competition.
Less frequently, we compete with providers of traditional, non-automated fundraising service providers, including parties providing services in support of traditional direct mail or email campaigns, special events fundraising, peer to peer, telemarketing and personal solicitations. We believe we compete successfully against these traditional fundraising service providers, primarily because our solutions and services are more automated, more robust, more tailored to the needs of nonprofit organization and more efficient.
Research and Development
We have made substantial investments in research and development and expect to continue to do so as a part of our strategy to introduce additional innovative solutions and services. As of December 31, 2017, we had 669 employees working on research and development.

Technology and Architecture
Our cloud technology, SKY, combines the latest in cloud platform and infrastructure, leading edge development processes, and a modern and open micro service-oriented architecture, and is the foundation for all of our next generation solutions. The first of our solutions shipped were Raiser's Edge NXT and Financial Edge NXT, but virtually all new capabilities are being developed on top of the SKY platform. One component of SKY, SKY API®, gives customers, partners and other application developers access to industry-standard, open, REST-based APIs and a comprehensive set of resources that enable them to integrate with or extend functionality of our solutions. Additionally, SKY UX®, our open-sourced user

experience framework, increases the reach of our solutions by enabling developers to create interfaces that look and feel like a Blackbaud solution. In 2017, SKY UX continued to mature with the release of version 2 which added new functionality while also increasing the performance and available tooling and testing. You'll see SKY UX in Blackbaud's next generation solutions including Raiser’s Edge NXT, Financial Edge NXT, Blackbaud Outcomes, the next generation of Luminate Online, our K-12 On Suite, and many other capabilities that are lighting up across our product portfolio. The SKY architecture enables rapid releases, scalable and high-quality services, and speedier time to market.
Each of our Luminate solutions, including Luminate Online, Luminate CRM and TeamRaiser, are cloud-based applications that are open and extensible and employ a multi-tenant architecture requiring only a web browser for customer access. Luminate Online and TeamRaiser share a common codebase and database, and are built on the Java runtime environment. Luminate CRM is built on the SalesForce.com platform.
Regardless of solution choice, our development strategies are designed to be:

• | Flexible. Our component-based architecture is programmable and easily extended by our customers without requiring modification of the source code, ensuring that the technology can be extended to accommodate changing demands of our customers and the market.


• | Adaptable. The architecture of our applications allows us to easily add features and functionality or to integrate with third-party applications in order to adapt to our customers' needs or market demands.


• | Scalable. We combine a scalable architecture with the performance, capacity and load balancing of industry-standard web servers and databases used by our customers to ensure that the applications can scale to the needs of larger organizations.
