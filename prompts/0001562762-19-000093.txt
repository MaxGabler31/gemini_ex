ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 ﻿
 Overview and Industry Background
 ﻿
 Our Business 
     Since 1993, BroadVision has been a pioneer and consistent innovator of e-business solutions. We deliver a combination of technologies and services into the global market that enable customers of all sizes to power mission-critical e-business initiatives that ultimately deliver high value to their bottom line. Our offering consists of a robust framework for secure, mobile and cloud-based collaboration, information sharing, and knowledge management, which enables our customers to deploy enterprise-class employee and customer engagement, knowledge management, and e-commerce solutions.
 ﻿
 Corporate Information 
     We were incorporated in Delaware in 1993 and have been a publicly traded corporation since 1996. From 2001 to date, our annual revenue has declined and as of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $1.3 billion. The majority of our accumulated deficit to date has resulted from non-cash charges associated with our 2000 acquisition of Interleaf, Inc. and restructuring charges related to excess real estate lease obligations. 
 ﻿
 Our principal executive offices are located at 460 Seaport Court, Suite 102, Redwood City, CA 94063. Our telephone number is (650) 331-1000. Our website address is www.broadvision.com. We make available free of charge through our website our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to these reports as soon as reasonably practicable after filing, by providing a hyperlink to the Securities and Exchange Commission's website (www.sec.gov) directly to our reports. The contents of our website are not incorporated by reference into this report.
 ﻿
 Recent Developments
 ﻿
 On January 2, 2019, we entered into a Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement with Vmoso, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“VMSO”), for the purchase of 745,000 shares of VMSO’s Series A Preferred Stock for a purchase price comprising the contribution of our intellectual property and other assets valued by our Board of Directors at $745,000. The contributed assets represent substantially all of the intellectual property and other assets relating to our Clearvale and Vmoso platforms, including our current Clearvale and Vmoso products and our My Vmoso Network (“MVN”) development project. VMSO will continue the commercialization of the Clearvale and Vmoso products and the development of MVN.   
 ﻿
 Following the completion of VMSO’s sale of Class 1 Common Stock described below, the shares of Series A Preferred Stock owned by our company represent approximately 19.9% of the total number of shares of VMSO’s capital stock outstanding. The rights, preferences and privileges of VMSO’s Series A Preferred Stock include a liquidation preference of $1.00 per share.
 ﻿
 On January 2, 2019, Dr. Pehong Chen, our and VMSO’s President and Chief Executive Officer and our largest stockholder, purchased 3,000,000 shares of VSMO’s Class 1 Common Stock, representing approximately 80.1% of the total number of shares of VMSO’s capital stock outstanding after such purchase, for a purchase price of $3,000,000 in cash pursuant to a Class 1 Common Stock Purchase Agreement between Dr. Chen and VMSO.
 ﻿
 On January 2, 2019, we entered into a Services and Facilities Agreement (the “Intercompany Agreement”), with VMSO, the terms of which provide for the payment of certain fees to us by VMSO, in exchange for the contribution of our expertise, resources, services, as well as the limited use of our facilities in VMSO’s business and operations. The Intercompany Agreement became effective as of January 1, 2019 and shall continue for a period of one year, unless earlier terminated, and shall be renewable upon written consent from both parties.
 ﻿
 We and VMSO anticipate that, pursuant to the Intercompany Agreement, we will provide substantially all of the personnel, facilities and equipment required for VMSO’s operations for the foreseeable future. The fees contemplated by the Intercompany Agreement are generally intended to permit us to recover the cost to us of providing these personnel, facilities, and equipment.
     Since Dr. Chen is both our President, Chief Executive Officer, Interim Chief Financial Officer and our largest stockholder, as well as the President and Chief Executive Officer and majority shareholder of VMSO, we are deemed under common control with VMSO and will treat VMSO as a consolidated variable interest entity and will consolidate its financial results with ours. Similarly, we also discuss Clearvale, Vmoso and MVN as ours throughout this annual report even though they are now owned by VMSO. However, as a result of the consummation of the VMSO financing, our share of the potential upside, but also our exposure to the development and commercialization cost, of Clearvale, Vmoso and MVN has been significantly reduced.

Industry Background
     E-business has become an integral part of work life and organizations are looking for ways to reduce costs, improve productivity and increase revenues by moving their business onto mobile and cloud platforms. By providing a way to quickly assemble and engage employees and customers via mobile and cloud-based solutions, organizations can deliver better engagement experiences to get more done with fewer resources.  A significant number of industry analysts have highlighted the ways in which organizations can reduce costs and improve customer satisfaction by implementing mobile and cloud solutions which can leverage key resources anytime and from anywhere. In addition to accelerating the response time to customers, e-business engagement applications also enable organizations to deliver higher quality services through more effective collaboration among providers of products and services.
 ﻿
 Building on the solid foundation of BroadVision’s personalization and transaction management capabilities, BroadVision has introduced the Clearvale family of Enterprise Social Networking (ESN) solutions to include engagement of partners, suppliers and customers through mobile and social technologies in order to meet our customers’ needs.

Support and Maintenance Services
     We offer a tiered support and maintenance program to better serve the needs of our global customer base. Standard Support provides technical assistance during regular business hours; Enterprise Support is designed for customers with mission-critical environments, providing customers with access to support experts 24 hours a day, 7 days a week; and Personalized Support assigns a specific individual to a customer along with other customer specified support services, including on-site support engineers. We have technical support centers in North America, Europe and Asia. Under our standard maintenance agreement, we provide telephone support and upgrade rights to new releases, including patch releases (as necessary) and product enhancements (when and if available).     Customers
     For the year ended December 31, 2018, no customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2017, Indian Railways Catering and Tourism Corporation Limited accounted for 13% of our total revenues and NTT Communications Corporation (NTTCC) accounted for 11% of our revenues. We do not believe that the loss of any single customer would have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.     Sales and Marketing
     We market our products primarily through a direct sales organization with operations in North America, Europe and Asia/Pacific. On December 31, 2018, our direct sales organization included 6 sales representatives, managers and sales support personnel.
     We have sales offices located throughout the world to support the sales and marketing of our products. In support of the Americas organizations, offices located in the United States are in California and Massachusetts.  Offices for our Europe region are located in Italy.  Our sales and marketing offices in the Asia Pacific/Japan/India region are located in Taiwan and Japan. 
 ﻿
 We derive a significant portion of our revenue from our operations outside North America. For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 49% of our revenues were derived from international sales. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 53% of our revenue was derived from international sales. If we are unable to manage or grow our existing international operations, we may not generate sufficient revenue required to establish and maintain these operations, which could slow our overall growth and impair our operating margins.
 ﻿
 Initial sales activities typically involve discussion and review of the potential business value associated with the implementation of a BroadVision solution, a demonstration of our applications’ capabilities online or at the prospect's site, followed by one or more detailed technical reviews. The sales process usually involves collaboration with the prospective customer in order to specify the scope of the solution. Our Global Services Organization helps customers to customize, develop and deploy their e-business solutions.
     As of December 31, 2018, we had 2 employees engaged in a variety of marketing activities, including product planning, marketing material development, public relations, identifying potential customers, establishing and maintaining close relationships with recognized industry analysts and maintaining our website.
     Alliances
     We recognize that today's organizations require an open, partner-based approach to e-business. Accordingly, we have assembled a global team of partners with the skills, services and value-added products necessary to develop, market, sell and deliver competitive e-business solutions.
 ﻿
 Clearvale Reseller Partners
 ﻿
 In late 2010 we introduced Clearvale PaasPort, a channel program that enables partners to resell, customize and add value to our Clearvale ESN solutions. 
 ﻿
 Consulting Partners
 ﻿
 Our systems integration and consulting services partners deliver strategic business solutions to our global customers. These partners offer deployment experience, strong vertical market expertise, and process-based solutions. We structure our contractual arrangements with these consulting partners to motivate them to develop an expertise in our technology and sell our products and services to potential customers, thus enabling us to extend the reach of our products and services. 
 ﻿
 Technology/OEM Partners
 ﻿
 Our technology partners include Value-Added Resellers (VAR) and Independent Software Vendors (ISV) who build and deploy BroadVision-based vertical and horizontal software solutions. Revenue generated from technology/OEM partners in recent years has not been significant.

Competition
     If we fail to compete successfully with current or future competitors, we may lose market share. The market for e-business is intensely competitive. Our customers' requirements and the technology available to satisfy those requirements will continually change. We expect competition in this market to intensify. Our primary competition currently includes:
     ﻿

• | in-house development efforts by prospective customers or partners; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | other vendors of application software or application development platforms and tools directed at interactive commerce and portal applications, such as JDA, IBM Corporation, Microsoft, Oracle and SAP; 
• | other vendors of enterprise social networking and collaboration platforms or solutions, such as Microsoft’s Yammer, Jive Software, Salesforce Chatter, Slack, and Facebook’s Facebook@Work; and 
• | web content developers that develop custom software or integrate other application software into custom solutions. 

      The principal competitive factors affecting the market for our products are:
 ﻿

• | depth and breadth of functionality offered; 
--+----------------------------------------------
• | availability of knowledgeable developers; 
• | time required for application deployment; 
• | reliance on industry standards; 
• | product reliability; 
• | proven track record; 
• | scalability; 
• | maintainability; 
• | product quality; 
• | price, including total cost of ownership; and
• | technical support. 

  ﻿
 ﻿
 ﻿
 Compared to us, many of these competitors and other current and future competitors may have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities, technologies and customer requirements. Many of these companies can use their greater name recognition and more extensive customer base to gain market share. Competitors may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and offer more attractive terms to purchasers. Current and potential competitors may bundle their products to discourage users from purchasing our products. In addition, competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance their products. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share. Competitive pressures may make it difficult for us to acquire and retain customers.
     Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights
     Our success and ability to compete are dependent to a significant degree on our proprietary technology. VMSO holds a U.S. patent, issued  in 2017, on systems and methods for secure sharing of task data over one or more networks. This patent will expire in March of 2037. VMSO also holds a U.S. patent, issued in 2014, on the unique concepts and features in our online solution that allows subscribers to connect with other people and share tasks and content. The patent will expire in January 2034. In addition, we hold a patent issued in 2004 on mechanisms for translating between a word processing document and an XML file. This patent will expire in March 2020. Although we hold these patents, they may not provide an adequate level of intellectual property protection. In addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. We cannot guarantee that infringement or other claims will not be asserted or prosecuted against us in the future, whether resulting from our intellectual property or licenses from third parties. Claims or litigation, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs and diversions of resources, either of which could harm our business.
     We also rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, service mark, trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in products and services. We have registered "BroadVision", "Clearvale", the Clearvale logo and "Interleaf" as trademarks in the United States and/or in other countries. It is possible that our competitors or other companies will adopt product names similar to these trademarks, impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly confusing customers. 
 ﻿
 As a matter of our company policy, we enter into confidentiality and assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, partners and vendors. We also control access to and distribution of our software, documents and other proprietary information. Notwithstanding these precautions, it may be possible for an unauthorized third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our software or other proprietary information or to develop similar software independently. Policing unauthorized use of our products will be difficult,

particularly because the global nature of the Internet makes it difficult to control the ultimate destination or security of software and other transmitted data. The laws of other countries may afford us little or no effective protection of our intellectual property.
 ﻿
 Research and Development
     As of December 31, 2018, we had 23 employees dedicated to research and development. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, employee-related benefit costs and consulting fees incurred in association with the development of our products. Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to develop new products and new versions of our products with new and expanded features. We believe that continued investment in our technology is important for our future growth, and as a result, we expect to incur material research and development expenses for the foreseeable future. 
 ﻿
 Research and development expenses were $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
 ﻿
 Employees
     As of December 31, 2018, we employed a total of 44 full-time employees, of whom 19 are based in North America, 13 in Europe and 12 in Asia. Of these full-time employees, 6 are in sales and marketing, 23 are in product development, 8 are in global services and client support, and 7 are in operations, administration and finance.
     We believe that our future success depends on attracting and retaining highly skilled personnel. We may be unable to attract and retain high-caliber employees. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit. We have never experienced a work stoppage and consider our employee relations to be good.
