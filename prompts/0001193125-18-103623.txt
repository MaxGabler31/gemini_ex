Item 1. Business. 
Overview 
 Altimmune, Inc. is a clinical stage immunotherapeutics company focused on the development of products to stimulate robust and durable immune responses for the prevention and treatment of diseases. We have two proprietary platform technologies, RespirVec and Densigen, each of which has been shown, in preclinical studies and early clinical trials, to activate the immune system in distinctly different ways than traditional vaccine methods. Using these technologies, we have generated clinical product candidates which potentially represent an entirely new approach to harnessing the immune system. We have two programs using the Respirvec recombinant adenovirus technology. NasoVAX, an intranasally administered recombinant influenza vaccine, uses an adenovector to achieve expression of the influenza antigen in the target cell, thereby potentially stimulating a broader and more rapid immune response than traditional influenza vaccines. Our planned Phase 2 program for NasoVAX started in September 2017. Initial data, released in March 2018, indicated that NasoVAX was well tolerated at all doses tested, and achieved 100% seroprotection with the two higher doses. Final data from this study will be available in the third quarter of 2018 and we expect to move forward with continued development of a quadrivalent NasoVAX product candidate which we expect will be ready for clinical evaluation in the first half of 2019. The second RespirVec product, NasoShield, is an anthrax vaccine designed to provide rapid, stable protection after one intranasal administration. We launched a Phase 1 trial for NasoShield in the first quarter of 2018 and anticipate topline data in the third quarter of 2018. 
 With the support of NIAID, we are developing an alternative anthrax vaccine candidate, SparVax-L, a recombinant protein-based anthrax vaccine designed to require fewer doses and have a longer shelf-life than the only currently licensed anthrax vaccine. The shelf life of the liquid formulation was insufficient to meet the government standards and the product was reformulated in a lyophilized (dry powder) formulation. We have demonstrated a significant improvement (at least two years at room temperature and at least six years at refrigerated temperatures) with the lyophilized formulation. Recent preclinical experiments have shown it to be 100% protective with a two-dose regiment (zero and 14 days) with higher toxin neutralizing antibodies than the currently licensed vaccine. 
 Based on the Densigen platform, HepTcell is an immunotherapy for patients chronically infected with the hepatitis B virus, or HBV. HepTcell is currently in a Phase 1 trial in the United Kingdom and South Korea in patients with chronic HBV. Preliminary results from this trial were inconclusive. We are awaiting the six month follow up results, which we expect will be available in the third quarter of 2018, to determine whether to continue with further development of HepTcell, including any further clinical trials. Oncosyn, a cancer immunotherapeutic is in preclinical development. 
 Merger with PharmAthene 
 Our business is the result of a merger between PharmAthene, Inc. (PharmAthene) and the business previously known as Altimmune, Inc. (Private Altimmune). In May of 2017, Private Altimmune merged with PharmAthene pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the Merger Agreement) dated January 18, 2017, among Private Altimmune, PharmAthene, its wholly owned acquisition subsidiaries Mustang 
 
2 


  Merger Sub Corp I Inc. (Merger Sub Corp) and Mustang Merger Sub II LLC (Merger Sub LLC). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub LLC agreed to acquire 100% of the outstanding capital stock of Private Altimmune in a reverse triangular merger and reorganization pursuant to section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the Mergers). Prior to the Mergers, PharmAthene was a publicly traded biodefense company engaged in Phase 2 clinical trials in developing a next generation anthrax vaccine. 
 On May 4, 2017, Private Altimmune and PharmAthene closed the Mergers in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. Upon the closing of the Mergers, (i) Merger Sub Corp merged with and into Private Altimmune, with Private Altimmune remaining as the surviving corporation; (ii) Private Altimmune then merged with and into Merger Sub LLC, with Merger Sub LLC (renamed as Altimmune LLC) remaining as the surviving entity; and (iii) PharmAthene was renamed as Altimmune, Inc. Upon closing of the Mergers, all equity instruments of Private Altimmune were exchanged for corresponding equity instruments of PharmAthene. Except where the context indicates otherwise, references to we, us, our, Altimmune or the Company refer, for periods prior to the completion of the Mergers, to Private Altimmune and its subsidiaries, and for periods following the completion of the Mergers to the combined company and its subsidiaries.

 Our Strategy 
 Key elements of our strategy include the following: 
 

 | Develop and commercialize immunotherapeutic products for the prevention and treatment of disease. We are dedicated to the development of immunotherapeutic pharmaceuticals to prevent and treat infectious disease. Our product candidates seek to engage the immune system in distinctive ways that offer an inherent advantage over existing approaches. We are currently focused on developing our four clinical stage assets against influenza, chronic HBV infections and anthrax, as well as our preclinical oncology program.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Apply our platform technologies to expand our pipeline of products. We intend to apply our platform technologies to various disease states where the immune system is involved in disease resolution. We will employ our technologies, either alone or in combination, in an effort to recruit the appropriate elements of the human immune system for a given disease indication. We are currently applying our technologies to respiratory diseases and chronic infections. We will also opportunistically continue to apply our technologies to areas of national security or public interest where government funding is available for such projects.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Partner or out-license certain product candidates at later stages of development. We intend to manage our organization to be focused on product development. With this focus, depending on indication, we see the benefit of partnering or out-licensing certain products for late stage development. For specific indications, such as influenza, we expect to partner after Phase 2 clinical testing. While there may be limited indications where marketing products independently is reasonable for a company of our size, we anticipate that in most indications, we would seek to out-license or partner to bring our products to market. We will seek partners that have the appropriate development expertise and the distribution and marketing infrastructure required to successfully commercialize our products.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | In-license or acquire complementary immunotherapeutic technologies and products to expand our pipeline. We will seek opportunities to expand our pipeline through the in-licensing or acquisition of additional immunotherapeutic technologies or product candidates. In particular, we will seek complementary products or technologies that either improve or extend an existing product candidate or indication in our current pipeline.

The Human Immune System 
 The human immune system consists of a series of specialized structures and cell types that work together to protect the body from disease. The immune system can respond to pathogens in two different ways  via the innate immune response or via the adaptive immune response. Adaptive immunity is developed in response to antigens expressed by a particular pathogen, is highly specific to those antigens, and takes from one to several weeks upon initial recognition of the pathogen to mount an effective response. The adaptive immune system responds to a pathogen through both antibody-mediated and T cell-mediated immunity. The antibody-mediated humoral response is primarily directed toward the neutralization of extracellular pathogens (including viruses), which renders them harmless. T cell-mediated cellular immunity functions to recognize cells that need to be destroyed either because they harbor a pathogen or because the cell has transformed into a cancer cell. The adaptive immune response also includes the mucosal immune system, which is localized to mucosal tissues like the lining of the respiratory tract. The mucosal immune system uses a specialized type of antibody called IgA to block pathogens at the site of entry into the body. 
 In contrast to the slower, highly specific responses of the adaptive immune response, the innate immune system is designed to provide a rapid and broad response to attacking pathogens. There are numerous types of innate immune cells with specialized functions. Their principal characteristic is the ability to respond quickly when a pathogen is encountered. The innate immune system can recognize viruses, bacteria and fungi, and is 
 
4 


  initiated immediately upon recognition of an invading organism to provide protection against infection while the adaptive immune response is being developed. In addition to acting directly on the pathogen threat, the innate immune system facilitates and improves the adaptive immune response. Together, the adaptive and innate immune systems provide a concerted response to the control and clear the pathogen from the host. 
 Current Product Candidates in Development

 NasoVAX 
 NasoVAX is an adenovectored influenza vaccine candidate that is delivered intranasally. NasoVAX has demonstrated safety and the ability to induce an immune response against influenza in two Phase 1 trials in healthy volunteers. We completed enrollment of Phase 2 clinical trial program in the fourth quarter of 2017 and reported preliminary data in March 2018. NasoVAX was well tolerated and immunogenic, and we plan to continue development of NasoVAX seasonal influenza vaccine with a quadrivalent study to start in the first half of 2019. Additional development of NasoVAX for the treatment of pandemic influenza is contingent on successful results in the seasonal influenza program and financial support from BARDA or other governmental agencies for additional development of a pandemic vaccine. 
Influenza Overview 
 Influenza is one of the most common viral respiratory infections, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. In particular, young children, adults over 65, pregnant women and individuals in long-term care facilities are vulnerable to developing flu-related complications. People with underlying medical conditions such as asthma, obesity, neurological disorders, and chronic lung, heart, liver or kidney problems are also at high risk for complications. The World Health Organization reports that up to 650,000 (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2017/seasonal-flu/en/) of those infected with the flu each year die as a result of influenza-related complications. The number of deaths associated with seasonal influenza vary from year to year, based on the severity of circulating strains and the effectiveness of that years influenza vaccine The CDC has posted estimates of seasonal flu deaths and estimates that from the 2010-2011 flu season to the 2013-2014 flu season influenza-associated deaths in the United States ranged from a low of 12,000 (during 2011-2012) to a high of 56,000 (during 2012-2013) (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/us_flu-related_deaths.htm). For comparison, the number of deaths from breast cancer in 2017 was approximately 40,000. 
 It is well known that elderly populations are at greater risk for influenza and influenza-related complications. In the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/
 
5 


  index2018.html), from February 16, 2018, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), confirmed previous findings that as many as 59% of hospitalizations and 85% of deaths occur among adult age ³65 years. However, the heightened risk based on age is not confined to senior citizens  for example, a 2014 MMWR report on influenza-associated intensive care unit admissions in the 2013  2014 flu season showed that persons aged 41  64 years had six times the risk of death and almost four times the risk of intensive care unit admission as those aged 40 or younger, demonstrating that influenza is a real concern for much of the adult population. 
 There are many influenza strains in circulation during a given flu season and the individual strains are systematically named by: (i) the type of influenza virus, either A or B; (ii) the geographical location where the strain was isolated; (iii) which isolate of potentially many from that location it represents (starting with the number 01); and (iv) the year it was isolated. For example, an isolate from the pandemic influenza virus known as the swine flu might be called A/California/04/2009. This system of naming virus strains sometimes includes information on the subtype of influenza virus as a suffix at the end of the name, such as A/California/04/2009 (H1N1), where the familiar designation H1N1 reveals the subunit structure of the virus, designating an influenza subtype comprised of hemagglutinin protein H1 and neuraminidase protein N1. 
 Vaccination against influenza virus can be an effective way to prevent infections. However, the effectiveness of vaccination can vary greatly from year to year, and the overall level of protection is suboptimal. According to the CDC, the average overall adjusted vaccine effectiveness for influenza seasons has been approximately 40% from 2005  2018 (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/vaccination/effectiveness-studies.htm). One reason for vaccine ineffectiveness is the constantly changing nature of influenza virus strains. The viral protein hemagglutinin (HA) is an important target of vaccination, and each type of HA protein, such as H1 or H3, has multiple forms which can vary from year to year. Because the process used to produce over 99% of influenza vaccine doses today requires six months of advance planning, regulatory agencies must commit to the strains to be used well in advance of the start of the flu season. Since each strain is different, an immune response generated against one form of H1 protein may not protect against infection with a virus containing another form of H1 protein. The low estimated 19% overall efficacy of the 2014  2015 flu vaccine in the United States was attributed to the fact that more than two-thirds of the H3N2 viruses circulating that season were of a different form than the H3N2 strain included in vaccine production. Worse still, a more dramatic change in influenza virus makeup occasionally arises when an entirely new HA protein emerges, which can result in a human pandemic. Because humans have never encountered the new HA protein they are likely to have little or no immunity, leaving them at much greater risk for serious complications or death. Current vaccines are suboptimal because of their narrow strain specific responses and the long lead times needed for vaccine production that results in mismatches between strains represented in the vaccine and the predominant circulating strains. We have demonstrated in repeated preclinical studies that NasoVAX may provide the type of cross-protection necessary to address a broad variety of HA proteins and has a more rapid production time than the vast majority of currently approved vaccines. Additionally, recent data suggest that glycosylation patterns may also be an important component of increasing vaccine efficacy. It was noted that vaccines that were manufactured in chicken eggs were less efficacious than similar vaccines manufactured in cell culture-based manufacturing processes. 
 The CDC recommends that everyone in the United States over six months of age receive an annual influenza vaccination. According to the CDC, vaccine manufacturers have projected that the market for influenza vaccines in the United States will be approximately 151 to 166 million doses for the 2017  2018 flu season, and have reported approximately 154.7 million doses distributed as of February 17, 2018. Through other market sources we estimate that the substantial majority of these vaccines contain inactivated virus produced in eggs. According to World Health Organization estimates, the U.S. influenza market is expected to be approximately $2.0 billion in 2018. Despite observations of limited efficacy, the CDC estimates that influenza vaccination prevented approximately 7.2 million illnesses, 3.1 million medically attended illnesses and 90,000 hospitalizations in 2013  2014. However, in 2014  2015, the CDC estimates that influenza vaccination prevented only 1.9 million illnesses, 966,000 medically attended illnesses and 67,000 hospitalizations, 
 
6 


  significantly lower than previous seasons because of the reduced effectiveness of the 2014  2015 vaccine against the predominant circulating influenza viruses. New vaccines with improved clinical efficacy and effectiveness are needed to further reduce influenza-related morbidity and mortality. One of the most important improvements needed for influenza vaccines is the ability to provide cross-protection between different HA protein types, which would address the issue created with changing viruses mentioned above. Many companies and laboratories have attempted to develop universal influenza vaccines that are directed against viral proteins that are highly conserved in sequence among all viral genetic subtypes of influenza; however, it is not clear that the type of immune response generated against those proteins will be sufficiently effective for approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 
 We believe there is an opportunity to develop and market an improved vaccine to prevent influenza given the low overall efficacy of currently approved vaccines, especially in those populations with the highest needs: children under two years of age, adults older than 65 years of age and immunocompromised patients. 
 Our Solution, NasoVAX 
 NasoVAX is an influenza vaccine candidate that consists of a segment of the influenza viral genome packaged in an adenovector that is delivered intranasally. The power of our RespirVec platform, together with the intranasal route of administration, allows NasoVAX to mimic the typical route of infection taken by influenza viruses, potentially stimulating a highly robust and broad immune response as a result. 
 We believe NasoVAX has a number of important advantages over traditional vaccines, including the potential for: 
 

 | Rapid protection in a matter of days, rather than weeks, as demonstrated in preclinical studies
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Broader protection against changing virus strains, as demonstrated in preclinical studies
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Ability to elicit mucosal immunity at the site of influenza infection
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Ability to elicit strong cellular immunity, a T cell response, as demonstrated in Phase 2 clinical trials
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Immune activation at very low doses, as demonstrated in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Manufacturing process in mammalian cells instead of chicken eggs allows for more appropriate glycosylation, which results in increased efficacy
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Production expected in less than half the time and at anticipated lower costs with greater worker safety compared to traditional egg-based manufacture
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 By employing our RespirVec platform and intranasal administration, we mobilize key elements of the adaptive immune system: not just the antibody-based response triggered by traditional vaccines, but also mucosal immunity to provide a first line of defense and cellular immunity to help control and clear the infection. In addition to this adaptive immunity, NasoVAX stimulates the rapidly acting innate immune response. The innate immune response generally occurs within hours of a pathogen invading, as the bodys first line of defense, and complements the longer-lasting pathogen-specific immunity generated by the other components of the immune system. Vaccine developers have long known of the importance of triggering innate immunity. Typically, this is accomplished through the use of adjuvants, which are often crude mixtures that are unrelated to the vaccine product itself. Because it is designed to activate the innate immune response, NasoVAX may act as its own adjuvant, potentially obviating the need for an additional adjuvant component to the vaccine. By triggering innate immunity, NasoVAX may confer rapid protection that complements the longer-lasting protection based on antibodies and cellular immunity. 
 Clinical Data 
 A Phase 2a clinical study of NasoVAX was conducted in 60 healthy young adult volunteers randomized to one of 3 doses of NasoVAX. Immunogenicty measures were also compared to those from 20 similar subjects 
 
7 


  vaccinated in an open label study of Fluzone, an injectable influenza vaccine. 100% seroprotection was achieved in the two higher NasoVAX doses, compared to 95% seroprotection after Fluzone. Other antibody measurements were similar for Fluzone and the highest NasoVAX dose, and median cellular immune response 8 days after vaccination was over 5-fold higher with NasoVAX. Rates of local and systemic side effects were not statistically different than in placebo recipients and did not increase with dose. 
 Phase 2 clinical results

Preclinical Data 
 NasoVAX directed against influenza H5N1, commonly referred to as bird flu, results in 100% survival in a ferret model of H5N1 infection that, in the absence of an effective vaccine, leads to 100% mortality within seven days. We believe that this may potentially translate into better protection for humans as well.

 In preclinical models, NasoVAX vaccines lead to protection against influenza across dissimilar influenza strains. Vaccination of mice with NasoVAX directed against influenza strain A/New Caledonia/20/1999 provided complete protection from a lethal viral challenge using a divergent strain, A/California/04/2009, to which a traditional vaccine for A/New Caledonia/20/1999 would have offered very little cross-protection. This type of activity may potentially provide increased efficacy in flu seasons when the vaccine developed is not a good match for the flu strain actually circulating. 
 NasoVAX provides cross-strain protection 
 


Figure 3. Protection of mice against a divergent influenza strain not targeted by the vaccine 
 Source: Company data 
 This protection may not only be due to the development of influenza-specific antibodies, but also to the stimulation of the innate immune system by NasoVAX. As shown in the graph below, mice receiving an intranasal administration of NasoVAX had superior rates of survival to the lethal challenge given just two days post-vaccination. These rates of survival at a near-term challenge indicate that NasoVAX activates the innate immune system. In contrast, in intramuscular administration of NasoVAX, the route used for most influenza vaccines, the effect was not observed. 
 NasoVAX provides protection from influenza within 2 days

 The table below highlights certain features of NasoVAX identified during our preclinical studies and Phase 1 clinical trials and compares these with features of certain widely used commercially available influenza vaccines, and certain influenza vaccine product candidates we consider to be potential competitors to NasoVAX. Typically, the injected influenza vaccines that most people receive are either the killed or split vaccines as

  illustrated below. The live attenuated vaccine referenced below is currently the only approved intranasal vaccine. The recombinant/virus like particle (VLP) vaccine category includes approved and Phase 2 development-stage influenza vaccines, while the bacterial category is another Phase 2 development-stage vaccine. Taken together, these feature comparisons suggest that NasoVAX potentially offers advantages over each of these products and product candidates in speed of response, multi-faceted response, ease and convenience of administration, speed and ease of manufacturing, and ability to protect against a broad range of flu viruses.

 Clinical Trial Plan for NasoVAX 
 Our Phase 2 clinical trial program for NasoVAX for the treatment of seasonal influenza commenced in the third quarter of 2017 completed enrollment in the fourth quarter of 2017 and reported data in the first quarter of 2018. This trial extended the previous dose ranges tested and evaluated both antibody and cellular immune responses. 100% of subjects in the two highest dose groups achieved seroprotective antibody levels to the matched strains and strong cellular immune responses were seen in the highest dose group. Final data to include durability of immune response is expected to be available in mid-2018.
We are also planning two additional trials as part of our Phase 2 program. One is a dose ranging trial of a quadrivalent NasoVAX vaccine in healthy adult subjects stratified by age to include healthy elderly subjects. This vaccine will include H3 and B strains in addition to the H1 influenza strain evaluated in the recent Phase 2a study. The subjects will be assessed for antibody response and other measures of immunogenicity one-month post vaccination, as well as be regularly monitored for duration of response. We anticipate commencing this trial in the first half of 2019 and expect immunogenicity data in the second half of 2019, with additional safety and durability data to follow. We plan to use the results of this trial to select dosing for a larger dose confirmation trial. 
 HepTcell 
 HepTcell is an immunotherapy product candidate directed against multiple HBV genotypes. HepTcell is a completely synthetic peptide product candidate based on our proprietary Densigen technology which we believe may help the immune system destroy infected cells and clear chronic HBV infection. In July 2015, we commenced a Phase 1 trial of HepTcell in the United Kingdom and South Korea in patients chronically infected 
 
10 


  with HBV. HepTcell was well tolerated but elicited HBV specific cellular immune responses were not significantly different than placebo. We plan to complete evaluation of other immune and virologic measures in these study subjects and will report the end of study results later this year. 
 Chronic Hepatitis B Overview 
 Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver usually caused by a viral infection. There are five main unrelated hepatitis viruses, referred to as types A, B, C, D and E. Hepatitis is categorized as acute when it lasts less than six months and chronic when it persists longer. In particular, types B and C lead to chronic disease in hundreds of millions of people and, together, are the most common cause of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. 
 HBV is the most common cause of viral hepatitis and is spread through blood products, contaminated needles or sexual contact, and from mother to infant. HBV infections are particularly endemic in Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, the Amazon basin, parts of the Middle East and in some Eastern European countries, where 70%  90% of the population is infected before the age of 40. Even though prophylactic vaccination programs have led to declines in HBV infections in many countries, chronic infection remains a significant problem in certain areas. 
 Most adults infected with HBV recover naturally; however, according to the Hepatitis B Foundation, five to ten percent of infected adults go on to develop chronic infections. CHB infection is a major worldwide health care challenge with approximately 257 million people worldwide chronically infected, resulting in 857,000 HBV-related deaths per year due to cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. 
 The management of CHB has improved dramatically in the last 20 years, owing to the development of new small molecule antivirals directed against the HBV polymerase protein. While these therapies can effectively suppress HBV replication, they do not result in eradication of the virus and therefore their administration can rarely be discontinued. They reduce but do not eliminate the risk of HBV related complications. 
 Therapeutic vaccination is a promising immunotherapeutic approach to induce immune control over the disease. CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses have been shown to be critical for clearance of acute HBV infection and immune control can be linked to the strength and quality of HBV-specific T cell responses. 
 CHB patients are known to have profound defects in anti-HBV-specific T cell immune responses, termed immunotolerance, thereby compromising critical protective and disease control mechanisms. We believe that a treatment like HepTcell, which has been shown in preclinical studies to stimulate the HBV-specific T cell response, could help destroy infected cells and clear chronic HBV infections. 
 Our Solution, HepTcell 
 In HepTcell, specific viral peptide sequences, chosen for their ability to elicit broad human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type-independent immune responses, are coupled to a fluorocarbon chain so that, upon administration, the immunotherapy creates a short-term depot, which we believe will lead to a strong and sustained activation of the immune system. The final study product consists of a mixture of nine peptides between 32 and 40 amino acids long that are designed to be effective across the full spectrum of HBV genotypes. The peptides were selected using bioinformatics and validated using in vitro screening of immune responses from blood of HBV-infected patients. We believe that our synthetic HepTcell product candidate, if approved, could be produced by commodity peptide manufacturers around the world according to a robust and cost-effective process. 
 Everyones immune system responds differently to stimuli due to innate differences in HLA type, a shorthand expression for the proteins that, in part, make up the immune system and that vary from individual to individual. For this reason, organ transplants have to be matched carefully to avoid rejection. The HLA type 
 
11 


  determines how each persons unique immune system will react to immunotherapy, leading to differing levels of efficacy. The discovery of the Densigen technology, on which HepTcell is based, has potentially solved the problem of HLA restriction, with the possibility that nearly all patients may benefit from immunotherapy without a need for matching. In addition, we believe that HepTcell has potential advantages over therapeutic vaccines under development for CHB because it is based on the incorporation of highly antigenic sequences that appear to be constant across multiple HBV strains or genotypes. 
 Preclinical Data 
 In our preclinical studies, mice immunized with HepTcell generated a robust T cell response. In one study, we tested HepTcell in a mouse model that reflects the HBV-induced immunotolerance seen in the clinical setting. Mice in the active arm were infected at week 0 with a vector that expresses all of the HBV proteins (AAV-HBV), and control mice received saline. Both active and control arms were subsequently treated at weeks 12, 14, 16 and 21 with HepTcell immunotherapy combined with the adjuvant IC31. At week 23 strong HBV-specific T cell responses in the spleen and liver were measured through detection of IFNgamma-secreting T cells. 
 HepTcell induces immunity in immunotolerized mice 
 


Figure 5. HepTcell with IC31 adjuvant breaks immune-tolerance and induces a robust immune response in both the spleen and the liver in a murine model of chronic HBV infection 
 Source: Company data 
 The results demonstrate that a robust immune response may be induced by HepTcell independent of HBV-mediated immunotolerance. We believe this response is characterized not just by a sufficiency of activated T cells, but also by the strength of recognition which governs the T cells ability to effectively eliminate HBV-infected cells. By combining HepTcell together with the adjuvant IC31, we increased the magnitude of the immune response up to three-fold. We chose IC31 because it is a fully synthetic adjuvant consistent with the synthetic nature of HepTcell itself. A synthetic adjuvant provides consistent quality and has a better controlled manufacturing process, in contrast to many adjuvants that, while effective, are comprised of undefined mixtures of natural substances. 
 HBV replicates only in humans and other primates. Accordingly, we conducted an in vivo proof of concept study where it loaded rodent cells with either HBV proteins or proteins from an unrelated pathogen, influenza. We then injected these cells into mice that had been previously administered HepTcell to assess in vivo cell killing activity in the treated mice. Within one day, 91.7% of HBV loaded cells were eliminated compared to control cells loaded with proteins from the unrelated pathogen. These preclinical study results show the possibility of HepTcell to recognize and kill cells containing HBV proteins.

 Clinical Trial Plan for HepTcell 
 We launched a Phase 1 trial in July 2015 in the United Kingdom and South Korea and enrolled 60 chronically infected HBV patients with controlled disease under standard of care. The primary objective of the trial was to assess the safety and tolerability of HepTcell. As a secondary objective, the trial measured the immune response induced by HepTcell following administration. The trial evaluated two dose levels, both with and without a novel adjuvant, compared to placebo and adjuvant alone. Each cohort received three doses of HepTcell, at days 1, 29 and 57, and assessed T cell response and HBsAg and HBsAg-antibody levels over a six-month period. We are also measuring the phenotype of cell-mediated immune response that is induced by the immunotherapy. The vaccine was well tolerated and was not associated with hepatic flares. Although the blinded results available at the end of 2017 demonstrated increases in Tcell response in higher dose cohorts, which both contained controls, the unblinded data was inconclusive, with similar results between treated patients and controls. We plan to complete evaluation of additional immunologic and virologic data from these subjects by the end of 2018. There can be no assurances we will continue the development of HepTcell or any other Densigen based product candidate. 
Our Anthrax Vaccine Franchise 
 NasoShield is a preclinical vaccine product candidate based on our RespirVec technology encoding the Bacillus anthracis protective antigen. In a head-to-head comparison with the existing approved anthrax vaccine in a gold-standard animal model, a single dose of NasoShield showed complete protection from inhalation anthrax and was non-inferior to multiple doses of the existing approved anthrax vaccine while providing for a more rapid and stable immune response. We estimate that annual sales in the United States of the existing approved anthrax vaccine are approximately $300 million. We have developed the product candidate with the support of BARDA, and, subject to their continued financial and other support, we launched a Phase 1 trial with NasoShield in first quarter of 2018 and are anticipating data from this trial midyear 2018. Previous work related to the development of NasoShield was also supported by NIAID. 
 In addition, we have a second anthrax vaccine candidate, SparVax-L, that is based on a recombinant protein technology encoding the Bacillus anthracis protective antigen. In a head-to-head comparison with the existing approved anthrax vaccine in a gold-standard animal model, two doses of SparVax-L showed complete protection from inhalation anthrax and was non-inferior to two doses of the existing approved anthrax vaccine. We have also shown extended shelf life both at room temperature (at least 24 months) and refrigerated temperatures (at least 6 years). The recent preclinical work also showed a greater protective antibody response that the currently licensed vaccine in that head-to-head study.

 Anthrax Overview 
 Anthrax is a disease that arises from infection with a bacterial pathogen, Bacillus anthracis. Anthrax can be spread by inhalation of bacterial spores which can be released from infected livestock or livestock products; however, this is extremely rare. The greater fear, and key driver for development of anthrax vaccines, is the potential use of anthrax spores by bioterrorists. The bacterial spores are readily aerosolized and could be used against the military or civilian population. Without timely treatment, inhalation anthrax is almost always fatal, and antibiotic treatment is significantly less effective if not initiated shortly after infection. The U.S. government has made significant investments in ensuring that appropriate countermeasures are in place to prevent and treat these infections. Individuals at high risk, such as active duty military personnel, are routinely vaccinated as a preventative measure, and the government stockpiles adequate doses of vaccine for distribution to the broader population in case of a bioterrorism attack. 
 Anthrax Vaccine Absorbed trade name BioThrax, is a protein-based vaccine produced from culture filtrates of an avirulent, non-encapsulated strain of Bacillus anthracis. For pre-exposure prophylaxis, it is given as a series of three intramuscular injections at zero, one and six months, at which point the vaccinated subject is considered protected. These initial injections are followed by two additional injections over the next year and yearly booster immunizations thereafter. BioThrax is the only anthrax vaccine approved by the FDA and had sales of $287 million in 2017. In a BioThrax study, approximately 60% to 80% of recipients experienced injection site adverse events following the first dose of the vaccine, primarily tenderness, erythema (skin rash), edema (fluid accumulation under the skin), warmth, induration (skin thickening), pain and itching. BioThrax is currently only given to high risk individuals, such as U.S. military personnel, and a significant number of those individuals have refused the vaccine in past voluntary programs, presumably because of the lengthy immunization procedure and documented adverse events. Thus, we believe that there is a market opportunity for a more effective, safer and more convenient anthrax vaccine to expand beyond the current market. 
 Our Solution, NasoShield 
 NasoShield is a vaccine product candidate based on our RespirVec technology encoding the anthrax protective antigen. In a head-to-head comparison with the existing approved anthrax vaccine in a gold-standard animal model, a single dose of NasoShield showed complete protection from inhalation anthrax and was non-inferior to multiple doses of the existing approved anthrax vaccine while providing for a more rapid and stable immune response. We have developed the product candidate with the support of BARDA, and, with their continued financial and other support, we launched a Phase 1 trial with NasoShield in the first quarter of 2018. Previous work related to the development of NasoShield was also supported by NIAID. 
 NasoShield is an anthrax vaccine product candidate based on the RespirVec platform and contains the coding region for the PA83 protective antigen from Bacillus anthracis. We believe NasoShield has advantages over the existing anthrax vaccine, as suggested by our preclinical studies, including the potential for: 
 

 | Efficacy with a single intranasal dose versus multiple injections
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Critical threshold of immunity reached in half the time of BioThrax
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Protection for at least one year from a single administration
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 These potential advantages of NasoShield, together with its convenient nasal delivery and robust, scalable manufacturing process, lead us to believe that NasoShield has the potential to be an important next generation anthrax vaccine. 
 Preclinical Data 
 Vaccination of animals with a single intranasal dose of NasoShield followed by spores via inhalation after 70 days resulted in statistical non-inferiority for survival relative to two doses of BioThrax, meaning that one 
 
14 


  dose of NasoShield provided no worse protection than two doses of BioThrax, with survival rates between 97% and 100%. In these experiments BioThrax was delivered by two intramuscular injections separated by 28 days. 
 


Figure 7. Non-inferiority of NasoShield vs. BioThrax in a rabbit inhalation anthrax model 
 Source: Company data 
 NasoShield vaccination in this preclinical study also demonstrates an important advantage over BioThrax, because the protective neutralizing antibody titer rises faster and has greater persistence than the immune response induced following vaccination with BioThrax. The level of antibody present within two weeks of NasoShield dosing is consistent with the level associated with 95% probability of survival in this study. As shown in the graph below, NasoShield also leads to the generation of an antibody response that is relatively consistent between 28 and 70 days prior to the lethal anthrax challenge, while the response to BioThrax is much less durable.

 Clinical Trial Plan for NasoShield 
 In July 2016, we were awarded a $120.2 million, five-year contract from BARDA to advance NasoShield into clinical development. The award was increased to $127.5 million in March 2017. We commenced a Phase 1 trial in the first quarter of 2018 with preliminary data expected midyear 2018. This study is a double-blind placebo controlled dose-escalation study evaluating safety and immunogenicity of NasoShield in healthy volunteers. It will also include a randomized open-label BioThrax comparator arm. The primary endpoint of the 
 
15 


  trial is safety; we will also assess immunogenicity as a secondary endpoint. The trial is expected to take approximately 18 months to complete. 
 SparVax-L 
 In September 2014, we signed a contract with NIAID that funds the preclinical development SparVax-L. Data generated to date demonstrates that the recombinant protective antigen protein can be stably formulated in a lyophilized state for extended storage at room temperature, and even longer at refrigerator temperature. Formulation of SparVax-L for long shelf life also increased the potency of vaccine such that in a preclinical model greater immunogenicity was observed compared to identical doses of a previous formulation of the antigen shown to be well-tolerated and immunogenic in earlier clinical studies. The next phase of the program is a demonstration of the final form of the vaccine in a single unit, dual-chambered syringe designed for simpler storage and ease of use. All of the necessary components of the vaccine will be contained in a single logistics transport and storage will be greatly improved. Animal efficacy studies demonstrated that the vaccine is efficacious even after storage at room temperature, and a repeat dose toxicology study of SparVax-L showed the vaccine to be well-tolerated. These data can be used in support a filing with the FDA to update the SparVax® IND, which is currently on clinical hold, to allow for the commencement of a subsequent clinical trial. 
 In late 2017, we initiated an additional preclinical study to demonstrate that a two-dose regimen of SparVax-L was able to protect animals at least as well as the currently licensed vaccine. In fact, we showed that a single dose resulted in 67% survival and a two-dose regimen achieved 100% survival, and also induced greater toxin neutralizing (protective) antibodies than the currently licensed vaccine.

 Our Technology Platforms 
 Our product candidates are based on two complementary technology platforms: RespirVec and Densigen. Our respiratory anti-infective product candidates are derived from our RespirVec platform, in which rapid as well as long-term immune protection is elicited by intranasal delivery of adenovectored pathogen sequences. We are targeting chronic diseases using our Densigen platform which recruits T cells to generate a sustained response to intracellular targets. 
 RespirVec 
 Our RespirVec platform consists of our proprietary process related to intranasal delivery of replication-deficient adenoviruses and is comprised of patents that we own or license. RespirVec is a viral vector based on a modified version of adenovirus that is used to deliver selected antigens to the immune system so that a robust response can occur. Our RespirVec technology has important potential advantages compared to other vaccine platforms. The ability of vaccines based on the RespirVec platform to induce mucosal immunity, as shown in our preclinical studies, is an important differentiator, as mucosal immunity is generally considered to be desirable for protection against respiratory pathogens. In addition, by using an adenovirus to enter the cell, we trigger the activation of local innate immunity, further boosting the immune recognition and response to the antigen expressed by the vector, essentially creating an adjuvant-like effect. Because the innate immune response can occur very quickly and is broad in its specificity, this immune response has the potential to provide a rapidly developing line of protection against divergent strains of a virus. Unlike most other vaccines, immunotherapies based on RespirVec enter the cells of the upper respiratory tract and express the antigen intracellularly, just as occurs during an actual respiratory infection. This allows the immune system to recognize the pathogen in the same context as a natural infection and as a result a more natural and robust immune response may be elicited that includes not only the humoral response of traditional vaccines, but also activation of the T cell and mucosal components of the immune system. Traditional vaccines are based on proteins rather than a viral vector and consequently rely primarily on the immune systems antibody response, rather than the type of broad immune involvement seen with RespirVec technology. 
 Key aspects of our RespirVec technology, supported by our preclinical studies and clinical trials, include: 
 

 | Intracellular expression of the vaccine antigen for authentic immune presentation;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Mobilization of the innate, cellular and mucosal immune systems, not just the antibody-based response triggered by conventional injectable vaccines;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Self-adjuvanting adenovector delivery system with the potential to improve immunogenicity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Recombinant vaccine manufactured in cell culture which avoids potential mutations during production and has shown higher efficacy than egg based manufacturing processes;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Rapid production cycle at anticipated lower costs.
--+---------------------------------------------------

 Adenovirus, when unmodified, is one of the causes of the common cold and as such it is well-suited for delivery of antigens using the intranasal route of delivery. One potential disadvantage associated with the use of adenovirus-based vectors is that pre-existing antibodies against the vector, either as a result of previous natural infections or prior therapy with the vector, may interfere with the ability of the vector to express the pathogen. Importantly, these negative effects have been primarily observed following intramuscular injection of similar vectors. Utilizing the intranasal route of delivery seems to bypass this effect, as demonstrated by us and others in preclinical models. We have also observed this in our Phase 1 seasonal influenza trial, where there was no correlation between the amounts of pre-existing adenoviral antibodies in study subjects and the ability of those subjects to generate influenza-specific antibodies when NasoVAX was dosed intranasally.

 RespirVec bypasses pre-existing vector immunity 
 


Figure 10. Lack of correlation between anti-adenovirus antibody titer and immune response to NasoVAX 
 Source: Company data 
 The graph above plots the level of anti-adenovirus titer versus hemagglutinin inhibition, a measure of vaccine activity. If a correlation existed between the level of pre-existing anti-vector antibody and vaccine activity, one would expect the data points in the graph to follow a trend where a point with a high anti-adenovirus titer would also have a low fold HI, yet this was not observed. For example, the two data points with the highest anti-adenovirus antibody level had the highest vaccine activity in one case and one of the lowest vaccine activities in the other case, indicating a lack of association. These results suggest that the presence of adenovirus neutralizing antibodies may not negatively impact the efficacy of intranasally delivered RespirVec-based vaccines. 
 Our experience suggests that vaccines based on the RespirVec technology can be developed through a simple, fast, safe and relatively inexpensive manufacturing process, which would be an advantage over most other influenza-based vaccine products. Because the manufacturing process uses recombinant DNA to synthesize pathogen-optimized products, manufacturing RespirVec-based products can be done potentially more rapidly than other vaccine types without the need to grow or handle dangerous pathogens. We believe that our RespirVec technology also lends itself to manufacture in smaller scale bioreactors, which may yield millions of doses without the need for large cell culture or egg-based production facilities. The ability to manufacture in cell culture instead of chicken eggs is proving to provide increased efficacy with influenza vaccines. 
 Densigen 
 We developed antigens consisting of 30  40 amino acid long synthetic peptides that encode a high density of CD4 and CD8 T cell epitopes that are selected to broaden the HLA class reactivity of the product. We refer to these high-density antigens as Densigens, which are covered by patents owned by us. Immunotherapeutic product candidates based on our Densigen technology contain a collection of carefully selected Densigens that are designed to elicit activity across multiple targets for the disease. Synthetic peptide-based antigens have potential advantages over viral or recombinant protein antigens because they may be able to be manufactured at large scale with high purity. However, the development of peptide-based vaccines has been limited due their relatively low immunogenicity in the absence of adjuvants. As demonstrated in preclinical studies, we have enhanced the ability of Densigen peptides to elicit an immune response by attaching a biologically inert fluorocarbon chain to each peptide, resulting in a depot effect. This effect can be seen in the figure below where the T cell immune response is significantly greater in animals treated with the fluorocarbon-containing peptide than in those treated with peptide without the fluorocarbon chain (native peptide).

 Densigen technology improves T cell immunogenicity

 Source: Company data 
 This change in the chemical structure, in turn, drives the aggregation of these peptides into micelles, which are more stable and longer-lasting structures than naked peptides. This conformational shift into micelles provides a depot for these peptide antigens and protects them from proteolytic degradation and diffusion, thereby prolonging exposure to the immune system. Our studies also indicate that the aggregation-inducing properties of the fluorocarbon chain can be modified by pH and salt concentrations such that the vaccine product candidate can be maintained in a soluble format until after intramuscular administration. 
 The following is our illustration of a single Densigen peptide and the aggregate that it forms after intramuscular administration:

 Applications of Our Technologies in Animal Health 
 Highly pathogenic strains of avian and swine influenza threaten the agricultural industry and are potential sources of genetic material that can lead to pandemic influenza outbreaks in humans. We have partnered with leading academic researchers and the United States Department of Agriculture to design and test the potential of our technologies in animal health and are encouraged by the results obtained to date. 
 We believe that applications in animal health provide potential out-licensing opportunities for our technologies and we continue to pursue animal health research using external sources of funding. 
 Competition 
 The biopharmaceutical industry and the vaccine market are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological progress. In general, competition among pharmaceutical products is based in part on product efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, price and patent position. An important factor is the relative timing of the market introduction of our products and our competitors products. Accordingly, the speed with which we can 
 
19 


  develop products, complete the clinical trials and approval processes and supply commercial quantities of the products to the market is an important competitive factor. Our competitive position also depends upon our ability to show differentiation with a product that is more efficacious, particularly in the relevant target populations, and/or be less expensive and quicker to manufacture. We also depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes and secure sufficient capital resources for the often substantial period between technological conception and commercial sale. 
 Large and established companies such as AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi Pasteur, among others, compete in the influenza vaccine market. These companies compete with us with their greater experience and expertise in securing government contracts and grants to support their research and development efforts, conducting testing and clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals to market products, manufacturing such products on a broad scale and marketing approved products. These companies also compete with us by having significantly greater research and marketing capabilities than we do and may also have products that have been approved or are in late stages of development and have collaborative arrangements in our target markets with leading companies and research institutions. Established pharmaceutical companies may also invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to in-license novel compounds that could make the product that we develop obsolete. 
 We also face competition from smaller companies such as Novavax, which is developing an influenza vaccine; Inovio Pharmaceuticals, which is developing an HBV therapeutic vaccine; and Emergent Biosolutions, which manufactures the existing anthrax vaccine, PaxVax and Pfenex which are developing anthrax vaccines. Any of these smaller companies may develop competing products more rapidly than we do. A number of companies of varying sizes are also pursuing the development of a universal flu vaccine. In addition, we face substantial competition for government funding, particularly for our anthrax vaccine program. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We generally seek patent protection for our technology and product candidates in the United States and abroad. The patent coverage available to biotechnology companies is generally uncertain because it involves complex legal and factual considerations. Our success will depend, in part, on whether we can: 

 | obtain patents to protect our own technologies and product candidates;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 | obtain licenses to use the technologies of third parties, which may be protected by patents;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | protect our trade secrets and know-how; and
--+--------------------------------------------


 | operate without infringing the intellectual property and proprietary rights of others.

Government Contracts 
 BARDA Anthrax Contract 
 On September 7, 2011, we signed a contract with the BARDA pursuant to which we are developing our NasoShield anthrax vaccine. That contract with BARDA was extended through September 2016. In July 2016, 
 
24 


  we signed a new contract with BARDA, which was further amended on March 24, 2017. The five-year contract, valued at up to $127.5 million, will fund clinical development of NasoShield. 
 Under the 2011 BARDA contract, BARDA paid us a fixed fee and reimburses certain of our costs for the research and development of an Ad5-vectored, protective antigen-based intranasal anthrax vaccine through non-clinical assessment of efficacy, bio-distribution and toxicity, manufacturing process and development as required for IND application, regulatory review, and development of a Phase 1 dose ranging protocol to assess safety and immunogenicity. The 2011 BARDA contract was completed in September 2016. During the term of the 2011 BARDA contract, we received an aggregate of approximately $17.8 million from BARDA. 
 Under the current contract, BARDA pays us a fixed fee and reimburses certain of our costs for the research and development of an Ad5-vectored, protective antigen-based intranasal anthrax vaccine through current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) manufacture and conduct of a Phase 1 clinical trial dose ranging assessment of safety and immunogenicity. The contract consists of an initial base performance period providing approximately $21.6 million in funding for the period July 2016 through July 2018. BARDA has seven options to extend the contract to fund certain continued development and manufacturing activities for the anthrax vaccine, including Phase 2 clinical studies. Each option, if exercised by BARDA, would provide additional funding ranging from approximately $1.1 million to $34.4 million for the period July 2018 through July 2021. To date, we have received an aggregate of approximately $9.3 million in revenue under the current BARDA contract. 
 We own the intellectual property rights to inventions made by us in the performance of work under the BARDA contracts, provided that we disclose such inventions to the U.S. government and notifies the U.S. government of our election to retain title. The U.S. government will have a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice, or have practiced for or on our behalf, such inventions throughout the world, in addition to other rights customarily reserved by the U.S. government for intellectual property generated using government funds. 
 BARDA is a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response that supports the advanced research and development, manufacturing, acquisition and stockpiling of medical countermeasures. Our contracts with BARDA, like those awarded by other U.S. government agencies, contain provisions not typically found in commercial contracts. Most notably, BARDA, or the U.S. government acting through BARDA, may terminate, modify or amend our contract, in whole or in part, for nearly any reason or no reason. 
 NIAID Anthrax Contract 
 As a result of the Mergers on May 4, 2017, we acquired a contract with NIAID that funds the preclinical development SparVax-L. Data generated to date demonstrates that our rPA can be stably formulated in a lyophilized state for room temperature storage. The next phase of the program is a demonstration of the final form of the vaccine in a single unit, dual-chambered syringe designed for simpler storage and ease of use. All of the necessary components of the vaccine will be contained in a single logistics transport and storage will be greatly improved. Animal efficacy studies in 2016 preliminary data indicate that the vaccine is efficacious even after storage at room temperature. Additional non-clinical toxicology studies have been performed, which can support a filing with FDA to update the SparVax® IND to allow for the commencement of a subsequent clinical trial. In late 2017, we initiated an additional preclinical study to demonstrate that a two-dose regimen of SparVax-L was able to protect animals at least as well as the currently licensed vaccine. In fact, we showed that with a single dose, we obtained 67% survival and that with the two-dose regimen not only did we obtain 100% survival, but we obtained much higher toxin neutralizing (protective) antibodies than the currently licensed vaccine. 
 United States Government Regulation 
 Biological products, such as our product candidates, are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), and the Public Health Service (PHS Act), as well as other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Both the FD&C Act and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, 
 
25 


  among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products. FDA approval must be obtained before clinical testing of biological products. FDA approval also must be obtained before marketing of biological products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources, and each process may take several years to complete, although certain expedited programs potentially applicable to our product candidates, such as FDA fast track approval processes for certain new drugs with the potential to address unmet medical needs for certain serious or life-threatening conditions, may potentially expedite approval processes. Certain federal incentive programs are also potentially applicable to our product candidates, such as for orphan drugs that treat rare conditions, and programs supporting the development of bioterrorism medical countermeasures. Data obtained from clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all, and we may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our product candidates. In addition, the FDA may limit the indications for use or place other conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial application of the products. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. In addition, our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including clinical holds, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our product candidates. 
 Biological Products Development Process 
 The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
 

 | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices (GLPs), and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an application for an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and which must include approval by an independent Institutional Review Board (IRB) at each clinical site before the trials may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | performance of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials according to the FDAs regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices (GCPs), and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of a biological licensing application (BLA), for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity and potency from results of preclinical testing and clinical trials, and detailed information about the chemistry, manufacturing and controls for the product, reports of the outcomes and full data sets of the clinical trials and proposed labeling and packaging for the product;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | review of the product candidate by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with cGMPs, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological products identity, strength, quality and purity and, if applicable, the FDAs current good tissue practices (cGTPs), for the use of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
26 


 
 | satisfactory completion of potential FDA audit of the preclinical study and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA, including agreement on post-marketing commitments, if applicable.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Before testing any biological product candidate in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical study stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of certain preclinical studies must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. 
 The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical studies may continue even after the IND is submitted. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. The FDA may also place the clinical trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, studies may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such studies. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events (AEs), should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDAs regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
 

 | Phase 1. The biological product is initially introduced into a small group of healthy human subjects (e.g., 10 to 20 volunteers) and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 2. The biological product is evaluated in a larger but limited patient population (e.g., a few hundred patients) to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency and safety in an expanded patient population (e.g., several hundred to several thousand patients) at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
27 


 Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the National Institute of Health (NIH) and the investigators for serious and unexpected AEs, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing and other sources that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsors initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRBs requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies, develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 Review and Approval Processes 
 After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product, the FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human studies, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, BLAs for seasonal influenza vaccines are currently required to be submitted annually, and we would expect the same requirement to be applicable to our influenza product candidate. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. PDUFA also imposes an annual product fee for biologics and an annual establishment fee on facilities used to manufacture prescription biologics. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. 
 Following submission of the application, the FDA reviews the BLA to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or 
 
28 


  not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the products identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required. 
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP, cGTP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production and quality control. 
 Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than how we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes; or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. 
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological products safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 After regulatory approval of a product is obtained, there may be a number of post-approval requirements. For example, as a condition of approval of a BLA, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the products safety or efficacy. In addition, holders of an approved BLA are required to keep extensive records, to report certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, to provide updated safety and efficacy information and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP regulations and practices, as well as the manufacturing conditions of approval set forth in the BLA. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes certain 
 
29 


  procedural, substantive and recordkeeping requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 
 Future FDA inspections may identify compliance issues at manufacturer facilities or at the facilities of third-party suppliers that may disrupt production or distribution or require substantial resources to correct and prevent recurrence of any deficiencies and could result in fines or penalties by regulatory authorities. In addition, discovery of problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, license revocations, seizure, total or partial suspension of production or criminal penalties, any of which could delay or prohibit further marketing. Newly discovered or developed safety or efficacy data may require changes to a products approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications. 
 Certain U.S. Regulatory Incentives and Other Programs 
 Priority Rule Voucher (PRV) 
 The 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act), which was signed into law on December 13, 2016, established a new priory review voucher (PRV) program for material threat Medical Countermeasures (MCMs). Upon approval of a material threat MCM application, the FDA will award a PRV provided certain criteria are met. When a marketing application receives a priority review designation, the FDAs goal is to take action on that application within 6 months. To be considered a material threat MCM PRV, the MCM application must be: (i) intended for use to prevent or treat harm from a biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear agent (or harm caused by an MCM used against such agent) determined by the Department of Homeland Security to be a material threat; (ii) eligible for priority review; (iii) approved after the date of enactment of the Cures Act; and (iv) for a drug for which an active ingredient has not been previously approved by the FDA. 
Animal Rule and Project BioShield Emergency Use Authorization 
 In 2002, the FDA amended its requirements applicable to BLAs to permit the approval of certain biologics that are intended to reduce or prevent serious or life-threatening conditions based on evidence of safety from trial in healthy subjects and effectiveness from appropriate animal studies when human efficacy studies are not ethical or feasible. These regulations, also known as the Animal Rule, and published in the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR 601 Subpart H), authorize the FDA to rely on evidence from animal studies to provide evidence of a products effectiveness under circumstances where there is a reasonably well-understood mechanism for the toxicity of the agent. Under these requirements, and with FDAs prior agreement, biologics used to reduce or prevent the toxicity of chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear substances may be approved for use in humans based on evidence of effectiveness derived from appropriate animal studies and any additional supporting data. Products evaluated for effectiveness under this rule are evaluated for safety under preexisting requirements for establishing the safety of new drug and biological products, including Phase 1 through Phase 2 clinical trials. Under certain circumstances a single animal species may be acceptable if that animal model is sufficiently well-characterized for predicting a response in humans. The animal study endpoint must be clearly related to the desired benefit in humans and the information obtained from animal studies must allow for selection of an effective dose in humans. The Animal Rule also requires post-marketing studies, such as field studies, to verify and describe the products clinical benefit and assess its safety should an exigency exists that leads to the product being used in humans; the nature of these studies will be discussed with FDA as part of the BLA process. Products approved under the Animal Rule are subject to additional requirements, such as restrictions imposed on marketing or distribution or requirements to provide information to patients. 
 The Animal Rule drug development pathway typically involves costs and time in excess of what would be expended in conducting human vaccine clinical trials not requiring compliance with the Animal Rule. There is an 
 
30 


  alternative regulatory pathway available for biological warfare drug candidates, called Emergency use Authorization under the Project BioShield Act of 2004 (Project BioShield), which avoids the Animal Rules reliance on animal models focused on efficacy. We are seeking to rely upon Emergency Use Authorization, but there can be no assurance that this alternative model will apply to our anthrax vaccine product candidate. 
 Under Project BioShield, the Secretary of HHS may, with the concurrence of the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and upon the approval of the President, contract to purchase unapproved medical countermeasures for the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS), in specified circumstances. The U.S. Congress is notified of a recommendation for a stockpile purchase after Presidential approval. Project BioShield specifies that a company supplying the countermeasure to the SNS is paid on delivery of a substantial portion of the countermeasure. To be eligible for purchase under these provisions, the Secretary of HHS must determine that there are sufficient and satisfactory clinical results or research data, including data, if available, from preclinical studies and clinical trials, to support a reasonable conclusion that the countermeasure will qualify for approval or licensing within eight years. The legislation also allows unlicensed products to be procured for the SNS so that they are available at the time an emergency is declared. 
 Project BioShield also allows the Secretary of HHS to authorize the emergency use of medical products that have not yet been approved by the FDA. To exercise this authority, the Secretary of HHS must conclude that: 
 

 | the agent for which the countermeasure is designed can cause serious or life-threatening disease;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | based on the totality of scientific evidence available to the Secretary of HHS, including data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, if available, it is reasonable to believe that the product may be effective in detecting, diagnosing, treating or preventing the disease;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the known and potential benefits of the product outweigh its known and potential risks; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | there is no adequate, approved, and available alternative to the product for diagnosing, preventing, or treating such disease or condition.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Although this provision permits the Secretary of HHS to circumvent the FDA approval process, its use would be limited to rare circumstances. Our product candidates will be eligible both for consideration for procurement into the SNS and for use in the event of an emergency, although there is no guarantee that our product candidates will meet the criteria set forth by HHS or the FDA for procurement and Emergency use Authorization, respectively. Both our NasoShield anthrax vaccine product candidate and our NasoVAX pandemic influenza vaccine product candidate may potentially be eligible for the SNS under Project BioShield. 
 Marketing Exclusivity for Reference Biological Products 
 As part of the ongoing efforts of governmental authorities to lower health care costs by facilitating generic competition to pharmaceutical products, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA), enacted as part of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act in 2010 (Health Care Reform Law), created a new abbreviated regulatory approval pathway in the United States for biological products that are found to be biosimilar or interchangeable with a biological reference product previously licensed under a BLA. This abbreviated approval pathway is intended to permit a biosimilar to come to market more quickly and less expensively by relying to some extent on the data generated by the reference products sponsor, and the FDAs previous review and approval of the reference product. Under the BPCIA, a biosimilar sponsors ability to seek or obtain approval through the abbreviated pathway is limited by periods of exclusivity granted by the FDA to the holder of the reference products BLA, and no biosimilar application may be accepted by the FDA for review until 4 years after the date the reference product was first licensed by the FDA, and no biosimilar application, once accepted, may receive final approval until 12 years after the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. 
 While we would expect to be granted this 12-year period of exclusivity for our product candidates, if approved, notably, this period of reference product market exclusivity applies only to the biosimilar pathway and 
 
31 


  will not, for example, provide protection against any biological product for a similar indication that achieves FDA approval under a traditional BLA based on the sponsors own research data There is also risk that the 12-year period of biological reference product exclusivity could be shortened due to congressional action, or that the FDA will not consider our product candidates, if they are approved, to be reference products for competing products, potentially creating the opportunity for competition sooner than anticipated. Once approved, biosimilars likely would compete with, and in some circumstances may be deemed under the law to be interchangeable with, the previously approved reference product. The extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of our product candidates, if approved, in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing. Although there is uncertainty regarding the impact of this new program, it seems likely that if any of our product candidates are approved by the FDA, there is risk that the approval of a biosimilar competitor to one of our products could have an adverse impact on our business. In particular, a biosimilar could be significantly less costly to bring to market and priced significantly lower than our product, if approved by the FDA. 
 FDA Fast Track Programs 
 Certain FDA programs are intended to speed the availability of drugs that treat serious diseases, which could potentially apply to our product candidates, although this cannot be assured, and we do not currently have any products with fast track designation. The FDA fast track programs, one of which is fast track designation, are designed to facilitate the development and review of new drugs that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the conditions. Fast track designation applies to a combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Thus, it is the development program for a specific drug for a specific indication that receives fast track designation. The sponsor of a product designated as being in a fast track drug development program may engage in close early communication with the FDA, including through timely meetings and feedback on clinical trials. Products in fast track drug development programs also may be eligible for FDA priority review or accelerated approval, if relevant criteria are met; in other words, the review cycle may have a six-month review clock instead of a twelvemonth review clock). Sponsors may also be able to submit completed portions of an application before the entire application is completed; however, the review clock will not officially begin until the entire completed BLA is submitted to and filed by the FDA. The FDA may notify a sponsor that its program is no longer classified as a fast track development program if the fast track designation is no longer supported by emerging data, the designated drug development program is no longer being pursued, or another product that meets the unmet medical need for the same indication. 
Pediatric Exclusivity 
 Under the BPCIA, which was part of the Health Care Reform Law, biologics, such as our product candidates, may be eligible for pediatric exclusivity, an incentive intended to encourage medical product research for children. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods applicable to biological products under the BPCIA  namely, the four-year period during which the FDA will not consider an application for a biosimilar product, and the 12-year period during which the FDA will not approve a biosimilar application. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of these exclusivity protection periods, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued written request for such a trial. It is possible, but not assured, that certain of our current or future product candidates may be targeted to pediatric populations, such as our influenza vaccine candidates, and so pursuit of this incentive may be relevant to us. 
Orphan Drug Designation 
 The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or that affects more than 200,000 individuals in the 
 
32 


  United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for such a disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation can provide opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and FDA user fee exemptions. In addition, if a product that has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product may be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA would not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or a meaningfully different mode of administration. It is possible, but not assured, that certain of our current or future product candidates may be targeted to rare diseases or conditions, such as with respect to our cancer vaccine activities, and so pursuit of this incentive may be relevant to us. 
 U.S. Regulations Affecting Certain Federally Funded Programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid 
 Pharmaceutical manufacturers with products that are reimbursed by U.S. federally funded programs such as Medicare and Medicaid are subject to regulation by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and enforcement by HHS the Office of the Inspector General (OIG), and in the event our product candidates are approved, regulation by CMS and enforcement by HHS OIG would be relevant to the Company. Some of these laws, referred to as false claims laws, prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal, state and other health care payers and programs. Other laws, referred to as anti-kickback laws, prohibit soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering, purchasing, leasing or arranging for, or recommending ordering, purchasing or leasing of, items or services that are paid for by federal, state and other health care payers and programs. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Law prohibits providers and others from directly or indirectly soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration with the intent of generating referrals or orders for services or items covered by a government health care program. Many states have enacted similar laws. Courts have interpreted this law very broadly, including by holding that a violation has occurred if even one purpose of the remuneration is to generate referrals, even if there are other lawful purposes. There are statutory and regulatory exceptions, or safe harbors, that outline arrangements that are deemed lawful. However, the fact that an arrangement does not fall within a safe harbor does not necessarily render the conduct illegal under the Anti-Kickback Law. In sum, even common business arrangements, such as discounted terms and volume incentives for customers in a position to recommend or choose drugs for patients, such as physicians and hospitals, can result in substantial legal penalties, including, among others, exclusion from Medicare and Medicaid programs, and arrangements with referral sources must be structured with care to comply with applicable requirements. Also, certain business practices, such as payment of consulting fees to health care providers, sponsorship of educational or research grants, charitable donations, interactions with health care providers that prescribe products for uses not approved by the FDA and financial support for continuing medical education programs, must be conducted within narrowly prescribed and controlled limits to avoid the possibility of wrongfully influencing health care providers to prescribe or purchase particular products or as a reward for past prescribing. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Law may be punished by civil and criminal penalties or exclusion from participation in federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. 
 The Federal False Claims Act (FCA) is violated by any entity that presents or causes to be presented knowingly false claims for payment to the federal government. In addition, the Health Care Reform Law amended the FCA to create a cause of action against any person who knowingly makes a false statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly conceals or improperly decreases an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the government. For the purposes of these recent amendments, an obligation includes an identified overpayment, which is defined broadly to include any funds that a person receives or retains under Medicare and Medicaid to which the person, after applicable reconciliation, is not entitled  The FCA is commonly used to sue those who submit allegedly false Medicare or Medicaid claims, as well as those who induce or assist others to submit a false claim. False claims can result not only from 
 
33 


  non-compliance with the express requirements of applicable governmental reimbursement programs, such as Medicaid or Medicare, but also from non-compliance with other laws, such as the Anti-Kickback Law or laws that require quality care in service delivery. The fraud and abuse regulations have been subject to varying interpretations, as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years, and significant enforcement activity has been the result of relators, who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the United States (and if applicable, particular states) under federal and state false claims laws. Under the federal FCA, relators can be entitled to receive up to 30% of total recoveries. Violations of the FCA can result in treble damages, and each false claim submitted can be subject to a civil penalty, which, for penalties assessed after January 29, 2018 whose associated violations occurred after November 2, 2015, ranges from a minimum of $11,181 to a maximum of $22,363 per claim. Most states have adopted similar state false claims laws, and these state laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal FCA penalties. 
 The Health Care Reform Law significantly strengthened the federal FCA and federal Anti-Kickback Law provisions, which could lead to the possibility of increased whistleblower or relator suits, and among other things made clear that a federal Anti-Kickback Law violation can be a basis for federal FCA liability. The bringing of any FCA action, even if unsuccessful could require us to devote resources to investigate and defend the action, as well as result in reputational harm. Failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs, including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs, and could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities, increasing the risk of noncompliance. We cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 U.S. Health Care Reform Law 
 Our financial prospects could be affected by changes in health care spending and policy in the United States and abroad. We operate in a highly regulated industry and new laws or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws or decisions, related to health care availability, the method of delivery or payment for health care products and services could negatively impact our business, operations and financial condition. 
 For example, in the United States there is significant interest in promoting health care reform, as evidenced by the enactment in the United States of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the companion Health Care Reform Law. The Health Care Reform Law increased federal oversight of private health insurance plans and included a number of provisions designed to reduce Medicare expenditures and the cost of health care generally, to reduce fraud and abuse, and to provide access to increased health coverage. 
 The Health Care Reform Law has also imposed substantial changes to the U.S. system for paying for health care, including programs to extend medical benefits to millions of individuals who have lacked insurance coverage. Generally, implementation of the Health Care Reform Law has thus far included significant cost-saving, revenue and payment reduction measures with respect to, for example, several government health care programs that might cover our products in the United States, should they be commercialized, including Medicaid and Medicare. Additional downward pricing pressure associated with the Health Care Reform Law includes that the Health Care Reform Law established and provided significant funding for a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to coordinate and fund Comparative Effectiveness Research, as those terms are defined in the Health Care Reform Law. While the stated intent of Comparative Effectiveness Research is to develop information to guide providers to the most efficacious therapies, outcomes of Comparative Effectiveness Research could influence the reimbursement or coverage for therapies that are determined to be less cost effective than others. Should any of our products be approved for sale, but then determined to be less cost effective than alternative therapies, the levels of reimbursement for these products, or the willingness to reimburse at all, could be impacted, which could materially impact our financial results.

 President Trump is seeking to repeal and replace the Health Care Reform Law. Repeal and replace legislation was passed in the House of Representatives, but did not obtain the necessary votes in the Senate. Subsequently, the President has affirmed his intention to repeal and replace the Health Care Reform Law and has taken a number of administrative actions to materially weaken the Health Care Reform Law. For example, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the Health Care Reform Law to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the Health Care Reform Law that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Further, on December 22, 2017, President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law, which repealed the individual mandate of the Health Care Reform Law. The uncertain status of the Health Care Reform Law limits our ability to forecast changes that may occur in the future, and its repeal without adequate replacement may have a negative impact on our business. 
 Another provision of the Health Care Reform Law, generally referred to as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act or Open Payments Program, has imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements for pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers and distributors with certain FDA-approved products, such as approved vaccines, with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain U.S. health care practitioners, such as physicians and academic medical centers, and with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in reporting entities. The CMS publishes information from these reports on a publicly available website, including amounts transferred and the physician and teaching hospital identities. 
 Under the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, should any of our products be approved for sale, we may be required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with physicians and teaching hospitals. Our compliance with these rules may also impose additional costs. It is difficult to predict how the new requirements, which also preempt similar state law reporting requirements, may impact our relationships between pharmaceutical companies and physicians or teaching hospitals. 
 It is likely that federal and state legislatures within the United States and foreign governments will continue to consider changes to existing health care legislation. We cannot predict the reform initiatives that may be adopted in the future or whether initiatives that have been adopted will be repealed or modified. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payers of health care services to contain or reduce costs of health care may adversely affect: 
 

 | the demand for any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | our ability to set a price that we believe is fair for our products;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


 | our ability to obtain coverage and reimbursement approval for a product;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | our ability to generate revenues and achieve or maintain profitability; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the level of taxes that we are required to pay.
--+------------------------------------------------

Environmental Regulations 
 We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential federal, state or local regulations, including national and local regulations that govern our facility in France. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological and chemical substances used in, and waste generated by our operations. Our research and development involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and viruses. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources. Additionally, for formulations containing controlled substances, we are subject to Drug Enforcement Act regulations. 
 
35 


 Pricing Regulations 
 There have been a number of federal and state legislative changes made over the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biological products, government control and other changes to the health care system of the United States. Concerns about drug pricing have been expressed by members of Congress and President Trump. It is uncertain how such legislative changes will be adopted or what actions federal, state or private payers for medical goods and services may take in response to such legislation. We cannot predict the effect such health care changes will have on our business, and no assurance can be given that any such reforms will not have a material adverse effect. 
 Non-U.S. Government Regulations 
 European Drug Development 
 Our products will also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements in the European Union. As in the United States, medicinal products can only be marketed if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained. See  European Marketing Authorization below. 
 As in the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. The EU Clinical Trials Directive (2001/20/EC) (Clinical Trials Directive) provides the clinical trials regulatory framework in the European Union, but the European Union member states have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the regimes of the different member states. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the European Union countries where the trial is to be conducted by the relevant National Competent Authority (NCA), and one or more Ethics Committees (ECs), and a Clinical Trial Authorization must be obtained. 
 Similar to the FDA, Europes Committee for Medicinal Products for Human use (CHMP) has adopted ICH S6 as a guideline governing preclinical testing of biologics. Sponsors usually must conduct pharmacodynamic (PD) studies, such as in vitro binding assays and in vivo studies that assess the products pharmacologic activity and define its mechanism of action. Biologics typically undergo single- and repeat-dose toxicity studies using relevant species. Safety pharmacology studies, which evaluate the products functional effects on major body systems and specific organs, and local tolerance testing can be done separately or subsumed in toxicity testing. Sponsors also usually conduct single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) and/or toxicokinetic studies to assess absorption, disposition, exposure and clearance (in particular, antibody-mediated clearance), and explore dose-response relationships. This information is used to predict margins of safety for human studies. Immunogenicity testing might include screening and mechanistic studies. 
 Clinical Trial Authorization in the European Union 
 The Clinical Trials Directive and European Commission guidance describe the steps that a sponsor must take before commencing a clinical trial. According to these documents, a clinical trial may commence only if: (i) the anticipated therapeutic and public health benefits outweigh any foreseeable risks and inconveniences to the subjects; (ii) the trial subjects understand the objectives and risks of the trial and give informed, written consent to participate; (iii) the trial safeguards the physical and mental integrity of the subjects; and (iv) insurance covers the liability of the sponsor and investigator. To comply with these requirements, the trial sponsor must take certain steps. In general, the sponsor must take responsibility for trial conduct, appointment of an appropriate investigator, selection of the institution that will conduct the trial, quality control, data collection standards, protocol drafting, and creation of the investigators brochure. The sponsor then must apply for approval from both the ethics committee and the relevant NCA in the member state. Written authorization may be required for all biologics trials and is required for trials involving medicines containing genetically modified organisms, medicines for gene therapy, and medicines for somatic cell therapy (including xenogenic cell therapy). The opinion of the ethics committee should be issued within 60 days. A review period of 30 days can 
 
36 


  be added for medicines requiring written authorization noted earlier, and for xenogenic cell therapy, there are no time limits for authorization. This timeframe can be extended by an additional 90 days (in addition to the original 90 days) if the ethics committee consults a national group or committee. The trial may begin only if (i) the ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion and (ii) no competent authority has informed the applicant of grounds for non-acceptance.
Good Clinical Practices and Other Considerations for Clinical Trials 
 Clinical trials of biologics must comply with GCP, as described in Directive 2005/28/EC on Good Clinical Practice and the ICH E6 guideline, which the CHMP has adopted. The directive and guideline describe general governing principles for clinical trials. The rights, safety and well-being of trial subjects must prevail over the interests of science and society. Investigators must obtain freely given informed consent from every trial subject before each subject is enrolled. Clinical trial information must be handled, recorded and stored with respect for relevant confidentiality and privacy rules. Trials must comply with the ethical principles of the World Medical Associations Declaration of Helsinki. Specific GCP guidelines apply to trials of advanced therapy medicinal products. These guidelines regulate issues such as the donation, procurement and testing of human tissues and cells; the implementation of a traceability system; and specific rules on safety reporting and long-term follow-up. Under the Clinical Trials Directive, special requirements apply to clinical trials conducted on minors and other persons not able to give informed legal consent. These requirements are intended to preserve the dignity of the trial subjects, confirm that the benefits of the trial outweigh the risks and ensure that subjects representatives give consent with as much involvement of the subject as possible. Competent authorities must record information regarding trials in the European database of clinical trials which is accessible only to other competent authorities, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and the European Commission. CHMP has issued a guideline on quality requirements during the clinical trial period for investigational medicinal products containing biological or biotechnology-derived substances. The guideline describes quality documentation that should be submitted to the competent authority as part of the sponsors investigational medicinal product dossier (IMPD). The IMPD should include, among other things, (i) an adequate description of the process and process controls, including a flow chart of all successive steps and details of in-process testing and (ii) a description and justification of any reprocessing during manufacture of the drug substance. The guideline also recognizes that sponsors will improve and optimize their manufacturing processes during clinical development and describes the steps sponsors should take following these changes. Specifically, the sponsor must compare the quality attributes of the pre- and post-change biological active substances and relevant intermediates, and conduct a comparability exercise where necessary. For first-in-human clinical trials, sponsors should use product representative of the material used during the non-clinical testing phase. Finally, with regard to characterization, the guideline requires details on the biological activity to be provided, recognizing that the extent of characterization data will further increase in later phases. 
Study Design Considerations 
 General regulatory guidance on study design applies to biologics as well as small molecule medicines. According to the guidance, there is a close, but variable correlation between phase of development and type of study, but one type of trial can occur in several different phases. The guidance therefore identifies the most typical kind of study for each phase. 
 Phase 1 usually involves the initial introduction of the investigational product into human subjects, and studies in this phase usually have non-therapeutic objectives. Specifically, Phase 1 studies typically investigate initial safety and tolerability, PK, PD and/or drug activity, to preliminarily determine the potential therapeutic benefit of a medicine. Phase 1 studies may be conducted in healthy volunteers or certain types of patients. If the medicine has significant potential toxicity (e.g., cytotoxic products), the trial will usually be conducted in patients. 
 The most typical Phase 2 study is a therapeutic exploratory study that explores efficacy in narrowly defined, relatively homogenous groups of patients. Initially, studies may use a variety of designs (e.g., concurrent controls 
 
37 


  and comparisons with baseline status). Subsequent Phase 2 trials usually are randomized and concurrently controlled, allowing for evaluation of the medicines safety and efficacy for a particular indication. A major goal of this phase is to determine the dose(s) for Phase 3 trials. 
 Phase 3 typically involves therapeutic confirmatory studies that are designed to verify the preliminary evidence obtained in Phase 2 and to provide a sufficient basis for marketing authorization. Phase 3 studies may also further explore the dose response relationship, or explore the drugs use in wider populations, in different stages of disease, or in combination with another drug. With regard to medicines administered for long periods, extended exposure trials ordinarily occur during Phase 3, although the sponsor may start them in Phase 2. 
 To ensure that clinical trials in all three phases of development will be adequate to support a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA), sponsors should design these trials with the MAA requirements in mind. Biologics in general need to comply with the requirements set out in Part III of the Annex I to Directive 2003/63/EC, and advanced therapy medicinal products need to comply with the requirements described in Part IV. 
 Consultation with the European Medicines Agency 
 A sponsor may obtain, from the EMA, scientific advice regarding clinical trial protocols. Although this advice does not bind the ethics committees or NCAs and is not binding for purposes of a future MAA, it can be useful to guide revisions to the protocol. The agencys remarks will only address scientific issues and will generally focus on matters such as the selection of endpoints and comparator, the duration of treatment or follow-up and the design of pivotal studies. Advice also might address a sponsors proposal to deviate from a CHMP guideline. If the applicant decides not to follow the EMAs advice, it should justify this decision in its MAA. EMA guidance details the procedures for requesting scientific advice. The fact that an applicant requests advice from EMA does not preclude it from also seeking advice from national competent authorities or from foreign regulators, such as the FDA. The process of obtaining advice from the national competent authorities is often less formal than requesting advice from the EMA, and such advice can prove helpful. Consequently, seeking such advice is a common choice among applicants. Applicants also may seek parallel scientific advice from the EMA and FDA. Generally, the parallel scientific procedure is available for important breakthrough drugs, that is, products that the EMA and FDA have identified as falling within therapeutic areas of overlapping interest (e.g., oncology products, vaccines and blood products). The goal of these meetings is to provide clarity regarding the regulatory requirements of each region and the reasons for any differences between them. A sponsor requesting parallel scientific advice should authorize the agencies to exchange all information about the product, including trade secrets. After the parallel scientific advice procedure, each agency will provide its own independent advice on the questions at issue. There is no guarantee of harmonized advice or identical regulatory decisions on the approvability of the product. 
European Marketing Authorization 
 In the European Economic Area (EEA), which includes the 28-member states of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be placed on the market after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. The MAA is based on the results of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials conducted on the medicinal product in question. There are two types of marketing authorization: 

 | The Centralized MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the CHMP and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of drugs, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products containing new active substances indicated for certain diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for other drugs provided eligibility criteria are met.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the member states of the EEA (for example, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency in the United Kingdom) and only
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
38 


 
cover their respective territory, are available for drugs not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a drug has already been authorized for marketing in a member state of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in other member states through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the drug has not received a National MA in any member state at the time of application, it can be approved by multiple member states in parallel through the Decentralized Procedure.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the drug on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. 
 The Marketing Authorization Application: Contents and Approval Standard 
 Many biologics fall under the scope of the Centralized Procedure, which, as mentioned above, is mandatory for medicines developed through biotechnological methods, such as recombinant DNA technology; controlled expression of genes coding for biologically active proteins in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, including transformed mammalian cells; and hybridoma and mAb methods. For example, cell therapy, gene therapy, vaccines from strains developed through recombinant DNA technology (including gene deletion), and any medicinal product for which a monoclonal antibody is used at any stage in the manufacturing process are all subject to the Centralized Procedure. Nonetheless, some biologics are still approved at the member state level. For example, many vaccines do not fall within the scope of the Centralized Procedure. The EMA has published a guideline intended to harmonize the summaries of product characteristics and patient information leaflets for human vaccines. 
 With respect to the Centralized Procedure, the approval standards for biotechnology products are the same as for chemically synthesized medicines. Both types of products must be safe and effective and have appropriate quality. Because of their special characteristics, however, biotechnology products must comply with several additional dossier requirements. The MAA for a biotechnology product must meet the standard dossier submission requirements, as described in Article 8 of the Medicines Directive (2001/83/EC). Consequently, the MAA must generally comply with the Common Technical Document format, including with respect to Module I (administrative information, including labeling and mock-ups), Module 2 (various summaries), Module 3 (chemical, pharmaceutical and biological information), Module 4 (non-clinical reports) and Module 5 (clinical study reports). MAAs for biologics also must meet special requirements. The applicant must thoroughly describe the manufacturing process and must: (i) provide information on the origin and history of the starting materials; (ii) demonstrate that the active substance complies with specific measures for preventing the transmission of animal spongiform encephalopathies; (iii) if cell banks are used, demonstrate that cell characteristics remain unchanged at the passage level for production (and beyond); (iv) provide information as to whether there are adventitious agents in seed materials, cell banks, pools of serum or plasma, and all other materials of biological origin, and, if it is not possible to avoid the presence of potentially pathogenic adventitious agents, show that further processing ensures elimination or inactivation of the agents; (v) if possible, base vaccine production on a seed lot system and established cell banks; (vi) in case of medicines derived from human blood or plasma, describe the origin, criteria and procedures for the collection, transportation and storage of the starting material; and (vii) describe the manufacturing facilities and equipment. Other special rules apply certain types of biological medicines. For example, for plasma-derived medicinal products, the applicant must provide an information dossier, the Plasma Master File. MAAs for vaccines other than for influenza need to contain a Vaccine Antigen Master File. Special rules also apply to advanced therapy medicinal products, including gene therapies, somatic cell therapies and tissue-engineered products. 
Data and Market Exclusivity in the European Union 
 In the European Union, new medicinal products qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovators data to assess a generic or biosimilar 
 
39 


  application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovators data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period may be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the period of data exclusivity, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. 
 Orphan Designation in the European Union 
 The EMA is also able to grant orphan designation in respect of medicinal products. To qualify the medicinal product must be intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of (i) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union or (ii) a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Union where without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the medicinal product in the European Union would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. Further, no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question must exist in the European Union or, if such method exists, the medicinal product must be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. 
 Orphan medicinal products still remain subject to the same regulatory approval process, albeit that they are always assessed through the Centralized Procedure. However, sponsors of orphan medicinal products are eligible to benefit from a number of incentives offered, including certain assistance with development of the medicinal product, reduced fees for MA applications and protection from market competition once the medicinal product is authorized, as below. 
 Where an MA in respect of an orphan medicinal product is granted, the EMA and the competent authorities of the member states shall not, for a period of ten years, accept another application for an MA, or grant an MA or accept an application to extend an existing MA, for the same therapeutic indication, in respect of a similar medicinal product, unless: (i) the holder of the MA for the original orphan medicinal product has given its consent to the second applicant; (ii) the holder of the MA for the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities of the medicinal product; or (iii) the second applicant can establish the second medicinal is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior. 
 Other Jurisdictions 
 In addition to regulations in the United States and the European Union, we may be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our product. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval from comparable regulatory authorities in foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials in such countries and the approval of the regulators of foreign countries before we may market products in such countries. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 
Acceptance of Foreign Clinical Trials in the United States and Europe 
 The FDA has adopted regulations governing its acceptance of foreign clinical data not conducted under an IND to support IND applications or marketing authorizations, such as BLAs. The conditions include requirements regarding the ability of the FDA to conduct onsite inspections to validate such data, and compliance with GCPs. Where a marketing application is based solely on foreign data, additional requirements apply, including a demonstration that the foreign data are applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice. 
 EU Directive 2001/83/EC allows for clinical trials conducted outside the European Union to be taken into consideration during the review of an MAA in the European Union if such trials have been designed, 
 
40 


  implemented and reported based on principles equivalent to those of the Clinical Trials Directive with regard to good clinical practice and ethical principles. Moreover, they should comply with the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. The applicant must submit a statement declaring such compliance as part of the MAA. In December 2008, the EMA published a strategy paper on the acceptance of data from foreign clinical trials conducted in third countries, particularly those outside the traditional Western European and North American research areas. According to this strategy paper, there is a growing concern both among regulators and in public debate about how well these trials are conducted from an ethical and scientific/organizational standpoint. The EMA has called for increased cooperation between international regulatory authorities involved in the supervision of clinical trials and has put forth other proposals to address these issues. 
 Manufacturing and Source of Supply 
 We do not have any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval. To date, we have obtained materials for clinical trials and non-clinical studies from third-party manufacturers who are suppliers to us. For our product candidates, we intend to identify and qualify additional contract manufacturers to provide commercial scale manufacturing prior to submission of an NDA to the FDA. 
 U.S. Government Contracts 
 Substantially all of our revenues to date have been derived from grants and U.S. government contracts. There can be no assurances that our remaining U.S. government contract will be continued, renewed beyond the base period, or that we can enter into new contracts or receive new grants to supply the U.S. or other governments with our products. The process of obtaining government contracts is lengthy and uncertain. 
 U.S. government contracts typically are subject to audit by the government and contain termination provisions for the government allowing it to terminate at its discretion, which subjects us to additional risks. These risks include the ability of the U.S. government unilaterally to: 
 

 | preclude us, either temporarily or for a set period of time, from receiving new contracts or extending our remaining contracts based on violations or suspected violations of laws or regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | terminate our remaining contracts either for the convenience of the government (at the governments sole discretion, for example, if funds become unavailable or the government no longer wants the work) or for default (for failing to perform in accordance with the contract schedule and terms);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | revise the scope and value of our contracts and/or the timing for work to be performed;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | audit and object to our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | control and potentially prohibit the export of our products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


 | claim rights to intellectual property, including our products, developed under the contract;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | add or remove the terms and conditions in our contracts; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


 | cancel or amend planned procurements, including outstanding request for proposal solicitations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Company has been audited by BARDA through 2014 and has agreed on final indirect rates with the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) through 2011. 
 Termination-for-convenience provisions generally enable us to recover only our costs incurred or committed, settlement expenses, and profit on the work completed prior to termination. Termination-for-default provisions do not permit these recoveries and would make us liable for excess costs incurred by the U.S. government in procuring undelivered items from another source.
