At the center of our customer engagement-or CRM-applications is the Customer Decision Hub, our real-time AI engine, which leads the industry in its ability to predict a customers behavior and recommend the Next-best-action to take across channels in real-time. 
 

 | The Pega® Marketing application is designed to enable enterprises to improve customer acquisition and experiences across inbound, outbound, and paid media channels. It incorporates AI in the form of predictive and machine-learning analytics, as well as business rules, and executes these decisions in real-time to evaluate the context of each customer interaction and dynamically deliver the most relevant action, offer, content, and channel.

 Digital process automation 
 Pegasystems offers industry-specific software applications built on the Pega Platform. These applications provide businesses with robust capabilities to automate industry-specific business processes. As they are built on the Pega Platform, these applications deliver flexibility beyond traditional, off the shelf products. Our applications allow our clients to offer differentiated service and value to their customers. The Pega Platform empowers organizations to implement new processes quickly, refine customer experiences, bring new offerings to market, and provide customized or specialized automated processing. 
 Our capabilities 
 Real-time, Omni-channel AI 
 AI has been around for many years, in many forms, yet only in the past decade businesses have started experiencing its practical applications fueled by the new abundance of data to power decisions and ever-increasing customer expectations. Our CRM and other applications built on the Pega platform, leverage predictive and adaptive analytics to deliver more personalized customer experiences and maximize business objectives. The Pega Customer Decision Hub®, a centralized, always-on brain unleashes the power of predictive analytics, machine learning, and real-time decisioning across our clients data, systems, and touchpointsorchestrating engagement on and across customer interactions channels. 
 End-to-end robotic automation 
 Pega brings together Robotic Automation capabilities-for both human-assisted robotic desktop automation and unattended robotic process automation-with our unified BPM, and case management capabilities. This gives our applications and platform the ability to automate both customer-facing processes and back-office operational processes from end-to-end, connecting across organizational and system silos to seamlessly and efficiently connect customers and employees to outcomes.

 Journey-centric rapid delivery 
 Our CRM and DPA solutions are designed to improve targeted customer outcomes, quickly and with out-of-the-box functionality that connects enterprise data and systems to customer experience channels. From there, organizations can scale, one customer journey-at-a-time, to realize greater value while delivering increasingly consistent and personalized customer experiences. 
 Software that writes your software 
 Our approach bypasses the error-prone and time-consuming process of manually translating requirements into code. Users design software in no-code visual models that reflect the needs of the business. The software application is created and optimized automatically and directly from the model, helping to close the costly gap between vision and execution. Changes to the code are made by changing the model, and application documentation is generated directly from the model. The Pega Platform is standards-based and can leverage a clients existing technology to create new business applications that cross technology silos and bridge front and back-office. 
 Unified future-proof platform 
 Pega offers a unified digital process automation platform, combining robotics, process automation, and case management together in a unified architecture. We build in powerful decision analytics, designed to allow our clients to automate any process while working faster and smarter. Our no-code architecture is designed to empower organizations to scale across all dimensions of their business, including product lines, departments, and geographies, by reusing components and avoiding the traditional method of deploying multiple CRM and BPM instances that lead to even more silos and disjointed customer experiences. 
 Cloud choice 
 Pega Cloud® Services allow clients to develop, test, and deploy, on an accelerated basis, our CRM applications and Pega Platform using a secure, flexible internet-based infrastructure. Pega Cloud provides production, development, and testing (Dev/Test) services to accelerate the development and deployment of Pega applications and the Pega Platform. This allows our clients to minimize infrastructure cost while focusing on core revenue generating competencies. 
 Additionally, the Pega Platform and CRM applications are deployable on other cloud architectures, including client or partner-managed clouds. This cloud choice gives our clients the ability to select, and change as needed, the best cloud architecture for the security, data access, speed-to-market, and budget requirements of each application they deploy. 
 Our Services and Support 
 We offer services and support through our Global Customer Success group, our Global Customer Support group, and our Pega® Academy training services group. We also use third-party contractors to assist us in providing these services. 
 Global Customer Success 
 Our Global Customer Success group combines our sales and Pega consulting groups and provides guidance and implementation services to our clients and partners on how to best apply our technology and develop strong implementation expertise. 
Global Customer Support 
 Our Global Customer Support group oversees technical support of our products and Pega Cloud. Support services include managing the online support community, proactive problem prevention through information and knowledge sharing, and problem tracking, prioritization, escalation, diagnosis, and resolution.

 We also offer software to a broad range of other types of companies and industries. For example, we license our applications and platform to clients in travel, transportation, retail, and other services. 
 Competition 
 The markets for our offerings are intensely competitive, rapidly changing, and highly fragmented, as current competitors expand their product offerings and new companies enter the market. 
 We encounter competition from: 
 

 | CRM application vendors;
--+-------------------------


 | BPM vendors, including no-code and low-code application development platforms, and service-oriented architecture middleware vendors;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Case management vendors;
--+-------------------------


 | Decision management, data science and AI vendors, as well as vendors of solutions that leverage decision making and data science in managing customer relationships and marketing;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Robotic automation and workforce intelligence software providers;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Companies that provide application specific software for the financial services, healthcare, insurance, and other specific markets;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Mobile application platform vendors;
--+-------------------------------------

 
9 


 
 | Co-browsing software providers;
--+--------------------------------


 | Social listening, text analytics, and natural language processing vendors;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Professional service organizations that develop their own products or create custom software in conjunction with rendering consulting services; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Clients in-house information technology departments, which may seek to modify their existing systems or develop their own proprietary systems.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Competitors vary in size, scope and breadth of the products and services they offer and include some of the largest companies in the world, such as Salesforce.com, Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation, SAP SE, and International Business Machines Corporation (IBM). 
 We have been most successful competing for clients whose businesses are characterized by a high degree of change, complexity, or regulation. We believe the principal competitive factors within our market include: 
 

 | Product adaptability, scalability, functionality, and performance;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Proven success in delivering cost-savings and efficiency improvements;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Proven success in enabling improved customer interactions;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


 | Ease-of-use for developers, business units, and end-users;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


 | Timely development and introduction of new products and product enhancements;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Establishment of a significant base of reference clients;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


 | Ability to integrate with other products and technologies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


 | Customer service and support;
--+------------------------------


 | Product price;
--+---------------


 | Vendor reputation; and
--+-----------------------


 | Relationships with systems integrators.
--+----------------------------------------

 We believe we are competitively differentiated as our unified Pega Platform is designed to allow both client business and IT staff, using a single, intuitive user interface, to build and evolve enterprise applications in a fraction of the time it would take with disjointed architectures and tools offered by our competitors. In addition, our applications, built on the Pega Platform, provide the same level of flexibility and ability to adapt to our clients needs. We believe we compete favorably due to our expertise in our target industries and our long-standing client relationships. We believe we compete less favorably on the basis of some of these factors with respect to our larger competitors, many of which have greater sales, marketing, and financial resources, more extensive geographical presence, and greater name recognition than we do. In addition, we may be at a disadvantage with respect to our ability to provide expertise outside our target industries. See Risk FactorsThe market for our offerings is intensely and increasingly competitive, rapidly changing, and highly fragmented. in Item 1A of this Annual Report. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We rely primarily on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secrets laws, as well as confidentiality and intellectual property agreements to protect our proprietary rights. We have obtained patents relating to our system architecture and products in strategic global markets. We enter into confidentiality, intellectual property ownership, and license agreements with our employees, partners, clients, and other third parties. We also control access to and ownership of software, services, documentation, and other proprietary information as means to protect our proprietary rights. 
 
10 


 Sales and Marketing 
 We sell our software and services primarily through a direct sales force. In addition, strategic partnerships with management consulting firms and major systems integrators are important to our sales efforts because they influence buying decisions, help us identify sales opportunities, and complement our software and services with their domain expertise and consulting capabilities. We also partner with technology providers and application developers. 
 To support our sales efforts, we conduct a broad range of marketing programs, including awareness advertising, client and industry-targeted solution campaigns, trade shows, including our PegaWorld® user conference, solution seminars and webinars, industry analyst and press relations, Web and digital marketing, community development, social media, and other direct and indirect marketing efforts. Our consulting staff, business partners, and other third parties also conduct joint and separate marketing campaigns that generate sales leads. 
Sales by Geography 
 See Note 17, Geographic Information and Major Clients, included in Item 8 and Risk FactorsWe face risks from operations and clients based outside of the U.S. in Item 1A of this Annual Report. 
Research and Development 
 Our development organization is responsible for product architecture, core technology development, product testing, and quality assurance. Our product development priority is to continue expanding the capabilities of our technology. We intend to maintain and extend the support of our existing applications, and we may choose to invest in additional strategic applications which incorporate the latest business innovations. We also intend to maintain and extend the support of popular hardware platforms, operating systems, databases, and connectivity options to facilitate easy and rapid deployment in diverse IT infrastructures. Our goal with all of our products is to enhance product capabilities, ease of implementation, long-term flexibility, and the ability to provide improved client service. 
 During 2017, 2016, and 2015, research and development expenses were approximately $162.9 million, $145.5 million, and $126.4 million, respectively. See Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report. We expect that we will continue to commit significant resources to our product research and development in the future to maintain our leadership position. 
 Employees 
 As of January 31, 2018 we had 4,237 employees worldwide, of which 1,768 were based in North America, 834 were based in Europe, and 1,635 were based in Asia Pacific. 
 Backlog 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had software license, maintenance, cloud, and services agreements with clients not yet recognized in revenue (backlog) of approximately $850.3 million. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $707.8 million in backlog. 
 Under some of these agreements, we must fulfill certain conditions prior to recognizing revenue, and there can be no assurance when, if ever, we will be able to satisfy all such conditions in each instance. Additionally, some backlog amounts may not be recognized as revenue in future periods as a result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard (ASC 606) effective January 1, 2018. See Note 2. Significant Accounting Polices in Item 8 of this Annual Report. 
 
11 


 Backlog may vary in any given period depending on the amount and timing of when arrangements are executed, as well as the mix between perpetual license, term license, and cloud arrangements. See Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report for a discussion on license and cloud backlog, which excludes future revenue from maintenance and service arrangements.
