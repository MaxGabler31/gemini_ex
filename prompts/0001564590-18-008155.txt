Company Overview 
 J.Jill is a premier omnichannel retailer and nationally recognized women’s apparel brand committed to delighting customers with great wear-now product. The brand represents an easy, relaxed, inspired style that reflects the confidence and comfort of a woman with a rich, full life. J.Jill provides guiding service through more than 270 stores nationwide and a robust e-commerce platform. J.Jill is headquartered outside Boston.
Brand 
 We have developed a differentiated brand image that encourages customers to build deep, personal connections with our brand. Our brand promise to the J.Jill customer is to delight her with great wear-now product, to inspire her confidence through J.Jill’s approach to dressing and to provide her with friendly, guiding service wherever and whenever she chooses to shop. We use our key brand attributes - Naturally Authentic, Thoughtfully Engaging, Relaxed Femininity, Positive Energy and Confident Simplicity - to guide brand messaging, which is consistently communicated to our customers, whether she chooses to shop on our www.jjill.com website, in our retail stores or through our catalog. 
Customer 
 While women of all ages are attracted to our brand, our typical customer is 40 to 65 years old, is college educated and has an annual household income of approximately $150,000. She leads a busy, yet balanced life, as she works outside the home, is involved in her community and has a family with children. She values comfort, ease and versatility in her wardrobe, in addition to quality fabrics and thoughtful details. She is fashion conscious and looks to J.Jill to interpret current trends relevant to her needs and lifestyle. She is tech savvy, but also loves the J.Jill store experience and frequently engages with us across all channels. 
 As our customers increase their tenure with our brand, they tend to spend more and purchase more frequently. Additionally, as we retain customers over time, they tend to migrate from single channel customers to more valuable omnichannel customers. Omnichannel customers reflect 23% of our active customer base for fiscal year 2017, which has increased from 22% in fiscal year 2016 and 20% in pro forma fiscal year 2015. See “Management’s Discussion of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information” for discussion regarding our pro forma fiscal year 2015.
 Product 
 Our Products 
 Our products are marketed under the J.Jill brand name and sold exclusively through our retail and direct channels. Our diverse assortment of apparel spans knit and woven tops, bottoms and dresses as well as sweaters and outerwear. We also offer a range of complementary footwear and accessories, including scarves, jewelry and hosiery. By presenting our merchandise in clear product stories, we strive to uncomplicate fashion, providing comfortable, easy and versatile collections that enable our customer to dress confidently for a broad range of occasions. Our products are available across the full range of sizes including Misses, Petites, Women’s and Tall, and reflect a modern balance of style, quality, comfort and ease at

accessible price points. The core products of our assortment are designed and merchandised in-house, grounded with essential yet versatile styles and fabrications that are typically represented across a season. Assortments are updated each month with fresh colors, layering options, novelty and fashion. In addition to our core assortment, we have two sub-brands as extensions of our brand aesthetic and our customer lifestyle needs: 
 Pure Jill:  Our Pure Jill sub-brand reflects the art of understated ease. It is designed with a clear focus and minimalist approach to style, and reflected in simple shapes, unstructured silhouettes, interesting textures, soft natural fabrics and artful details. 
 Wearever:  Our Wearever sub-brand consists of our refined rayon jersey knit collection that is designed for work, travel and home. It has a foundational collection of versatile shapes and proportions, in solids and prints that mix easily to provide endless options that work together. These soft knits are easy care and wrinkle-free, and always look great. 
 We also offer accessories in unique, versatile and wearable collections.   These accessory collections are primarily driven by scarves and jewelry and seamlessly complete our customer’s wardrobe. 
 Product Design and Development 
 We offer 12 merchandise collections that are introduced every four weeks and designed and delivered to provide a consistent flow of fresh products. All of our merchandise is designed in-house, and we create newness through the use of different fabrics, colors, patterns and silhouettes. We introduce each collection simultaneously in our retail stores, on our website and in our catalogs. We support each collection with sequenced floor sets, continuous web updates and 24 corresponding catalog editions in addition to regular, coordinated marketing activities. Our new product development lifecycle typically takes 48 weeks from design concept through delivery. We leverage feedback and purchasing data from our customer database along with continual collaborative hindsighting to guide our product and merchandising decision making. The close coordination between our teams ensures that our product and brand message is clearly communicated to our customers across all channels. 
Channel 
 Driven by our direct-to-consumer heritage, we have a well-diversified and profitable omnichannel platform. We strive to deliver a seamless brand experience to our customer, wherever and whenever she chooses to shop across our retail stores, website and catalogs. Our sales channels reinforce one another and drive traffic to each other, and we deliver a consistent brand message by coordinating the release of our monthly product collection across channels, allowing our customers to experience a uniform brand message. We believe that our customers’ buying decisions are influenced by this consistent messaging and experience across sales channels. We have a track record of migrating customers from a single-channel customer to a more valuable, omnichannel customer over time. 
Retail Channel 
 Our Stores 
 Our retail channel represented 57% of net sales for fiscal year 2017. As of February 3, 2018, we operated 276 stores across 42 states with approximately half located in lifestyle centers and the remaining in premium malls; all of our stores are leased. Our stores range in size from approximately 2,350 to 6,100 square feet, and the average store is approximately 3,700 square feet. 
 Our store designs showcase our brand and elevate, yet simplify, the J.Jill shopping experience. Our stores provide a welcoming, easy-to-shop format that guides her through clearly merchandised product stories. With natural materials in soothing neutral colors, comfortable fabrics and elegant seating areas, the atmosphere is aspirational, yet attainable. When she cannot find an item in-stock at her local store, our concierge service leverages our in-store ordering platform and ships products to her home with no shipping charge. 
 Site Selection 
 We believe our store expansion model supports our ability to grow our store footprint in both new and existing markets across the United States with the potential to simultaneously enhance our direct channel sales by migrating single-channel customers to omnichannel customers. New store locations are evaluated on various factors, including customer demographics within a market, concentration of existing customers, location of existing stores and center tenant quality and mix. We also

leverage our customer database, including purchasing history and customer demographics, to determine geographic locations that may benefit from a retail store. We target opening new stores in high traffic locations with desirable demographic characteristics and favorable lease economics. We believe we have the opportunity to add up to 100 stores to our store base of 276. We plan to open 10-12 new stores in fiscal year 2018. We also selectively close underperforming stores. 
 The following table shows new store openings since fiscal year 2013. The stores opened in the last three years were primarily in lifestyle centers.

Direct Channel 
 Our direct channel, which represented 43% of total net sales for fiscal year 2017, consists of our website and catalog orders. 
 E-commerce Platform 
 At the end of fiscal year 2017, we upgraded our website, www.jjill.com, from a proprietary platform to a new, enhanced platform. The improved capabilities of the new platform will improve our customers’ shopping experience and engagement by featuring updates on new collections, guidance on how to wardrobe and wear our products and the ability to chat live with a sales representative.
 Our website also provides customers with a broader range of colors and sizes, including Women’s and Tall sizes, than available in our stores. Additionally, we leverage our website as an inventory clearance vehicle, which allows us to keep our retail store products fresh and representative of our newest collection. Within our direct channel, E-commerce represented 89% of fiscal 2017 net sales.
 Catalog 
 Our catalogs are an integral part of our business. As one of our primary marketing vehicles, our catalogs promote and reinforce our brand image and drive customer acquisition and engagement across all of our channels. We produce 24 annual editions of our catalog that, when combined with increased online marketing, drives customer acquisition and engagement across all sales channels.  As on our website and in our retail stores, our catalogs reflect our product offering in settings that align with our merchandise segments, including our sub-brands, and provide guidance on styling and wardrobing. Our catalogs are designed in-house, providing us with greater creative control as well as effectively managing our catalog production costs. Within our direct channel, catalog orders represented 11% of fiscal year 2017 net sales. 
Competitive Strengths 
 Distinct, Well-Recognized Brand. The J.Jill brand represents an easy, relaxed and inspired style that reflects the confidence and comfort of a woman with a rich, full life. We have cultivated a differentiated brand and through our commitment to our customer and our brand building activities, we have created significant brand trust and an emotional connection with our customers. 
 Omnichannel Business. We have developed an omnichannel business model comprised of our retail stores and our direct channel. Our retail and direct channels complement and drive traffic to one another, and we leverage our targeted marketing initiatives to acquire new customers across channels. We have a track record of migrating customers from a single-channel customer to a more valuable, omnichannel customer over time. We believe our omnichannel capabilities enable us to deliver a seamless brand experience to our customer, wherever and whenever she chooses to shop.

Data-Centric Approach That Drives Consistent Profitability and Mitigates Risk. We believe we have industry-leading data capture capabilities that allow us to match approximately 98% of transactions to an identifiable customer. We use our extensive customer database to track and effectively analyze customer information (e.g., name, address, age, household income and occupation) as well as contact history (e.g., catalog and email). We also have significant visibility into our customers’ transaction behavior (e.g., orders, returns, order value), including purchases made across our channels. As such, we can identify a single-channel customer who purchases a product through our website, our retail store or our catalogs, as well as an omnichannel customer who purchases in more than one channel. We continually leverage this database and apply our insights to operate our business as well as to acquire new customers and then create, build and maintain a relationship with each customer to drive optimum value.
 Affluent and Loyal Customer Base. We target an attractive demographic of affluent women in the 40-65 age range, a segment of the population that is experiencing outsized population growth between 2010 and 2020 in the United States, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. With an average annual household income of approximately $150,000, our customer has significant spending power. Our private label credit card program also drives customer loyalty and encourages spending. We believe we will continue to develop long-term customer relationships that can drive profitable sales growth. 
 Customer-Focused Product Assortment. Our customers strongly associate our product with a modern balance of style, quality, comfort and ease suitable for a broad range of occasions at accessible price points. Our customer-focused assortment spans a full range of sizes and is designed to provide easy wardrobing that is relevant to her lifestyle. Each year we offer 12 merchandise collections that are introduced approximately every four weeks and designed and delivered to provide a consistent flow of fresh products. We create product newness through the use of different fabrics, colors, patterns and silhouettes. We have an in-house, customer centric product design and development process that leverages our extensive database of customer feedback and allows us to identify and incorporate changes in our customers’ preferences. We believe our customer focused approach to product development and continual delivery of fresh, high quality products drives traffic, frequency and conversion.
 Highly Experienced Leadership Team. Our leadership team has experience with leading global organizations and an average of 25 years of industry experience with significant expertise in merchandising, marketing, retail, E-commerce, human resources, and finance. We have developed a strong and collaborative culture aligned around our goals to Create a great brand, to Build a successful business and to Make J.Jill a great place to work.
Growth Strategy 
 Key drivers of our growth strategy include: 
 Grow Size and Value of Our Customer Base. We have a significant opportunity to continue to attract new customers to our brand and to grow the size and value of our active customer base across all channels. We have strategically increased our marketing investment to drive growth through the acquisition of new customers, reactivation of lapsed customers, and the retention of existing customers. We recently began a brand voice initiative and a customer segmentation initiative which, upon completion, will further enhance our ability to target the highest value customers and increase customer spending. Through these initiatives, we believe we will continue to attract new customers to our brand, migrate from single-channel to more profitable omnichannel customers and increase overall customer spend.
 Increase Direct Sales. Given our strong foundation and recent website enhancements, we believe we can leverage our direct platform to broaden our customer reach and drive additional sales.  We are undertaking initiatives to further develop our recently upgraded website to provide a more personalized shopping experience with more features and services for our customers.  The new website also provides enhanced capability to engage customers on mobile devices, improved access to product information and the ability to better connect with the brand on social media.
 Profitably Expand Our Store Base. Based on our proven new store economics, we believe that we have the potential to grow our store base by up to 100 stores from our total of 276 stores as of February 3, 2018. We target new locations in lifestyle centers and premium malls, and plan to open 10-12 new stores in fiscal year 2018. 
 Strengthen Omnichannel Capabilities. We are pursuing initiatives to enhance our omnichannel capabilities focused on best serving our customer, wherever and whenever she chooses to shop. We will continue to leverage our insight into customer attributes and behavior, which will guide strategic investments in our business. For example, we plan to implement technology to further fulfill customer demand, including ship from store to customer and order online for pickup in store.

Enhance Product Assortment. We believe there is an opportunity to grow our business by selectively broadening and enhancing our assortment in certain product categories, including our Pure Jill and Wearever sub-brands, our Women’s and Petite’s businesses, and accessories. We also believe we have the opportunity to continue to optimize our assortment architecture and productivity by delivering the right mix and flow of fashion and basics to our channels. In addition, we will continue delivering high quality customer-focused product assortments across each of our channels, while strengthening visual merchandising.  
 Marketing and Advertising 
 We leverage a variety of marketing and advertising vehicles to increase brand awareness, acquire new customers, drive customer traffic across our channels, and strengthen and reinforce our brand image. These include our 24 annual catalog editions, promotional mailings, email communications, digital and print advertisements and public relations initiatives. We leverage our customer database to strategically optimize the value of our marketing investments across customer segments and channels. This enables us to productively acquire new customers, effectively market to existing customers, increase customer retention levels and reactivate lapsed customers. 
 Our catalogs, combined with an increased investment in online marketing, drive customer acquisition and engagement. We reinforce a consistent brand message by coordinating the release of our monthly collection across our retail stores, website and catalogs, allowing our customers to experience a uniform brand message wherever and whenever she chooses to shop. We also engage in a wide range of other marketing and advertising strategies to promote our brand, including media coverage in specialty publications and magazines. 
 We offer a private label credit card program through an agreement with Comenity Capital Bank (“ADS”), under which they own the credit card receivables. All credit card holders receive invitations to exclusive customer events and promotions including special purchase events three times per year, a special offer for her birthday, and a 5% discount when purchases are made on the card. We promote the benefits of the credit card throughout our retail stores, our website and our catalogs through banner ads, signage and customer service and selling associate representatives. Additionally, we leverage regional print advertising to promote the card and its benefits to new and existing customers. We believe that our credit card program encourages customer loyalty, repeat visits and additional spending. In fiscal year 2017, 55% of our gross sales were generated by our credit card holders. 
 Sourcing and Supply Strategy 
 We outsource the manufacturing of our products. In order to efficiently source our products, we work primarily with agents who represent suppliers and factories. In fiscal year 2017 approximately 82% of our products were sourced through agents and 18% were sourced directly from suppliers and factories. We currently work with three primary agents that help us identify quality suppliers and coordinate our manufacturing requirements. Additionally, the agents manage the development of samples of merchandise produced in the factories, inspect finished merchandise, ensure the timely delivery of goods and carry out other administrative and oversight functions on our behalf. We source the remainder of our products by interacting directly with suppliers and factories both domestically and abroad.
 Agents work with approximately 25 suppliers on our behalf. We source our merchandise globally from six countries with the top three by volume including China, India and the Philippines. No single supplier accounts for more than 20% of merchandise purchased. 
 We have no long-term merchandise supply contracts as we typically transact business on an order-by-order basis to maintain flexibility. We believe our strong relationships with suppliers have provided us with the ability to negotiate favorable pricing terms, further improving our overall cost structure and profitability. Our dedicated sourcing team actively negotiates and manages product costs to deliver initial mark-up objectives. The team further focuses on quality control to ensure that merchandise meets required technical specifications and inspects the merchandise to ensure it meets our strict standards, including regular in-line inspections while goods are in production. Upon receipt, merchandise is further inspected on a test basis for consistency in cut, size and color, as well as for conformity with specifications and overall quality of manufacturing. Our sourcing team ensures that the customer has a consistent product and satisfying brand experience regardless of product size, color or collection.

Omnichannel Distribution and Customer Contact Center 
 We lease our 520,000 square foot state-of-the-art distribution and customer contact center in Tilton, New Hampshire. The facility manages the receipt, storage, sorting, packing and distribution of merchandise for our retail and direct channels. Retail stores are replenished at least twice a week from this facility and shipped by third-party delivery services, providing our retail stores with a steady flow of new inventory that helps to maintain product freshness. Our distribution system is designed to operate in a highly-efficient and cost-effective manner, including our ability to profitably support individual direct orders which we believe differentiates ourselves from our competitors. In fiscal year 2017, the distribution center handled 37 million units, split between 18 million retail (49%) and 19 million direct (51%), and we believe this facility is sufficient to support our future growth. 
 The customer contact center is an extension of our brand, providing a consistent customer experience at every stage of a purchase across all of our channels. In fiscal year 2017, we managed approximately 4.4 million customer interactions through our in-house customer contact center in Tilton, New Hampshire. Our customer contact center is responsible for nearly all live customer interactions, other than in retail stores, including order taking and further serves as an important feedback loop in gathering customer responses to our brand, product and service. We continue to refine and improve our contact center strategy and experience to support the constantly evolving digital landscape. 
 Information Systems 
 We use information systems to support business intelligence and processes across our sales channels. We continue to invest in information systems and technology to enhance the customer experience and create operating efficiencies. We utilize third-party providers for customer database and customer campaign management, ensuring efficient maintenance of information in a secure, backed-up environment. In fiscal 2017, we migrated our website to a new platform and are undertaking initiatives to improve the customers’ shopping experience and engagement. We also implemented a new merchandise financial planning system that provides timely views of inventory ownership and adds pre-season and in-season inventory management capabilities. 
Seasonality 
 While the retail business is generally seasonal in nature, we have historically not experienced significant seasonal fluctuations in our sales. Our merchandise offering drives consistent sales across seasons with no quarter contributing more than 27% of total annual net sales in fiscal year 2017. 
Competition 
 The women’s apparel industry is highly competitive. We compete with local, national and international retail chains and department stores, specialty and discount stores, catalogs and internet businesses offering similar categories of merchandise. We compete primarily on the basis of design, service, quality and value. We believe our distinct combination of design, service, quality and value allows us to compete effectively and we believe we differentiate ourselves from competitors based on the strength of our brand, our omnichannel platform, our strong data capabilities, our loyal customer base, our customer-focused product assortment and our highly experienced leadership team. Our competitors range from smaller, growing companies to considerably larger companies with substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources. 
Employees 
 As of February 3, 2018, we employed 1,501 full-time and 2,254 part-time employees. Of these employees, 386 are employed in our headquarters in Quincy, Massachusetts, 2,884 are employed in our retail stores and 485 work in our distribution and customer contact center and administrative office in Tilton, New Hampshire. The number of employees, particularly part-time employees, fluctuates depending upon seasonal needs. 
 Our employees are not represented by a labor union and are not party to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
