ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
 
We are a leader in the development and sale of innovative, broadly enabling, high pressure-based platform technologies and related consumables for the worldwide life sciences, agriculture, food and beverage, and other key industries. Our solutions are based on the unique properties of both constant (i.e., static) and alternating (i.e., pressure cycling technology, or “PCT”) hydrostatic pressure. PCT is a patented enabling technology platform that uses alternating cycles of hydrostatic pressure between ambient and ultra-high levels to safely and reproducibly control bio-molecular interactions (e.g., cell lysis, biomolecule extraction). Historically, our primary focus has been in the development of PCT-based products for biomarker and target discovery, drug design and development, biotherapeutics characterization and quality control, soil & plant biology, forensics, and counter-bioterror applications. In more recent years, major new market opportunities have emerged in the use of our pressure-based technologies in the following areas: (1) the use of our recently acquired, patented technology from BaroFold, Inc. (the “BaroFold” technology platform) to allow entry into the bio-pharma contract services sector, and (2) the use of our recently-patented, scalable, high-efficiency, pressure-based Ultra Shear Technology (“UST”) platform to (i) create stable nanoemulsions of otherwise immiscible fluids (e.g., oils and water) and to (ii) prepare higher quality, homogenized, extended shelf-life or room temperature stable low-acid liquid foods that cannot be acceptably preserved using existing non-thermal technologies.


On February 8, 2021, PBI announced plans to acquire the assets of a global eco-friendly agrochemical supplier. This opportunity is attractive as it has the potential of readily producing significant revenue, as well as the potential to apply the UST technology to improve some of the product line. In July 2021, a newly-formed subsidiary of PBI, PBI Agrochem, leased a warehouse in Sparks, NV, and hired a warehouse manager. See the further description of this possible transaction in Item 1 – Business – “The PBI Agrochem Platform.”

The PCT Platform
 
a. Description
 
The instruments, consumables and software used to perform PCT (the “PCT Platform”) use alternating cycles of hydrostatic pressure between ambient and ultra-high levels to safely and reproducibly control bio-molecular interactions (e.g., critical steps performed by hundreds of thousands of scientists worldwide, such as cell lysis and biomolecule extraction). Our primary focus is in making our recently released, GMP-compliant, next generation PCT-based Barocycler 2320 EXT instrument available globally to biopharmaceutical drug manufacturers to accelerate biologics development by streamlining workflows for the design, development, characterization and quality control of biotherapeutic drugs. The PCT Platform is also used in such areas as biomarker and target discovery, soil & plant biology, anti-bioterror, and forensics. We currently have hundreds of PCT instrument systems placed in approximately 200 academic, government, pharmaceutical, and biotech research laboratories worldwide. There are over 120 independent, peer-reviewed publications highlighting the advantages of using the PCT Platform in scientific research studies, many from key opinion leaders worldwide. The PCT Platform is offered through the Company’s Research Products & Services Group.
 
We are focused on solving the challenging problems inherent in biological sample preparation, a crucial laboratory step performed by scientists worldwide working in biological life sciences research. Sample preparation is a term that refers to a wide range of activities that precede most forms of scientific analysis. Sample preparation is often complex, time-consuming and, in our belief, one of the most error-prone steps of scientific research. It is a widely-used laboratory undertaking – the requirements of which drive what we believe is a large and growing worldwide market. We have developed and patented a novel, enabling technology platform that offers revolutionary speed and reproducible control in the sample preparation process. It is based on harnessing the unique properties of high hydrostatic pressure. This process, which we refer to as Pressure Cycling Technology, or PCT, uses alternating cycles of hydrostatic pressure between ambient and ultra-high levels i.e., 20,000 psi or greater to safely, conveniently and reproducibly control the actions of molecules in biological samples, such as cells and tissues from human, animal, plant and microbial sources.
 
PCT is an enabling platform technology based on a physical process that had not previously been used to control bio-molecular interactions. PCT uses unique instrumentation that is capable of cycling pressure between ambient and ultra-high levels at controlled temperatures and specific time intervals, to rapidly and repeatedly control the interactions of bio-molecules, such as proteins, DNA, RNA, lipids and small molecules. Our laboratory instrument family, the Barocycler, and our proprietary consumables product line, which include our unique MicroTubes, MicroCaps, MicroPestles, and PULSE (Pressure Used to Lyse Samples for Extraction) Tubes, and application specific kits (containing consumable products and reagents), together make up our PCT Sample Preparation System (the “PCT SPS”).
 
In 2015, together with an investment bank, we formed a subsidiary called Pressure BioSciences Europe (“PBI Europe”) in Poland. We have 49% non-controlling ownership interest with the investment bank retaining 51%. As a result of subsequent changes in the Polish government, initial plans for PBI Europe have not been pursued. Throughout 2021, PBI Europe did not have any operating activities and we cannot reasonably predict when operations will commence.
 
Sample preparation is widely regarded as a significant impediment to research and discovery and sample extraction is generally regarded as one of the key parts of sample preparation. The process of preparing samples for genomic, proteomic, lipidomic, and small molecule studies includes a crucial step called sample extraction or sample disruption. This is the process of extracting biomolecules such as nucleic acid i.e., DNA and/or RNA, as well as proteins, lipids, or small molecules from the plant or animal cells and tissues that are being studied. The majority of our current sales and marketing efforts are based upon our belief that pressure cycling technology provides a superior solution for sample extraction when compared to other available technologies or procedures, and thus might significantly improve the quality and efficiency of sample preparation and subsequent test result.
 
Within the broad field of biological sample preparation, we focus the majority of our PCT and constant pressure (“CP”) product development efforts in three specific areas: biomarker discovery, precision medicine and forensics. We believe that our existing PCT and CP-based instrumentation and related consumable products fill an important and growing need in the sample preparation market for the safe, rapid, versatile, reproducible and more complete extraction of nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and small molecules from a wide variety of plant, animal, and microbiological cells and tissues.
 
Biomarker Discovery and Precision Medicine
 
The most commonly used technique worldwide for the preservation of cancer and other tissues for long-term storage and subsequent pathology evaluation is to process them into formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (“FFPE”) samples. We believe that the quality and analysis of FFPE tissues is highly problematic, and that PCT offers significant advantages over current processing methods, including standardization, speed, biomolecule recovery, and safety.
 
Our customers include researchers at academic laboratories, government agencies, biotechnology companies, pharmaceutical companies and other life science institutions in the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia/Pacific. Our goal is to continue aggressive market penetration in these target areas. We also believe that there is a significant opportunity to sell and/or lease additional Barocycler instrumentation to additional laboratories at current customer institutions.
 
If we are successful in commercializing PCT in applications beyond our current focus area of genomic, proteomic, lipidomic, and small molecule sample preparation, and if we are successful in our attempts to attract additional capital, our potential customer base could expand to include hospitals, reference laboratories, pharmaceutical manufacturing plants and other sites involved in each specific application. If we are successful in forensics, our potential customers could be forensic laboratories, military and other government agencies. If we are successful in biomarker discovery and precision medicine - specifically the extraction of biomolecules from FFPE tissues, our potential customers could be pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, and laboratories focused on drug discovery or differentiation of disease states, subtypes and susceptibility to alternative treatments.
 
Forensics
 
The detection of DNA has become a part of the analysis of forensic samples by laboratories and criminal justice agencies worldwide in their efforts to identify the perpetrators of violent crimes and missing persons. Scientists from the University of North Texas and Florida International University have reported improvements in DNA yield from forensic samples (e.g., bone and hair) when using the PCT platform in the sample preparation process. We believe that PCT may be capable of differentially extracting DNA from sperm cells and female epithelial cells captured in swabs collected from rape victims and subsequently stored in rape kits. We also believe that there are many completed rape kits that remain untested for reasons such as cost, time and quality of results. We further believe that the ability to differentially extract DNA from sperm and not epithelial cells could reduce the cost of such testing, while increasing the quality, safety and speed of the testing process.

b. Market
 
We focus most of our research and development and commercialization efforts on sample preparation and quality control analysis for genomic, proteomic, lipidomic, and small molecule studies. This market is comprised of academic and government research institutions, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and other public and private laboratories that are engaged in studying genomic, proteomic and small molecule material within plant and animal cells and tissues. We elected to initially focus our resources in the market of genomic, proteomic and small molecule sample preparation because we believe it is an area that:
 

● | is a rapidly growing market; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | has a large and immediate need for better technology; 
● | is comprised mostly of research laboratories, which are subject to minimal governmental regulation; 
● | is the least technically challenging application for the development of our products; 
● | is compatible with our technical core competency; and 
● | we currently have strong patent protection. 

 
We believe that our existing PCT and CP-based instrumentation and related consumable products fill an important and growing need in the sample preparation market for the safe, rapid, versatile, reproducible and more complete extraction of nucleic acids, proteins and small molecules from a wide variety of plant and animal cells and tissues.
 
Biomarker Discovery - Mass Spectrometry
 
A biomarker is any substance (e.g., protein, DNA) that can be used as an indicator of the presence or absence of a particular disease-state or condition, and/or to predict or measure the progression and effects of therapy. Biomarkers can help in the diagnosis, prognosis, therapy selection and monitoring, prevention, surveillance, control, and cure of diseases and medical conditions.
 
A mass spectrometer is a laboratory instrument used in the analysis of biological samples, often focused on proteins, in life sciences research. It is frequently used to help discover biomarkers. According to the November 2017 published market report by Markets and Markets “Mass Spectrometry Market by Application (Pharmaceuticals, Biotechnology, Environmental testing), Platform (Single mass spectrometry (Quadrupole, TOF & Ion Trap), Hybrid mass spectrometry (Triple Quadrupole, QTOF & FTMS)) – Global Forecast to 2022, the global mass spectrometry market is expected to grow from USD 3.44 billion in 2016 to USD 5.27 billion by 2022, at a CAGR of 7.4% from 2015 to 2020. We believe PCT and CP-based products offer significant advantages in speed and quality compared with current techniques used in the preparation of samples for mass spectrometry analysis.
 
Biomarker Discovery – Precision Medicine
 
Precision medicine is an approach to patient care that allows doctors to select treatments that are most likely to help patients based on a specific biomolecular understanding of their disease. The hope of precision medicine is that treatments will one day be tailored to the unique biomolecular variations specific to each person’s disease.
 
A significant roadblock in obtaining necessary information to advance precision medicine – specifically in proteogenomics, is sample preparation and the time required using conventional methods. We believe our PCT workflows address this roadblock by providing a rapid, reproducible means of extracting biomarkers from patient samples in a clinically relevant timeframe of 2 hours.
 
Biomarker Discovery – Cancer and Tumor Microenvironment
 
The most commonly used technique worldwide for the preservation of cancer and other tissues for subsequent pathology evaluation is formalin-fixation followed by paraffin-embedding, or FFPE. We believe that the quality and analysis of FFPE tissues is highly problematic, and that PCT offers significant advantages over current processing methods, including standardization, speed, biomolecule recovery, and safety.
Biopharmaceutical Quality Control
 
A critical step in biopharmaceutical manufacturing processes is quality control, involving characterization of the resulting biotherapeutics via peptide mapping and analysis of post-translational modifications. Peptide mapping can be used in drug discovery and throughout the manufacturing process for quality control between batches to produce a unique ‘fingerprint’ of an individual protein and to compare this with the theoretical gene-derived amino acid sequence. Using conventional methods this process can take overnight or more. We believe our PCT workflows offer a significant advantage to this process by offering a significant reduction in time and improvement in reproducibility with a GMP compliant platform. Many protein-based pharmaceuticals undergo specific enzymatic and chemical modifications (such as glycosylation, when specific carbohydrate moieties, glycans, are attached to the protein core, thus helping them remain active longer in the patient’s bloodstream). Similar to peptide mapping, analysis of glycans, also critical quality attributes of biologic drugs, requires tedious sample preparation steps that can be significantly accelerated and rendered more reproducible by PCT workflows.

Our customers include researchers at academic laboratories, government agencies, biotechnology companies, pharmaceutical companies and other life science institutions in the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia/Pacific. Our goal is to continue aggressive market penetration in these target areas. We also believe that there is a significant opportunity to sell and/or lease additional Barocycler instrumentation to additional laboratories within current customer organizations.


Sample Extraction Process
 
The process of preparing samples for genomic, proteomic and small molecule studies includes a crucial step called sample extraction or sample disruption. This is the process of extracting nucleic acid i.e., DNA and/or RNA, proteins or small molecules from the plant or animal cells and tissues that are being studied. Sample preparation is widely regarded as a significant impediment to research and discovery and sample extraction is generally regarded as one of the key parts of sample preparation. Our current commercialization efforts are based upon our belief that pressure cycling technology provides a superior solution to sample extraction compared with other available technologies or procedures and can thus significantly improve the quality of sample preparation, and thus the quality of the test result.
 
c. Products
 
We believe our PCT and CP products allow researchers to improve scientific research studies in the life sciences field. Our products are developed with the expectation of meeting or exceeding the needs of research scientists while enhancing the safety, speed and quality that is available to them with existing sample preparation methods.
 
Barocycler Instrumentation
 
Our Barocycler product line consists of laboratory instrumentation that subjects a sample to cycles of pressure from ambient (approximately 14.5 psi) to ultra-high levels (20,000 psi or greater) and then back to ambient, in a precisely controlled manner.
 
Our instruments (the Barocycler 2320EXT, the HUB440 and the HUB880) use cycles of high, hydrostatic pressure to quickly and efficiently break up the cellular structures of a specimen to release proteins, nucleic acids, lipids and small molecules from the specimen into our consumable processing tubes, referred to as our PULSE Tubes and MicroTubes. Our instruments have temperature control options (on-board heating via internal heating jacket or heating and chilling via an external circulating water-bath), automatic fill and dispensing valves, and an integrated touchscreen for interfacing with an onboard micro-processor or computer. The microprocessor, computer or laptop computer are capable of saving specific PCT protocols, so the researcher can achieve maximum reproducibility for the preparation of nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, or small molecules from various biological samples. Our Barocycler instruments, consumable products and application specific kits make up our PCT Sample Preparation System.
 
Barocycler 2320EXTREME - The Barocycler 2320EXT is the flagship of the Company’s Barocycler line of PCT-based instruments. It weighs approximately 80lbs, delivers a maximum pressure of 45,000 psi, and can process either up to 16 MicroTubes simultaneously or one PULSE Tube. The working temperature range is 4 – 95ºC and is controlled via an on-board electric heating jacket or external circulating water bath. All tests are entered and recorded on a touch screen interface. Information from each test run (pressure profile, cycle number, and temperature) is recorded and can be stored on the instrument, on a USB drive, or networked into the user’s lab computer system. Pressure profiles can be manipulated in a number of ways, including static high pressure holds and pressure ramp programs. The Barocycler 2320EXT is pneumatic and requires an input air source of only 100psi to achieve and cycle at high pressure.
 
The Barocycler 2320EXT was developed to support the PCT-HD/PCT-SWATH application. PCT-HD enables faster, less cumbersome and higher quality processing of biopsy tissues. With homogenization, extraction, and digestion of proteins occurring in a single PCT MicroTube under high pressure, this protocol can yield analytical results in under four hours from the start of tissue processing. PCT-HD was developed by our scientists and engineers in collaboration with Professor Ruedi Aebersold and Dr. Tiannan Guo of the Institute of Molecular Systems Biology, ETH Zurich, and the University of Zurich, both in Zurich, Switzerland. Drs. Aebersold and Guo combined PCT-HD with SCIEX’s SWATH-Mass Spectrometry – calling the resulting method “PCT-SWATH”.

Barocycler HUB440 –We believe the Barocycler HUB440 is the first portable, ready to use, “plug-and-play” high pressure generator for the laboratory bench. The Barocycler HUB440 is capable of creating and controlling hydrostatic pressure from 500 psi to 58,000 psi and is designed for easy and flexible interfacing with a wide variety of user-specified pressure vessels. It is computer controlled and runs on software that was developed by us to allow data logging and sophisticated algorithms for controlling pressure and temperature. We own the rights and have a license to use the specialty LabVIEW software. We believe that over the coming years, the Barocycler HUB440 may become one of the main products in our pressure-based instrument line.
 
Barocycler HUB880 - The Barocycler HUB880 is a compact, portable, bench-top, ultra-high pressure generator with vessel interface flexibility similar to the HUB440, that uses an air pressure-to-liquid pressure intensifier allowing the user to generate fluid pressure as high as 90,000 psi with input air pressure of just 126 psi. The HUB880 can be operated through a simple front panel or controlled using an optional external Data Acquisition and Control Module for dynamic pressure control. We believe that the HUB880 will be well accepted by scientists that need to achieve super high pressure, such as those working in the life science research, food safety and vaccine industries.
 
The Shredder SG3 –The Shredder SG3 is a low shear mechanical homogenization system for use with tough, fibrous and other difficult-to-disrupt tissues and organisms. The Shredder SG3 System uses a variety of Shredder PULSE Tubes to directly and rapidly grind a biological sample which, when combined with selected buffers, can provide effective extraction of proteins, DNA, RNA, lipids and small molecules from tissues and organisms. The Shredder SG3 is also used to isolate intact and functional mitochondria from tissues. The Shredder SG3 features a three-position force setting lever, which enables the operator to select and apply reproducible force to the sample during the shredding process and eliminates the need for the operator to exert force for long periods when processing one or more samples.
 
Barocycler Consumable Products
 
PCT MicroTubes – PCT MicroTubes are made from a unique fluoropolymer, fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP). FEP is highly inert and retains its integrity within an extremely wide temperature range (-200°C to 100°C), while providing important limited flexibility behavior for PCT applications. MicroTubes hold a maximum total volume of 150 microliters. PCT MicroTubes must be used with either PCT-MicroCaps or PCT-MicroPestles.
 
PCT-MicroCaps – PCT MicroCaps are made from polytetraflouroethylene (PTFE). The PCT MicroCaps are available in three sizes to accommodate total sample volume: 50, 100 and 150uL. 50uL MicroCaps are used with samples ≤50uL, 100uL MicroCaps are used with samples between 50-100uL, and 150uL MicroCaps are used with samples between 100-150uL.
 
PCT-Micro Pestle - PCT μPestles are made from polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), a synthetic fluoropolymer of tetrafluoroethylene, also known as Teflon (by DuPont Co). PTFE is practically inert; the only chemicals known to affect it are certain alkali metals and most highly reactive fluorinating agents. PCT μPestles, in conjunction with PCT MicroTubes, are designed to enhance the extraction of proteins, lipids, DNA, RNA and small molecules from minute amounts (0.5 – 3.0 mg) of solid tissue in extraction reagent volumes as low as 20-30 μL. PCT MicroTubes and PCT μPestles use PCT to effectively disrupt soft tissues and lyse their cells. As a result, the tissue sample trapped between the MicroTube walls and the μPestles shaft is crushed on every pressure cycle. This mechanical action, combined with the extraction ability of the buffer under high pressure, results in highly effective tissue homogenization and extraction.
 
PCT μPestles and PCT MicroTubes, together with a PBI Barocycler, comprise the PCT Micro-Pestle System, which provides a fast, safe, and efficient means of extraction from extremely small amounts of solid samples such as soft tissue biopsies. The PCT μPestle System can be used in any PBI Barocycler.
 
We believe our development of these various consumable products has helped, and will continue to help, drive the adoption of PCT within the life sciences market.
 
d. Customers
 
Our customers include researchers at academic laboratories, government agencies, biotechnology companies, pharmaceutical firms, and other life science institutions throughout the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia/Pacific. Our goal is to continue aggressive market penetration to target groups in these geographical areas. We also believe that there is a significant opportunity to sell and/or lease additional Barocycler instrumentation to additional laboratories within current customer organizations.
 
If we are successful in commercializing PCT in applications beyond our current focus area of genomic, proteomic, lipidomic, and small molecule sample preparation, and if we are successful in our attempts to attract additional capital, our potential customer base could expand to include:
 

● | Hospitals 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Reference laboratories 
● | Government laboratories (e.g., FDA, USDA, NIH, FBI, and police) 
● | Pharmaceutical/biotech/diagnostic companies 
● | Laboratories focused on drug discovery, cancer research, and precision medicine

e. Competition
 
We compete with companies that have existing technologies for the extraction of nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and small molecules from cells and tissues, including methods such as mortar and pestle grinding, sonication, rotor-stator homogenization, French Press, bead beating, freezer milling, enzymatic digestion, and chemical dissolution. We believe that there are a number of significant issues related to the use of these methods, including: complexity, sample containment, cross-contamination, shearing of biomolecules of interest, limited applicability to different sample types, ease-of-use, reproducibility, and cost. We believe that our PCT Sample Preparation System offers a number of significant advantages over these methods, including:
 

● | labor reduction | ● | versatility
--+-------------------------+---+------------
● | temperature control | ● | efficiency 
● | precision | ● | simplicity 
● | reproducibility | ● | safety 

 
To be competitive in the industry, we believe we must be able to clearly and conclusively demonstrate to potential customers that our products provide these improved performance capabilities. We strongly believe that our PCT Sample Preparation System is a novel and enabling system for genomic, proteomic, and small molecule sample preparation. As such, many users of current manual techniques will need to be willing to challenge their existing methods of sample preparation and invest time to evaluate a method that could change their overall workflow in the sample preparation process, prior to adopting our technology.
 
Further, we are aware that the cost of the PCT Sample Preparation System may be greater than the cost of many of the other methods currently employed. Consequently, we are focusing our sales efforts on those product attributes that we believe will be most important and appealing to potential customers; namely versatility, reproducibility, quality, and safety.
 
f. Manufacturing and Supply
 
We currently manufacture and assemble the Barocycler 2320EXT, Barocycler HUB440, HUB880, the SHREDDER SG3, and most of our consumables at our South Easton, MA facility. We will regularly reassess the tradeoffs between in-house assembly versus the benefits of outsourced relationships for of the entire Barocycler product line, and future instruments.
 
We utilize a few contract manufacturers of certain parts for our Barocycler product line. They provide us with precision manufacturing services to meet our specific application and operational requirements. 
 
At this time, we believe that this approach is the most cost-effective method for us to obtain ISO Certified, CE and CSA Marked instruments.

g. Research and Development
 
Our research and development activities are split into two functional areas: Applications Development and Engineering.
 

1. | Applications Development R&D: Our highly educated and trained staff has years of experience in molecular and cellular biology, virology, and proteomics. Our team of scientists focuses on the development and continued improvement of the PCT Sample Preparation System and on PCT-dependent genomic, proteomic, lipidomic, and small molecule sample preparation applications. Dr. Alexander Lazarev, our Chief Science Officer, meets regularly with our sales, marketing, and engineering staff to discuss market needs and trends. Our applications research and development team is responsible for the technical review of all scientific collaborations, for the support of our marketing and sales departments through the generation of internal data in a number of areas of market interest, and in the development of commercially-viable PCT-dependent products. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Engineering R&D: Our engineering research and development team is focused on the design and development of new and improved instrumentation and consumable products to support the commercialization of PCT. Our engineering department is led by Dr. Edmund Ting, our Senior Vice President of Engineering. The primary focus of our engineering group is to develop and continually improve our line of PCT-based instruments and consumables, ensure seamless production processes, help perform installations and field service, and work with our application scientists to enhance our PCT-based systems for the mass spectrometry and other markets. 

Collaboration Program
 
Our Collaboration Program is an important element of our business strategy. Initiating a collaboration with a researcher involves the installation of a Barocycler instrument for an agreed upon period of time of approximately three to twelve months, a financial commitment that is beneficial to both the collaborator and PBI, and the execution of an agreed upon work plan. Our primary objectives for entering into a collaboration agreement include:

● | the development of a new application for PCT and CP in sample preparation; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the advancement and validation of our understanding of PCT and CP within an area of life sciences in which we already offer products; 
● | the demonstration of the effectiveness of PCT and CP by specific research scientists, particularly Key Opinion Leaders (“KOLs”), who we believe can have a positive impact on market acceptance of PCT; and 
● | the expectation of peer-reviewed publications and/or presentations at scientific meetings by a third party, especially a KOL, on the merits of PCT and CP. 

 
Since we initiated our collaboration program, third party researchers have cited the use of our PCT platform in nearly 200 peer-reviewed publications and dozens of scientific presentations. We believe that this program has provided and continues to provide us with independent and objective data about PCT from well-respected laboratories in the United States and throughout the rest of the world. We believe this program has been responsible for the sale of multiple Barocycler instruments over the past few years and will continue to help to increase the sales of instrument systems in the future.

Other Fields of Use and Applications for PCT
 
Our research and development efforts have shown that, in addition to genomic, proteomic, lipidomic, and small molecule sample preparation, PCT is potentially beneficial in a number of other areas of the life sciences, including pathogen inactivation, protein purification, control of chemical (particularly enzymatic) reactions, and immunodiagnostics. Other applications in the sample preparation market include forensics and histology, as discussed above. Our pursuit of these markets, however, depends on a number of factors, including our success in commercializing PCT in the area of sample preparation, our judgment regarding the investment required to be successful in these areas, the value of these markets to PBI, and the availability of sufficient financial resources. Below is a brief explanation of each of these additional potential applications and a short description of why we believe PCT can be used to improve scientific studies in these areas.
 
Protein Purification
 
Many vaccines and drugs are comprised of proteins. These proteins need to be purified from complex mixtures as part of the manufacturing process. Current purification techniques often result in the loss of a significant amount of the protein. Therefore, any method that could increase the amount of protein being recovered in the purification step, could subsequently lead to a reduction in cost to the manufacturer. We believe we have successfully generated proof-of-concept that PCT can satisfy this need. We believe that compared with current purification procedures, a process that uses PCT has the potential to increase protein recovery, increase the quality of the product, and lower production costs. We have been issued U.S. patents in this area.
Pathogen Inactivation
 
Biological products intended for human use, such as blood, vaccines and drugs, are put through rigorous processing protocols in an effort to minimize the potential of that product to transmit disease. These protocols may include methods to remove infectious materials such as pre-processing testing, filtration or chromatography, or methods to inactivate infectious agents that are not captured in the removal steps such as pasteurization, irradiation and solvent detergent inactivation. Notwithstanding current diligence in both the removal and inactivation steps, significant concern remains that some pathogens (e.g., bacteria, viruses, spores) capable of transmitting infection to recipients may not be removed or inactivated with current procedures. In addition, some removal and inactivation methods may not be useful because of cost, safety, ease-of-use or other practical concerns. To that end, we believe that a superior inactivation method is needed that can safely, rapidly and inexpensively inactivate pathogens in blood, vaccines and drugs without the need for chemical or other potentially toxic additives. We have successfully generated proof-of-concept that PCT can satisfy this need. We believe that compared with current procedures, a process that uses PCT has the potential to increase safety and yield, lower cost and decrease the potential side effects of current methods. We have been issued U.S. patents for this PCT-dependent inactivation technology.
Control of Chemical (Particularly Enzymatic) Reactions
 
Chemical reactions encompass many important interactions in nature. Methods used to control chemical reactions could have a positive effect on the quality, speed, and overall result of the reaction. The control and detection of chemical reactions is particularly useful in the biotechnology field for synthesizing and characterizing such molecules as nucleic acids and polypeptides. We believe that PCT offers distinct advantages in controlling chemical reactions over current methods, since PCT can provide precise, automated control over the timing and synchronization of chemical reactions, particularly enzymatic reactions. We have been issued U.S patents in this area.

Immunodiagnostics
 
Many tests used in the clinical laboratory today are based on the formation of a complex between two proteins, such as an antigen and an antibody. Such “immunodiagnostic” methods are used for the detection of infectious agents such as the human immunodeficiency virus (“HIV”), hepatitis viruses, West Nile virus, and others, as well as for endocrine, drug testing and cancer diagnostics. We have generated proof-of-concept that PCT may be used to control biomolecular interactions between proteins, such as antigens and antibodies. We believe this capability may provide a greater degree of sensitivity and quantitative accuracy in immunodiagnostic testing than that offered by methods that are available today. We have been issued U.S. patents in this area.
Extended Service Contracts
 
We offer extended service contracts on our laboratory instrumentation to all of our customers. These service contracts allow a customer who purchases a Barocycler instrument to receive on-site scheduled preventative maintenance, on-site repair and replacement of all worn or defective component parts, and telephone support, all at no incremental cost for the life of the service contract. We offer one-year and four-year extended service contracts to customers who purchase Barocycler instruments.
The BaroFold Platform
 
a. Description
 
The need for the efficient production of recombinant protein biopharmaceuticals has grown rapidly and demand for them will continue to grow as a result of their high specificity and efficacy. Protein drugs are being manufactured in a variety of host organisms. With the rapid growth in biosimilars (less expensive versions of popular biopharmaceuticals that are manufactured and marketed after the expiration of the original patents), expression in bacteria is beginning to play a major role in this industry, particularly when the biological activity of the protein product is not dependent on post-translational modifications. Overexpression of proteins in bacteria often results in the accumulation of the protein product in inactive insoluble deposits inside the cells, called inclusion bodies. Inclusion bodies protect the protein of interest from degradation and present a simple and convenient ways to extract and purify it. Moreover, if the protein of interest is toxic or lethal to the host cell, then inclusion body expression may be the only available production method. However, the challenge of protein production in bacterial systems most often lies in conversion of inactive and misfolded proteins in the inclusion bodies into soluble, properly folded bioactive products. This conversion process is called protein refolding. Traditional methods of protein refolding rely on using high concentrations of chemical denaturants and detergents to unfold misshapen proteins, disentangle inactive aggregated proteins and to dissolve them, followed by up to 100-fold dilution or dialysis to remove interfering chemicals and then letting the proteins refold into their desired active forms. Since chemically-driven unfolding is harsh, it tends to destroy most protein structure, some of which could be beneficial for subsequent refolding. Moreover, dilution- or dialysis-based methods take a long time and produce very low yields of refolded protein, while most of the unfolded protein material tends to get lost into irreversible aggregation. Overall, traditional refolding methods are usually inefficient, include multiple costly steps and have very low recovery yields. Pressure-mediated disaggregation and unfolding and refolding of proteins offers an attractive pathway for achieving much higher yields of correctly folded proteins with desired efficaciousness, produced at much lower cost, versus traditional chemically driven methodologies.
 
Acquisition of BaroFold’s PreEMT™ high-pressure protein refolding technology in December 2017
 
Our acquisition of the assets of BaroFold, Inc. have significantly increased PBI’s intellectual property portfolio in high-pressure technologies with the addition of eight issued and several pending patents. These patents give PBI the ability to operate in several important areas for biologics research and manufacturing: protein folding, re-folding and disaggregation. The patents also provide PBI the right to grant licenses to third parties to practice the BaroFold technology in both research laboratories and in biopharmaceutical manufacturing.
 
Biopharmaceutical products are typically large-molecule protein therapeutics produced via complex biological manufacturing processes that can result in undesirable protein misfolding and aggregation outcomes. Misfolded or aggregated proteins typically lack therapeutic activity and can present health risks to patients, requiring robust remediation within pharmaceutical manufacturing processes. The BaroFold technology improves the quality of manufacturing, decreases manufacturing costs (as much as $2-10M/year per commercial biologic drug), and facilitates achievement of proper activity from difficult-to-manufacture proteins.
 
BaroFold technology utilizes high pressure instead of, or in synergy with, chemical denaturants, offering significantly milder conditions for unfolding and disaggregation of proteins in inclusion bodies. As a result, subsequent refolding can be carried out faster, more efficiently, and in much smaller volumes. Pressure-based unfolding of proteins in inclusion bodies tends to only partially unfold the protein and preserve some beneficial structures that could help to guide the refolding process into the desired outcomes. Consequently, higher yields of active protein and faster manufacturing turn-around further lower the cost of biopharmaceutical production. Moreover, lower requirements for harsh chemical reagents in high pressure refolding process result in decrease or elimination of associated hazardous waste generated from chemical removal processes, leading to further cost reduction and protection of the environment.
 
The instruments, consumables and software used to practice the BaroFold technology (the “BaroFold Platform”) can be used to significantly lower the cost, boost production yield, and improve the quality of protein therapeutics. It employs high pressure for the disaggregation and controlled refolding of proteins to their native structures at yields and efficiencies not achievable using existing technologies. The BaroFold Platform has been shown to remove protein aggregates in biotherapeutic drug manufacturing, thereby improving product efficacy and safety for both new-drug entities and biosimilar products. The BaroFold Platform can help companies create novel protein therapeutics, accelerate therapeutic protein development, manufacture follow-on biologics, and significantly optimize life-cycle management of protein therapeutics. It is scalable and practical for standard manufacturing processes. This unique technology platform can help protein-based biopharmaceutical companies create and manufacture high quality, novel protein therapeutics and lower the cost of existing formulations. Research and manufacturing licenses are available.

b. Market
 
The global biopharmaceuticals market was valued at $237 billion in 2018 and is estimated to be valued at $389 billion in 2024, witnessing a CAGR of 8.59%. The market growth is attributed to the growing acceptance for biopharmaceuticals due to their ability to treat previously untreatable or poorly managed diseases, resulting in huge market demand for biopharmaceuticals.
 
We believe that biopharmaceuticals offer several benefits, such as highly effective and potent action, fewer side effects, and the potential to actually cure diseases rather than merely treat the symptoms, which have significantly increased the demand for biopharmaceutical products.
 
The predominant majority of biopharmaceutical products are recombinant proteins. Typical examples of such proteins are vaccines, monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), growth factors (such as Erythropoietin), hormones (such as insulin or HGH), receptor ligands, recombinant enzymes (Caspase, Cathepsin, etc.), blood factors and other therapeutic and research reagent proteins. Recombinant protein production can be done in bacteria or in cell cultures derived from higher organisms. Due to significant time and cost savings, attention to protein production in bacterial hosts has recently spiked, predominantly driven by rapid growth of biosimilars, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and fusion proteins that are lethal to non-bacterial host cells. A major area of challenge in the biopharmaceuticals industry results from suboptimal folding configurations and/or agglomeration of proteins during production and storage, requiring subsequent remediation via unfolding and controlled refolding of these therapeutic proteins into their optimal configurations. Following initial penetration and acceleration through conversion of market share from traditional chemical methods, the growth of the protein refolding business is expected to follow the growth trajectory of the entire biopharmaceutical market.
 
Our BaroFold platform technology has been shown not only to save manufacturing costs and time, but to boost protein yield and minimize protein immunogenicity, resulting in greater efficacy and safety for the patient.
 
Moreover, PBI’s Barocycler line of products can also be utilized in accelerated protein stability testing to guide biopharmaceutical formulation development. PBI has initiated several collaborations, including a co-marketing agreement with RedShift BioAnalytics, Inc., and a research collaboration with the University of Delaware (see the Research and Development section below).
 
c. Products
 
Instruments: Barocycler 2320 EXT - a convenient screening tool for protein refolding optimization
 
Originally developed within the framework of our PCT platform business as a tool for biological sample preparation (as described above), our Barocycler 2320EXT instrument features a “ramp mode” in its control software that makes it ultimately suitable for performing research-scale experiments for protein refolding and disaggregation on a laboratory bench scale. Each protein molecule is biochemically unique and, while pressure is highly efficient in solubilization of practically any misfolded protein contained within inclusion bodies, a unique chemical environment may be required to persuade each unfolded protein molecule to refold into a stable biologically active state. Therefore, development of protein refolding methods requires screening experiments necessary to determine the most optimal composition of the chemical milieu for each protein of interest. The Barocycler 2320EXT is ideally suited for such experiments, providing researchers with abilities to process up to 12 specimens per batch in varying chemical environments. We believe that availability of this affordable screening tool will promote adoption of the high-pressure refolding approach among biopharmaceutical process development teams and academic researchers involved in development of protein biopharmaceuticals. The same instrument is also uniquely suited for studies of thermodynamics of protein aggregation and accelerated protein stability tests.
 
BaroFold Contract Services
 
Our BaroFold contract services can be used to significantly impact and improve the quality of large-molecule protein biotherapeutics. These services employ high pressure manipulations for the disaggregation and unfolding of proteins to their native structural states and then controlled refolding of the proteins to the desired therapeutically active state, at yields and efficiencies not achievable using existing technologies. The BaroFold Platform has been shown to eliminate protein aggregation during biotherapeutic drug manufacturing and storage, thereby improving product yield, efficacy and safety for both new-drug entities and biosimilar products. The BaroFold platform can help companies create novel protein therapeutics, accelerate therapeutic protein development, manufacture follow-on biologics, and enable life-cycle management of protein therapeutics. It is scalable and practical for standard manufacturing processes. This unique technology platform can help protein-based biopharmaceutical companies create and manufacture high quality, novel protein therapeutics and lower the cost of existing formulations. Research and manufacturing licenses are available.

e. Competition
 
Over two decades, BaroFold, Inc. built an intellectual property portfolio centered around the use of hydrostatic pressure for protein refolding and disaggregation. Following BaroFold’s acquisition by PBI in 2017, this portfolio, combined with the PBI patents in adjacent areas, puts PBI in a unique position worldwide to commercialize, practice and license out the right to practice high pressure protein refolding, disaggregation and accelerated stability testing. There is no direct competition to PBI that is using high pressure for these applications. Competing traditional approaches use chemicals for refolding and appear inferior in many aspects, as described above.

f. Manufacturing and Supply
 
Manufacturing of the Barocycler 2320EXT has been covered above, since this instrument shares its utility with applications of PCT technology platform. The PCT MicroTube consumable line is also shared between these two application areas.
 
PBI currently develops GMP-compliant, pilot-scale, high-pressure systems for processing of protein batches up to 10L in volume at pressure up to 60,000 psi.
 
In order to provide access for our customers to manufacturing scale high pressure equipment, PBI is currently in negotiations with several HPP (High Pressure Processing) equipment vendors supplying large pressure systems to food manufacturers. Upon successful feasibility studies conducted by customers themselves, or within the framework of BaroFold Contract Services, PBI will act as a contractor to assist protein refolding customers in scaling up the process and identifying, procuring and validating appropriate large-scale equipment for high pressure protein refolding.
 
g. Research and Development
 
The PBI team has gained access to a significant body of research data through acquisition of the assets of BaroFold, Inc. BaroFold has spent over two decades perfecting high-pressure protein refolding applications and produced many publications and patents (see below). Our team’s experience in high pressure refolding is being used in Contract Service work currently offered by PBI to our biopharmaceutical customers, as described above. As an equipment vendor, PBI has a goal of taking advantage of these R&D instrument assets and turning a benchtop high pressure protein refolding solution into a convenient, popular and easily accessible workflow for thousands of laboratories worldwide. As the knowledge about this method spreads and feasibility of great economic impact of utilizing this approach at a production scale is demonstrated, PBI plans to license high pressure refolding methods to its biopharmaceutical customers.
 
Additionally, several new applications of high pressure in biopharmaceutical development are stemming from a combined BaroFold and PBI intellectual property portfolio. One of these highly promising applications, namely, pressure-assisted accelerated protein stability testing, is currently being developed by PBI’s R&D team in collaboration with the Center for Biomanufacturing Science and Technology of the University of Delaware, headed by Professor Christopher J. Roberts. Many protein biopharmaceuticals must be kept in solution. Any physical factors such as exposure to temperature fluctuations in storage and shipment, mechanical vibration, exposure to light, etc., could promote protein aggregation, if the biotherapeutic protein is stored in a suboptimal chemical environment. Protein aggregates tend to be highly immunogenic, i.e., causing a patient’s immune system to recognize protein drug as a foreign object and destroy it, leading to undesired inflammatory response and counteracting the desired therapeutic effect. Each protein drug may require optimization of its chemical environment (formulations development) to guarantee maximal stability and shelf life. Meanwhile, high pressure is a convenient tool for controlled protein unfolding. Partially unfolded proteins tend to aggregate more rapidly. Brief exposure of the protein drug in a specific formulation to a “pressure shock” can be used to promote aggregation, allowing researchers to screen for best formulations that prevent drug aggregation in a matter of only a few days. Conventional approaches for accelerated stability testing utilize exposure to high temperature. Since thermal effects on proteins are stochastic (i.e., random), there is little chance that every protein molecule will follow the same fate after thermal shock. Pressure exerts its effect on all protein molecules of the same type/conformation in exactly the same manner, making the pressure shock more effective in such studies. Our collaborative research program with Professor Roberts’s team is directed towards development of validated workflows for high pressure accelerated stability testing.
 
The UST Platform
 
a. Description
 
The UST Platform is based on the use of intense shear forces generated from ultra-high pressure (greater than 20,000 psi) discharged through a dynamically-controlled nanometer-scale valve orifice. UST has been shown to turn hydrophobic extracts into stable, effectively water-soluble formulations on a small, laboratory scale. The UST Platform offers the potential to produce stable nanoemulsions of oil-like products in water. Such formulations could potentially have enormous success in many markets, including pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals (such as medically important plant oil extracts like CBD-enriched plant oil soluble in water), cosmetic and personal care products, liquid foods and beverages, agrochemicals, as well as inks, paints, lubricants and other industrial products. We believe that UST has the potential to play a significant role in a number of commercially important areas, including (i) the creation of stable nanoemulsions of otherwise immiscible fluids (e.g., oils and water), and (ii) the preparation of higher quality, homogenized, extended shelf-life or room temperature stable low-acid liquid foods that cannot be effectively preserved using existing non-thermal technologies, e.g., dairy products.
 
UST is an emerging technology that combines intense fluid shear with an instant, short-lived burst of heat achieved by specialized high-pressure equipment that can produce commercially sterile, pumpable, homogeneous fluid products. The UST process can provide energetic cellular disruption that results in the inactivation of bacteria, bacterial spores, viruses, and enzymes. Depending on operating conditions, low nano-scale emulsions (nanoemulsions) of oil and water mixtures can be produced that have been shown to have improved room-temperature shelf stability, and superior sensory profiles (taste, smell, texture and appearance). Of particular importance, oil-based active components delivered in such extreme nano-emulsions in water facilitates greatly improved absorption and bioavailability in the water-based biochemistry of humans, animals and plants, allowing for much lower loading quantities of actives required in manufacture, while ensuring safer and more controlled effective dosing.
 
The Company received its second US patent in 2021 to complement two patents in China on UST, focused on a low cost, scalable approach for product manufacturing. The Company believes this method can find use in various nanoemulsion applications for pharmaceutical (e.g., drug delivery), biotechnology (e.g., protein recovery, biomolecule extraction), agrochemical, cosmetics, and food (e.g., shelf-stable “clean label” products). We plan to design, develop, manufacture, and market UST-based production instruments, services and production to the life sciences and other industries. We initiated the process to build full-scale UST systems initially at two sites, in order to address current customer demands and the belief that a large number of food, cosmetics, nutraceuticals, pharmaceutical, and other companies will follow.  We expect to have a mix of sales of instruments, service contracts, leases and tolling for production.

b. Market
 
In 2019, we focused efforts on developing and demonstrating the UST protocol and seeding early adopters, which would provide insights into market, formulation, product development, and ultimately end product requirements. Our initial market focus has been on cannabis extracts, as this market’s unmet needs for nanoemulsions solutions offer high visibility and ready access to funding, versus many other important target markets, such as Cosmetics, Food and Beverage, Nutraceutical, Pharmaceutical, and Industrial fluids and lubricants. In 2020, we refined the Ultra Shear Technology™ K45 instrument allowing us to run samples for multiple potential customers, which demonstrated the goal of producing room-temperature-stable, transparent nanoemulsions. (Transparency is achieved when nanoemulsion droplet sizes are below ~150nm or smaller than the wavelength of visible light – an important indicator of achievement of extremely low-scale nanoemulsions.) We secured orders from companies for 15 units, which is the target number for our first production run. We also moved forward in the development of the BaroShear Mini: bench-top, laboratory-based instrument for research, formulation, and small volume processing; and the BaroShear Max; high-volume, industrial-scale, clean-in-place (CIP), production instrument. In 2021, we demonstrated that our CBD nanoemulsion was stable for more than 18 months at room temperature or refrigerated conditions, and after repeated freeze/thaw events.  We shipped the first BaroShear Max system to our partners at The Ohio State University.  We also initiated to process of setting up two bi-coastal facilities capable of meeting the development and production needs for several customers.  In 2022, we plan to commence operation of these new capabilities.

f. Manufacturing and Supply
 
PBI’s current strategy is to have the development handled by PBI’s development and engineering team, with manufacturing at a combination of our locations, partnered with selected Contract Manufacturing Organization (CMO), and, ultimately, with the end customers, where appropriate. Aftermarket service and support will initially be handled by PBI’s service and repair staff. As unit placements grow, we will investigate expansion of PBI’s service and support organization or augment it with external partners.

g. Research and Development
 
PBI’s UST engineering team is developing a product portfolio consisting of three model instruments with the following research & formulation, pre-production and production models scheduled for launch as follows:
 
BaroShear K45 mini – bench-top instrument, Q2 2022
 
BaroShear K45 – floor standing model, Q4 2022
 
BaroShear Max – floor standing, fully automated, CIP equipment, prototype delivered to Ohio State University – Q4 2021. Commercial release planned for mid-2022 timeframe.
 
The PBI Agrochem Platform
 
In February 2021, PBI announced a signed Letter of Intent to acquire the assets and senior management of a dormant company with an extensive portfolio of innovative agrochemical products, utilizing natural product oils as active ingredients (similar to the use of orange oil or neem oil for pest control). With the intense and growing focus of consumers and governments on the long term environmental and health challenges presented by many conventional agrochemical products, this new class of “green” essential oil agrochemicals that are considered safe for humans and animals represent a highly attractive and high-growth segment of the agrochemicals market.
 
The ability of PBI to further differentiate the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of these products versus traditional agrochemicals, through the application of UST to obtain all of the benefits of extremely low droplet-size nanoemulsions, offers a compelling growth and profitability acceleration opportunity in the agrochemicals business sector. While PBI is pursuing a lease and license model for the rollout of its UST platform into other business sectors, we elected to test a direct participation model in the agrochemical applications sector.
 
In July 2021, PBI established PBI Agrochem, Inc., a wholly-owned agrochemicals subsidiary, in order to purchase up to $1M of “green” agrochemical products from the targeted acquisition, to allow the management of the dormant agrochemicals company to demonstrate the reestablishment of previous business relationships and sales channels, and to provide access to early agrochemical sales revenues for PBI (prior to closing the asset acquisition transaction). PBI Agrochem leased a warehouse near Sparks, NV and hired a warehouse manager to facilitate the shipping, storage and management of the “green” agrochemicals inventory.
 
The reestablishment of previous business relationships and sales channels proceeded much more slowly during late 2021 than had been forecast by the management of the dormant agrochemicals company. In the 1st Quarter of 2022, PBI Agrochem sales have begun to gain initial traction and are increasing monthly. The management of the dormant agrochemicals company continues to forecast an accelerating reestablishment of its previous customer base and sales, and robust global growth opportunities for its highly desirable “green” agrochemical product solutions. PBI is continuing to evaluate these agrochemical assets and the asset acquisition opportunity.

a. Sales and Marketing
 
Our marketing and sales functions are led by John Hollister, our Director of Sales and Marketing. Mr. Hollister oversees and directs all marketing and sales activities, including trade show attendance and sponsorship, on-line advertising, website maintenance and improvement, search engine optimization, creation and dissemination of newsletters, market research initiatives, the arrangement of on-location seminars, lectures, and demonstrations of instrumentation and consumables capabilities, and the supervision of our sales and marketing personnel. Mr. Schumacher is also responsible for the overall coordination of our collaboration programs, from initial set-up, research plan design, and training, service, and data analysis. Some of these responsibilities are shared with other departments such as Research and Development, but marketing and sales drives the collaborative process. Mr. Schumacher is also responsible for the continued coordination and support of our foreign distribution partners. The Company is in the process of recruiting a field sales person.
 
Our sales and marketing efforts are centered on using the independent data developed and disseminated by our collaboration partners to help drive the installed base of our PCT Sample Preparation System, BaroFold services, and BaroShear UST platform. The development of scientific data by our partners and our internal researchers provides our sales and marketing staff with additional tools that are essential in selling existing and newly developed paradigm-shifting, high-value technologies and services. We believe that partnering with seasoned, capable equipment distribution partners in the cannabis and other laboratory / process markets will drive lead generation and purchase orders faster than if we were to build our own sales force.

b. Marketing Strategy
 
We recognize that our enabling PCT, BaroFold, and UST pressure platforms are powerful, novel platform technologies. We also recognize that the power of pressure in today’s laboratories is not yet widely known and utilized by researchers. Our first goal is to greatly broaden the awareness of pressure and its applications among research scientists and to ensure they know that these technologies exist through our high-pressure instruments, requisite consumables, and unique services. To accomplish this expansion of knowledge about the power of pressure and the subsequent adoption of our pressure-based technology platforms, we have developed and are implementing a multi-faceted approach to marketing our products and services.
Key Opinion Leaders and Publications
 
To initially reach scientists, we have established collaborations with key opinion leaders (KOL) who recognized early the potential for our pressure-based platforms and who went on to report their discoveries in peer reviewed journals. Among the KOLs working with us is Dr. Ruedi Aebersold (Head of the Department of Biology, ETH, Zurich). Dr. Aebersold, a pioneer in proteomics, worked with our scientists and engineers to develop PCT-SWATH (aka PCT-HD), a superior method for the extraction and preparation of proteins from samples intended for analysis by mass spectrometry. Other KOLs include Dr. Jennifer van Eyk (Director of Advanced Clinical Biosystems Institute in the Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cedar Sinai, Los Angeles, CA) and Dr. Wayne Hubble (Jules Stein Professor at the University of California, LA). Dr. van Eyk is a recognized expert in the causes of heart disease and is using PCT in her attempt to discover cardiac disease biomarkers. Dr. Hubble, a member of the National Academy of Sciences, is a leader in the field of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). He uses PCT in his studies of protein-protein interactions, so very important in the discovery of drug targets and drug design. The publications and presentations of these and other world class scientists have been invaluable in gaining initial entry of PCT in several areas of research. In addition to publications by our numerous KOLs, there are also many additional peer reviewed publications from dozens of other scientists discussing the advantages of the PCT platform in bio-molecule sample preparation, as well as the advantages of our BaroFold technology and our UST platform. To this end, we do all we can to disseminate the work of these scientists in an effort to increase the exposure of PCT, BaroFold, and UST to the worldwide research community.

c. Foreign Distribution Network
 
We have previously established distribution arrangements covering China, Poland, South Korea, Japan, and 24 countries in Western Europe.
 
On December 3, 2021, we entered into a two-year distribution agreement with Westlake Omics Biotechnology, Ltd, in Hangzhou, China.  We believe that they are committed and capable of rapidly expanding the market for Barocyclers in China.
 
In February 2016, we entered into a three-year distribution agreement with Bioanalytic of Poland, pursuant to which PBI granted Bioanalytic exclusive distribution rights to all of our PCT products in Poland... In August of 2021, we expanded our relationship with Bioanalytic to reflect an exclusive distribution relationship for all of the EU and non-EU members in Western Europe, in addition to Poland. In August 2021, we signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Bioanalytic on Aug 1 2021 that expires on December 31, 2023.
 
In September of 2016, we entered into a three-year distribution agreement with Vita Co. of Japan, pursuant to which we granted Vita Co. exclusive distribution rights to all of our PCT products in Japan. This agreement expired in 2019. We continue to maintain a distribution relationship with Vita and are in contract renewal discussions.
 
In September of 2016, we entered into a distribution agreement with I&L GmbH of Germany, pursuant to which we granted I&L exclusive distribution rights to all of our products until March 30, 2018 in the countries designated as Western Europe (Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Gibraltar, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Ireland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, Norway, Netherlands, Portugal, San Marino, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom). This agreement expired March 31, 2020. In February of 2021, we were informed that I&L had determined that they were not going to renew their exclusive distributor relationship with PBI.


In January 2020, we entered into a three-year distribution agreement with SCINCO Co., LTD of South Korea, pursuant to which PBI granted SCINCO exclusive distribution rights to all of our PCT products in South Korea.
 
Non-Exclusive and Other Distribution Agreements
 
In November 2011, we entered into a distributor agreement with OROBOROS Instruments Corp. (“OROBOROS”) of Austria, pursuant to which we granted OROBOROS non-exclusive world-wide distribution rights to our Shredder SG3 System and related products.
 
We are also the exclusive distributor, throughout the Americas, for Constant Systems, Ltd.’s (“CS”) cell disruption equipment, parts, and consumables. CS, a British company located northwest of London, England, has been providing niche biomedical equipment, related consumable products, and services to a global client base since 1989. CS designs, develops, and manufactures high pressure cell disruption equipment used by life sciences laboratories worldwide, particularly disruption systems for the extraction of proteins. The CS equipment provides a constant and controlled cell disruptive environment, giving the user superior, constant, and reproducible results whatever the application. CS has over 900 units installed in over 40 countries worldwide. The CS cell disruption equipment has proven performance in the extraction of cellular components, such as protein from yeast, bacteria, mammalian cells, and other sample types.
 
The CS pressure-based cell disruption equipment and our PCT-based instrumentation complement each other in several important ways. While both the CS and our technologies are based on high pressure, each product line has fundamental scientific capabilities that the other does not offer. Our PCT Platform uses certain patented pressure mechanisms to achieve small-scale, molecular level effects. CS’s technology uses different, proprietary pressure mechanisms for larger-scale, non-molecular level processing. In a number of routine laboratory applications, such as protein extraction, both effects can be critical to success. Therefore, for protein extraction and a number of other important scientific applications, we believe laboratories will benefit by using the CS and PBI products, either separately or together.
 
In June 2013, CS and PBI signed an expanded distribution agreement that made us the exclusive distributor of CS products throughout all of the Americas until the end of 2019. In October 2021, we renewed this distribution agreement for an additional two years. 
 
d. Intellectual Property
 
We believe that protection of our patents and other intellectual property is essential to our business. Subject to the availability of sufficient financial resources, our practice is to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions, and improvements to inventions that are important to our business development. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, and technological innovations to develop and maintain our potential competitive position.
 
To date, we have been awarded 26 total United States and foreign patents related to our PCT technology platform, and one US patent and two additional patents in China related to our Ultra Shear Technology. We also received eight patents with our purchase of the assets of BaroFold in December 2017.
 
The Company received one US patent and two patents in China for UST, focused on a low-cost scalable approach for product manufacturing. The Company believes this method can find use in various nanoemulsion applications for pharmaceutical (e.g., drug delivery), biotechnology (e.g., protein recovery, biomolecule extraction), and food/beverage (e.g., shelf-stable “clean label”) products. We plan to design, develop, manufacture, and market three different modules of BaroShear UST platform:
 
1. a bench-top, research/formulation, low-throughput instrument that we will license for formulation development;
 2. a lab-or pilot scale production instrument that we will license into life science companies and other industries;
 3. a production scale UST-based instrument for manufacturing applications that we will license to food, cosmetics, nutraceuticals, and other processors worldwide.
 
Our issued patents expire between 2022 and 2030. Any failure to obtain and maintain adequate patent protection may adversely affect our ability to enter into, or affect the terms of, any arrangement for the marketing, sale or licensing of any of our products or technology platforms. It may also allow our competitors to duplicate our products without our permission and without compensation.

License Agreements Relating to Pressure Cycling Technology
 
BioMolecular Assays, Inc.
 
In 1996, we acquired our initial equity interest in BioSeq, Inc., which at the time was developing our original pressure cycling technology. BioSeq, Inc. acquired its pressure cycling technology from BioMolecular Assays, Inc. under a technology transfer and patent assignment agreement. In 1998, we purchased all of the remaining outstanding capital stock of BioSeq, Inc., and at such time, the technology transfer and patent assignment agreement was amended to require us to pay BioMolecular Assays, Inc., a 5% royalty on our sales of products or services that incorporate or utilize the original pressure cycling technology that BioSeq, Inc. acquired from BioMolecular Assays, Inc. We were also required to pay BioMolecular Assays, Inc. 5% of the proceeds from any sale, transfer or license of all or any portion of the original pressure cycling technology. These payment obligations terminated March 7, 2016.
 
In connection with our acquisition of BioSeq, Inc., we licensed certain limited rights to the original pressure cycling technology back to BioMolecular Assays, Inc. This license is non-exclusive and limits the use of the original pressure cycling technology by BioMolecular Assays, Inc. solely for molecular applications in scientific research and development and in scientific plant research and development. BioMolecular Assays, Inc. is required to pay us a royalty equal to 20% of any license or other fees and royalties, but not including research support and similar payments, it receives in connection with any sale, assignment, license or other transfer of any rights granted to BioMolecular Assays, Inc. under the license. BioMolecular Assays, Inc. was required to pay us these royalties until the expiration in March 2016 of the patents held by BioSeq, Inc. since 1998. We have not received any royalty payments from BioMolecular Assays, Inc. under this license.
 
Battelle Memorial Institute
 
In December 2008, we entered into an exclusive patent license agreement with the Battelle Memorial Institute (“Battelle”). The licensed technology is the subject of a patent application filed by Battelle in 2008 and relates to a method and a system for improving the analysis of protein samples, including through an automated system utilizing pressure and a pre-selected agent to obtain a digested sample in a significantly shorter period of time than current methods, while maintaining the integrity of the sample throughout the preparatory process. In addition to royalty payments on net sales of “licensed products,” we are obligated to make minimum royalty payments for each year that we retain the rights outlined in the patent license agreement and we are required to have our first commercial sale of the licensed products within one year following the issuance of the patent covered by the licensed technology. After re-negotiating the terms of the contract in 2013, the minimum annual royalty was $1,200 in 2014 and $2,000 in 2015; the minimum royalties were $3,000 in 2016, $4,000 in 2017 and $5,000 in 2018 and each calendar year thereafter during the term of the agreement.

f. Liquidity
 
Management has developed a plan to continue operations. This plan includes controlling expenses, streamlining operations, and obtaining capital through equity and/or debt financing. We have been successful in raising cash through debt and equity offerings in the past. We have efforts in place to continue to raise cash through debt and equity offerings.
 
Although we have successfully completed equity financings and reduced expenses in the past, we cannot assure our investors that our plans to address these matters in the future will be successful. Additional financing may not be available to us on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In the event we are unable to raise sufficient funds on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to:
 

● | severely limit or cease our operations or otherwise reduce planned expenditures and forego other business opportunities, which could harm our business. The accompanying financial statements do not include adjustments that may be required in the event of the disposal of assets or the discontinuation of the business; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | obtain financing with terms that may have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or the rights of the holders of our capital stock; or 
● | obtain funds through arrangements with future collaboration partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to some or all of our technologies or products.

g. Regulation
 
Many of our activities are subject to regulation by governmental authorities within the United States and similar bodies outside of the United States. The regulatory authorities may govern the collection, testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, transportation, approval, advertising, and promotion of our products, as well as the training of our employees.
 
Currently, our PCT commercialization efforts are focused in the area of genomic, proteomic, lipidomic, and small molecule sample preparation. We do not believe that our current Barocycler products used in sample preparation are considered “medical devices” under the United States Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDA Act”) and we do not believe that we are subject to the law’s general control provisions that include requirements for registration, listing of devices, quality regulations, labeling and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. We also do not believe that we are subject to regulatory inspection and scrutiny. If, however, we are successful in commercializing PCT in applications beyond our current focus area of genomic, proteomic, lipidomic, and small molecule sample preparation, such as protein purification, pathogen inactivation and immunodiagnostics, our products may be considered “medical devices” under the FDA Act, at which point we would be subject to the law’s general control provisions and regulation by the FDA that include requirements for registration listing of devices, quality regulations, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. The process of obtaining approval to market these devices in the other potential applications of PCT would be costly and time consuming and could possibly prohibit us from pursuing such markets.
 
Some of our devices may also become subject to the European Pressure Equipment Directive, which requires certain pressure equipment meet certain quality and safety standards. We do not believe that we are currently subject to this directive because our Barocycler instruments are below the threshold documented in the text of the directive. If our interpretation were to be challenged, we could incur significant costs defending the challenge, and we could face production and selling delays, all of which could harm our business.
 
We self-certified that our Barocycler instrumentation was electromagnetically compatible, or “CE” compliant, which means that our Barocycler instruments meet the essential requirements of the relevant European health, safety and environmental protection legislation. In order to maintain our CE Marking, a requirement to sell equipment in many countries of the European Union, we are obligated to uphold certain safety and quality standards. Due to outsourcing manufacturing to CBM, an ISO certified contract manufacturer, for all Barocycler 2320 EXT instruments currently in inventory or sold in 2021, we believe compliance with CE and other required marks and certifications is well controlled.
 
h. Employees
 
At December 31, 2021, we had twelve (12) full-time employees. All employees enter into confidentiality agreements intended to protect our proprietary information. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. Our performance depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified professional, scientific and technical staff. The level of competition among employers for skilled personnel is high. Subject to our limited financial resources, we attempt to maintain employee benefit plans to enhance employee morale, professional commitment and work productivity and provide an incentive for employees to remain with us.
 
i. Corporate Information
 
We were incorporated in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in August 1978 as Boston Biomedica, Inc. In 1996, Boston Biomedica completed a successful initial public offering and was listed on the NASDAQ market (where we maintained a listing until 2012). In September 2004, we completed the sale of Boston Biomedica’s core business units and began to focus exclusively on the development and commercialization of the PCT platform. Following this change in business strategy, we changed our legal name from Boston Biomedica, Inc. to Pressure BioSciences, Inc. We began operations as PBI in February 2005, research and development activities in April 2006, early marketing and selling activities of our Barocycler instruments in late 2007, and active marketing and selling of our PCT-based instrument platform in 2012.
