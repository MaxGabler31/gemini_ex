Item 1. Business.
Graham Holdings Company (the Company) is a diversified education and media company whose operations include educational services, television broadcasting, online print and local TV news, home health and hospice care and manufacturing. The Company’s Kaplan subsidiary provides a wide variety of educational services, both domestically and outside the United States. The Company’s media operations comprise the ownership and operation of television broadcasting (through the ownership and operation of seven television broadcast stations), plus Slate and Foreign Policy magazines and Panoply, a podcast network. The Company also owns home health and hospice providers, four industrial companies and Social Code LLC, a marketing solutions provider. 
Financial information concerning the principal segments of the Company’s business for the past three fiscal years is contained in Note 20 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Revenues for each segment are shown in Note 20 gross of intersegment sales. Consolidated revenues are reported net of intersegment sales, which did not exceed 0.1% of consolidated operating revenues.
The Company’s operations in geographic areas outside the U.S. consist primarily of Kaplan’s non-U.S. operations. During the fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, these operations accounted for approximately 25%, 25% and 26%, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated revenues, and the identifiable assets attributable to non-U.S. operations represented approximately 21% and 20% of the Company’s consolidated assets at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Education
Kaplan, Inc. (Kaplan), a subsidiary of the Company, provides an extensive range of education and related services worldwide for students and professionals. Kaplan conducts its operations through three segments: Kaplan Higher Education, Kaplan Test Preparation and Kaplan International. In addition, the results of the Kaplan Corporate segment include investment activities, identifying and investing in high-growth-potential education technology companies.
The following table presents revenues for each of Kaplan’s segments:

Kaplan Higher Education
Kaplan Higher Education (KHE) currently consists of Kaplan University (KU). KU provides a wide array of certificate, diploma and degree programs designed to meet the needs of students seeking to advance their education and career goals. 
Potential Transaction
On April 27, 2017, certain Kaplan subsidiaries entered into a Contribution and Transfer Agreement (Transfer Agreement) to contribute the institutional assets and operations of KU to a new, non-profit, public-benefit corporation affiliated with Purdue University (Purdue) in exchange for a Transition and Operations Support Agreement (TOSA), to provide key non-academic operations support to the new university. The new university will operate almost exclusively online as a new Indiana public university affiliated with Purdue under the name Purdue University Global. As part of the transfer to the new university, KU will transfer students, academic personnel, faculty and operations, property leases for KU’s campuses and learning centers, Kaplan-owned academic curricula and content related to KU courses. The operations support activities that Kaplan will provide to the new university will include technology support, help-desk functions, human resources support for transferred faculty and employees, admissions support, financial aid administration, marketing and advertising, back-office business functions, certain test preparation and domestic and international student recruiting services.
The proposed transfer of KU does not include any of the assets of the KU School of Professional and Continuing Education, which provides professional training and exam preparation for professional certifications and licensures, nor does it include the transfer of other Kaplan businesses such as Kaplan Test Preparation and Kaplan International. Those entities, programs and business lines will remain part of Kaplan. Kaplan will receive nominal cash consideration upon transfer of the institutional assets.

Pursuant to the TOSA, Kaplan is not entitled to receive any reimbursement of costs incurred in providing support functions, or any fee, unless and until the new university has first covered all of its operating costs. In addition, during each of the new university’s first five years, prior to any payment to Kaplan, the new university is entitled to a priority payment of $10 million per year beyond costs, which will be paid out of the new university’s revenue. To the extent the new university’s revenue is insufficient to pay the $10 million per year priority payment, Kaplan is required to advance an amount to the new university to cover such insufficiency. In addition, if the new university achieves cost savings in its budgeted operating costs, then the new university may be entitled to a payment equal to 20 percent of such savings (Efficiency Payment). To the extent that there are sufficient revenues to pay the Efficiency Payment, pay the priority payment and to reimburse the new university for its direct expenses, Kaplan will receive reimbursement for Kaplan’s costs of providing the support activities in addition to a fee equal to 12.5 percent of the new university’s revenue.
The TOSA has a 30-year initial term, which will automatically renew for five-year periods unless terminated. After the sixth year, the new university has the right to terminate the agreement upon payment of a termination fee equal to 1.25 times the new university’s revenue for the preceding 12-month period (Buy-out Fee), which payment would be made pursuant to a 10-year note, and at the new university’s election, it may receive for no additional consideration certain assets used by Kaplan to provide the support activities pursuant to the TOSA. At the end of the 30-year term, if the new university does not renew the TOSA, the new university would be obligated to make a final payment of six times the fees paid or payable during the preceding 12-month period, which payment would be made pursuant to a 10-year note, and at the new university’s election, it may receive for no additional consideration certain assets used by Kaplan to provide the support activities pursuant to the TOSA.
Either party may terminate the TOSA at any time if the new university generates (i) $25 million in cash operating losses for three consecutive years or (ii) aggregate cash operating losses greater than $75 million at any point during the initial term. Operating loss is defined as the amount of revenue the new university generates minus the sum of (1) the new university’s and Kaplan’s respective costs in performing academic and support functions and (2) the $10 million priority payment to the new university in each of the first five years. Upon termination for any reason, the new university would retain the assets that Kaplan contributed pursuant to the Transfer Agreement. Each party also has certain termination rights in connection with a material default or material breach of the TOSA by the other party. 
Under the agreement, Kaplan will indemnify Purdue for pre-closing liabilities of KU. The terms of the TOSA, including the fee structure, may be changed by agreement prior to closing.
The proposed transfer of KU is subject to various closing conditions, including, among others, regulatory approvals from the U.S. Department of Education (ED), the Indiana Commission for Higher Education (ICHE) and the Higher Learning Commission (HLC), which is the regional accreditor approved by the U.S. Secretary of Education of both Purdue and KU, as well as certain other state educational agencies and accreditors of programs. ICHE approved the transaction on August 10, 2017, and confirmed that the new university will be considered by the state of Indiana to be a public postsecondary institution. HLC has indicated that it will review the application at its board meeting in late February 2018 after a full staff and peer review. The parties also submitted a pre-acquisition application to the ED seeking approval for the change of control of KU. On September 13, 2017, the ED responded to the pre-acquisition application stating that as of such date it did not see any impediment to approval of the transaction subject to certain conditions, the details of which remain subject to change, on which its ultimate approval relies.The parties expect to be able to comply with all required conditions, but this may result in changes to the TOSA, including changes to the fee structure. The parties anticipate approval of this transaction by the end of the first quarter of 2018; however, there can be no assurance that the transaction will be consummated on the terms described above or at all, or that the required approvals will be obtained.
If the proposed transfer of KU is consummated, Kaplan will no longer own or operate KU or any other institution participating in student financial aid programs that have been created under Title IV of the U.S. Federal Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (Higher Education Act). Consequently, Kaplan would no longer be responsible for operating KU. However, pursuant to the TOSA, Kaplan would be performing functions that fall within the ED definition of a third-party servicer and would, therefore, assume certain regulatory responsibilities that require approval by the ED. The ED requires that contracts between institutions and third-party servicers include agreements by the third-party servicer to: (1) comply with all statutory and regulatory provisions applicable to Title IV of the Higher Education Act; (2) refer to the ED Office of the Inspector General for investigation any information indicating reasonable cause to believe the institution might have engaged in fraud or other criminal misconduct in connection with the administration of Title IV; (3) be jointly and severally liable with the institution to the Secretary of the ED for any violation by the servicer of a statutory or regulatory provision applicable to Title IV; (4) confirm student eligibility prior to disbursement and calculate and return unearned Title IV funds if disbursing funds; and (5) return records and funds to the institution upon terminating the contract or ceasing to provide services. The third- party servicer arrangement between Kaplan and the new university would also be subject to information security requirements established by the Federal Trade Commission as well as all aspects of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. As a third-party servicer, Kaplan may be required to undergo an annual compliance audit of its 
2

administration of the Title IV functions or services that it performs, although this audit requirement may not apply if Kaplan only contracts with the new university and the attestation engagement of the new university covers every aspect of Kaplan’s administration of the Title IV programs. The ED would continue to have oversight authority over Kaplan as a third-party servicer, including the ability to initiate program reviews or audits at its discretion and to impose sanctions on Kaplan, including, but not limited to, terminating Kaplan’s authority to act as a third-party servicer for the new university or any other Title IV participating institution.
If the proposed transfer of KU is not consummated, KU will continue to be operated by the Company and will exist in the same regulatory environment applicable to for-profit postsecondary institutions. See Item 1A. Risk Factors, including The Proposed Transfer of Kaplan University Is Subject to Receipt of Regulatory Approvals That, If Not Obtained, Could Delay or Prevent Consummation of the Proposed Transaction and Could Disrupt the Business of Kaplan University During the Pendency of the Transaction. 
Kaplan University.  KU specializes in online education, is accredited by the HLC and holds other programmatic accreditations. Most of KU’s programs are offered online, while some are offered in a traditional classroom format at 14 locations in Iowa, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska and Wisconsin. KU also includes Concord Law School (Concord), a fully online law school. At year-end 2017, KU had approximately 28,718 students enrolled, including those conditionally admitted in a trial period.
Also currently part of KU is the School of Professional and Continuing Education (PACE). PACE offers a wide range of education solutions to assist professionals in advancing their careers by obtaining professional licenses, designations and certifications. This includes solutions for insurance, securities, mortgage and appraisal licensing exams and for advanced designations, such as CFA® and CPA exams. PACE serves approximately 3,587 business-to-business clients, including 157 Fortune 500 companies. In 2017, more than 491,000 students used PACE’s exam preparation offerings. In the fourth quarter of 2017, PACE entered into an agreement to acquire the College for Financial Planning (CFFP). CFFP offers financial education and training to individuals through comprehensive programs of study that lead to licensing or certification, graduate-level study and education for professionals pursuing the Certified Financial Planner (CFP) designation. The acquisition is intended to complement existing CFP education offerings and will add new professional designations and degrees to the PACE portfolio. CFFP is a separately accredited institution by the HLC. The acquisition is subject to regulatory approval from the HLC, which is not expected before June 2018.

Financial Aid Programs and Regulatory Environment
Funds provided under the U.S. Federal student financial aid programs that have been created under Title IV of the Higher Education Act, historically, have been responsible for a majority of KHE revenues. During 2017, funds received under Title IV programs accounted for approximately $374 million, or approximately 68%, of total KHE revenues, and 25% of Kaplan, Inc. revenues. The Company estimates that funds received from students borrowing under third-party private loan programs comprised less than 1% of KHE revenues. Direct student payments, funds received under various state and federal agency grant programs and corporate reimbursement under tuition assistance programs accounted for most of the remaining 2017 KHE revenues. 
Title IV programs encompass various forms of student loans and non-repayable grants. In some cases, the U.S. Federal government subsidizes a portion of the student interest expense of Title IV loans. Subsidized loans and grants are only available to students who can demonstrate financial need. During 2017, approximately 87% of the $374 million of Title IV funds received by KHE came from student loans, and approximately 13% of such funds came from grants.
Title IV Eligibility and Compliance With Title IV Program Requirements. To maintain eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, a school must comply with extensive statutory and regulatory requirements relating to its financial aid management, educational programs, financial strength, administrative capability, compensation practices, facilities, recruiting practices, representations made to current and prospective students and various other matters. In addition, the school must be licensed, or otherwise legally authorized, to offer postsecondary educational programs by the appropriate governmental body in the state or states in which it is physically located or is otherwise subject to state authorization requirements, be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the ED and be certified to participate in the Title IV programs by the ED. Schools are required periodically to apply for renewal of their authorization, accreditation or certification with the applicable state governmental bodies, accrediting agencies and the ED. In accordance with ED regulations, KU campuses are grouped into a main campus and additional campus locations. KU is assigned its own identification number, known as an OPEID number, for the purpose of determining compliance with certain Title IV requirements. No assurance can be given that KU or its individual programs will maintain their Title IV eligibility, accreditation and state authorization in the future or that the ED might not successfully assert that KU has previously failed to comply with Title IV requirements.
The ED may place a school on provisional certification status under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, failure to satisfy certain standards of financial responsibility or administrative capability, or upon a change in ownership resulting in a change of control. Provisional certification status carries fewer due process protections than full certification. As a result, the ED may withdraw an institution’s provisional certification more easily than if it is fully certified. In addition, the ED may subject an institution on provisional certification status to greater scrutiny in some instances, for example, when it applies for approval to add a new location or program or makes another substantive program change. Provisional certification does not otherwise limit access to Title IV program funds by students attending the institution. On December 17, 2015, KU, in connection with the renewal of its U.S. Department of Education Program Participation Agreement, received notice from the ED that it had been placed on provisional certification status until September 30, 2018, in relation to an open and ongoing ED program review. The ED has not notified KU of any negative findings. However, at this, time we cannot predict the outcome of the program review. During the period of provisional certification, KU must obtain prior ED approval to open a new location, add an educational program, acquire another school or make any other significant change.
In addition, if the ED finds that a school has failed to comply with Title IV requirements or improperly disbursed or retained Title IV program funds, it may take one or more of a number of actions, including fining the school, requiring the school to repay Title IV program funds, limiting or terminating the school’s eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, initiating an emergency action to suspend the school’s participation in the Title IV programs without prior notice or opportunity for a hearing, transferring the school to a method of Title IV payment that would adversely affect the timing of the institution’s receipt of Title IV funds, requiring the submission of a letter of credit, denying or refusing to consider the school’s application for renewal of its certification to participate in the Title IV programs or for approval to add a new campus or educational program and referring the matter for possible civil or criminal investigation. There can be no assurance that the ED will not take any of these or other actions in the future, whether as a result of a lawsuit, program review or otherwise. This list is not exhaustive. There may be other actions the ED may take and other legal theories under which a school could be sued as a result of alleged irregularities in the administration of student financial aid. See Item 1A. Risk Factors, including Failure to Comply With Statutory and Regulatory Requirements Could Result in Loss of Access to U.S. Federal Student Loans and Grants Under Title IV, a Requirement to Pay Fines or Monetary Liabilities or Other Sanctions. 
Student Default Rates.  A school may lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if student defaults on the repayment of Title IV loans exceed specified rates, referred to as “cohort default rates.” The ED calculates a cohort default rate for each OPEID number. KU has one OPEID number. If a school’s cohort default rate exceeds 40% for any single year, it will lose its eligibility to participate in the Direct Loan programs for at least two fiscal years, effective 30 days after notification from the ED. If a school’s cohort default rate equals or exceeds 30% for three 
4

consecutive years, it will lose its Title IV eligibility to participate in the Direct Loan and U.S. Federal Pell Grant programs effective 30 days after notification from the ED and will remain ineligible for at least two fiscal years. If a school’s cohort default rate equals or exceeds 30% in two of the three most recent fiscal years for which rates have been issued by the ED, it may be placed on provisional certification by the ED and, under new regulations that were scheduled to take effect on July 1, 2017, but were subsequently delayed, may be required to submit a letter of credit to the ED.
The three-year cohort default rates for KU for the U.S. Federal fiscal years ending September 30, 2014, 2013 and 2012, were 14.6%, 12.4% and 12.9%, respectively. 
Because KU receives a significantly lower level of taxpayer-funded grants and subsidies than community colleges, state schools and not-for-profit schools, KU is more dependent on tuition, and its students are more dependent on loans. However, no assurances can be given that these resources or programs will enable Kaplan’s schools to maintain cohort default rates below the thresholds for sanctions.
Recent Federal Rulemaking
Borrower Defense to Repayment Regulations. On November 1, 2016, the ED issued final rules that would have become effective on July 1, 2017, but were subsequently delayed, that expand the bases on which borrowers may obtain a discharge of their federal financial aid loans and that establish a process for the ED to commence a separate proceeding against the institution to recover the discharged amounts. Prior to the effective date, on June 14, 2017, the ED delayed implementation of a large portion of the rule. Multiple state attorneys general have sued the ED to force reinstatement of the rules.
The final rules amend existing procedures and standards for borrowers seeking the discharge of certain Title IV loans first disbursed prior to July 1, 2017, based on certain acts or omissions of the institution. The final rules also expand the bases for borrowers to obtain discharges of certain Title IV loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2017, including any substantial misrepresentations by the school or any of its representatives or individuals or entities with whom the institution has an agreement, certain breaches of contract and certain judgments against the school. The final rules include procedures for borrowers to assert discharge claims as a group rather than individually and create extended and, in some cases, unlimited statutes of limitation for the submission of discharge claims. The final rules also establish procedures for the evaluation of claims, for minimal school participation in the process and for the ED to consolidate and present borrower claims during the process. If the borrower discharge claims are approved, the ED may discharge some or all of the loans and initiate a separate proceeding to recover any discharged loans from the institution.
The rules also amend the ED’s financial responsibility regulations by imposing, among other things, two sets of triggers for determining whether the ED may require the institution to furnish the ED with a letter of credit or other form of acceptable financial protection and to accept other requirements that the ED might impose. The first set of triggers include certain lawsuits, judgments and settlements; an accrediting agency requirement to submit a teach-out plan in connection with closure of a location; one or more programs that could lose eligibility based on gainful employment rates in the next award year; and certain withdrawals of owners’ equity. If one of the triggers occurs, the ED would recalculate the institution’s composite score by estimating the amount of actual and potential losses resulting from the triggering event and determining whether the recalculated composite score results in the institution failing the financial responsibility standards. The rules for estimating potential losses are broad. For example, the rules generally presume that potential losses from pending lawsuits equal the amount sought in the complaint or in any final demand letter. 
Additionally a second set of triggers that could result in the ED imposing a letter of credit requirement and other conditions or requirements include failure to comply with 90/10 requirements for the most recently completed fiscal year; an SEC warning that it may suspend trading on the institution’s stock; failure to file certain reports with the SEC; receipt of notice of non-compliance with exchange requirements; notice that the institution’s stock is delisted; cohort default rates exceeding 30% for the two most recent years; certain significant fluctuations in Title IV funding; failure to comply with certain state or accreditor requirements; high annual drop-out rates; probation, show cause or similar action by an institution’s accrediting agency; certain violations of loan agreements; expected or pending claims for borrower relief discharges; and other material adverse effects on financial condition.
If the ED deems that the institution failed the financial responsibility standards based on one or more of the aforementioned events listed in the regulations or based on the institution’s failure to comply with other requirements in the financial responsibility regulations, the ED may permit the institution to continue participating in the Title IV programs under a provisional certification and would require the institution to submit a letter of credit or other form of financial protection, comply with certain student debt-to-income ratios under the ED’s gainful employment rules discussed below and potentially accept other conditions or restrictions.
5

If the ED requires a letter of credit based on a trigger from either set of triggers, the rules require the letter of credit to equal 10% of the total amount of Title IV funds received by the institution during its most recently completed fiscal year plus any additional amount that the ED determines is necessary to fully cover any estimated losses. The ED also may place the institution on provisional certification, impose certain reporting requirements, place the institution on the heightened cash monitoring or reimbursement payment methods and impose other conditions or requirements. The ED may require the institution to maintain the letter of credit until the institution’s composite score is 1.0 or greater and the triggering events have been resolved or cease to exist. If the rule goes into effect as written, it is possible that KU will be subject to such letter of credit requirements in the future. 
Additionally, the rules require schools not meeting a “repayment rate” threshold calculation to provide an ED-prepared warning to current and prospective students and to include the warning on its website and in promotional materials and advertisements. The final language of the warning is not yet determined. It is likely KU will have to provide such warnings if the rules take effect as written. 
The rules also include new provisions related to arbitration and class-action lawsuits, including prohibitions regarding an institution’s use of pre-dispute arbitration agreements and class-action waivers. KU currently uses both mandatory arbitration and class-action waivers to limit exposure to class-action cases and resolve student complaints more quickly and efficiently.
On October 24, 2017, the ED published an interim final rule that delayed until at least July 1, 2018, the effective date of the majority of these regulations. On the same date, the ED also published a notice of proposed rulemaking that proposed to further delay, until July 1, 2019, the effective date of the majority of the regulations to ensure that there is adequate time to conduct negotiated rulemaking and, as necessary, develop revised regulations. Comments on the proposal were due by November 24, 2017. The ED convened the first meeting of negotiated rulemaking in November 2017 and convened additional meetings in early 2018. The ED intends to issue proposed regulations for public comment during the first half of 2018, but the ED has not established a final schedule. Any regulations published in final form by November 1, 2018, typically would take effect on July 1, 2019, but there is no assurance as to the timing or content of any such regulations. On February 14, 2018, the ED issued a final regulation delaying the effective date of most of the provisions with respect to borrower defense to repayment until November 1, 2019. The ED has indicated that, in the meantime, it will continue to accept claims with respect to borrower defense to repayment and process them under pre-2016 policies and practices. 
We cannot predict how the ED would interpret and enforce the new borrower defense to repayment rules if they take effect after the delay or how these rules, or any rules that may arise out of the negotiated rulemaking process, may impact KU’s participation in the Title IV programs; however, the new rules could have a material adverse effect on Kaplan’s business and results of operations, and the broad sweep of the rules may, in the future, require Kaplan to submit a letter of credit as indicated above.
Gainful Employment. Under the Higher Education Act, certain education programs, including all programs offered by proprietary institutions such as KU, are required to lead to gainful employment in a recognized occupation in order to be eligible to participate in the Title IV programs. The ED has defined the phrase “gainful employment” to mean employment with earnings high enough to meet specific student debt-to-income ratios. The ED tied an education program’s Title IV eligibility to whether the program meets that definition. These regulations are known as the “Gainful Employment” regulation or “GE” rules. A final Gainful Employment regulation was released on October 31, 2014. The final rule went into effect on July 1, 2015, and Kaplan timely submitted the required Gainful Employment data to the ED. 
As noted previously, the final rule maintained the debt-to-earnings thresholds requiring that each GE program show that its graduates’ debt payment on loans taken out to attend the program are no more than a certain percentage of their earnings. If a program fails this metric multiple years in a row, it will become ineligible for Title IV aid. Under the debt-to-earnings rates, a program passes the test if its annual debt-to-earnings rate does not exceed 8% or its discretionary debt-to-earnings rate does not exceed 20%. A program fails the test if its annual debt-to-earnings rate exceeds 12% and its discretionary debt to earnings rate exceeds 30%. A program is in a regulatory status called the “warning zone” if it does not pass or fail the test (i.e., either its annual debt-to-earnings rate is greater than 8%, but less than 12%, or its discretionary debt-to-earnings rate is greater than 20%, but less than 30%). If a program fails the test two times within three years, it will become ineligible to participate in the Title IV programs for a period of three years. If a program is either in the warning zone or fails the test for four consecutive years, it will also become ineligible to participate in Title IV programs for a period of three years. In addition, the regulation requires an institution to provide to current and prospective students prescribed warnings of potential ineligibility of the program in any year for which the program could become ineligible based on the prior-year GE rates. Institutions with such programs also must wait to enroll prospective students into the failing program until three days after providing the warning to students. Such institutions also may be required to submit a letter of credit or other financial protection to the ED under the new borrower defense to repayment regulations noted in this disclosure, although the effective date of these regulations has been delayed.
6

The rules also included revised requirements for program approval, public disclosures on certain outcomes (graduation, placement, repayment rates and other consumer information) and a “certification” requirement that each program is included in the school’s accreditation grant and has programmatic-level accreditation if required for licensure in the occupation. This “certification” requirement has a material negative impact on KU’s Concord Law School’s Juris Doctor program, which accounted for less than 1% of KHE’s 2017 revenue. Because it is completely online, that program does not have the accreditation necessary to allow graduates to become licensed to practice law upon graduation and qualify to take the bar exam in any state other than California. Accordingly, because the ED has not provided guidance that narrows the rule as written, in 2015, Concord Law School was required to cease enrollments in multiple states. 
KU implemented actions to mitigate the potential impact of the GE regulations on certain programs that may fail the GE debt-to-income ratio by discontinuing likely failing programs and placing tuition caps on certain other programs. New programs have replaced a significant portion of the intake loss of the discontinued programs (isolating for general declines in all programs). Kaplan believes that the new programs are not “substantially similar” under the GE rules to any other current or past programs. However, if the ED determines that these new programs are substantially similar and combines the new programs with programs that are currently in the warning zone or that failed the GE test, eligibility of the new programs to participate in Title IV programs and revenues from such programs would be materially adversely affected. The GE rules do not apply to degree programs (Graduate degrees, Associate’s and Bachelor’s) at non-profit or public institutions such as the new university.
In October 2016, the ED issued draft debt-to-earnings rates. KU had five programs in which the draft rates failed the GE test; however, two of these five programs are not active and the remaining three are not currently accepting enrollments. KU has 16 programs in which the draft rates put them in warning zone status. Four of these programs are active and accounted for $71 million and $51.1 million in revenue for 2015 and 2016, respectively. For 2017, these four programs accounted for $44.5 million in revenue. KU continues to employ mitigation actions to minimize the financial impact of GE and secure GE compliance. Of the remaining 12 programs, five were suspended several years ago and have no active students and seven of these programs are not currently accepting enrollments. 
On January 9, 2017, the ED released the final first-year debt-to-earnings rates, which did not change from the draft rates issued in October 2016. Under the GE regulations, KU has the ability to challenge the underlying data used in the debt-to-earnings calculations. KU has appealed the underlying earnings data in certain programs that fell into the fail or warning zone category. If successful, the appeals could shift the number of programs in each category favorably. 
On June 30, 2017, the ED announced the extension of the compliance date for certain gainful employment disclosure requirements from July 1, 2017, to July 1, 2018, and subsequently relaxed the documentation requirements for alternate earnings appeals. On August 18, 2017, the ED extended to February 1, 2018, the deadline for all programs to file supporting documents for their alternate earnings appeals. The ED has not announced a delay or suspension in the enforcement of any other GE regulations. However, on August 8, 2017, ED officials announced that the ED did not have a timetable for the issuance of lists of students who completed programs, which is the first step toward generating the data for calculating new gainful employment rates. Consequently, we cannot predict when the ED will begin the process of calculating and issuing new draft or final gainful employment rates in the future. We also cannot predict whether the announcement of the intent to initiate gainful employment rulemaking, discussed below, or the extension of certain gainful employment deadlines may result in the ED delaying the issuance of new draft or final gainful employment rates in the future.
On June 15, 2017, the ED announced its intention to convene a negotiated rulemaking committee to develop proposed regulations to revise the GE rules. The committee convened in December 2017, will continue to meet in early 2018, and may issue proposed regulations for public comment during the first half of 2018, but the ED has not established a final schedule for publication of proposed or final regulations. Any regulations published in final form by November 1, 2018, typically would take effect on July 1, 2019, but we cannot provide any assurances as to the timing or content of any such regulations.
Some of the data needed to compute debt-to-earnings rates and project their impact on Title IV program eligibility under the GE regulations are not accessible to the Company, including specific graduate earnings information that will be compiled by the Social Security Administration. In addition, the continuing eligibility of programs for Title IV funding may be affected by factors beyond Kaplan’s control, such as changes in the actual or deemed earnings level of its graduates, changes in student borrowing levels, increases in interest rates, changes in the U.S. Federal poverty income level relevant for calculating one of the proposed debt-to-earnings rates and other factors. As a result, the ultimate outcome of future GE rates and their impact on Kaplan’s operations are still uncertain. Kaplan is continuing efforts to mitigate any current and potential negative impact of the GE rules. These efforts include increasing career services support, implementing financial literacy counseling, creating program-specific tuition reductions and scholarships and revising the pricing model to implement a tuition cap for at-risk programs. Although Kaplan is taking these and other steps to address compliance with GE regulations, there is no assurance that these measures will be adequate to prevent a material number of programs from receiving debt-to-earnings rates that fail 
7

or are in the warning zone and to prevent a loss of Title IV eligibility. This has caused Kaplan to eliminate or limit enrollments in certain educational programs at some of its schools; may result in the loss of student access to Title IV programs; and has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on KHE’s revenues, operating income and cash flows. 
Incentive Compensation. Under the ED’s incentive compensation rules, an institution participating in Title IV programs may not provide any commission, bonus or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid to any person or entity engaged in any student recruiting or admission activities or in making decisions regarding the awarding of Title IV funds. Kaplan has taken steps to comply fully with these rules and the related guidance. Among the actions taken, Kaplan revised its compensation plans for admissions personnel and eliminated enrollment results as a component in the determination of compensation. Kaplan believes that this change in its approach to recruiting has adversely impacted, and will continue to adversely impact, its enrollment rates, operating costs, business and results of operation. Kaplan cannot predict how the ED will interpret and enforce all aspects of the revised incentive compensation rule in the future.
The 90/10 Rule. Under regulations referred to as the 90/10 rule, an institution would lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs for a period of at least two fiscal years if the institution derives more than 90% of its receipts from Title IV programs, as calculated on a cash basis in accordance with the Higher Education Act and applicable ED regulations, in each of two consecutive fiscal years. An institution with Title IV receipts exceeding 90% for a single fiscal year would be placed on provisional certification and may be subject to other enforcement measures, including a potential requirement to submit to the ED a letter of credit under the borrower defense to repayment regulations that were scheduled to take effect on July 1, 2017, but were subsequently delayed. KU derived less than 74% and less than 77% of its receipts from Title IV programs in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
KU is taking various measures to reduce the percentage of its receipts attributable to Title IV funds, including modifying student payment options; emphasizing direct-pay and employer-paid education programs; encouraging students to evaluate carefully the amount of their Title IV borrowing; eliminating some programs; cash-matching; and developing and offering additional non-Title IV-eligible certificate preparation, professional development and continuing education programs. Kaplan has taken steps to ensure that revenue from programs acquired by KU is eligible to be counted in that campus’s 90/10 calculation. However, there can be no guarantee that the ED will not challenge the inclusion of revenue from any acquired program in KU’s 90/10 calculations or will not issue an interpretation of the 90/10 rule that would exclude such revenue from the calculation. There can be no guarantee that these measures will be adequate to prevent the 90/10 ratio at KU from exceeding 90% in the future. In addition, certain legislators have proposed amendments to the Higher Education Act that would lower the threshold percentage in the 90/10 rule to 85%, treat non-Title IV federal funds as Title IV funds in the 90/10 calculation and make other refinements to the calculation. If these proposals or similar laws or regulations are adopted, they would make it more difficult for KU’s institutions to comply with the 90/10 rule. 
Change of Control. If an institution experiences a change of control, such as the proposed transfer of KU, under the standards of applicable state agencies, accrediting agencies or the ED, the institution must seek the approval of the relevant agencies. An institution that undergoes a change of control, which may include a change of control of the institution’s parent corporation or other owners, must be reviewed and recertified by the ED and obtain approvals from certain state agencies and accrediting bodies, in some cases prior to the change of control. The standards pertaining to a change of control are not uniform and are subject to interpretation by the respective agencies. Certifications obtained from the ED following a change of control are granted on a provisional basis that permits the institution to continue participating in Title IV programs, but provides fewer procedural protections than full certifications. As a result, the ED may withdraw an institution’s provisional certification more easily than if it is fully certified. In addition, the ED may subject an institution on provisional certification status to greater scrutiny in some instances, for example, when it applies for approval to add a new location or program or makes another substantive change. As noted above, the proposed transfer of KU is subject to regulatory approval by the ED, HLC, and certain other agencies.
Standards of Financial Responsibility. An institution participating in Title IV programs must maintain a certain level of financial responsibility as determined under the Higher Education Act and under ED regulations. The ED measures an institution’s financial responsibility by compiling a composite score, ranging from -0.1 to 3.0, pursuant to a formula that incorporates various financial data from annual financial statements submitted to the ED. An institution with a composite score of 1.5 or higher passes the composite test. An institution with a composite score of at least 1.0 and less than 1.5 is in the warning zone. If an institution’s composite score is in the warning zone and the institution complies with other financial responsibility standards, the ED typically permits the institution to continue participating in the Title IV programs under certain conditions, including imposing certain monitoring and reporting requirements, placing the institution on provisional certification and transferring the institution from the advance system of Title IV payment to a heightened cash-monitoring or reimbursement system of payment. An institution fails the composite score test with a score of less than 1.0. The ED may permit such institutions to continue participating in the Title IV programs under the aforementioned conditions and potentially other conditions, as well as a requirement to submit to the ED a letter of credit in an amount equal to at least 10% of the annual Title 
8

IV program funds received by the institution during its most recently completed fiscal year, although the ED could require a letter of credit based on a higher percentage of the institution’s annual Title IV program funds. The borrower defense to repayment regulations that were scheduled to take effect on July 1, 2017, but were subsequently delayed, expand the list of circumstances that could require an institution to provide the ED with a letter of credit or other form of acceptable financial protection. Moreover, the new borrower defense to repayment regulations may increase the required minimum letter of credit amount beyond 10% of annual Title IV funds to include additional amounts that the ED determines are needed to fully cover any estimated potential losses. If an institution is unable to submit a required letter of credit or to comply with ED imposed conditions, the institution could be subject to loss of Title IV eligibility, financial penalties and other conditions or sanctions. For the 2017 fiscal year, KU expects to have a composite score of 1.9, based on its own assessment using ED methodology. However, the ED will make its own determination once it receives and reviews KU’s audited financial statements for the 2017 fiscal year.
Administrative Capability. The Higher Education Act, as reauthorized, directs the ED to assess the administrative capability of each institution to participate in Title IV programs. The failure of an institution to satisfy any of the criteria used to assess administrative capability may cause the ED to determine that the institution lacks administrative capability and subject the institution to additional scrutiny, deny eligibility for Title IV programs or impose other sanctions. To meet the administrative capability standards, an institution must, among other things: 

• | Comply with all applicable Title IV program requirements;


• | Have an adequate number of qualified personnel to administer Title IV programs;


• | Have acceptable standards for measuring the satisfactory academic progress of its students;


• | Have procedures in place for awarding, disbursing and safeguarding Title IV funds and for maintaining required records;


• | Administer Title IV programs with adequate checks and balances in its system of internal control over financial reporting;


• | Not be, and not have any principal or affiliate who is, debarred or suspended from U.S. Federal contracting or engaging in activity that is cause for debarment or suspension;


• | Provide adequate financial aid counseling to its students;


• | Refer to the ED’s Office of the Inspector General any credible information indicating that any applicant, student, parent, employee, third-party servicer or other agent of the institution has engaged in any fraud or other illegal conduct involving Title IV programs;


• | Submit in a timely way all required reports and financial statements; and


• | Not otherwise appear to lack administrative capability.

Although Kaplan endeavors to comply with the administrative capability requirements, Kaplan cannot guarantee that it will continue to comply with the administrative capability requirements or that its interpretation or application of the relevant rules will be upheld by the ED or other agencies or upon judicial review.
State Authorization. Kaplan’s institutions and programs are subject to state-level regulation and oversight by state licensing agencies, whose approval is necessary to allow an institution to operate and grant degrees or diplomas in the state. State laws may establish standards for instruction, qualifications of faculty, location and nature of facilities, financial policies and responsibility and other operational matters. Institutions that participate in Title IV programs must be legally authorized to operate in the state in which the institution is physically located or is otherwise subject to state authorization requirements.
Some states have sought to assert jurisdiction over online educational institutions that offer education services to residents in the state or to institutions that advertise or recruit in the state, notwithstanding the lack of a physical location in the state. State regulatory requirements for online education vary among the states, are not well developed in many states, are imprecise or unclear in some states and are subject to change. If KU is found not to be in compliance with an applicable state regulation and a state seeks to restrict one or more of KU’s business activities within its boundaries, KU may not be able to recruit or enroll students in that state and may have to cease providing services in that state. If a state’s requirements are found not to be in compliance with ED regulations or if KU’s institutions do not receive state approvals where necessary, the institutions could be deemed to lack the state authorization necessary to participate in the Title IV programs and be subject to loss of Title IV eligibility, repayment obligations and other sanctions. Due to an exemption, KU’s home state of Iowa does not require KU to be registered in Iowa. However, to comply with the law, KU was granted affirmative registration in Iowa. Kaplan believes that all of KU’s campuses currently meet the ED requirements to be considered legally authorized to provide the programs they offer in the states in which the campuses are located. The ED has stated that it will not publish a list of states that meet, or fail to meet, the state authorization requirements, and it is uncertain how the ED will interpret these requirements in each state. On December 19, 2016, the ED issued final regulations regarding distance-education state authorization requirements that may require KU to be authorized in additional states, as well as regulations applicable to institutions with Title IV participating locations in a foreign country. These 
9

regulations, however, recognize state authorization reciprocity agreements, in which KU participates, as a means of satisfying the Title IV requirement. An institution must be able to document its approval under a state authorization reciprocity agreement, upon the ED’s request, if it does not have a separate authorization in a state where it enrolls distance-education students.
The regulations are not scheduled to take effect until July 1, 2018. Specifically, the regulations will require an institution that offers postsecondary education through distance education in a state in which the institution is not physically located, or in which the state determines that the institution is otherwise subject to the state’s jurisdiction, to meet the state’s authorization requirements for offering postsecondary distance education in that state or show that it is authorized through a reciprocity agreement. The regulations also will require the institution to document that there is a state process for review and appropriate action on complaints from enrolled students in each such state. In addition, the regulations will require the institution to provide public disclosures regarding various matters relating to its state authorization and to provide individualized disclosures to each prospective student regarding certain matters, including whether the student’s program fails to meet licensure or certification prerequisites in the state in which the student resides. If Kaplan is unable to obtain the required approvals for distance-education programs by the effective date of the new regulations, then Kaplan students residing in the state for which approval was not obtained may be unable to receive Title IV funds, which could have a material adverse effect on Kaplan’s business and operations. The implementation of this rule may further limit Concord’s ability to enroll students in its Juris Doctor program outside of California and may materially impact Concord’s revenue.
Congressional Reauthorization of Title IV Programs. All of the Title IV programs are subject to periodic legislative review and reauthorization. In addition, while Congress historically has not limited the amount of funding available for the various Title IV student loan programs, the availability of funding for the Title IV programs that provide for the payment of grants is primarily contingent upon the outcome of the annual U.S. Federal appropriations process. Congress also can make changes in the laws affecting Title IV programs in those annual appropriations bills and in other laws it enacts between Higher Education Act reauthorizations. The Higher Education Act was reauthorized through September 2014 and has continued to receive annual appropriations. The House Education and the Workforce Committee approved a reauthorization bill on December 13, 2017. The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee has indicated it plans to develop its own reauthorization bill. It is not known if or when Congress will pass final legislation that amends the Higher Education Act or other laws affecting U.S. Federal student aid.
Whether as a result of changes in the laws and regulations governing Title IV programs, a reduction in Title IV program funding levels or a failure of KU to maintain eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, a material reduction in the amount of Title IV financial assistance available to the students attending those schools could have a material adverse effect on Kaplan’s business and operations. In addition, any development that has the effect of making the terms on which Title IV financial assistance is made available materially less attractive could also have a material adverse effect on Kaplan’s business and operations.
Governmental Scrutiny and Enforcement. There has been increased attention by Congress on the role that for-profit educational institutions play in higher education, including their participation in Title IV programs and tuition assistance programs for military service members attending for-profit colleges. Beginning in June 2010, the HELP Committee held a series of hearings to examine the for-profit education sector and requested information from various for-profit institutions, including KHE institutions. In July 2012, the majority staff of the HELP Committee issued a final report to conclude the review. The final report included observations and recommendations for federal policy related to increasing regulations on higher education. 
Other committees of Congress have also held hearings to look into, among other things, the standards and procedures of accrediting agencies, credit hours and program length and the portion of U.S. Federal student financial aid going to for-profit institutions. This increased activity, and other current and future activity, may result in legislation, further rulemaking and other governmental actions affecting Kaplan’s participation in Title IV programs or the amount of student financial assistance for which Kaplan’s students are eligible. In addition, concerns generated by congressional or other activity, or negative media reports, may adversely affect enrollment in for-profit educational institutions.
The increased scrutiny of for-profit schools also has resulted in additional enforcement actions, investigations and lawsuits by the ED; other federal agencies; state Attorneys General and state licensing agencies. These actions and allegations have attracted significant negative media coverage. Recent enforcement actions have resulted in institutions being required to post substantial letters of credit, liabilities, restrictions and sanctions and, in some cases, have led to the loss of Title IV eligibility and closure of institutions. Allegations and enforcement actions against the overall postsecondary education sector may impact general public perceptions of private-sector educational institutions, including Kaplan, in a negative manner. Negative media coverage regarding other educational institutions or regarding Kaplan directly could damage Kaplan’s reputation, reduce student demand for Kaplan programs or lead to increased regulatory scrutiny and could negatively impact Kaplan’s operating results.
10

Kaplan cannot predict the extent to which these activities could result in further investigations, legislation or rulemaking affecting its participation in Title IV programs, other governmental actions and/or actions by state agencies or legislators or by accreditors. If any laws or regulations are adopted that significantly limit Kaplan’s participation in Title IV programs or the amount of student financial aid for which Kaplan’s students are eligible, or any actions are taken against Kaplan that result in material liabilities, sanctions, conditions or requirements, Kaplan’s results of operations and cash flows could be adversely and materially impacted. 
Program Reviews, Audits and Investigations.  Kaplan’s schools are subject to audits and program compliance reviews by various external agencies, including the ED; its Office of the Inspector General; other federal agencies, including the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs; and state and accrediting agencies. While program reviews may be undertaken for a variety of reasons, they are performed routinely as part of regulatory oversight of institutions that participate in Title IV or federal or state student funding programs. If the ED or another regulatory agency determines that an institution has improperly disbursed Title IV or other federal or state program funds or violated a provision of the Higher Education Act or other federal or state law or regulations, the affected institution may be required to repay funds to the ED or the appropriate federal or state agency or lender and may be assessed an administrative fine and be subject to other sanctions. Although Kaplan endeavors to comply with all U.S. Federal and state laws and regulations, Kaplan cannot guarantee that its interpretation of the relevant rules will be upheld by the ED or other agencies or upon judicial review.
On February 23, 2015, the ED began a review of KU. The review will assess Kaplan’s administration of its Title IV and Higher Education Act programs and will initially focus on the 2013 to 2014 and 2014 to 2015 award years. On December 17, 2015, KU received a notice from the ED that it had been placed on provisional certification status until September 30, 2018, in connection with the open and ongoing ED program review. The ED has not notified KU of any negative findings. However, at this time, Kaplan cannot predict the outcome of this review, when it will be completed or any liability or other limitations that the ED may place on KU as a result of this review. During the period of provisional certification, KU must obtain prior ED approval to open a new location, add an educational program, acquire another school or make any other significant change.
In addition, there are two open program reviews at campuses that were part of the KHE Campuses business prior to its sale in 2015 to Education Corporation of America (ECA), and the ED’s final reports on the program reviews at former KHE Broomall, PA, and Pittsburgh, PA, locations are pending. Kaplan retains responsibility for any financial obligation resulting from the ED program reviews at the KHE Campuses business that were open at the time of sale.
Institutional and Programmatic Accreditation.  Accreditation is a process through which an institution submits itself to qualitative review by an organization of peer institutions. Pursuant to the Higher Education Act, the ED relies on accrediting agencies to determine whether the academic quality of an institution’s educational programs is sufficient to qualify the institution to participate in Title IV programs. As noted previously, to remain eligible to participate in Title IV programs, a school must maintain its institutional accreditation by an accrediting agency recognized by the ED. Kaplan’s schools are subject to reviews by the accrediting agencies that accredit them and their educational programs. KU’s regional accreditation by the HLC was required to be reaffirmed in 2016. As part of this process, in the second quarter of 2016, HLC conducted an on-site review of KU. In August 2016, the HLC reaffirmed KU’s accreditation for a 10-year term through the 2025/26 academic year. The Company anticipates that HLC will consider KU’s change of control applications related to the proposed transaction with Purdue at its February 2018 meeting.
Programmatic accreditation is the process through which specific programs are reviewed and approved by industry-specific and program-specific accrediting entities. Although programmatic accreditation is not generally necessary for Title IV eligibility, such accreditation may be required to allow students to sit for certain licensure exams or to work in a particular profession or career or to meet other requirements. KU programs maintain a variety of programmatic accreditations that it believes are appropriate to ensure the quality of the programs or to enable students to seek necessary credentials upon graduation.
Return of Title IV Funds.  ED regulations require schools participating in Title IV programs to calculate correctly and return on a timely basis unearned Title IV funds disbursed to students who withdraw from a program of study prior to completion. These funds must be returned in a timely manner, generally within 45 days of the date the school determines that the student has withdrawn. Under ED regulations, failure to make timely returns of Title IV program funds for 5% or more of students sampled in a school’s annual compliance audit, or in a program review or Office of the Inspector General (OIG) audit could result in a requirement that the school post a letter of credit in an amount equal to 25% of its prior-year returns of Title IV program funds. Currently, KU is not required to post a letter of credit. If unearned funds are not properly calculated and returned in a timely manner, an institution is subject to monetary liabilities, fines or other sanctions.
Kaplan recently determined that a procedural change that was implemented with respect to student financial aid refunds may not have been in accordance with the regulation governing return of financial aid for students who 
11

withdraw from a program prior to completion. Consequently, $8.4 million in estimated unreturned funds from prior periods was recorded in Kaplan’s fourth quarter 2017 results; this estimated refund liability is included in current liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2017. No restatement of prior period financial statements and no change in previously reported financial results was required due to the immateriality of the adjustment for the periods presented. Kaplan has self-reported this matter to the ED. Kaplan is in the process of implementing remediation measures, including improvements to the review and approval process for changes to Title IV financial aid refund policies and procedures. 
Test Preparation
In 2017, Kaplan Test Preparation (KTP) included test preparation businesses in pre-college, graduate, health and bar review, as well as new businesses in new economy skills training (NEST) and in career advising. KTP also published test preparation and other books through its Kaplan Publishing business. Each of these businesses is discussed below.
Test Preparation.  KTP’s pre-college and graduate businesses prepare students for a broad range of college and graduate school admissions examinations, including the SAT, ACT, LSAT, GMAT, MCAT and GRE. KTP’s health business prepares students for medical and nursing licensure exams, including the USMLE and NCLEX. Kaplan Bar Review offers full-service bar review in 50 states and the District of Columbia, as well as review for the multistate portion of the bar exam nationwide.
KTP delivers courses at numerous venues throughout the U.S., Canada, Puerto Rico, Mexico and in London. These courses are taught at more than 70 KTP-branded locations and at numerous other locations such as hotels, high schools and universities. KTP also offers courses online, typically in a live online classroom or a self-study format. Private tutoring services are provided in person in select markets and online throughout the U.S. In addition, KTP licenses material for certain of its courses to third parties and to a Kaplan affiliate, which, during 2017, delivered courses at 63 locations in 35 countries outside the U.S. KTP also offers college admissions examination preparation courses and materials directly to high schools and school districts.
During 2017, KTP enrolled over 350,000 students in its courses, including more than 175,000 enrolled in online programs.
New Economy Skills Training. KTP operates Metis, a licensed, data science school with locations in New York, California, Illinois and Washington. KTP had also operated Dev Bootcamp, a licensed, coding school that provided students with job-ready computer coding skills and had locations in New York, California, Illinois, Texas and Washington. In July 2017, Dev Bootcamp announced that it was no longer accepting new students and would discontinue campus operations. Dev Bootcamp completed its “teach out” in 2017.
Publishing.  Kaplan Publishing focuses on print test preparation resources sold through retail channels. At the end of 2017, Kaplan Publishing had over 300 products available in print and digital formats, including more than 122 digital products.
Kaplan International
Kaplan International (KI) operates businesses in Europe, the U.S. and the Asia Pacific region. Each of these businesses is discussed below.
Europe.  In Europe, Kaplan International operates the following businesses, all of which are based in the U.K. and Ireland: Kaplan UK, KI Pathways, KI English, Mander Portman Woodward and a higher education institution and an online learning institution.
The Kaplan UK business in Europe, through Kaplan Financial Limited, is a provider of training, test preparation services and degrees for accounting and financial services professionals, including those studying for ACCA, CIMA and ICAEW qualifications. In addition, Kaplan UK provides professional training. In 2017, Kaplan UK provided courses to over 52,000 students in accountancy and financial services. Kaplan UK is headquartered in London, England, and has 22 training centers located throughout the U.K.
The KI Pathways business offers academic preparation programs especially designed for international students who wish to study in English-speaking countries. In 2017, university preparation programs were being delivered in Australia, China, Japan, Nigeria, Singapore, the U.K. and the U.S., serving approximately 12,000 students in partnership with more than 40 universities. 
The KI English business provides English-language training, academic preparation programs and test preparation for English proficiency exams, principally for students wishing to study and travel in English-speaking countries. KI English operates a total of 38 English-language schools, with 20 located in the U.K., Ireland, Australia, New 
12

Zealand and Canada and 18 located in the U.S. During 2017, KI English served approximately 47,000 students for in-class English-language instruction provided by Kaplan. 
In January 2016, Kaplan International acquired Mander Portman Woodward (MPW), a U.K. independent sixth-form college that prepares domestic and international students for A-level examinations that control admission to U.K. universities. MPW operates three colleges in London, Cambridge and Birmingham. 
Kaplan International also operates Dublin Business School in Ireland, a higher education institution, and Kaplan Open Learning in the U.K., an online learning institution. At the end of 2017, these institutions enrolled an aggregate of approximately 4,900 students. 
U.K. Immigration Regulations. Certain Kaplan International businesses serve a significant number of international students; therefore, the ability to sponsor students from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland to come to the U.K. is critical to these businesses. Pursuant to regulations administered by the United Kingdom Visas and Immigration Department (UKVI), the KI Pathways business is required to hold or operate Tier 4 sponsorship licenses to permit international students to come to the U.K. to study the courses they deliver. Four of the KI English schools also have Tier 4 licenses to enable them to teach international students, although, in general, students studying the English language can choose to enter the U.K. on a student visitor visa as opposed to a Tier 4 visa.
Each Tier 4 license holder is also required to have passed the Basic Compliance Assessment (BCA) and hold Educational Oversight accreditation. Without these criteria being met, Kaplan International’s U.K. schools would not be permitted to issue a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) to potential incoming international students, which is a prerequisite to a student obtaining a Tier 4 student visa. The revised immigration rules also require all private institutions to obtain Educational Oversight accreditation. Educational Oversight requires a current and satisfactory full inspection, audit or review by the appropriate academic standards body. Failure to comply with these new rules has the potential to adversely impact the number of international students studying through Kaplan International.
For the sixth consecutive year, Kaplan International has retained 100% in Tier 4 Educational Oversight with high grades across all colleges. All Tier 4 license renewals have been approved again with high scores in the core measurable requirements. 
KI English has four U.K. English-language schools listed on the Kaplan Tier 4 master license. In 2016, each of these four schools also completed annual monitoring, achieving “exceeded expectations” from the Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI). As noted above, students studying the English language can choose to enter the U.K. on a student visitor visa as opposed to a Tier 4 visa.
The MPW schools have performed consistently well with good records in their Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills (OFSTED) and ISI Educational Oversight inspections. The MPW schools each hold current Tier 4 licenses.
Changes continue to be made to U.K. immigration rules. The UKVI continues to tighten the regulations around sponsoring students from outside the EEA and Switzerland. Changes over the past three years have included the introduction of a rule that restricts to five years the time a sponsored student can spend studying at or above degree level in the U.K. In addition, sponsored students who do not attend an institution that qualifies as a Higher Educational Institution (HEI), which includes students attending Kaplan International colleges in the U.K., are no longer permitted to work part time while studying. In 2013, the biggest change was the introduction of a new screening process called a “Credibility Check” for potential students. This interview process can affect the number of visa refusals Kaplan International’s businesses receive, which is a risk factor for loss of the relevant license. However, Kaplan International has not experienced a significant increase in visa refusals. Since the introduction of the Points-Based System in 2009, all Tier 4 students are subject to strict checks pre- and post-arrival, including verification that their qualifications are genuine, confirmation that the students maintain a good attendance record and that they can be contacted at all times, and verification that they have academic progression and that their visa is valid at all times while they are present in the U.K. Failure to meet these requirements obligates Kaplan International to withdraw sponsorship and report these students to the UKVI. In 2014, there were additional changes to the UKVI rules, including a significant tightening of the core measurable with respect to visa refusals. Effective November 1, 2014, no more than 10% of the students to whom a CAS is issued by a Tier 4 license sponsor can have their visa refused. Formerly, the limit was set at 20%. In 2015, the Tier 4 licenses for Kaplan Financial, KI Pathways’ London College and all of KI English colleges were consolidated into one single “master” license. In June 2016, KI English reduced the number of its schools on the master license to four. The University of Nottingham International College was later added to the master license. Kaplan Financial has ceased sponsoring international students and was removed from the master license in 2017. If this license were lost, all of these colleges would lose the ability to sponsor international students. Furthermore, students applying to another education provider after completing their studies at these colleges are now required to return home to apply for a 
13

second visa. All of KI Pathways’ colleges dedicated to working with one university partner that held their own individual sponsor license before the introduction of the master license have retained their individual licenses. Academic service providers are required to have rigorous processes to verify all English-language test certificates. The introduction of revised immigration rules has increased Kaplan International’s operating costs in the U.K. in relation to students from outside the EEA and Switzerland.
No assurance can be given that each Kaplan International business in the U.K. will be able to maintain its Tier 4 BCA status and Educational Oversight accreditation. Maintenance of each of these approvals requires compliance with several core metrics that may be difficult to attain. Loss of either Tier 4 BCA status or Educational Oversight accreditation would have a material adverse effect on Kaplan Europe’s operating results.
Impact of Brexit.  On June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved a proposal that the U.K. leave the European Union (EU), commonly referred to as “Brexit.” The impact on Kaplan International from Brexit will depend, in part, on the outcome of future negotiations regarding the terms of the U.K.’s withdrawal from the EU, possibly including any transition period. The timing of the negotiations and their impact on recruitment of international students is uncertain. It is possible that EU nationals’ ability to enter the U.K. for long- or short-term study will change or that changes in laws affecting EU nationals could also apply to international students presently covered by the Tier 4 (KI Pathways) or student visitor visa regime (KI English). It is also unclear how international student recruitment agents and prospective international students will view the U.K. as a study destination after the EU exit negotiations and the U.K.’s eventual departure from the EU. If the U.K. exit from the EU and related perceptions of the U.K. as a study destination have a significant negative impact on Kaplan’s ability to recruit international students, Kaplan’s results of operations and cash flows would be adversely and materially impacted. The U.K.’s Prime Minister continues to express her desire to maintain rigorous immigration controls and select the “best” students for entry into the U.K. However, in 2017, the Home Secretary commissioned the Migration Advisory Committee to assess the economic and social impact of international students in the U.K. This report is due in September 2018. A white paper on immigration is proposed to be released in autumn 2018 by the U.K. government. 
The U.K. Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015. The U.K. Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015 creates a statutory duty for specified public authorities to “have due regard to the need to prevent people from being drawn into terrorism” (Prevent duty). The aim of this government policy is to prevent people from becoming terrorists or supporting terrorism. The private Further Education sector became subject to the new Prevent duty in July 2015 and is required to implement safeguards as proposed by the Home Office Prevent guidance. 
Kaplan International has successfully implemented a Prevent Policy to satisfy the requirements of its duty across KI English and KI Pathways. Following inspections in July 2016 at three KI Pathways sites, KI Pathways received the highest grading of “compliant” for its inspections and received best practice ratings in a number of areas for the private Further Education sector. 
Higher Education and Research Act 2017 (U.K.). The Higher Education and Research Act 2017 (HERA) received Royal Assent on April 27, 2017. HERA undertakes a significant reform of regulation of the higher education sector in the U.K., including the formation of a new regulator, the Office for Students. The academic year 2018/19 will be a transition year under the new regulatory framework. The Department of Education on behalf of the Office for Students consulted on the new regulatory framework that will apply to the higher education sector, including transition arrangements, in 2017. While the final regulatory framework has not yet been published, the Company expects that the Kaplan International Pathways business will have a higher compliance burden on the basis of its review of the proposals sent out for consultation.
Asia Pacific. In the Asia Pacific region, Kaplan operates businesses primarily in Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and China.
In Singapore, Kaplan operates three business units: Kaplan Higher Education, Kaplan Financial and Kaplan Professional. During 2017, the Higher Education and Financial divisions served more than 14,000 students from Singapore and 3,000 students from other countries throughout Asia and Western Europe. Kaplan Professional provided short courses to approximately 37,000 professionals, managers, executives and businesspeople in 2017. 
Kaplan Singapore’s Higher Education business provides students with the opportunity to earn Bachelor’s and postgraduate degrees in various fields on either a part-time or full-time basis. Kaplan Singapore’s students receive degrees from affiliated educational institutions in Australia and the U.K. In addition, this division offers pre-university and diploma programs.

In Australia, Kaplan delivers a broad range of financial services programs from certificate level through Master’s level, together with professional development offerings through Kaplan Professional, as well as higher education programs in business, accounting, hospitality and tourism and management through Kaplan Business School. In 2017, these businesses provided courses to approximately 1,800 students at any one time through face-to-face classroom programs (within Kaplan Business School) and to a total of approximately 43,000 students through online or distance-learning programs offered by Kaplan Professional. 
Kaplan Australia’s English-language business is part of KI English, which operates across six locations in Australia and one location in New Zealand, teaching more than 7,500 students throughout 2017. In 2017, the Kaplan International English School in Cairns was sold to a regionally-based distance-education provider, to allow Kaplan to refocus its English-language training businesses on metropolitan areas in Australia. The Kaplan Australia Pathways business is also part of KI Pathways. It consists of Murdoch Institute of Technology and the University of Adelaide College (formerly Bradford College) and offered face-to-face pathways and foundational education to 950 students wishing to enter Murdoch University in Perth and the University of Adelaide, respectively, at any one time throughout 2017.
In 2017, Kaplan Australia acquired Red Marker Pty Ltd., a machine learning and artificial intelligence-based provider of regulatory software. Its Artemis product detects potentially non-compliant content as it is being created, helping advisers and licensees to identify and remediate compliance risks associated with the promotion of financial products or services. This acquisition broadened Kaplan’s portfolio of compliance solutions to the financial services sector in Australia.
In Hong Kong, Kaplan operates three main business units: Kaplan Financial, Kaplan Language Training and Kaplan Higher Education, serving approximately 12,000 students annually. 
Kaplan Hong Kong’s Financial division delivers preparatory courses to approximately 10,000 students and business executives wishing to earn professional qualifications in accountancy, financial markets designations and other professional courses.
Hong Kong’s Language Training division offers both test preparation for overseas study and college applications, including TOEFL, IELTS, SAT and GMAT, to approximately 1,000 students.
Kaplan Hong Kong Higher Education division offers both full-time and part-time programs to approximately 1,000 students studying for degrees from leading Western universities. Students earn Doctorate, Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees in Hong Kong. Kaplan also offers a proprietary pre-college diploma program through Kaplan Business and Accountancy School.
In 2014, Kaplan Holdings Limited (Hong Kong) signed a joint venture agreement with CITIC Press Corporation. Under the terms of the agreement, the parties have now incorporated a joint venture company, Kaplan CITIC Education Co. Limited, which is 49% owned by Kaplan Holdings Limited. The joint venture company is carrying out publishing and distribution of Kaplan Financial training products in China (including CFA, FRM and ACCA) and is expanding business with other Kaplan divisions under an intellectual property license from Kaplan. 
Each of Kaplan’s international businesses is subject to unique and often complex regulatory environments in the countries in which they operate. The degree of consistency in the application and interpretation of such regulations can vary significantly in certain jurisdictions, which can make compliance challenging. No assurance can be given that Kaplan will be able to continue complying with foreign regulations, and failure to do so could materially and adversely affect Kaplan’s operating results.

 (b) below).
(b) Full-power commercial TV stations, Designated Market Area (DMA) is a market designation of The Nielsen Company that defines each television market exclusive of another, based on measured viewing patterns.
In January 2017, GMG acquired WCWJ, a CW affiliate television station in Jacksonville, FL, and WSLS, an NBC affiliate television station in Roanoke, VA. GMG operates both stations under the network affiliations in effect prior to their acquisition. 
Revenue from broadcasting operations is derived primarily from the sale of advertising time to local, regional and national advertisers. In 2017, advertising revenue accounted for 68.4% of the total for GMG’s operations. Advertising revenue is sensitive to a number of factors, some specific to a particular station or market and others more general in nature. These factors include a station’s audience share and market ranking; seasonal fluctuations in demand for air time; annual or biannual events, such as sporting events and political elections; and broader economic trends, among others.
Regulation of Broadcasting and Related Matters
GMG’s television broadcasting operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under the U.S. Federal Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Communications Act). Each GMG television station holds an FCC license that is renewable upon application for an eight-year period.
Digital Television (DTV) and Spectrum Issues. Each GMG station (and each full-power television station nationwide) now broadcasts only in digital format, which allows transmission of HDTV programming and multiple channels of standard-definition television programming (multicasting). 
Television stations may receive interference from a variety of sources, including interference from other broadcast stations that is below a threshold established by the FCC. That interference could limit viewers’ ability to receive television stations’ signals. The amount of interference to stations could increase in the future because of the FCC’s decision to allow electronic devices, known as “white space” devices, to operate in the television frequency band on an unlicensed basis on channels not used by nearby television stations. 
In November 2017, the FCC voted to adopt rules authorizing broadcast television stations to voluntarily transition to a new technical standard, called Next Generation TV or ATSC 3.0. The new standard is designed to allow broadcasters to provide consumers with better sound and picture quality; hyper-localized programming, including news and weather; enhanced emergency alerts and improved mobile reception. The standard also allows for the use of targeted advertising and more efficient use of spectrum, potentially allowing for more multicast streams to be aired on the same six-megahertz channel. ATSC 3.0 is not backwards compatible with existing television equipment, and the FCC’s recently adopted rules require full-power television stations that transition to the new standard to continue broadcasting a signal in the existing DTV standard until the FCC phases out the requirement in a future order. A transitioning station’s DTV-formatted content must be substantially similar to the programming aired on its ATSC 3.0 channel for at least five years.
In April 2017, the FCC announced the completion of an incentive auction in which certain broadcast television stations bid to relinquish spectrum or move to a different spectrum band in exchange for a share of the revenues obtained by auctioning the reallocated broadcast spectrum for use by wireless broadband providers. None of GMG’s stations won the incentive auction. However, certain GMG stations — specifically WDIV, WSLS, WCWJ and WJXT — will be required to move to new channel allotments so as to free up a nationwide block of spectrum for wireless broadband use. The FCC has adopted rules requiring this “repacking” of broadcast television stations to 
16

new channels to be completed within 39 months after the incentive auction closed, with earlier deadlines set for particular stations in order to stagger the transition to new channels. The scheduled transition deadlines for GMG’s repacked stations are as follows:

• | WSLS: September 6, 2019


• | WCWJ and WJXT: January 17, 2020


• | WDIV: March 13, 2020

The repacking and incentive auction processes could have an adverse effect on GMG. For example, the repacking of GMG’s stations and/or neighboring stations may result in increased interference to the GMG stations’ signals or otherwise affect the stations’ over-the-air coverage. In addition, although GMG’s repacked stations are eligible to seek reimbursement for repacking-related costs, the legislation authorizing the incentive auction provides only $1.75 billion in total for all such reimbursements. On October 16, 2017, the FCC announced that the initial reimbursement estimates from all entities eligible for reimbursement, after such estimates were reviewed and adjusted by the FCC’s reimbursement fund administrator, totaled approximately $1.864 billion, or approximately $114 million more than currently is statutorily authorized for such reimbursements. Each repacked commercial television station, including each of the repacked GMG stations, has been allocated an initial reimbursement amount equal to approximately 52% of the station’s estimated repacking costs, as verified by the FCC’s fund administrator, subject to FCC approval of particular requests for reimbursement of actual costs incurred. Further reimbursement allocations will depend on the amount of funds actually drawn from the FCC’s reimbursement fund and whether any additional reimbursement funding is made available by Congress. The Company accordingly cannot predict the extent to which the GMG stations will be compensated for expenses that they incur in connection with the repacking. 
Carriage of Local Broadcast Signals. Congress has established, and periodically has extended or otherwise modified, various statutory copyright licensing regimes governing the local and distant carriage of broadcast television signals on cable and satellite systems. The Company cannot predict whether or how Congress may maintain or modify these regimes in the future, nor what net effect such decisions would have on the Company’s broadcast operations or on the Company overall.
The Communications Act and the FCC rules allow a commercial television broadcast station, under certain circumstances, to insist on mandatory carriage of its signal on cable systems serving the station’s market area (must carry). Alternatively, stations may elect, at three-year intervals, to forego must-carry rights and allow their signals to be carried by cable systems only pursuant to a “retransmission consent” agreement. Commercial television stations also may elect either mandatory carriage or retransmission consent with respect to the carriage of their signals on direct broadcast satellite (DBS) systems that provide “local-into-local” service (i.e., to distribute the signals of local television stations to viewers in the local market area). Stations that elect retransmission consent may negotiate for compensation from cable or DBS systems in exchange for the right to carry their signals. Each of GMG’s television stations has elected retransmission consent for both cable and DBS operators and are carried on all of the major cable and DBS systems serving each station’s respective local market pursuant to retransmission consent agreements. The FCC has considered proposals to alter its rules governing retransmission consent negotiations, network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity. For example, pursuant to the STELA Reauthorization Act (STELAR), enacted in December 2014, the FCC adopted rules prohibiting same-market television broadcast stations from coordinating or jointly negotiating for retransmission consent unless such stations are under common control, and it considered, though ultimately did not adopt, changes to its “good faith” standards for retransmission consent negotiations. In addition, the FCC in March 2014 solicited comments on a proposal to eliminate its network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules, which rules restrict the ability of cable operators, direct broadcast satellite systems and other distributors classified by the FCC as multichannel video programming distributors to import the signals of out-of-market television stations with duplicating programming during retransmission consent disputes or otherwise. The FCC has not acted on that proposal to date. If Congress or the FCC were to enact further changes to the retransmission consent and/or exclusivity rules, such changes could materially affect the GMG stations’ bargaining leverage in future retransmission consent negotiations.
Ownership Limits.  The Communications Act and the FCC’s rules limit the number and types of media outlets in which a single person or entity may have an attributable interest. In November 2017, the FCC voted to eliminate certain of these restrictions and modify others. For instance, the FCC voted to eliminate a standard known as the “Eight Voices Test,” which generally prohibited two commercial television stations in the same market from combining ownership if the transaction would result in fewer than eight independently owned stations remaining in the market. This change to the local television ownership (or “duopoly”) rule means that the ownership rules generally will permit a party to own up to two commercial television stations in a market so long as one of the stations is not among the top-four ranked television stations in that market. The FCC voted to retain the existing prohibition on transactions that would result in common ownership among the top-four ranked stations in the same market, subject to potential waivers of the prohibition on a case-by-case basis. In addition, the FCC voted to eliminate the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule, which had prohibited a single entity from owning a full-power broadcast station and a daily print newspaper in the same local market, and the television/radio cross-
17

ownership rule, which imposed specific limits on the ability to own television and radio stations in the same market (in addition to the separate limits on the number of television or radio stations a party could own in the market). The FCC also voted to eliminate a rule making certain television joint sales agreements (JSAs) attributable in calculating compliance with the ownership limits. The FCC will continue to require public disclosure of certain shared services agreements (SSAs) though these agreements are not considered attributable. The changes adopted in the FCC’s November 2017 order have been challenged in court. GMG’s ability to enter into certain transactions in the future may be affected by the outcome of such challenges.
In addition, by statute, a single person or entity may have an attributable interest in an unlimited number of television stations nationwide, as long as the aggregate audience reach of such stations does not exceed 39% of nationwide television households and as long as such interest complies with the FCC’s other ownership restrictions. In a December 2017 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the FCC sought comments regarding its authority to modify or eliminate this national ownership cap. The FCC also sought comments regarding the potential elimination of the 50% “Ultra High Frequency (UHF) discount,” under which stations broadcasting on UHF channels are credited with only half the number of households in their market for purposes of calculating compliance with the 39% cap. The FCC in 2016 eliminated the UHF discount, but it reversed that decision in early 2017, concluding that the UHF discount should not be altered except in connection with a broader review of the national ownership cap. Both the FCC’s earlier elimination of the UHF discount and its order restoring the provision have been challenged in court. The Company cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings, which could affect the ability of GMG and its competitors to enter into certain transactions in the future.
Programming. Six of GMG’s seven stations are affiliated with one or more of the national television networks that provide a substantial amount of programming to their television station affiliates. The expiration dates of GMG’s affiliation agreements are set forth at the beginning of this Television Broadcasting section. WJXT, one of GMG’s Jacksonville stations, has operated as an independent station since 2002. In addition, each of the GMG stations receives programming from syndicators and other third-party programming providers. GMG’s performance depends, in part, on the quality and availability of third-party programming, and any substantial decline in the quality or availability of this programming could materially affect the ability of GMG and its competitors to enter into certain transactions in the future.
Public Interest Obligations. To satisfy FCC requirements, stations generally are expected to air a specified number of hours of programming intended to serve the educational and informational needs of children and to complete reports on a quarterly basis concerning children’s programming. In addition, the FCC requires stations to limit the amount of advertising that appears during certain children’s programs. 
The FCC has other regulations and policies to ensure that broadcast licensees operate in the public interest, including rules requiring the disclosure of certain information and documents in an online public inspection file; rules requiring the closed-captioning of programming to assist television viewing by the hearing impaired; video description rules to assist television viewing by the visually impaired; rules concerning the captioning of video programming distributed via the Internet; and rules concerning the volume of commercials. Compliance with these rules imposes additional costs on the GMG stations that could affect GMG’s operations.
Political Advertising. The FCC regulates the sale of advertising by GMG’s stations to candidates for public office and imposes other obligations regarding the broadcast of political announcements more generally. The application of these regulations may limit the advertising revenues of GMG’s television stations during the periods preceding elections.
Broadcast Indecency. The FCC’s policies prohibit the broadcast of indecent and profane material during certain hours of the day, and the FCC regularly imposes monetary forfeitures when it determines that a television station has violated that policy. Broadcasters have repeatedly challenged these rules in court, arguing, among other things, that the FCC has failed to justify its indecency decisions adequately, that the FCC’s policy is too subjective to guide broadcasters’ programming decisions and that its enforcement approach otherwise violates the First Amendment. In June 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court held that certain fines against broadcasters for “fleeting expletives” were unconstitutional because the FCC failed to provide advance notice to broadcasters of what the FCC deemed to be indecent, but it also upheld the FCC’s authority to regulate broadcast decency. The Company cannot predict how GMG’s stations may be affected by the FCC’s current or future interpretation and enforcement of its indecency policies. 
The FCC is conducting proceedings concerning various matters in addition to those described in this section. The outcome of these proceedings and other matters described in this section could adversely affect the profitability of GMG’s television broadcasting operations.

CyberVista LLC
The Company launched CyberVista LLC (CyberVista) in 2015. CyberVista develops cybersecurity training and workforce development education programs. 
Competition
Kaplan’s businesses operate in fragmented and competitive markets. KU competes with both facilities-based and other distance-learning providers of similar educational services, including not-for-profit colleges and universities and for-profit businesses. PACE competes in each of its professional lines with other companies that provide preparation for exams required for professional licenses, certifications and designations. KTP competes with a variety of regional and national test preparation businesses, with individual tutors and with in-school preparation for standardized tests. Overseas, each of Kaplan’s businesses competes with other for-profit companies and, in certain instances, with government-supported schools and institutions that provide similar training and educational programs. Students choose among providers based on program offerings, convenience, quality of instruction, reputation, placement rates, student services and cost.
GMG competes for audiences and advertising revenues with television and radio stations, cable systems and video services offered by telephone companies serving the same or nearby areas; with DBS services; and, to a lesser degree, with other media, such as newspapers and magazines. Cable systems operate in substantially all of the areas served by the Company’s television stations, where they compete for television viewers by importing out-of-market television signals; by distributing pay-cable, advertiser-supported and other programming that is originated for cable systems; and by offering movies and other programming on a pay-per-view basis. In addition, DBS services provide nationwide distribution of television programming, including pay-per-view programming and programming packages unique to DBS, using digital transmission technologies. Moreover, to the extent that competing television stations in the Company’s television markets transition to ATSC 3.0, such stations may pose an increased competitive challenge to the Company’s stations, such as by offering an increased number of multicast channels and/or by offering advanced features. 
Competition also continues to increase from established and emerging online distribution platforms. Movies and television programming increasingly are available on an on-demand basis through a variety of online platforms, which include free access on the websites of the major TV networks, ad-supported viewing on platforms such as Hulu and subscription-based access through services such as Netflix. In addition, online-only subscription services offering live television services have been launched both by traditional pay-TV competitors (such as DISH and DirecTV) and new entrants (such as Sony). The Company has entered into agreements for some of its stations to be distributed via certain of these services, typically through opt-in agreements negotiated by the stations’ affiliated networks. Participation in these services has given the Company’s stations access to new distribution platforms. At the same time, competition from these various platforms could adversely affect the viewership of the Company’s television stations via traditional platforms and/or the Company’s strategic position in negotiations with pay-TV services. In addition, the networks’ increased role in negotiating online distribution arrangements for their affiliated stations may have broader effects on the overall network-affiliate relationship, which the Company cannot predict.
The home health and hospice industries are extremely competitive and fragmented, consisting of both for-profit and non-profit companies. Graham Healthcare Group competes primarily with privately-owned and hospital-operated home health and hospice service providers.
