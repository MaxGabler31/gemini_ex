Item 1. Business.
Special Note Regarding Chinese Companies.
 
Our principal executive offices are located in China and a majority of our executive officers and/or directors are located in or have significant ties to China. To date, our operations in the PRC have been limited. Clancy Corp. a Nevada company, registered Shanghai Clancy Enterprise Management Co., Ltd. as a wholly foreign-owned entity in Shanghai, China on April 13, 2020 (Shanghai Clancy). Shanghai Clancy registered Beijing Clancy Information Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing Clancy) as a wholly-owned subsidiary in Beijing on April 24, 2020. Unless the context indicates otherwise, all operations are conducted by Beijing Clancy, however shareholders will own an interest in Clancy Corp, the US domiciled company.

Nonetheless, investors should be aware that legal and operational risks due to our operations in the PRC. Depending on the nature of our business and/or operations, the PRC government may exert a significant amount of control and/or regulation on the PRC operating entity. This regulation and/or control could result in a material change our company’s post-combination operations and the value of common stock held by investors. It also could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors. Furthermore, it could cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. Recently, the PRC government initiated a series of regulatory actions and made a number of public statements on the regulation of business operations in China with little advance notice, including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, enhancing supervision over China-based companies listed overseas using a variable interest entity structure, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement.
 
As such, with respect to our future business, we will avoid any business restricted by the PRC, that is involving “Important Industry,” “National Economic Security,” a “well-known trademark,” or a “Chinese traditional brand.” Foreign ownership of these type of PRC companies require approval by the PRC authorities. Typically, these types of companies are acquired by foreign entities (without PRC approval) using a variable interest entity (VIE) structure whereby contractual agreements are entered into between the foreign acquiring company (or its subsidiary) and the PRC operating entity, however, the PRC operating company never becomes a direct subsidiary of the foreign acquiring company. Notwithstanding the forgoing, nonetheless the Company will face numerous risks and uncertainties with respect to any operations in the PRC. PRC laws and regulations are uncertain, as many of these laws and regulations are relatively new and may be subject to change, and their official interpretation and enforcement by the PRC government may involve substantial uncertainty. Generally, PRC has substantially less experience through its judiciary or the arbitration process as compared to the United States or the Cayman Islands. In addition, laws in the PRC are subject to change in the future with little advance notice which could negatively impact our future business and stock price.
 
As stated above, we do not believe that we will be directly subject to these regulatory actions or statements, as we do not intend to have a VIE structure and any such business acquired will not involve the collection of user data, implicate cybersecurity, or involve any other type of restricted industry. However, because these statements and regulatory actions are new, it is highly uncertain how soon legislative or administrative regulation making bodies in China will respond to them, or what existing or new laws or regulations will be modified or promulgated, if any, or the potential impact such modified or new laws and regulations will have on our daily business operations or our ability to accept foreign investments and list on an U.S. exchange. See “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Doing Business in China.”

As we develop operations in the PRC, our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and certain transactions may be subject to economic, political and legal developments in the PRC. Unlike in the United States, the enforcement of laws and rules and regulations in the PRC can change quickly with little advance notice; and the Chinese government may intervene or influence our operations at any time, or may exert more control over offerings conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in PRC-based issuers which could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of our common shares. Recent statements by the Chinese government have indicated an intent to exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investments in China based issuers. Any future action by the Chinese government expanding the categories of industries and companies whose foreign securities offerings are subject to government review could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and could cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. See “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Doing Business in China.”
 
As of the date of this filing, based upon our understanding, we are not (i) required to obtain permissions from any PRC authorities to operate or issue our shares to foreign investors and (ii) subject to the permission requirements from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) nor any other entity that is required to approve of our PRC subsidiaries’ operations. As of the date of this filing, we have not received, nor were we denied, such permissions by any PRC authority. If our determination that we are not subject to these regulatory requirements is incorrect or such requirements adversely change, foreign investors may be required to divest themselves of their investment and we may face sanctions, fines, or penalties from the PRC government and we may be required to divest our PRC operations, change certain aspects of our business to ensure compliance, which could decrease demand for our products, reduce revenues, increase costs, require us to obtain more licenses, permits, approvals or certificates, or subject us to additional liabilities. To the extent any new or more stringent measures are required to be implemented, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected as well as materially decrease the value of our common shares. 
 
Moreover, as stated above, we will avoid businesses requiring a VIE structure under PRC regulations. As stated above, this type of VIE structure typically entails contractual agreements between the acquiring company (ie the Company) (or its subsidiary) and the PRC operating entity, however, at no time is the PRC operating company a subsidiary of the acquiring company.
 
Since we intend to use a direct ownership structure rather that a VIE structure, under PRC law, the Company will be able to distribute dividends, if any, from its operating PRC entity. The operating PRC subsidiary will be able to distribute dividends upstream to the parent company and the parent company will then be able to distribute the dividends to its shareholders on a proportionate basis, provided however, that the PRC subsidiary has distributable earnings. Current PRC regulations permit an operating subsidiary to pay dividends to their respective shareholders only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, each PRC subsidiarity will be required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a statutory reserve until such reserve reaches 50% of each of its registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. However, as of this date, we have not made any upstream transfers, dividends or distributions.
 
Pursuant to the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (“HFCAA”), the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the “PCAOB”) issued a Determination Report on December 16, 2021 which found that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in: (1) mainland China of the People’s Republic of China because of a position taken by one or more authorities in mainland China; and (2) Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region and dependency of the PRC, because of a position taken by one or more authorities in Hong Kong. In addition, the PCAOB’s report identified the specific registered public accounting firms which are subject to these determinations. Our registered public accounting firm, Jack Sharma CPA, is not headquartered in mainland China or Hong Kong and was not identified in this report as a firm subject to the PCAOB’s determination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the PCAOB is not able to fully conduct inspections of our auditor’s work papers in China, you may be deprived of the benefits of such inspection which could result in limitation or restriction to our access to the U.S. capital markets and trading of our securities may be prohibited under the HFCAA. See “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Doing Business in China.” Although the audit report included herein was issued by U.S. auditors who are currently inspected by the PCAOB, if it is later determined that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate our auditor completely, investors would be deprived of the benefits of such inspection and our common shares may be delisted or prohibited from trading.

Company Background.
 
Clancy Corp. (the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 22, 2016.
 
On January 15, 2020, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to Articles of Incorporation with the Nevada Secretary of State (the “Amendment”) which effectuated the following corporate actions:

● | the forward split of our issued and outstanding common stock, $0.001 par value, on thirty (30) post-split shares for a one (1) pre-split share basis applicable to shareholders of record as of January 2, 2020, and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The increase of our authorized shares of common stock, $0.001 par value, from 75,000,000 to 345,000,000. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The above corporate actions were adopted by written consent of our sole Director, Mr. Gaoyang Liu, on January 2, 2020, and the sole Director recommended the Corporate Actions be presented to our shareholders for approval. On January 3, 2020, Mr. Liu, our majority stockholder, holding 64.4% of our outstanding voting securities executed written consent approving the Corporate Actions. For purposes of the forward stock split described above, the sole Director also set January 2, 2020 as the record date of such action.
 
On March 31, 2020, a change of control occurred with respect to the Company. Pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement entered into by and among the Clancy Corp. (“Company”), Gaoyang Liu (“Seller”), and Xiangying Meng (“Buyer”) (the “Purchase Agreement”), Seller assigned, transferred and conveyed to Buyer 60,000,000 shares of common stock of Company (“Common Stock”), which represents 64.4% of the total issued and outstanding shares of the Company, for the sum of $285,000. In addition, Seller assigned his rights and interest to outstanding loans made by Seller to the Company in the amount of $55,609 for the face value of such loans.
 
Mr. Meng now owns 67,500,000 shares of common stock of the Company or 72.5% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company. In connection with the transaction, Mr. Liu, the then sole officer and director of the Company resigned in all officer and director capacities from the Company and Mr. Meng was appointed Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company. In addition, Mr. Meng was appointed the sole director of the Company.
 
On April 13, 2020, Clancy Corp. (“Company”) received notification from the National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System that it had approved the Company’s establishment of Shanghai Clancy Enterprise Management Co., Ltd (“Shanghai Clancy”) as a wholly owned foreign entity in Shanghai, Peoples Republic of China (“WOFE”). The initial application was filed by the Company with the PRC governmental agency on November 2, 2019. Shanghai Clancy registered a wholly-owned subsidiary in Beijing on April 24, 2020. Its name is Beijing Clancy Information Technology Co., Ltd. The main business scope is technology development, transfer, consultation, service and promotion.
 
On July 6, 2020, the Nevada Secretary of State approved the Company’s Certificate of Amendment to Articles of Incorporation which effectuated the following corporate action (“Corporate Action”):
 

● | the reverse split of our issued and outstanding common stock, $0.001 par value, on thirty (30) pre-split shares to one (1) post-split share basis. Fractional shares resulting from the action will be rounded up to the nearest whole share. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The above corporate action was adopted by written consent of our sole Director on June 11, 2020, and the sole Director recommended the corporate action be presented to our shareholders for approval. For purposes of the reverse stock split described above, the sole Director also set June 12, 2020 as the record date of such action. On June 12, 2020, our majority stockholder, holding 91.885% of our outstanding voting securities, executed written consent in lieu of a shareholder meeting approving the corporate action.
 
On December 23, 2020, the Company closed a private placement of its common stock to five parties pursuant to which five parties subscribed to 150,000,000 shares of common stock for the sum of $300,000. Of the total offering, Mr. Xiangying Meng, our sole officer and director, subscribed to 75,550,000 shares and paid the Company the sum of $151,100.

Proposed Combinations
 
Presently, under SEC Rule 405 promulgated under the Act, the Company qualifies as a “shell company,” because it has no or nominal assets and no or nominal operations. Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business combination or until it has successfully developed an operating business. The Company intends to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Act for so long as it is subject to those requirements.
 
The Company’s principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business or through the successful development of its business described below.
 
As of the date of this report, the Company has not entered into any definitive agreement with any party, nor have there been any specific discussions with any potential business combination candidate regarding business opportunities for the Company. The Company has unrestricted flexibility in seeking, analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities.
 
Potential Acquisition Structure 
 
If we move forward with acquiring another business for which no assurances can be given, it will be impossible to predict the manner in which the Company may participate in a business opportunity. Specific business opportunities will be reviewed as well as the respective needs and desires of the Company and the promoters of the opportunity and, upon the basis of that review and the relative negotiating strength of the Company and such promoters, the legal structure or method deemed by management to be suitable will be selected. Such structure may include, but is not limited to leases, purchase and sale agreements, licenses, joint ventures and other contractual arrangements. The Company may act directly or indirectly through an interest in a partnership, corporation or other form of organization. Implementing such structure may require the merger, consolidation or reorganization of the Company with other corporations or forms of business organization, and although it is likely, there is no assurance that the Company would be the surviving entity. In addition, the present management, board of directors and stockholders of the Company most likely will not have control of a majority of the voting shares of the Company following a reorganization transaction. As part of such a transaction, the Company’s existing management and directors may resign and new management and directors may be appointed without any vote by stockholders. 
 
It is likely that the Company will acquire its participation in a business opportunity through the issuance of Common Stock or other securities of the Company. Although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted, it should be noted that in certain circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not an acquisition is a so-called “tax free” reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, depends upon the issuance to the stockholders of the acquired company of a controlling interest (i.e. 80% or more) of the common stock of the combined entities immediately following the reorganization. If a transaction were structured to take advantage of these provisions rather than other “tax free” provisions provided under the Internal Revenue Code, the Company’s current stockholders would retain in the aggregate 20% or less of the total issued and outstanding shares. This could result in substantial additional dilution in the equity of those who were stockholders of the Company prior to such reorganization. Any such issuance of additional shares might also be done simultaneously with a sale or transfer of shares representing a controlling interest in the Company by the principal shareholders. The Company does not intend to supply disclosure to shareholders concerning a target company prior to the consummation of a business combination transaction, unless required by applicable law or regulation. The Company will file a current report on Form 8-K, as required, within four business days of a business combination which results in the Company ceasing to be a shell company. This Form 8-K will include complete disclosure of the target company, including audited financial statements.
 
It is anticipated that any new securities issued in any reorganization would be issued in reliance upon exemptions, if any are available, from registration under applicable federal and state securities laws. In some circumstances, however, as a negotiated element of the transaction, the Company may agree to register such securities either at the time the transaction is consummated, or under certain conditions or at specified times thereafter. The issuance of substantial additional securities and their potential sale into any trading market that might develop in the Company’s securities may have a depressive effect upon such market.

The present majority stockholder of the Company will likely not have control of a majority of the voting securities of the Registrant following a reorganization transaction. As part of such a transaction, the Registrant’s sole director may resign and one or more new directors may be appointed by our majority stockholder.
 
In the case of an acquisition, the transaction may be accomplished upon the sole determination of management with the consent of our majority stockholder. In the case of a statutory merger or consolidation directly involving the Company, it will likely be necessary to call a stockholders’ meeting and obtain the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding securities. The necessity to obtain such stockholder approval may result in delay and additional expense in the consummation of any proposed transaction and will also give rise to certain appraisal rights to dissenting stockholders. Most likely, management will seek to structure any such transaction so as not to require stockholder approval.
 
The Company will participate in a business opportunity only after the negotiation and execution of a written agreement. Although the terms of such agreement cannot be predicted, generally such an agreement would require specific representations and warranties by all of the parties thereto, specify certain events of default, detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by each of the parties thereto prior to such closing, outline the manner of bearing costs if the transaction is not closed, set forth remedies upon default, and include miscellaneous other terms normally found in an agreement of that type.
 
It is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs theretofore incurred in the related investigation might not be recoverable. Moreover, because many providers of goods and services require compensation at the time or soon after the goods and services are provided, the inability of the Company to pay until an indeterminate future time may make it impossible to procure such goods and services. 
 
The Company intends to search for a target for a business combination by contacting various sources including, but not limited to, our affiliates, lenders, investment banking firms, private equity funds, consultants and attorneys. The approximate number of persons or entities that will be contacted is unknown and dependent on whether any opportunities are presented by the sources that we contact. It is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs theretofore incurred in the related investigation might not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in the loss to the Registrant of the related costs incurred.
 
Our sole officer and director is engaged in outside business activities. Our sole officer and director anticipates that he will devote very limited time to our business until the acquisition of a successful business opportunity has been identified. The specific amount of time that management will devote to the Company may vary from week to week or even day to day, and therefore the specific amount of time that management will devote to the Company on a weekly basis cannot be ascertained with any level of certainty. In all cases, management intends to spend as much time as is necessary to exercise its fiduciary duties as officer and director of the Company. We expect no significant changes in the number of our employees other than such changes, if any, incident to a business combination.

As such time as it has reached a meaningful level of business, the Company intends to change its status from a “shell company,” however, at this time, no assurances can be given that we will be able to achieve the desired level of business.
