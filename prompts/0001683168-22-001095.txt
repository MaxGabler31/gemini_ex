Item 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
 
History and Operation of the Business
 
Legacy Card Company, LLC (“Legacy”) was formed as a California limited liability company on August 29, 2001. On April 18, 2005, Legacy converted to a Nevada corporation. On November 10, 2005, Legacy merged with Cardiff Lexington Corp (formerly Cardiff International, Inc.) (“Cardiff Lexington”, the “Company”), a publicly traded Colorado corporation. On August 27, 2014, Cardiff Lexington redomiciled to Florida.
 
In the first quarter of 2013, Cardiff Lexington was restructured into a holding company that began targeting the acquisition of undervalued, niche companies with high growth potential, income-producing commercial real estate properties, or high return investments, with the goal of generating the net income required to support a consistent dividend to our shareholders. The reason for this strategy was to protect our shareholders by acquiring profitable small- to minimum-sized businesses with little to no debt, and provide financing and management support to enhance their ability to provide acceptable returns to investors. New classes of preferred stock have been and may continue to be created to streamline voting rights, avoid debt, and acquire new businesses. By December 31, 2020, we had acquired ten businesses. Four of the acquired businesses were merged into two, one was discontinued, and two were sold during 2020. Accordingly, we currently operate the following four businesses, each as a separate subsidiary:
 

· | We Three, LLC, which operates under the name “Affordable Housing Initiative” or “AHI,” was acquired in April 2014. AHI is located in Maryville, Tennessee. AHI acquires both mobile homes and mobile home parks offering an alternative to traditional housing. Their mobile home business is a popular option for a homeowner wishing to avoid large down payments, expensive maintenance costs, monthly mortgage payments and high property taxes. If bad credit is an issue preventing people from purchasing a traditional house, AHI will provide a financial leasing option with “O” interest on the lease providing a “lease to own” option for their family home. Most homes are 3 bedroom/2bath homes making the dream of owning a home possible.

· | Edge View Properties, Inc., was acquired in July 2014 (“Edge View”). Edge View consists of 30 prime acres of land; 23.5 acres zoned MDR (Medium Density Residential) with 12 lots already platted and 48 lots zoned HDR (High Density Residential), 4 acres of dedicated river front property zoned for recreation on the Salmon River, Idaho’s premier whitewater river and 2.5 acres zoned for commercial use.

Cardiff Lexington divested its holdings in the food services sector: Repicci's Italian Ice and Gelato and Romeo's New York Style Pizza. The companies’ restaurant franchise operations have been hard hit by the economic pressure of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent directives and responses to this crisis taken by the federal, state, and local government. In light of current circumstances arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, management is continuing to evaluate alternatives to mitigate the negative effects of the pandemic on the Company and its shareholders. Cardiff Lexington Board of Directors has narrowed its forward focus to acquisitions in the financial services, healthcare and real estate sectors.
 
Cardiff Lexington is a diversified holding company that operates much like a cooperative, leveraging proven management in private companies that become subsidiaries under our umbrella. Our current emphasis is on the financial services, healthcare, and real estate sectors. Our platform provides an “Equity Exit or Equity Capitalization” strategy for acquisitions as well as a diversified investment platform for investors that is intended to mitigate risk. Our “Buy and Build” strategy seeks niche companies which complement existing subsidiaries. Our acquisition strategy is driven by structure, transaction value, alignment, resources and return on investment. Our acquisition strategy is not limited by geographic location, and is focused on proven management teams, attractive markets, and historical operating margins. We target acquisitions of mature, high growth, niche companies. Cardiff Lexington’s strategy identifies and empowers select, income-producing, middle market private businesses and commercial real estate properties.

The target company’s management team typically maintains control of the day-to-day operations. Acquisitions become standalone autonomous subsidiaries that gain the advantages of a publicly traded company without losing their independent management control. Management enjoys the advantage of improved valuation, liquidity, synergies, and support, along with diversification and asset appreciation through collective subsidiary performance. Diversification and pooled resources leverage value and mitigate risk.
 
Cardiff Lexington provides these companies both 1) the enhanced ability to raise money for operations or expansion, and 2) an equity exit and liquidity strategy for the owner, heirs, and/or Investors.
 
For investors, Cardiff Lexington provides a diversified lower risk to protect and safely enhance their investment by continually adding assets and holdings.
 
Cardiff Lexington employs a merge, acquire, and hold strategy to maximize value and potential of private, often family run, enterprises while providing diversification and risk mitigation for all shareholders.
 
Cardiff Lexington is led by strong and talented roster of executives and advisors providing expert acquisition, market guidance and added value for subsidiaries and investors.
 
Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic
 
The outbreak of a novel coronavirus throughout the world, including the United States, during early calendar year 2020 has caused widespread business and economic disruption through mandated and voluntary business closings and restrictions on the movement and activities of people (“COVID-19 Pandemic”). We are subject to risks and uncertainties as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for discussion on results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Company's business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict, as the response to the COVID-19 Pandemic is rapidly evolving in many countries, including the United States and other markets where the Company operates. It is expected that many of the Company's customers and suppliers will continue to be impacted by these closings and restrictions which could materially and adversely affect demand for our products, our ability to obtain or deliver inventory or services, and our ability to collect accounts receivables as customers face higher liquidity and solvency risk. Furthermore, capital markets and economies worldwide have also been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic, and it is possible that economic distress will continue in many markets for the foreseeable future. Such economic disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business. Policymakers around the world have responded with fiscal and monetary policy actions to support the economy. The magnitude and overall effectiveness of these actions remains uncertain.
 
The Company’s restaurant franchise operations have been severely and adversely affected by the economic pressure of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent directives and responses to the crisis taken by the federal, state, and local governments. In light of circumstances arising from the COVID-19 Pandemic, management divested of all food service operations and is continuing to evaluate the Company’s current operations and acquisition opportunities to mitigate the impact of the pandemic and maximize shareholder value.
 
The decrease in revenue in 2020 is primarily attributable to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Both the affordable housing and financial services segments of the economy have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 Pandemic, due mainly to the significant increase in unemployment, which directly affected our subsidiaries prospects and customer base. We believe the segment of the population which was adversely affected by unemployment overlaps significantly with the customer base of our affordable housing and financial services businesses and, consequently, these customers were no longer able to afford our services.
 
Human Capital
 
Collectively, Cardiff Lexington and its subsidiaries employ approximately 37 employees and anticipates hiring additional personnel with new acquisitions. We believe that we have good relations with our employees and our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining group or agreement. We believe our ability to attract and retain employees is a key to a successful acquisition strategy.

Competition
 
We are a small capitalization holding company that seeks to enable businesses to take advantage of the potential access to capital markets provided by affiliation with a publicly traded company. Cardiff Lexington began targeting the acquisition of undervalued, niche companies with high growth potential, income-producing commercial real estate properties, and high return investments, all designed to generate sufficient earnings to pay a consistent dividend to our shareholders. The strategy is intended to mitigate risk to shareholders by building a diversified portfolio of profitable small- to minimum-sized businesses with little to no debt, seeking support with both financing and management that had the ability to offer a return to investors. We will continue to establish new classes of preferred stock to streamline voting rights, negate debt, and acquire new businesses in the financial services and healthcare, and real estate sectors.
 
We face significant competition in the markets in which our subsidiaries operate. Platinum Tax and Key Tax have significant competition in most of the markets in which they operate from other local tax resolution entities and from larger national companies. AHI has significant competition from other private companies in the area and a few real estate investment trusts, which compete in the manufactured housing communities Edgeview competes in the highly competitive housing industry. Some of our subsidiaries’ competitors may have advantages over us in terms of greater operational, financial, management or other resources in particular markets or in general. Our market position depends on our financing, development and operation capabilities, reputation, experience and track record. There can be no assurance that our current or potential competitors will not offer products or services comparable or superior to those that our subsidiaries offer. Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced profit margins and loss of market share.
