Item 1. Business
The Company (formerly Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp.) was incorporated in Delaware on September 24, 2013 as a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. On February 24, 2015, the Company consummated a business combination (the “Business Combination”), pursuant to which the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of School Bus Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation (“School Bus Holdings” or “SBH”) from The Traxis Group, B.V. (the “Seller”). The total purchase price was paid in a combination of cash in the amount of $100.0 million and 12,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, $0.0001 par value (the “Common Stock”), valued at $120.0 million.
In connection with the closing of the Business Combination, the Company changed its name from Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. to Blue Bird Corporation. Unless expressly stated otherwise in this Report, Blue Bird Corporation is referred to as "Blue Bird," the "Company," "we," "our" or "us," and includes its consolidated subsidiaries.
In May 2016, the Seller, ASP BB Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“ASP”), and the Company, entered into an agreement pursuant to which the Seller agreed to sell the 12,000,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company owned by Seller (the “Transaction Shares”) to ASP. ASP acquired 7,000,000 Transaction Shares at an initial closing on June 3, 2016 for an amount in cash equal to $10.10 per share and 5,000,000 Transaction Shares at a second closing on June 8, 2016 for an amount in cash equal to $11.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $125.7 million. There were no proceeds to the Company from this transaction.
The following discussion of our business describes the business historically operated by School Bus Holdings and its subsidiaries under the “Blue Bird” name as an independent enterprise prior to the Business Combination and as subsidiaries of Blue Bird Corporation after the Business Combination.

Overview
We are the leading independent designer and manufacturer of school buses, with more than 592,000 buses sold since our formation in 1927.
We review and present our business in two operating segments, which are also our reportable segments: (i) the Bus segment, which involves the design, engineering, manufacture and sale of school buses and extended warranties; and (ii) the Parts segment, which includes the sale of replacement bus parts. Financial information is reported on the basis that it is used internally by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) in evaluating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to segments. The President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company has been identified as the CODM. Management evaluates the segments based primarily upon revenues and gross profit. Refer to Note 11, Segment Information, to the Company’s consolidated financial statements for additional financial information regarding our reportable segments including the primary geographic areas in which we earn revenues.
Throughout this Report, we refer to the fiscal year ended October 1, 2022 as “fiscal 2022,” the fiscal year ended October 2, 2021 as “fiscal 2021” and the fiscal year ended October 3, 2020 as “fiscal 2020.” There were 52 weeks in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, and there were 53 weeks in fiscal 2020.
Our performance in recent years has been driven by the implementation of repeatable processes focused on product initiatives, continuous improvement of both competitiveness and manufacturing flexibility, and lowering our cost of capital, as described below:
1.Alternative Power Initiatives — We believe Blue Bird is the clear leader in alternative powered school buses (defined as buses that do not operate on diesel fuel) and we continue to introduce new products to support growing consumer demand for these products.
•Propane — In fiscal 2012, we entered into our exclusive relationship with Ford Motor Company and Roush Clean Tech to offer propane powered Type C school buses. We have continued to lead the industry with this offering.
◦We launched the industry’s first .05g/bhp-hr nitrogen oxide ("NOx") propane engine in fiscal 2017. This engine operates four times cleaner than the current emission standard and is significantly better for the environment than competitors' published offerings.
◦We launched the industry’s first .02g/bhp-hr NOx propane engine in August 2018. This engine complies with Ultra Low NOx classification and has an emissions level at 10% of the current standard and competitive offerings.
•Compressed Natural Gas ("CNG") — Blue Bird was the first Original Equipment Manufacturer ("OEM") to introduce a CNG powertrain for the Rear Engine Type D bus using Cummins Westport technology.
•Electric — Blue Bird is the first major school bus manufacturer to market, and presently the clear leader in, electric bus sales among all major OEMs. We have partnered with Cummins, one of our long-standing engine suppliers, to design and develop our electric vehicle offering. We offer electric solutions in both our Type C and Type D buses and commenced delivery to customers in fiscal 2018. With demand and interest growing quickly, we have taken, and will continue to take, actions to expand our electric vehicle production capacity.
•Gasoline — In fiscal 2016, we re-introduced gasoline engines in school buses, again using a Ford engine and transmission and a Roush Clean Tech fuel delivery. This product has been successful and continues to grow the Blue Bird customer base. 
2.Diesel — Blue Bird works closely with Cummins on diesel engines, which continue to be the power source for the majority of school buses sold.
3.Product Initiatives — We continue to update and improve our products.
•During fiscal 2021, we successfully launched the all-new, Ford 7.3L V8 engine in our gasoline and propane powered offerings. 
4.Manufacturing and Process Initiatives — We have commenced a number of initiatives to continue to build customer loyalty, reduce costs, and enhance competitiveness.
•We launched our state-of-the-art 60,000 square foot paint facility in July 2019. Using robotic technology, the paint facility is designed to paint a bus three times faster than can be done manually, with a higher paint transfer rate and consistent, outstanding coverage. In keeping with Blue Bird's going green, the facility features a zero-to-landfill design. All paint over spray is captured, dried and sent to a power generation plant to be used as fuel.
•During fiscal 2022, we began to repurpose an existing building for the dedicated assembly of electric chassis production that is expected to increase our volume capacity in April 2023.
•We made investments in, and implemented process changes to, certain of our production areas, including the air conditioner installation department, that increased daily throughput by 20% to 50% within those areas.
5.Access to Capital — We refinanced our term debt on substantially better terms in December 2016 (the "Credit Agreement"). Since then, the Credit Agreement has been amended on six different occasions and as of the date of this filing, provides total revolving commitments of $90.0 million. Additional details and discussion of these amendments can be found in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of Item 7. "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Report.
On December 15, 2021, we issued and sold through a private placement an aggregate 4,687,500 shares of our common stock at $16.00 per share. The approximate $74.8 million of net proceeds that we received from this transaction were used to repay outstanding revolving borrowings as required by the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement (defined below), which increased the available borrowing capacity of the Revolving Credit Facility (defined below) that could be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, investments in technologies or businesses, operating expenses and capital expenditures. Refer to Note 13, Stockholders' Equity (Deficit), to the Company’s consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this transaction.
Additionally, on November 16, 2021, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 that allows the Company to sell up to $200.0 million in the aggregate of any combination of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt securities and/or units from time to time in one or more offerings.
Our management believes that Blue Bird is in a leading position in the industry due to our range of alternative power offerings and our strong diesel offering. We believe that our alternative power options will continue to capture market share in the industry as customers realize benefits on the total cost of ownership and as the adoption of green technology gains traction. Furthermore, we believe that our product, process, and manufacturing initiatives are appropriately aligned with our long-term objectives.
As a result of the concentration of Blue Bird’s sales in the school bus industry in the U.S. and Canada, our operations are affected by national, state, and local economic and political factors that impact spending for public and, to a lesser extent, private education. Unlike the discretionary portion of school budgets, the offering of school bus services is typically viewed as a mandatory part of the public infrastructure across the U.S. and Canada, ensuring that funding for new school buses receives some level of priority in all economic climates. All 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the 13 Canadian Provinces and Territories have fleets of school buses in operation.
Bus Segment
Our buses are sold through an extensive network of over 70 U.S. and Canadian dealer locations that, in their territories, are exclusive to our Company on Type C and Type D school buses. We also sell directly to major fleet operators, the U.S. Government, state governments and authorized dealers in certain limited foreign countries.
In fiscal 2022, we sold 6,822 buses throughout the world. Refer to “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for discussion of our unit volumes.
Approximately 97% of our buses sold in fiscal 2022 were sold through distributors and dealers. The Company holds no equity or control position in any of the distributors or dealers.
We design, engineer, manufacture, and sell three types of buses: (i) Type C school buses, (ii) Type D school buses, and (iii) specialty buses. Each of our Type C and Type D buses is manufactured and assembled on its own dedicated purpose-built chassis in Fort Valley, Georgia. Regardless of specifications, all school bus bodies that we manufacture include our signature 14-gauge one-piece steel bows roof system, complemented by a rugged and sturdy floor structure.

Specialty buses include school buses that are converted to suit applications required by the U.S. Government, state and local governments, and various customers for commercial and export markets. 
The Blue Bird Micro Bird by Girardin Type A bus is produced through Micro Bird Holdings, Inc., an unconsolidated Canadian joint venture with Girardin Minibus JV Inc. (“Micro Bird”), and is sold through our dealer network. This is a smaller bus than the Type C or Type D bus and is produced on a traditional chassis provided by either Ford or GM or on an electric chassis provided by a smaller supplier.
Parts Segment

Parts are key for routine maintenance, replacement of parts that are damaged in service, and replacement of parts that suffer from wear and tear throughout the useful life of the vehicle.
In fiscal 2022, parts sales represented 9.6% of Company net sales.
We maintain a parts distribution center in Delaware, Ohio that fills demand for our Company specific and all-makes parts. Additional demand for parts is fulfilled by drop ship and direct sales. To fulfill demand for parts that are not maintained at the distribution center, we are linked to approximately 40 suppliers that ship directly to dealers and independent service centers.
Our network of dealers and authorized repair centers operate over 200 locations to support the fleet across the U.S. and Canada, the majority of which are owned by independent operators, to complement their primary locations. Field service engineers provide technical support to our dealer network. At the end of fiscal 2022, service engineers had an average of over 25 years of experience with our Company and are strategically placed throughout the U.S. and Canada to better serve both dealers and end-customers. The network leverages our parts inventory, technical training, and online warranty network to address customer service needs.
Our Industry
The school bus serves a critical role in the U.S. and Canadian education systems. In normal non-pandemic years, approximately half of the U.S. student population rides a school bus. School buses are distinguished from other types of buses by design characteristics associated with increased safety as mandated by federal, state, and municipal regulations.
Our management has developed a forecasting model using R.L. Polk vehicle registration data, population of school age children forecasts from the National Center for Education Statistics and bus ridership data collected and published by School Transportation News. Our management utilizes this and other models to assess historical experience and to predict demand for school buses in future periods. The ability to purchase new buses to fulfill predicted demand, however, is based on the assumption that funds will be available through property taxes and other state and federal sources.
The U.S. and Canadian school bus industry for Type C and Type D buses has averaged approximately 30,700 unit sales annually between 1985 and 2022. Unit sales for 2022 are projected to be about 23,900, a decrease of 14.0% when compared with 2021. Both fiscal years were significantly impacted by supply chain constraints that resulted in shortages of critical components that hindered the production of units across the school bus industry to meet strong demand for buses.

Source: Historical registration data are based on R.L. Polk vehicle registration data.
The low point in the industry occurred in 2011, at approximately 23,800 units, and was the result of the decline in the U.S. economy and, in particular, the collapse of the housing market in 2008 and 2009. Property taxes are the primary source of funds for school bus purchases and were impacted in the 2010-2011 period as a result of the substantial recession in the U.S. economy in general, and housing market in particular, preceding and during that period.
The school bus industry fully recovered from the downturn in 2010-2011 and from 2016 to 2019 had been operating at levels approximately 10% higher than the long-term average, supported by positive demographic trends, pent-up demand from several years of below-trend bus sales, and a growing tax base for education-related spending. In 2020, countermeasures taken to battle the COVID-19 pandemic included virtual and hybrid schooling in many jurisdictions throughout the U.S. and Canada. The uncertainty of when and how schools would open materially affected demand within the Type C and Type D school bus industry in the second half 
of the Company's fiscal 2020 that continued into the first half of fiscal 2021. However, demand for Type C and Type D school buses strengthened substantially throughout 2021 as COVID-19 vaccines were administered and many school jurisdictions returned to in-person learning environments. Nonetheless, subsequent supply chain shortages for certain components, such as microchips and products containing resins, that are critical to the manufacture of school buses, depressed sales during the latter half of fiscal 2021 and throughout fiscal 2022. Although management began to see slight improvements in the challenges caused by supply chain disruptions towards the latter part of fiscal 2022, which are currently expected to continue into the fiscal year ending September 30, 2023 ("fiscal 2023"), future supply chain challenges could continue to hinder the Company's ability to produce sufficient units to meet the strong current demand for school buses.
Our management believes, based on our models, that Type C and Type D school bus registrations will return to a similar level as has been experienced over recent pre-pandemic years (2016-2019) once the supply chain constraints are fully addressed. We believe that (i) since the start of the pandemic and continuing through the subsequent period that has been significantly impacted by supply chain disruptions (i.e., the cumulative period beginning in the last half of fiscal 2020 and continuing through fiscal 2022), the industry has been operating below its historical long-term average of approximately 30,700 unit sales per year, (ii) there are over 166,000 buses in the U.S. and Canadian fleets that have been in service for 15 or more years, and (iii) the population of school age children is increasing.
Local property and municipal tax receipts are key drivers of school district transportation budgets. Budgets for school bus purchases are directly related to property tax receipts. Home prices have risen in recent years as home-buyers have taken advantage of historically low mortgage rates and thus, put additional pressure on housing inventories. However, the forecast for continued appreciation in housing prices is uncertain due to, among others, recent rises in mortgage rates and significant inflationary pressures that have reduced consumer purchasing power. Nonetheless, such challenges are not expected to have a significant effect on property tax receipts in the near-term due to the lag that occurs in tax authorities reflecting declining home prices in property tax invoices, and school transportation budgets are expected to directly benefit from larger municipal spending budgets. We believe that incremental demand may be achieved as a result of (i) the average age of a school bus in service and (ii) an increased student population (based on information from the most recent National Center of Education Studies Projection of Education Statistics, we expect total student enrollment in the U.S. to increase by 2%, or 1 million students, from 2016 to 2028).
In addition to strong property tax collections, additional funding for school buses is being made available in connection with the Volkswagen ("VW") settlement with the U.S. Government in regard to emissions violations. Of the $14.7 billion in settlement funds, $2.9 billion was allocated to the VW Diesel Emissions Environmental Mitigation Trust for state government projects to reduce NOx output from ten categories; school buses are one of the ten categories. Over $440 million of the $2.9 billion has been awarded thus far and many more millions are under review by state agencies but are not yet publicly available. Of the grants awarded, over $160 million has been issued to school bus projects and several states are continuing and/or increasing their focus on similar projects. Given the historical trend and future projections, we expect as much as $1 billion in additional VW settlement funds may ultimately be allocated, or have a high probability of allocation, to the purchases of "cleaner running" school buses through 2028.

Beyond the VW funds, traditional grant programs are expected to continue, including the U.S Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") National Clean Diesel Program and its various state versions. These are valuable programs for potential propane and CNG engine platform sales, as annual budgets for these programs usually range from $40.0 to $100.0 million. Additionally, in November 2020, the Bezos Earth Fund awarded a grant of $100 million, to be disbursed over a five-year period, to the World Resources Institute, a global research organization that focuses on climate initiatives, among others. A portion of this grant will be used to accelerate the adoption of zero emission school buses in the U.S.
In mid-November 2021, the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act ("IIJA") was signed into law. The IIJA allocates $5 billion of federal funds to help local school jurisdictions purchase zero and low emission school buses over the next five years. Specifically, $2.5 billion of the funds are allocated solely for the purchase of electric powered buses, while the remaining $2.5 billion of funds are allocated for the purchase of low and zero emission school buses, including buses that are propane, CNG or electric powered. In October 2022, the EPA announced the awarding of approximately $913 million from the IIJA as part of the 2022 Clean School Bus Rebate Program. These awards will allow nearly 400 school districts to purchase over 2,400 zero and low emission school buses, of which 95% will be electric. The Company and its dealer network is actively pursuing converting as many of those awards as possible to sales orders in the relatively near future. Management estimates, based on the Company's historical market share as well as the number of school bus manufacturers competing for these orders, that the Company's share could approximate 25% or more.
Finally, in August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act ("IRA") was signed into law. The IRA authorizes a $369 billion investment in energy security and combating climate change. This funding includes $1 billion in grants for clean Class 6 and 7 heavy-duty vehicles, up to $40,000 in tax credits for zero-emission commercial vehicles, up to $100,000 in tax credits for heavy-duty charging infrastructure, and $2 billion for grants to support electric and fuel cell manufacturing.
We believe our leadership in alternative power options, coupled with this external funding, provides a strong foundation to continue to increase sales of our propane, gasoline, CNG and electric powered bus platforms.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe that our competitive strengths are derived from the following factors:
Reputation for safety, product quality/reliability/durability, and drivability. Our longevity and reputation in the school bus industry have made us an iconic American brand. We are the only principal manufacturer with chassis and body production specifically designed for school bus applications in the U.S. and the only school bus company to offer as a standard feature compliance with industry recognized safety tests - Altoona Testing, Colorado Rack Test and the Kentucky Pole Test - as a standard specification across our entire product line.
Alternative powered bus leadership. We believe we are the market leader in electric, propane, gasoline, and CNG powered buses, having sold approximately 65% of all alternative powered school buses from fiscal 2013 through fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2022, we sold 3,974 propane, gasoline, CNG, and electric powered buses, an increase of 18% when compared with the prior year, as market demand for alternative powered buses remained robust. To maintain our leadership position, we continue to expand the available features requested by our customers and during fiscal 2022, added a hydraulic braking system with electronic stability control and a fuel-fired heater for cold-weather markets to our Type C electric powered bus offering.
Innovative product leadership. We believe we have consistently led the school bus industry with innovative product leadership through several industry firsts, including the first Type D CNG powered school bus, the first unique school bus chassis, and the first OEM-manufactured propane powered bus. In fiscal 2016, years ahead of our competition, we launched the industry's first gasoline powered Type C bus (utilizing an exclusive Ford and Roush CleanTech powertrain) and we were first-to-market with electronic stability control. In fiscal 2018, we sold our first Type D electric vehicles and in fiscal 2019 we introduced our Type C electric vehicle. In fiscal 2022, we sold 269 Type C and Type D electric vehicles. 
Strong distribution model. We have built an extensive, experienced network of over 70 dealer locations to distribute our buses across the U.S. and Canada, and during recent years have significantly enhanced our relationships with large fleet operators. Our dealers have an average tenure of more than 32 years with us and do not sell competing Type C or Type D school bus products in the areas assigned to them by us. 
Highly-skilled and committed workforce. We benefit from a highly-skilled, committed hourly workforce of approximately 1,375 employees who support our customized assembly operations at our 900,000 square foot integrated chassis manufacturing and body assembly facility and 340,000 square foot component fabrication facility. Our employees are trained to maximize production efficiency by following customized processes developed by us. 
Strong management team. We are led by a highly experienced and committed management team with an established track record in the U.S. and Canadian school bus and heavy-duty vehicle industries. 
Sales Volume
In fiscal 2022, we sold 6,822 Type C and Type D buses, including 6,496 school buses, 174 commercial buses, 4 export buses and 148 Government Services Administration ("GSA") buses. Our Type C school bus accounted for 77% of unit sales and our Type D school bus accounted for 18% of unit sales. Commercial, GSA and export buses, which can be ordered with either the Type C or Type D chassis, accounted for the remaining 5% of unit sales. 
Our Dealer Network
In fiscal 2022, we sold approximately 97% of our vehicles through our U.S. and Canadian dealer network, currently consisting of over 70 dealer locations that, in their territories, are exclusive to us with Type C and D school buses. School buses sold in the U.S. and Canada through our dealer network are purchased by school districts and private schools, as well as small and medium size contractors that provide services to school districts on a fee basis. Bus purchases and contractor fees are funded through local school district budgets. Purchases of school buses are typically made through a bid process at the district or state level, with dealers coordinating this process. Dealers develop collaborative relationships with school districts, district transportation directors, and key officials in their states. 
Our dealers have access to financing through a financing product maintained by an independent third party, Huntington Distribution Finance, Inc. ("Huntington," formerly TCF Inventory Finance, Inc.). We do not assume any balance sheet risk with respect to this type of financing and do not receive any direct economic benefit from Huntington. 
Other Distribution Channels
Fleet Operators. We also sell school buses directly to large national fleets that span multiple states and such sales are managed internally by our National Account Sales Team. 
Export Dealers. We regularly monitor opportunities to sell our Type C and Type D buses in either school bus or other configurations in certain limited international markets and typically sell these products through dealers assigned to those territories.
U.S. Government; Other Specialty Sales. We also sell buses through our U.S. GSA contract, an expedited procurement procedure designed to meet the needs of bus customers authorized to purchase through the GSA contracting offices, including the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army, Homeland Security and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. This full line of bus models is configured for adult or school bus use. In addition to the base GSA specifications, we offer several additional configurations to provide a wide range of passenger capacities and optional features. We also offer a full line of activity bus and Multi-Function School Activity Bus (“MFSAB”) products. With varying vehicle sizes, capacities, power choices, and engine types, our bus options enable our customers to tailor their transportation solutions to their specific needs, be it transporting a church congregation or shuttling workers to job sites.
Government Contracts 
As a U.S. government contractor, we are subject to specific regulations and requirements as mandated by our contracts. These regulations include Federal Acquisition Regulations, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations, and the Code of Federal Regulations. We are also subject to routine audits and investigations by U.S. government agencies such as the Defense Contract Management Agency and Defense Contract Audit Agency. These agencies review and assess compliance with contractual requirements, cost structure, cost accounting, and applicable laws, regulations, and standards.
A portion of our existing U.S. government contracts extend over multiple years and are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations. In addition, our U.S. government contracts generally permit the contracting government agency to terminate the contract, in whole or in part, either for the convenience of the government or for default based on our failure to perform under the terms of the contract.
Suppliers
We purchase our engine and transmission components on a single-source basis from major OEMs with sophisticated engineering, production and logistics capabilities, as reflected in the table below:

Component | OEM Supplier 
Diesel and CNG engines | Cummins Inc. 
Diesel emissions kits | Cummins Inc. 
Electric powertrains and battery systems | Cummins Inc. 
Propane and gasoline engines and transmissions | Ford Motor Company 
Transmissions | Allison Transmission
Propane and gasoline fueling kits | Roush CleanTech 

Our purchasing department continually works to improve our purchasing processes by rationalizing the supplier base and by implementing improved control processes. We regularly perform supplier audits and, when necessary, will meet with under-performing suppliers in order to enhance performance. At October 1, 2022, we had in place long-term supply contracts (addressing both component price and supply) covering nearly 83% of the value of our purchases from suppliers, including long-term agreements with our major single-source suppliers.
As a result of ongoing supply chain disruptions that began in the latter half of fiscal 2021 and continued throughout fiscal 2022, we have experienced significant supplier shortages of critical components, which have prevented the Company from initiating or completing, as applicable, the production process for certain units that were otherwise scheduled to be delivered to customers during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022. For further details and discussion about the impact of these supply chain disruptions, refer to the "Impacts of COVID-19 and Subsequent Supply Chain Constraints on Our Business" section of Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."
Competition
The U.S. and Canadian school bus industry is highly competitive. Our two principal competitors are Thomas Built Bus and IC Bus. Thomas Built Bus is a subsidiary of Daimler Trucks North America and IC Bus is a subsidiary of Navistar International. 
We compete primarily on the basis of product diversification, school bus innovation, safety, quality, durability and drivability of our products, the scope and strength of our dealer network and price. As our principal competitors are parts of larger corporations, our competitors may have greater access to financial capital, human resources, and business opportunities. Such access, in turn, may be used by such companies to compete with us and others in the industry.
Facilities
Our corporate headquarters are located in Macon, Georgia. Our Bus segment operates a fabrication plant and an integrated chassis manufacturing and body assembly plant in Fort Valley, Georgia, where components for Type C, Type D, and specialty buses are manufactured and assembled. Our Parts segment operates a parts distribution center located in Delaware, Ohio. We own our facilities in Fort Valley, Georgia (approximately 1.5 million square feet). We lease facilities in Macon, Georgia (approximately 0.3 million square feet) and Delaware, Ohio (approximately 0.1 million square feet). Our Micro Bird joint venture leases its facility (0.2 million square feet) in Drummondville, Quebec, Canada.
Intellectual Property and Technology
We seek trademark protection in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. where available and when appropriate. Among other trademarks, we have registered trademark rights in the principal names and designs used by us and Micro Bird in the U.S., Canada and elsewhere. We use these registered marks in connection with all aspects of our branding. However, we also rely on a number of significant unregistered trademarks and other unregistered intellectual property in the day-to-day operation of our business. Without the protections afforded by registration, our ability to protect and use our trademarks and other unregistered intellectual property may be limited and could negatively affect our business.
In addition to trademarks, we rely heavily on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. For example, significant aspects of our product designs, manufacturing processes and cost containment steps are based on unpatented trade secrets and know-how. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, suppliers and other commercial partners. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data, designs and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our suppliers or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how.
Government Regulation
Our products must satisfy various legal, environmental, health and safety requirements at federal, state and municipal levels. Compliance with such requirements adds to the costs that must be incurred in order to manufacture a school bus. Failure to comply with such requirements could lead to substantial additional regulatory costs.
At the federal level, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (“FMVSS”) govern the safety of all motor vehicles sold for use in the U.S. More than half of the FMVSS regulations apply to school buses. For example, federal regulations require school buses to be painted “school bus yellow” and to be equipped with specific warning and safety devices. School buses are also built with the body on top of chassis frame rails. This so-called “high floor” construction moves the passenger compartment above the typical automotive “crash zone” and therefore provides an added measure of safety should a collision occur. Steel rollover cages and heavy-duty bumpers are designed to provide incremental protection, in contrast with standard transit buses with “low floor” construction that offer lower curb height access with limited or no steel reinforcement.
After a school bus is sold, regulation of the operation of the school bus becomes the responsibility of the state in which it operates. Today, each state has its own rules and regulations pertaining to the manufacture, design, operation and safety of the school buses operated in their jurisdictions. As a result, we cannot manufacture to a single set of specifications, but rather must assure that each manufactured bus conforms to the specifications of the particular jurisdiction in which it will be operated.
We must also consider the rules and regulations of foreign jurisdictions. In Canada, where our Micro Bird joint venture operates, 
school buses are governed by the Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Regulations. These regulations are patterned after the FMVSS regulations, although differences do exist between the two regulatory systems.
Seasonality
Historically, our business has been highly seasonal with school districts buying their new school buses so that they will be available for use on the first day of the school year, typically in mid-August to early September. This has resulted in our third and fourth fiscal quarters becoming our two busiest quarters, the latter ending on the Saturday closest to September 30. Our quarterly results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity have historically been, and are likely to be in future periods, impacted by seasonal patterns. Working capital has historically been a significant use of cash during the first fiscal quarter due to planned shutdowns and a significant source of cash generation in the fourth fiscal quarter.
As a result of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent supply chain constraints, seasonality and working capital trends have become unpredictable. Accordingly, seasonality and variations from historical seasonality have impacted the comparison of working capital and liquidity results between fiscal periods.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment and health and safety, including those regulating the following: soil, surface water and groundwater contamination; the generation, storage, handling, use, disposal and transportation of hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of materials, including greenhouse gases (“GHG”) into the environment; and the health and safety of our employees. We are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain operations. We have taken various steps to comply with these numerous and sometimes complex laws, regulations and permits. Compliance with environmental requirements historically has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. We have made, and will continue to make, capital and other expenditures pursuant to such requirements. If we violate or fail to comply with these requirements, we could be subject to fines, penalties, enforcement actions or lawsuits.
For additional information regarding potential environmental issues at Blue Bird’s Fort Valley, Georgia facility, refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors - Risk Factors Relating to Our Business and Industry - Environmental obligations and liabilities could have a negative impact on our financial condition, cash flows and profitability."
Environmental laws, regulations, and permits and the enforcement thereof, change frequently and have become more stringent over time. Among other things, more rigorous GHG emission requirements are in various stages of development. For example, the U.S. EPA has promulgated the GHG Reporting Rule, which requires reporting of GHG data and other relevant information from large sources and suppliers in the U.S., and the GHG Tailoring Rule, which requires certain facilities with significant GHG emissions to obtain emissions permits under the authority of the Clean Air Act (typically limited to only the largest stationary sources of GHG). The U.S. Congress has also considered imposing additional restrictions on GHG emissions. Any additional regulation of GHG emissions by either the U.S. Congress and/or the U.S. EPA could include a cap-and-trade system, technology mandate, emissions tax, reporting requirement, or other program and could subject us to significant costs, including those relating to emission credits, pollution control equipment, monitoring, and reporting, as well as increased energy and raw material prices.
Our facilities and operations could in the future be subject to regulations related to climate change and climate change itself may also have some impact on the Company’s operations. However, these impacts are currently uncertain and the Company cannot presently predict the nature and scope of those impacts.
Research and Development

Warranty
We provide warranties on virtually all of the buses and parts we sell. Warranties are offered for specific periods of time and mileage, and vary depending upon the type of product and the geographic location of its sale. Pursuant to these warranties, we will repair, replace, or adjust certain parts on a bus that are defective in factory-supplied materials or workmanship during the specified warranty period. In addition to the costs associated with this warranty coverage provided on our vehicles, we also incur costs as a result of field service actions (i.e., safety recalls and service bulletins), and customer satisfaction actions. Component suppliers, in particular major component suppliers such as engines and transmissions, provide warranties on their products. 
Legal Proceedings
We are engaged in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business. Although no assurances can be given about the final outcome of pending legal proceedings, at the present time our management does not believe that the resolution or outcome of any of our pending legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. 
Human Capital Management
Blue Bird delivers market value to stockholders through a people centered human capital strategy, critical to our ability to deliver on our strategic plans. Our success in delivering high quality products and solutions for our customers is only achievable through the talent, expertise, and dedication of our workforce.
Attraction, Development, and Retention
We recognize that attracting, developing and retaining skilled talent and promoting a diverse and inclusive culture are essential to maintaining our leadership position in the markets we serve. We offer employees resources to continuously improve their skills and performance with the goal of further cultivating the diverse, entrepreneurial talent to fill key positions. We seek people who are proactive and dedicated, demonstrate an ownership mindset and share our commitment to the pursuit of operational excellence. We continue to make significant investments in talent development and recognize that the growth and development of our employees is essential for our continued success. Employee training and development programs are extensive and comprehensive, including professional and technical skills training, compliance training, leadership development and management training.
We view the diversity of our employees as a strength to better serve our customers and communities. We also believe the diversity of our workforce enables us to attract new talent, keeps our employees engaged and productive, and advances ideas reflecting the diversity of our employees' backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. To that end, we have taken various actions to enhance diversity, including partnering with organizations that can support our efforts to identify and recruit talented and diverse candidates.
We aim to cultivate an inclusive culture that enables employees to feel connected to Blue Bird's three foundational objectives (Care, Delight, Deliver) while being valued for their contributions. One of the ways in which we seek to promote an inclusive work environment is by supporting the establishment of employee resource groups. These groups allow for collaboration and serve as an open forum for networking, professional development, and mentoring. We are committed to our efforts to maintain a work environment that is professional, inclusive, and free from discrimination and harassment. 
The Company’s benefit packages support employee physical, emotional and financial well-being. Employee satisfaction and engagement are measured through periodic surveys.
Health and Safety
Safety is a key priority at all of our facilities and as such, we have invested in a safety and health department staffed with trained medical personnel. The Company’s leaders and managers continuously address safety enhancements, provide regular and ongoing safety training, and use displays located near our employee work areas to provide all employees with safety-related information. 
Employees
At October 1, 2022, we employed 1,596 employees, of which 1,593 were full-time. Our workforce is non-union.
