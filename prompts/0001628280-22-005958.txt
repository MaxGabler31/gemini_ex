Item 1. Business
Corporate History:
We were formed as a Nevada corporation on May 14, 2008. Pursuant to an Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger dated May 19, 2008, by and between Vertex Holdings, L.P. (formerly Vertex Energy, L.P.), a Texas limited partnership (“Holdings”), us, World Waste Technologies, Inc., a California corporation (“WWT” or “World Waste”), Vertex Merger Sub, LLC, a California limited liability company and our wholly-owned subsidiary (“Merger Subsidiary”), and Benjamin P. Cowart, our Chief Executive Officer, as agent for our shareholders (as amended from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”), effective on April 16, 2009, World Waste merged with and into Merger Subsidiary, with Merger Subsidiary continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming our wholly-owned subsidiary (the “Merger”). In connection with the Merger, (i) each outstanding share of World Waste common stock was cancelled and exchanged for 0.10 shares of our common stock; (ii) each outstanding share of World Waste Series A preferred stock was cancelled and exchanged for 0.4062 shares of our Series A preferred stock; and (iii) each outstanding share of World Waste Series B preferred stock was cancelled and exchanged for 11.651 shares of our Series A preferred stock.
Additionally, as a result of the Merger, as the successor entity of World Waste, we assumed World Waste’s filing obligations with the Securities and Exchange Commission and our common stock began trading on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board under the symbol “VTNR.OB” effective May 4, 2009. Subsequently, effective February 13, 2013, our common stock began trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “VTNR”, where it has continued to trade.

Additionally, Chris Carlson, our Chief Financial Officer, owned a 10% interest in Holdings at the time of the acquisition.
Omega Refining Acquisition
In May 2014, we acquired certain of the assets of Omega Refining, LLC (“Omega Refining”), Bango Refining NV, LLC (“Bango Refining”) and Omega Holdings Company LLC (“Omega Holdings” and collectively with Omega Refining and Bango Refining, “Omega” or the “sellers”) related to (1) the operation of oil re-refineries and, in connection therewith, purchasing used lubricating oils and re-refining such oils into processed oils and other products for the distribution, supply and sale to end-customers and (2) the provision of related products and support services. The assets included Omega’s Marrero, Louisiana plant which produces vacuum gas oil (VGO) and a Bango, Nevada plant which produces base lubricating oils. We acquired the assets in the name of our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Vertex Refining LA, LLC (“Vertex LA”). The assets and operations acquired from Omega fall under our Black Oil segment. The Bango Refining operations were sold in January 2016.
Heartland Acquisition
    In December 2014, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Warren Ohio Holdings Co., LLC, f/k/a Heartland Group Holdings, LLC (“Heartland”) related to and used in an oil re-refinery and, in connection with the collecting, aggregating and purchasing of used lubricating oils and the re-refining of such oils into processed oils and other products for the distribution, supply and sale to end-customers, including raw materials, finished products and work-in-process, equipment and other fixed assets, customer lists and marketing information, the name ‘Heartland’ and other related trade names, Heartland’s real property relating to its used oil refining facility located in Columbus, Ohio, the ownership of 65% of which was transferred to Tensile in connection with the Heartland SPV (discussed below), effective January 1, 2020, used oil storage and transfer facilities located in Columbus, Zanesville and Norwalk, Ohio, and leases related to storage and transfer facilities located in Zanesville, Ohio, Mount Sterling, Kentucky, and Ravenswood, West Virginia (collectively, the “Heartland Assets”).

Myrtle Grove Share Purchase and Subscription Agreement
On July 26, 2019 (the “MG Closing Date”), Vertex Refining Myrtle Grove LLC (“MG SPV”), a Delaware limited liability company, which entity was formed as a special purpose vehicle in connection with the transactions, described in greater detail below, Vertex Operating, LLC, our wholly-owned subsidiary (“Vertex Operating”), Tensile-Myrtle Grove Acquisition Corporation (“Tensile-MG”), an affiliate of Tensile Capital Partners Master Fund LP, an investment fund based in San Francisco, California (“Tensile”), and solely for the purposes of the MG Guaranty (defined below), the Company, entered into and closed the transactions contemplated by a Share Purchase and Subscription Agreement (the “MG Share Purchase”).
Prior to entering into the MG Share Purchase, Vertex Operating’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Vertex Refining LA, LLC, (“Vertex LA”), transferred all of the operating assets owned by it and related to the planned development of the MG Refinery (as defined below), which the parties agreed had a fair market value of $22,666,667, to MG SPV in consideration for 21,667 Class A Units and 1,000 Class B Units of MG SPV, which units were distributed to Vertex Operating. At the closing of the MG Share Purchase (on the MG Closing Date), Vertex Operating sold 1,000 of the Class B Units to Tensile-MG in consideration of the payment to it of $1 million by Tensile-MG, and Tensile-MG purchased an additional 3,000 Class B Units directly from MG SPV for $3 million (less Tensile’s fees and expenses incurred in connection with the transaction, totaling $850,000).

As a result of the transaction, Tensile, through Tensile-MG, acquired an approximate 15% ownership interest in MG SPV, which in turn now owns the Company’s former Belle Chasse, Louisiana, re-refining complex (the “MG Refinery”). Vertex Operating owns the remaining 85% of MG SPV.

MG SPV Limited Liability Company Agreement
 The Class B Units held by Tensile-MG are convertible into Class A Units at the option of Tensile-MG, as provided in the Limited Liability Company Agreement of MG SPV dated July 25, 2019 (the “MG Company Agreement”), based on a conversion price (initially one-for-one) which may be reduced from time to time if new Units of MG SPV are issued, and automatically convert into Series A Units upon certain events described in the MG Company Agreement.
Additionally, the Class B Unit holders may force MG SPV to redeem the outstanding Class B Units at any time on or after the earlier of (a) July 26, 2024 and (ii) the occurrence of an MG Triggering Event (defined below)(an “MG Redemption”). The cash purchase price for such redeemed Class B Units is the greater of (y) the fair market value of such units (without discount for illiquidity, minority status or otherwise) as determined by a qualified third party agreed to in writing by a majority of the holders seeking an MG Redemption and Vertex Operating (provided that Vertex Operating still owns Class A Units on such date) and (z) the original per-unit price for such Class B Units plus any unpaid Class B preference. The preference is defined as the greater of the (A) aggregate unpaid Class B yield, equal to 22.5% per year and (B) amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate capital invested by the Class B Unit holders through such MG Redemption date. “MG Triggering Events” mean (a) any dissolution, winding up or liquidation of the Company, Vertex Operating or any significant subsidiary of Vertex Operating, (b) any sale, lease, license or disposition of any material assets of the Company, Vertex Operating or any significant subsidiary of Vertex Operating, (c) any transaction or series of related transactions (whether by merger, exchange, contribution, recapitalization, consolidation, reorganization, combination or otherwise) involving the Company, Vertex Operating or any significant subsidiary of Vertex Operating, the result of which is that the holders of the voting securities of the relevant entity as of the MG Closing Date are no longer the beneficial owners, in the aggregate, after giving effect to such transaction or series of transactions, directly or indirectly, of more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting power of the 
outstanding voting securities of the entity, subject to certain other requirements set forth in the MG Company Agreement, (d) the failure of Vertex Operating to operate MG SPV in good faith with appropriate resources, or (e) the material failure of the Company and its affiliates to comply with the terms of the contribution agreement, whereby the Company contributed assets and operations to MG SPV.
    Distributions of available cash of MG SPV pursuant to the MG Company Agreement (including pursuant to liquidations of MG SPV), subject to certain exemptions set forth therein, are to be made (a) first, to the holders of the Class B Units, in an amount equal to the greater of (A) the aggregate unpaid “Class B Yield” (equal to an annual return of 22.5% per annum) and (B) an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate capital invested by the Class B Unit holders (initially Tensile-MG)(such aggregate capital invested by the Class B Unit holders, the “MG Invested Capital”, which totals approximately $4 million as of December 31, 2021, less prior distributions (the greater amount of (A) and (B), the “Class B Priority Distributions”); (b) second, the Class B Unitholders, together as a separate and distinct class, are entitled to receive an amount equal to the aggregate MG Invested Capital; (c) third, the Class A Unitholders (other than Class A Unitholders which received Class A Units upon conversion of Class B Units), together as a separate and distinct class, are entitled to receive all or a portion of any distribution equal to the sum of all distributions made under sections (a) and (b) above; and (d) fourth, to the holders of Units who are eligible to receive such distributions in proportion to the number of Units held by such holders.
On or after July 26, 2022, the Company or any of its subsidiaries, may elect to purchase all of the outstanding units of MG SPV held by Tensile-MG (or any assignee of Tensile-MG) as discussed in the MG Company Agreement. 
On the MG Closing Date, Tensile-MG, Vertex Operating and the Company entered into a right of first offer letter agreement (the “ROFO Agreement”), whereby we agreed that if we, at any time, propose to issue, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber or otherwise directly or indirectly dispose of any equity or debt securities of (x) MG SPV and/or (y) Cedar Marine Terminals, L.P., or any other entity formed or designated to operate the Cedar Marine Terminal in Baytown, Texas, we would provide Tensile-MG written notice of such, and Tensile-MG would have thirty days to purchase the amount of securities offered on terms at least as favorable as those in the original proposal. The rights under the ROFO Agreement continue to apply until such time, if ever, as Tensile-MG has acquired $50 million of securities pursuant to the terms thereof.
Heads of Agreement

On January 10, 2020, Vertex Operating entered into a Heads of Agreement (the “Heads of Agreement”) with Bunker One (USA) Inc., which is owned by Bunker Holding, a Danish holding company (“Bunker One”). Pursuant to the Heads of Agreement, the Company and Bunker One agreed to form a joint decision-making body (the “JDMB”) to focus on strategic matters related to the overall cooperation of the parties and to establish rules and procedures for identifying and undertaking joint projects. The JDMB has six members, three each from the Company and Bunker One.

The goal of the parties, pursuant to the Heads of Agreement and the JDMB, is to jointly develop and acquire direct or indirect equity or equity-related interests in projects and companies in the marine fuel sector in North America, with Bunker One focusing on opportunities related to the supply and optimization of marine fuels or components and the Company focusing on business opportunities relating to refining of bunker fuels.

For each project that the parties agree to pursue, the parties will enter into a form of Co-Operation and Joint Supply and Marketing Agreement (each a “Co-Operation JSMA”). The principal objective of each such Co-Operation JSMA will be the expansion of the business of each party by cooperating in the sourcing, storing, transportation, marketing and selling of products, where: (a) Vertex is primarily responsible for the sourcing and storing of the product (bunker fuels); (b) Bunker One is primarily responsible for the transporting, blending, marketing, selling and delivering of the product (bunker fuels); (c) Bunker One is responsible for the risk management/exposure (e.g. hedging) of the bunker fuels; and (d) Bunker One is the exclusive seller of the product to third parties.

The Heads of Agreement also allows for certain projects outside of the scope of Co-Operation JSMA’s which will be subject to separate Authorization for Expenditures agreed to by the JDMB.

The Heads of Agreement has a term of ten years, beginning effective on January 1, 2020, and continuing through April 30, 2029, provided that the agreement extends for additional five-year periods thereafter unless either party provides the other at least 120 days’ notice of non-renewal before any such automatic renewal date. The agreement can also be terminated by either party upon an event of default (as described in the Heads of Agreement), subject to required thirty days’ notice of such event of default and the opportunity for the breaching party to cure. The Heads of Agreement contains standard and customary events of default, including failure to pay amounts when due, failure to comply with the terms of the agreement, insolvency and the 
occurrence of a Change of Control, each subject to the terms of the agreement. A Change of Control is defined in the agreement as any party (a) engaged in the bunkering business (i.e., the supplying of fuel used by ships), as to Bunker One, or (b) engaged in the refining business, as to Vertex, obtaining control of such applicable party by way of any transaction or series of transactions.

The Heads of Agreement also contains a right of first refusal provision, whereby if at any time Bunker One, or any of its U.S. affiliates (each a “Bunker One Party”), proposes to issue, sell, transfer, assign, or otherwise directly or indirectly dispose of (x) all or any substantial portion of its bunkering business in the United States, or, if mutually agreed, outside of the United States and/or (y) the controlling equity interests in any corporation, limited liability company or partnership that owns all or any substantial portion of the bunkering business, held by such Bunker One Party for value, the Bunker One Party is required to provide the Company written notice of such event and the Company is provided the right to make an offer to purchase such entity/assets, from such Bunker One Party, subject to the terms of the Heads of Agreement.
Additionally, under the Heads of Agreement, at any time Bunker One determines to extend its existing bunkering business to any port in North America that is not served by Bunker One as of August 1, 2019, Bunker One is required to extend to the Company the right to elect to expand the terms and conditions of the Heads of Agreement to include any such new port.

Finally, under the Heads of Agreement, if at any time the Company acquires a supply of material that the Company intends to sell in Texas, Louisiana or Alabama and that is suitable for use in Bunker One’s bunkering business in such area from a third party, or produces additional material for sale in such area, the Company is required to provide Bunker One the right to purchase such supply/material pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Heads of Agreement.

JSMA

Also, on January 10, 2020, Vertex Operating entered into a Joint Supply and Marketing Agreement (the “JSMA”), with Bunker One. The JSMA is effective as of May 1, 2020, and provides for Bunker One to acquire 100% of the production from the Company’s Marrero, Louisiana re-refining facility (which produces approximately 100,000 barrels per month of a bunker suitable fuel for offshore use and use as a marine vessel’s propulsion system (“Bunker Fuel”)) at the arithmetic mean of Platts #2 USGC Pipe and Platt’s ULSD USGC Waterborne on agreed pricing days less an agreed upon discount, adjusted every three months.

Pursuant to the JSMA, the parties agreed to the percentages pursuant to which net profit will be split between the parties, relating to the sale of such Bunker Fuel by Bunker One, which is to be sold in Texas, Louisiana, Alabama and areas immediately adjacent thereto if mutually agreed (collectively, the “Area”).

Pursuant to the JSMA, (i) the Company is primarily responsible for the sourcing and storing of the feedstock which is used to produce the Bunker Fuel, (ii) Bunker One is primarily responsible for the transporting, blending, marketing, selling and delivering of the Bunker Fuel, (iii) Bunker One is responsible for the risk management/exposure (e.g., hedging) of the Bunker Fuel, and (iv) Bunker One is the exclusive seller of the Bunker Fuel to third parties.

The Bunker Fuel is meant for blending by Bunker One into other products for the purpose of being transformed into bunker suitable fuel for a marine vessel’s propulsion system and/or marketable wholesale products in various other markets for sale by Bunker One to customers in the Area.

Pursuant to the JSMA, the Company agreed that during the term of the agreement, neither the Company, nor any affiliate of the Company, would sell any Bunker Fuel to any customers for their use as bunker fuel other than pursuant to the terms of the Agreement.

Payment for the Bunker Fuel is required to be made by Bunker One within three days after invoiced by the Company, and at the end of each three months during the term of the agreement, Bunker One is required to provide a detailed accounting to the Company setting forth the consideration due to the Company and the calculation of such amounts. The agreement also provides for a yearly accounting by Bunker One and true up of amounts paid and due throughout such year.

The JSMA has a term from May 1, 2020 to April 30, 2029, provided that the term is automatically renewable for additional five-year periods thereafter unless either party provides the other at least 120 days prior written notice of non-renewal, prior to any automatic renewal date. The agreement can also be terminated by either party upon an event of default (as described in the JSMA), subject to required ten days’ notice of such event of default and the opportunity for the breaching party to cure. The Heads of Agreement contains standard and customary events of default, including failure to pay amounts when due, failure to comply with the terms of the agreement and insolvency, each subject to the terms of the agreement. In the event 
that the individual or group of individuals who ultimately own or control each party or such party’s parent as of May 1, 2020 no longer has the right or ability to control or cause the direction of the management and policies of such entity, the agreement can be terminated immediately by the party not subject to such change of control.
The JSMA prohibits either party from promoting activities which compete against the other party’s business in the Area for the term of the agreement and for two years thereafter.

The JSMA also provides, during the term of such agreement, for Bunker One to be allowed to have a representative attend meetings of the Board of Directors of the Company and the committees of the Board (in a non-voting observer capacity)(the “Board Observer Right”). The Board Observer Right was provided partially in connection with Bunker One’s agreement to acquire up to $5 million of the Company’s securities which it did through the purchase of shares of Series B1 Preferred Stock (which shares have since been converted into common stock) and common stock, in privately negotiated purchases, with holders of the Company’s Series B1 Preferred Stock.
Heartland Share Purchase and Subscription Agreement

On January 17, 2020 (the “Heartland Closing Date”), a Share Purchase and Subscription Agreement (the “Heartland Share Purchase”) by and among HPRM LLC (“Heartland SPV”), a Delaware limited liability company, which entity was formed as a special purpose vehicle in connection with the transactions, described in greater detail below, Vertex Operating, Tensile-Heartland Acquisition Corporation (“Tensile-Heartland”), an affiliate of Tensile, and solely for the purposes of the Heartland Guaranty (defined below), the Company, was entered into.

Prior to entering into the Heartland Share Purchase, the Company transferred 100% of the ownership of Vertex Refining OH, LLC, its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary (“Vertex OH”) to Heartland SPV in consideration for 13,500 Class A Units, 13,500 Class A-1 Preferred Units and 11,300 Class B Units of Heartland SPV and immediately thereafter contributed 248 Class B Units to Vertex Splitter, as a contribution to capital.

Vertex OH owns the Company’s Columbus, Ohio, Heartland facility, which produces a base oil product that is sold to lubricant packagers and distributors.

Pursuant to the Heartland Share Purchase, Vertex Operating sold Tensile-Heartland the 13,500 Class A Units and 13,500 Class A-1 Preferred Units of Heartland SPV in consideration for $13.5 million. Also, on the Heartland Closing Date, Tensile-Heartland purchased 7,500 Class A Units and 7,500 Class A-1 Units in consideration for $7.5 million directly from Heartland SPV.

Concurrently with the closing of the transactions described above, and pursuant to the terms of the Heartland Share Purchase, the Company, through Vertex Operating, purchased 1,000 newly issued Class A Units from MG SPV at a cost of $1,000 per unit ($1 million in aggregate).
The Heartland Share Purchase provides Tensile-Heartland an option, exercisable at its election, any time after the Heartland Closing Date, subject to the terms of the Heartland Share Purchase, to purchase up to an additional 7,000 Class A-2 Preferred Units at a cost of $1,000 per Class A-2 Preferred Unit from Heartland SPV.

The Heartland Share Purchase also provided for a guarantee by the Company to Tensile-Heartland of the payment obligations of Vertex Operating as set forth in the Heartland Share Purchase (the “Heartland Guaranty”).

The Heartland Share Purchase had an effective date of January 1, 2020.

Administrative Services Agreement
Pursuant to an Administrative Services Agreement, entered into on the Heartland Closing Date, Heartland SPV engaged Vertex Operating and the Company to provide administrative/management services and day-to-day operational management services of Heartland SPV in connection with the collection, storage, transportation, transfer, refining, re-refining, distilling, aggregating, processing, blending, sale of used motor oil, used lubricants, wholesale lubricants, recycled fuel oil, or related products and services such as vacuum gas oil, base oil, and asphalt flux, in consideration for a monthly fee. The Administrative Services Agreement has a term continuing until the earlier of (a) the date terminated with the mutual consent of the parties; (b) a liquidation of Heartland SPV; (c) a Heartland Redemption (defined below); (d) the determination of Heartland SPV to terminate following a change of control (as described in the Administrative Services Agreement) of Heartland SPV or 
the Company; or (e)  written notice from the non-breaching party upon the occurrence of a breach which is not cured within the cure period set forth in the Administrative Services Agreement.
The Administrative Services Agreement also provides that in the event that Heartland SPV is unable to procure used motor-oil (“UMO”) through its ordinary course operations, subject to certain conditions, Vertex Operating and the Company are required to use their best efforts to sell (or cause an affiliate to sell) UMO to Heartland SPV, at the lesser of the (i) then-current market price for UMO sold in the same geography area and (ii) price paid by such entity for such UMO. Finally, the Administrative Services Agreement provides that in the event that the Heartland SPV is unable to procure vacuum gas oil (“VGO”) feedstock through its ordinary course operations, subject to certain conditions, Vertex Operating and the Company are required to use their best efforts to sell (or cause an affiliate to sell) VGO to Heartland SPV, at the lesser of the (i) then-current market price for VGO sold in the same geographic area and (ii) price paid for such VGO.
Heartland Limited Liability Company Agreement
The Heartland SPV is currently owned 35% by Vertex Operating and 65% by Tensile-Heartland. The Class A Units held by Tensile-Heartland are convertible into Class B Units as provided in the Limited Liability Company Agreement of Heartland SPV (the “Heartland Company Agreement”), based on a conversion price (initially one-for-one) which may be reduced from time to time if new Units of Heartland SPV are issued and will automatically convert into Series A Units upon certain events described in the Heartland Company Agreement.
The Class A-1 and A-2 Preferred Units (“Class A Preferred Units”), which are 100% owned by Tensile-Heartland, accrue a 22.5% per annum preferred return subject to terms of the Heartland Company Agreement (the “Class A Yield”).
Additionally, the Class A Unit holders (common and preferred) may force Heartland SPV to redeem the outstanding Class A Units at any time on or after the earlier of (a)  January 17, 2025 and (b) the occurrence of a Heartland Triggering Event (defined below)(a “Heartland Redemption”). The cash purchase price for such redeemed Class A Unit will be the greater of (y) the fair market value of such units (without discount for illiquidity, minority status or otherwise) as determined by a qualified third party agreed to in writing by a majority of the holders seeking Heartland Redemption and Vertex Operating (provided that Vertex Operating still owns Class B Units on such date) and (z) the Class A preference. The Class A preference is defined as the greater of (A) the aggregate unpaid Class A yield equal to 225% per year or (B) an amount equal to the original per-unit price for such Class A Units plus fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate capital invested by the Class A Unit holders through such Heartland Redemption date. “Heartland Triggering Events” include (a) any termination of the Administrative Services Agreement pursuant to its terms and/or any material breach by us of the environmental remediation and indemnity agreement, (b) any dissolution, winding up or liquidation of the Company, Vertex Operating or any significant subsidiary of Vertex Operating, (c) any sale, lease, license or disposition of any material assets of the Company, Vertex Operating or any significant subsidiary of Vertex Operating, or (d) any transaction or series of related transactions (whether by merger, exchange, contribution, recapitalization, consolidation, reorganization, combination or otherwise) involving the Company, Vertex Operating or any significant subsidiary of Vertex Operating, the result of which is that the holders of the voting securities of the relevant entity as of the Heartland Closing Date are no longer the beneficial owners, in the aggregate, after giving effect to such transaction or series of transactions, directly or indirectly, of more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting power of the outstanding voting securities of the entity, subject to certain other requirements set forth in the Heartland Company Agreement.
In the event that Heartland SPV fails to redeem such Class A Units within 180 days after a redemption is triggered, the Class A Yield is increased to 25% until such time as such redemption is completed (with such increase being effective back to the original date of a notice of redemption). In addition, in such event, the Class A Unit holders may cause Heartland SPV to initiate a process intended to result in a sale of Heartland SPV.
Distributions of available cash of Heartland SPV pursuant to the Heartland Company Agreement (including pursuant to liquidations of Heartland SPV), subject to certain exceptions set forth therein, are to be made (a) first, to the holders of the Class A Preferred Units, in an amount equal to the greater of (A) the aggregate unpaid Class A Yield and (B) an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate capital invested by the Class A Preferred Unit holders (initially Tensile-Heartland)(such aggregate capital invested by the Class A Preferred Unit holders, the “Heartland Invested Capital”, which totaled approximately $21 million as of the Heartland Closing Date, subject to adjustment as provided in the Heartland Share Purchase), less prior distributions (such greater amount of (A) and (B), the “Class A Preferred Priority Distributions”); (b) second, the Class A Preferred Unitholders, together as a separate and distinct class, are entitled to receive an amount equal to the aggregate Heartland Invested Capital; (c) third, the Class B Unitholders (other than Class B Unitholders which received Class B Units 
upon conversion of Class A Preferred Units), together as a separate and distinct class, are entitled to receive all or a portion of any distribution equal to the sum of all distributions made under sections (a) and (b) above; and (d) fourth, to the holders of Units who are eligible to receive such distributions in proportion to the number of Units held by such holders.
On or after January 17, 2023, the Company (through Vertex Operating) may elect to purchase all of the outstanding units of Heartland SPV held by Tensile-Heartland at the greatest of (i) the amount of the Class A Priority Distributions and the amount of the Heartland Invested Capital, had the Class A Yield accrued at 30% per annum (instead of the original stated 22.5% per annum), (ii) two hundred and seventy-five percent (275%) of the total Heartland Invested Capital, and (iii) a calculation based on the greater of six (6) times the trailing twelve (12) months’ adjusted EBITDA and (B) six (6) times the next twelve (12) months’ projected adjusted EBITDA, each as described in further detail in the Heartland Company Agreement.
Upon the occurrence of a Heartland Triggering Event (described above), the Class A Unitholders (initially Tensile-Heartland) may elect, by a majority vote, to (a) terminate the Administrative Services Agreement and appoint new management of Heartland SPV, (b) trigger a Heartland Redemption, and/or (c) purchase the Class B Units from the Class B Unitholders (initially Vertex Operating) at the fair market value of such units as determined by a qualified third party agreed to in writing by the parties.

Recent Transactions
May 2021 Purchase Agreement
On May 26, 2021, Vertex Operating, entered into a definitive Sale and Purchase Agreement (the “Refinery Purchase Agreement”) with Equilon Enterprises LLC d/b/a Shell Oil Products US, Shell Oil Company and Shell Chemical LP, subsidiaries of Shell plc (“Shell”), to purchase the Shell’s Mobile, Alabama refinery, certain real property associated therewith, and related assets, including all inventory at the refinery as of closing and certain equipment, rolling stock, and other personal property associated with the Mobile refinery (collectively, the “Mobile Refinery” and the “Mobile Acquisition”). The Mobile Refinery is located on an 800+ acre site in the city and county of Mobile, Alabama. The 91,000 barrel-per-day nameplate capacity Mobile Refinery is capable of sourcing a flexible mix of cost-advantaged light-sweet domestic and international feedstocks. Approximately 70% of the refinery’s current annual production is distillate, gasoline and jet fuel, with the remainder being vacuum gas oil, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and other products. The facility distributes its finished product across the southeastern United States through a high-capacity truck rack, together with deep and shallow water distribution points capable of supplying waterborne vessels.
In addition to refining assets, the transaction will include the acquisition by the Company of approximately 3.2 million barrels of inventory and product storage, logistics and distribution assets, together with more than 800+ acres of developed and undeveloped land.
The initial base purchase price for the assets is $75 million. In addition, Vertex Operating will also pay for the hydrocarbon inventory located at the Mobile Refinery, as valued at closing, which we currently anticipate having a value of 
approximately $100 million and the purchase price is subject to other customary purchase price adjustments and reimbursement for certain capital expenditures in the amount of approximately $440,000. Upon closing of the acquisition, the Company (through one or more of its subsidiaries and affiliates) plans to complete an $85 million capital project designed to modify the Mobile Refinery’s hydrocracking unit to produce renewable diesel fuel on a standalone basis (the “Conversion”).
In connection with Vertex Operating’s execution of the Refinery Purchase Agreement, and as a required term and condition thereof, Vertex Operating provided the Shell a promissory note in the amount of $10 million (the “Deposit Note”). Pursuant to the terms of the Refinery Purchase Agreement, the terms of such agreement (other than exclusivity through December 31, 2021, or such earlier date that the Refinery Purchase Agreement is terminated), were not legally binding on Shell until such time as Vertex Operating funds the Deposit Note in cash (which note has been paid in full to date). The Deposit Note did not accrue interest unless or until an event of default occurs under such note, at which time interest accrues at 12% per annum until paid. The entire balance of the Deposit Note was due upon the earlier of (i) 45 calendar days following the date of the Deposit Note (i.e., July 10, 2021); and (ii) five calendar days following the closing of any transaction between Vertex Operating and any third party, which Deposit Note was paid in full prior to such applicable due date. 
In the event of the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Refinery Purchase Agreement, the funded portion of the Deposit Note, and any interest thereon (the “Deposit”) is credited against the purchase price due to the Shell. In the event the Refinery Purchase Agreement is terminated, the Deposit is non-refundable except as more particularly described in the Refinery Purchase Agreement, which provides that in some circumstances the Company may receive a complete refund of the Deposit or must pay a portion of (or in some cases all) the costs for the Swapkit (defined below) and/or the audit of the Shell’s operations, to the extent requested by the Company.
The Refinery Purchase Agreement is subject to termination prior to closing under certain circumstances, and may be terminated: at any time prior to the closing date, by the mutual consent of the parties; by Vertex Operating or Shell in the event the closing has not occurred by May 26, 2022 (the “Outside Date”, subject to extensions as discussed in the Refinery Purchase Agreement), in the event such failure to close is not a result of Vertex Operating’s or Shell’s breach of the agreement, respectively, or the failure to obtain any government consent; by Vertex Operating or Shell, if the other party has breached any representation, warranty or covenant set forth in the agreement, subject to certain cases to the right to cure such breach, or required regulatory approvals have not been received as of the Outside Date.
The Refinery Purchase Agreement provides that if all conditions to closing are satisfied other than government approvals and required permits and registrations, then the Outside Date is extended to such date as the parties mutually agree; provided, however, in the event the parties do not mutually agree, then the Outside Date is automatically extended to May 26, 2023.
The Refinery Purchase Agreement contemplates the Company and the Shell entering into various supply and offtake agreements at closing.
The Mobile Acquisition is expected to close early in the second quarter of 2022, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, the absence of legal impediments prohibiting the Mobile Acquisition, receipt of regulatory approvals and required consents, absence of a material adverse effect and the Company raising sufficient cash to pay such aggregate purchase price, a portion of which the Company raised through the sale of the Convertible Notes and a portion of which the Company plans to raise through the entry into the Term Loan, each defined and discussed below. The conditions to the closing of the Mobile Acquisition may not be met, and such closing may not ultimately occur on the terms set forth in the Refinery Purchase Agreement, if at all.
In connection with the entry into the Refinery Purchase Agreement, Vertex Operating and Shell entered into a Swapkit Purchase Agreement (the “Swapkit Agreement”). Pursuant to the agreement, Vertex Operating agreed to fund a technology solution comprising the ecosystem required for the Company to run the Mobile Refinery after closing (the “Swapkit”), at a cost of $8.7 million, which is payable at closing (subject to certain adjustments), or in certain circumstances, upon termination of the Purchase and Sale Agreement.
Series B and B1 Preferred Stock Automatic Conversion
Pursuant to the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock and Series B1 Preferred Stock of the Company, in the event that the closing sales price of the Company’s common stock was at least $6.20 (as to the Series B Preferred Stock) and $3.90 (as to the Series B1 Preferred Stock) per share for at least 20 consecutive trading days, such shares of Series B Preferred Stock and 
Series B1 Preferred Stock were to convert automatically into common stock of the Company on a one-for-one basis (the “Automatic Conversion Provisions”).
Effective on June 24, 2021 (as to the Series B1 Preferred Stock) and June 25, 2021 (as to the Series B Preferred Stock), the Automatic Conversion Provisions of the Series B Preferred Stock and Series B1 Preferred Stock were triggered, and the outstanding shares of the Company’s Series B Preferred Stock and Series B1 Preferred Stock automatically converted into common stock of the Company.
Specifically, the 1,783,292 then outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock automatically converted into 1,783,292 shares of common stock and the 3,134,889 then outstanding shares of Series B1 Preferred Stock automatically converted into 3,134,889 shares of common stock (or 4,918,181 shares of common stock in total).
As a result, there are no outstanding shares of Series B or B1 Preferred Stock as of December 31, 2021.
Safety-Kleen Sale Agreement
On June 29, 2021, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Sale Agreement” and the transactions contemplated therein, the “Sale Transaction” or the “Sale”) with Vertex Operating, Vertex LA, Vertex OH, CMT, H & H Oil, as sellers, and Safety-Kleen Systems, Inc., as purchaser (“Safety-Kleen”), dated as of June 28, 2021.
Pursuant to the Sale Agreement, Safety-Kleen agreed to acquire the Company’s Marrero used oil refinery in Louisiana (currently owned by Vertex LA); our Heartland used oil refinery in Ohio (currently owned by Vertex OH); our H&H and Heartland used motor oil (“UMO”) collections business; our oil filters and absorbent materials recycling facility in East Texas; and the rights CMT holds to a lease on the Cedar Marine terminal in Baytown, Texas (the “UMO Business”).
The initial base purchase price for the assets was $140 million, which is subject to customary adjustments to account for working capital, taxes and assumed liabilities.
The Sale Agreement was expected to close in the first half of 2022, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, the absence of legal impediments prohibiting the transaction, and receipt of regulatory approvals and required consents.
On January 24, 2022, each of the Company Parties and Safety-Kleen entered into an Asset Purchase Termination Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”) pursuant to which the Sale Agreement was terminated. Pursuant to the terms of the Termination Agreement, the Company agreed to pay a termination fee to Safety-Kleen of $3,000,000. Immediately upon receipt of such termination fee, which the Company paid simultaneously with the execution of the Termination Agreement, the Sale Agreement was terminated and is of no further force or effect, and with no further liability to any party thereunder, other than certain confidentiality obligations of the parties and ongoing liability for any willful or intentional breach of, or non-compliance with, the Sale Agreement.
The Company is exploring other opportunities for the sale of the UMO business. 
Tensile Transactions
On July 1, 2021, the Operating Agreement of MG SPV was amended to provide that from the date of such agreement until December 31, 2021, the Company (through Vertex Operating), was required to fund the working capital requirements of MG SPV, which advances were initially characterized as debt, but that Tensile MG may convert such debt into additional Class A Units of MG SPV (after December 31, 2021), at $1,000 per unit (the “MG SPV Amendment”).
On July 1, 2021, Heartland SPV loaned Vertex Operating $7,000,000, which was evidenced by a Promissory Note (the “Heartland Note”). The Heartland Note accrues interest at the applicable federal rate of interest from time to time, increasing to 12% upon an event of default. Amounts borrowed under the Heartland Note are currently due upon the earlier of (i) June 30, 2022; and (ii) five calendar days following the closing of a sale of substantially all the assets of Vertex Refining OH, LLC (“VROH”), and/or the sale of membership interests in VROH possessing voting control (with the consent of the Company), provided that the Heartland Note may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty. The Heartland Note includes customary events of defaults. The Company used the funds borrowed under the Heartland Note, to paydown a portion of the Deposit Note, with the remaining funds coming from a loan from EBC as discussed below.
On July 25, 2019, Tensile purchased 1,500,000 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 1,500,000 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $2.25 per share, and we entered into a Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement with Tensile which required us to register the shares of common stock issued to Tensile, and the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants issued to Tensile, and Tensile agreed to certain restrictions on the sale of the shares held by Tensile. On July 1, 2021, we entered into a First Amendment to Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement with Tensile (the “RRA Amendment”) to adjust the restriction on Tensile’s ability to sell shares of common stock under the lock-up to provide for Tensile to not sell more than 500,000 shares of common stock in any seven day period until July 25, 2024, without the prior written consent of the Company.
Indenture and Convertible Notes
On November 1, 2021, we issued $155.0 million aggregate principal amount at maturity of our 6.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 (the “Convertible Notes”) pursuant to an Indenture (the “Indenture”), dated November 1, 2021, between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”), in a private offering (the “Note Offering”) to persons reasonably believed to be “qualified institutional buyers” and/or to “accredited investors” in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, pursuant to Securities Purchase Agreements.
The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting placement agent fees and estimated offering costs and expenses payable by the Company, were approximately $133.9 million. The Company intends to use approximately $33.7 million of the net proceeds from the offering to fund a portion of the funds payable in connection with the Refinery Purchase Agreement. The Company has previously used (1) $10.9 million of the net proceeds from the offering to repay amounts owed by the Company under its credit facilities with Encina Business Credit, LLC and certain of its affiliates (the “EBC Lenders”), and (2) $0.4 million of the net proceeds to repay certain secured equipment leases with certain affiliates of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association. The Company intends to use the remainder of the net proceeds for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which may include debt retirement and organic and inorganic growth initiatives, provided that the Company has no current specific plans for such uses.
Key terms of the Convertible Notes are as follows:
•Issue price – 90% of the face amount of each Note.
•Interest rate of 6.25% – The Convertible Notes will bear interest at a rate of 6.25% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on April 1, 2022.
•Conversion price of approximately $5.89 – The Convertible Notes will be convertible at an initial conversion rate of 169.9235 shares of the Company’s common stock, per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $5.89 per share, which represents a conversion premium of approximately 37.5% to the last reported sale price of $4.28 per share of the Company’s common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market on October 26, 2021).
•Maturity date –The Convertible Notes will mature on October 1, 2027, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted.
•Conversion – Prior to July 1, 2027, the Convertible Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders of the Convertible Notes only upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods, and thereafter, at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date.
•Cash settlement of principal amount in connection with conversions – Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at its election.
•Limited investor put rights – Holders of the Convertible Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase for cash all or part of their Convertible Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the accreted principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding the repurchase date, upon the occurrence of certain change of control transactions or liquidation, dissolution or common stock delisting events (collectively, a “fundamental change”), subject to certain conditions.
•Optional Redemption – Prior to October 6, 2024, the Convertible Notes will not be redeemable at the Company’s option. On a redemption date occurring on or after October 6, 2024 and on or before the 30 scheduled trading day before the maturity date, the Company may redeem for cash all or part of the Convertible Notes (subject to certain restrictions), at its option, if the last reported sale price of our Company’s common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive), including the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides a notice of redemption, during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the redemption notice date at a redemption price equal to 100% of the accreted principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. No “sinking fund” is provided for the Convertible Notes, which means that we are not required to redeem or retire the Convertible Notes periodically.
•Escrow of proceeds; special mandatory redemption. A total of seventy-five percent (75%) of the net proceeds from the offering (approximately $100 million) were placed into an escrow account to be released to the Company, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions precedent to the Company’s obligation to consummate the Mobile Acquisition (collectively, the “Escrow Release Conditions”). If the Mobile Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to April 1, 2022, if the Company has not certified to the escrow agent that all conditions precedent to the Company’s obligations to consummate the Mobile Acquisition have been satisfied, or if the Company notifies the trustee and the escrow agent in writing that the agreement relating to the purchase of the Mobile Refinery has been terminated, the Convertible Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption equal to 100% of the accreted principal amount of the Convertible Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the special mandatory redemption date, plus interest that would have accrued on the Convertible Notes from the special mandatory redemption date to, and including, the date that is nine (9) months after the special mandatory redemption date. If the Escrow Release Conditions have been satisfied or waived, the Company can request that the escrowed funds be released to the Company.
•Conversion rate increase in certain customary circumstances – The Company will also be required to increase the conversion rate for holders who convert their Convertible Notes in connection with a fundamental change and certain other corporate events or convert their Convertible Notes called for optional redemption (or deemed called for redemption) following delivery by the Company of a notice of optional redemption, in either case, in certain circumstances.
The Convertible Notes are Vertex Energy’s senior unsecured obligations.
The Indenture contains additional customary terms and covenants, including that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing, either the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes then outstanding may declare the entire principal amount of all the Convertible Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to be immediately due and payable, provided that in the case of an event of default with respect to the Convertible Notes arising from specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency, 100% of the principal of and accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, on the Convertible Notes will automatically become due and payable.
The following events are considered an “event of default,” which may result in acceleration of the maturity of the Convertible Notes: (1) default in any payment of interest on any Convertible Note when due and payable and the default continues for a period of 30 consecutive days; (2) default in the payment of the accreted principal amount of any Convertible Note when due and payable at its stated maturity, upon optional redemption, upon any required repurchase, upon declaration of acceleration or otherwise; (3) our failure to comply with our obligation to convert the Convertible Notes in accordance with the Indenture upon exercise of a holder’s conversion right and such failure continues for three business days; (4) our failure to give certain required notices under the Indenture, in each case when due and such failure continues for five business days; (5) our failure to comply with certain of our obligations under the Indenture; (6) our failure for 60 days after written notice from the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Convertible Notes then outstanding to comply with any of our other agreements contained in the Convertible Notes or Indenture; (7) default by us or any of our significant subsidiaries with respect to any mortgage, agreement or other instrument under which there may be outstanding, or by which there may be secured or evidenced, any indebtedness for borrowed money in excess of $15,000,000 (or its foreign currency equivalent) in an aggregate of us and/or any such significant subsidiary, whether such indebtedness now exists or shall hereafter be created (i) resulting in such indebtedness becoming or being declared due and payable prior to its stated maturity date or (ii) constituting a failure to pay the principal of any such indebtedness when due and payable (after the expiration of all applicable grace periods) at its stated maturity, upon required repurchase, upon declaration of acceleration or otherwise and in the cases of clauses (i) and (ii), such acceleration shall not have been rescinded or annulled or such failure to pay or default shall not have been cured or waived, or such indebtedness is not paid or discharged, as the case may be, within 30 days after written notice to us by the Trustee or to us and the Trustee by holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes then outstanding in accordance with the Indenture; (8) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency, or reorganization of us or any of our significant subsidiaries; or (9) a final judgment or judgments for the payment of $15,000,000 (or its foreign currency equivalent) (excluding any amounts covered by insurance) or more (excluding any amounts covered by insurance) in the aggregate rendered against us or any of our significant subsidiaries, which judgment is not discharged, bonded, paid, waived or stayed within 60 days after (i) the date on which the right to appeal thereof has expired if no such appeal has commenced, or (ii) the date on which all rights to appeal have been extinguished.
The Company may elect that the sole remedy for an event of default relating to a failure by it to comply with certain reporting obligations set forth in the Indenture, will after the occurrence of such an event of default consist exclusively of the right to receive additional interest on the Convertible Notes at a rate equal to (i) 1.00% per annum of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes outstanding for each day during the period beginning on, and including, the date on which such event of default first occurred and ending on the earlier of (x) the date on which such event of default is cured or validly waived and (y) the 365th day immediately following, and including, the date on which such event of default first occurred. On the 366th day 
after such event of default (if the event of default relating to the reporting obligations is not cured or waived prior to such 366th day), the Trustee by notice to us, or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Convertible Notes by notice to us and the Trustee, may declare 100% of the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Convertible Notes to be due and payable.
If on or after the date that is six months after the last original issue date of the Convertible Notes, the Company has not satisfied the reporting conditions (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the requirement for current Form 10 information) set forth in Rule 144(c) and (i)(2) under the Securities Act, or the Convertible Notes are not otherwise able to be traded pursuant to Rule 144 by holders other than the Company’s affiliates or holders that were affiliates of the Company at any time during the three months immediately preceding (as a result of restrictions pursuant to U.S. securities laws or the terms of the Indenture or the Convertible Notes), the Company will pay additional interest on the Convertible Notes at a rate equal to 1.00% per annum of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes outstanding, in each case for each day for which the Company’s failure to file has occurred and is continuing or the Convertible Notes are not otherwise able to be traded pursuant to Rule 144 as described above.
Initially, a maximum of 36,214,960 shares of common stock may be issued upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, based on the initial maximum conversion rate of 233.6449 shares of the Company’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes, which is subject to customary and other adjustments described in the Indenture.
Encina Credit Agreement Term Loan
On November 1, 2021, the Company repaid in full the amounts owed to the EBC Lenders with the funds raised through the sale of the Convertible Notes.
Idemitsu Offtake Agreement
On February 14, 2022, Vertex Refining Alabama LLC (“Vertex Refining”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Master Offtake Agreement dated February 4, 2022 (the “Offtake Agreement”) with Idemitsu Apollo Renewable Corp. (“Idemitsu”). Pursuant to the Offtake Agreement, Vertex Refining agreed to sell Idemitsu renewable diesel which is planned to be produced by the Mobile Refinery, subject to completion of the acquisition of the Mobile Refinery and the capital project discussed above. Following phase 1 of the planned modifications of the Mobile Refinery, it is expected to produce 10,000 barrels of renewable diesel and following phase 2, 14,000 barrels of renewable diesel. “Phase 1” means the first stage of conversion of the hydrocracker unit to renewable diesel production and “phase 2” means the second stage of the conversion of the hydrocracker conversion which will be completed after the new hydrogen plant is operating at ratable hydrogen supply. During the term of the Offtake Agreement, Idemitsu agreed to purchase all of the renewable diesel produced at the refinery (provided it meets certain specifications), up to a maximum volume of 14,000 barrels per day.
The obligations of the parties under the Offtake Agreement are subject to certain conditions precedent, including (a) the closing of the acquisition of the Mobile Refinery occurring prior to April 30, 2022; (b) the parties having entered into a mutually acceptable storage agreement for the storage of renewable diesel on or before the commencement of commercial operations of the refinery following the completion of the capital project (the “COD”); (c) Idemitsu having delivered to Vertex Refining the Guaranty (discussed below) on or before COD; (d) absence of certain actions or proceedings to set aside, enjoin or prevent the performance by either party of its respective obligations under the agreement; (e) no project assets, related facilities or products having been affected adversely or threatened to be affected adversely by any material loss or damage, subject to certain exceptions; (f) the mutual representations and warranties of each party being true and correct; and (g) COD having occurred within eighteen months of the Company’s acquisition of the Mobile Refinery.
If a party terminates the Offtake Agreement as a result of any of the conditions precedent required under the Offtake Agreement, as summarized above, not being satisfied, neither party has any further obligation under the Offtake Agreement to the other party, except that (i) Vertex Refining is responsible for payment to Idemitsu of a Termination Payment (defined below), in the event the Master Agreement is terminated due to the failure to satisfy or waive the condition that COD occur within eighteen months of the Company’s acquisition of the Mobile Refinery, and (ii) each party shall remain liable to the other party for any and all damages incurred as a result of a breach by a party of its representations, warranties or any other obligations prior to such termination. “Termination Payment” means the actual and documented storage costs incurred by Idemitsu to acquire or lease 300,000 barrels of storage tanks for twelve (12) months. The Termination Payment is payable in monthly installments in an amount equal to the monthly storage costs incurred by Idemitsu.
A performing party may terminate the Offtake Agreement (a) by delivery of a written notice to the other Party within thirty days of any of the conditions precedent required under the Offtake Agreement, as summarized above, not being waived or satisfied by the date required for such condition, or a determination that a condition is not capable of being satisfied by the date indicated for such condition, or (b) if there is an event of default under the agreement.
The initial term of the Offtake Agreement (the “Initial Term”) commences on COD and continues for a period of five years thereafter, subject to certain early termination provisions set forth in the agreement, including, but not limited to, the right of either party to request a review of the terms of the agreement prior to the commencement of the 4th and 5th contract years of the agreement, which, if triggered, and if the parties fail to mutually agree in writing to any such requested revisions, will result in the agreement expiring three years or four years after COD, as applicable. The parties may mutually agree to extend the term of the agreement beyond the Initial Term pursuant to the terms of the Offtake Agreement.
Pursuant to the Offtake Agreement, Idemitsu shall be the exclusive offtake party for certain amounts of renewable diesel produced by Vertex Refining, up to a total of 14,000 barrels of renewable diesel, provided that if Idemitsu fails to purchase or accept any portion of such committed volume in accordance with the terms of the Offtake Agreement, Vertex Refining has the right to sell such product and regulatory credits to a third-party. Vertex Refining is also required to transfer all regulatory credits associated with the product purchased to Idemitsu pursuant to the terms of the Offtake Agreement.
The Offtake Agreement also includes a requirement that Idemitsu pay for certain minimum volumes of renewable diesels per month and that Vertex Refining supply certain minimum volumes per month, subject to certain make whole payments or reimbursements due from the appropriate party.
Vertex Refining may also, in its sole discretion, offer to Idemitsu renewable diesel and associated regulatory credits produced by the Mobile Refinery in excess of the committed volume.
In the event the refinery produces and Vertex Refining offers for sale during the term of the agreement, renewable products other than renewable diesel (“Other Renewable Products”), prior to offering the Other Renewable Products to any third party, Vertex Refining is required to first offer such products to Idemitsu and Idemitsu has a 14 day right of first refusal to purchase such Other Renewable Products.
Idemitsu agreed to pay to Vertex Refining a per gallon of product purchased at an indexed, spot-market price at the time of production.
The Offtake Agreement includes customary representations and warranties of the parties, requirements of the parties, force majeure provisions, reimbursement obligations, limitations on damages, events of default, and confidentiality obligations. The agreement also requires Vertex Refining to (i) register with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a renewable fuel producer; (ii) use reasonable efforts to maintain such registration and generate the maximum allowable number of certain renewable fuel credits on all product delivered to Idemitsu; and (iii) maintain all documentation and any other information required under the EPA renewable fuel standard.
Pursuant to the Offtake Agreement, Idemitsu has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase from Vertex Refining, quantities of ultra low sulfur diesel (“ULSD”), up to an amount required by Idemitsu to blend with the renewal diesel to a ratio of 0.1% ULSD or greater; provided that Vertex Refining has such volumes available for sale. The purchase price for any ULSD purchased by Idemitsu from Vertex shall be the monthly average of the daily prompt CME Group ULSD futures (heating oil) settlement for each day during the month in which delivery occurred.
As a condition to the effectiveness of the Offtake Agreement, Idemitsu’s parent entity, Idemitsu Kosan Co., Ltd. (“Idemitsu Parent”), must enter into a Continuing Guaranty in favor of Vertex Refining (the “Guaranty”) prior to COD. Pursuant to the Guaranty, Idemitsu Parent will guaranty the full and prompt payment when due, whether upon acceleration, demand or otherwise, and at all times thereafter, of the indebtedness of Idemitsu under the Offtake Agreement and related agreements and the punctual performance of all of such payment obligations under the Offtake Agreement, with such liability limited to the lesser of (i) the amounts owed to Vertex Refining under the Offtake Agreement and related agreements; and (ii) $100,000,000. The Guaranty will have customary covenants and requirements, including requiring Idemitsu Parent to subordinate any debt owed by Idemitsu to Idemitsu Parent to the obligations to Vertex Refining under the Guaranty.
Commitment Letter
On February 17, 2022, the Company and the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Vertex Refining, entered into a Commitment Letter with a syndicate of lenders in respect of a three-year, $125 million first-lien senior secured term loan facility (the “Term Loan”). The closing date and the funding of the Term Loan are subject to the closing of the Mobile Acquisition, in addition to various conditions precedent, as set forth in more detail in the Commitment Letter.
The Term Loan syndicate is led by, among others, certain funds and accounts managed by BlackRock Financial Management, Inc., Whitebox Advisors LLC and Highbridge Capital Management, LLC. The Term Loan proceeds are expected to be used by the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries to fund a portion of the purchase price of the Mobile Refinery, a portion of a planned renewable diesel conversion project at the Mobile Refinery, liquidity needs, and certain fees and expenses 
associated with the closing of the Term Loan. The Term Loan is expected to be secured by substantially all of the present and after-acquired assets of the Company and its subsidiaries and to be guaranteed by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries.
The commitments and undertakings of the lenders under the Commitment Letter will automatically terminate on the first to occur of (a) April 1, 2022, (b) consummation of the acquisition of the Mobile Refinery without use of the facility or if the lenders become aware of a breach of the exclusivity provisions of the Commitment Letter, (c) the closing date of the Term Loan and the release of the Term Loan proceeds to the Company, (d) the termination of the Refinery Purchase Agreement in accordance with its terms prior to the closing date, and (e) the date upon which the Company breaches its obligations under the Commitment Letter or otherwise fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the Commitment Letter (unless such breach or failure is cured within two (2) business days following the Company’s receipt of notice of such breach or failure).
As described in more detail in the Commitment Letter, the Term Loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the sum of (i) the greater of (x) the per annum rate publicly quoted from time to time by The Wall Street Journal as the “Prime Rate” in the United States minus 1.50% as in effect on such day and (y) the Fed Funds rate for such day plus 0.50% (subject to a floor of 1.0%), plus (ii) 8.75%. The facility will also be issued with an original issue discount of 1.5%. Beginning on the first anniversary of the closing date of the facility, the loan will amortize in equal quarterly installments in aggregate annual amounts equal to 5.0% of the original principal amount of the facility. The facility will be subject to certain mandatory prepayment obligations as described in the Commitment Letter, and to be further documented in the definitive loan agreements.
Additionally, subject to the terms of the Commitment Letter, if an escrow agent has been appointed by the parties and the parties have entered into an escrow agreement prior to the termination of the Commitment Letter, but in no event prior to February 21, 2022, the lenders have agreed to fund the full amount of the Term Loan (less certain amounts) into the escrow account. If the conditions required for the Term Loan funding have been satisfied prior to the date that the Commitment Letter terminates, the amount of funds in the escrow account is to be distributed to the Company, net of certain fees and expenses, otherwise such funds are to be returned to the lenders upon termination of the Commitment Letter. 
As a closing condition to the facility, the Company will issue warrants (the “Lender Warrants”) to purchase 2.75 million shares of common stock of the Company to the lenders, on a pro-rata basis based on each lender’s lending commitments. The Lender Warrants will be subject to customary registration and antidilution rights, have a three-year term and a $4.50 per share exercise price.
The lenders received certain exclusivity rights for future fundings of the Company, relating to any transaction that would replace all or any portion of the funding under the facility, as described in greater detail in the Commitment Letter.
The obligation of the lenders party to the Commitment Letter to honor their respective commitments under the Commitment Letter is subject to satisfaction (or waiver) of certain conditions precedent, including, without limitation, the negotiation and receipt of customary closing documents, together with certain collateral documents, execution of a working capital credit agreement by the Company and certain third party lenders, execution of an intercreditor agreement, the issuance of the Lender Warrants, the consummation of the acquisition of the Mobile refinery, substantially simultaneously with the initial borrowings under the facility, completion of applicable “know your customer” requests and delivery of documentation related thereto, no material adverse effect with respect to the Company, the occurrence of no events of default, completion of lender due diligence, payment of required fees, delivery of customary financial reporting information, specified representations and warranties, perfection of certain security interests, and delivery of customary opinions. The Company will pay certain fees and expenses in connection with obtaining the facility. Given the conditional nature of the Commitment Letter and the commitments of the lenders thereunder, the lenders may not be obligated to provide funding under the planned facility, and, as a result, the Company may not be able to consummate such financing or obtain such loan funds, on the terms described in the Commitment Letter, if at all.
On March 2, 2022, (1) the Company, (2) Vertex Refining, (3) the Lenders and (4) Cantor Fitzgerald Securities (the “Escrow Agent”), entered into an Escrow Agreement (the “Escrow Agreement”). Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, on March 2, 2022 each of the Lenders deposited their pro rata portion of the $125 million loan amount, less certain upfront fees, into an escrow account. Such funds will be released to (i) Vertex Refining if the Credit Agreement is entered into by April 1, 2022, and certain other conditions precedent are satisfied by that date or (ii) the Lenders if (a) the Credit Agreement is not entered into by such date and the other conditions precedent are not satisfied, (b) the Acquisition (as defined below) is consummated without use of the loan amount under the Credit Agreement or if the Lenders become aware of a breach under the exclusivity provision of the Commitment Letter, (c) the termination of the Refinery Purchase Agreement in accordance with its terms prior to the closing date of the Credit Agreement, or (d) the date upon which Vertex Refining breaches its obligations under the Commitment Letter or otherwise fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the Commitment Letter (unless such breach or failure is cured within two business days following Vertex Refining’s receipt of notice of such breach or failure). The 
Escrow Agreement includes customary indemnification obligations of Vertex Refining and the Company and certain limited indemnification obligations of the Lenders. The Company is required to pay a ‘ticking fee’ equal to 10.5% per annum on the gross aggregate amount of escrow account proceeds, beginning on March 2, 2022, which was the date funds were deposited, into the escrow account.
Heartland and Myrtle Grove Purchase Agreements
On February 25, 2022, Vertex Splitter Corporation (“Vertex Splitter”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company entered into (1) a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Tensile-Vertex Holdings LLC (“Tensile-Vertex”), an affiliate of Tensile and Tensile-Heartland (the “Heartland Purchase Agreement”); and (2) a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Tensile-Vertex and Tensile-MG (the “Myrtle Grove Purchase Agreement”, and together with the Heartland Purchase Agreement, the “Purchase Agreements”).
As discussed above, Tensile-Heartland holds 65% of Heartland SPV and Tensile-MG owns 15% of MG SPV, and Tensile-Vertex holds 100% of both Tensile-Heartland and Tensile-MG.
Pursuant to the Heartland Purchase Agreement, the Company, through Vertex Splitter, agreed to acquire 100% of the outstanding securities of Tensile-Heartland and pursuant to the Myrtle Grove Purchase Agreement, the Company, through Vertex Splitter, agreed to acquire 100% of the outstanding securities of Tensile-MG, from Vertex-Tensile, the result of which will be that Vertex Splitter will own 100% of each of Heartland SPV and MG SPV.
Pursuant to the Heartland Purchase Agreement, the purchase price payable by Vertex Splitter to Vertex-Tensile, for 100% of Tensile-Heartland is $35 million (the “Base Amount”), plus an amount accrued and accruing from and after May 31, 2021, on the Base Amount on a daily basis at the rate of 22.5% per annum compounded on the last day of each calendar quarter plus an amount equal to any and all cash and cash equivalents of Tensile-Heartland, as of the closing date, which we currently anticipate will total an aggregate of approximately $44 million.

The Heartland Purchase Agreement includes customary representations of the parties, requires Vertex Splitter to maintain officer and director insurance for Tensile-Heartland for at least six years following the closing; requires that they bear their own fees and expenses, except that each party is required to pay the fees and expenses of the other party upon termination of the agreement in certain situations; includes customary indemnification obligations; and includes mutual releases of the parties, effective upon closing.
The Heartland Purchase Agreement may be terminated prior to closing, by the mutual consent of the parties; by Vertex Splitter if Vertex-Tensile has failed to consummate the agreement, or breached a covenant, representation or warranty set forth in the agreement, that prevents such closing, and such breach is not cured, if capable of being cured, within 30 days after notice thereof; by Vertex-Tensile if Vertex Splitter has failed to consummate the agreement, or breached a covenant, representation or warranty set forth in the agreement, that prevents such closing, and such breach is not cured, if capable of being cured, within 30 days after notice thereof; or by either party if there is a final, non-appealable judgment preventing the closing.
Pursuant to the Myrtle Grove Purchase Agreement, the purchase price payable by Vertex Splitter to Vertex-Tensile, for 100% of Tensile-MG is estimated to be approximately $7 million, and will be based on the value of the Class B Unit preference of MG SPV held by Tensile-MG, plus capital invested by Tensile-MG in MG SPV (which has not been returned as of the date of payment), plus cash and cash equivalents held by Tensile-MG as of the closing date. The purchase contemplated by the Myrtle Grove Purchase Agreement is required to take place on March 31, 2022, or earlier as mutually agreed by the parties, subject to customary conditions to closing. The Myrtle Grove Purchase Agreement includes customary representations of the parties, requires Vertex Splitter to maintain officer and director insurance for Tensile-MG for at least six years following the closing; requires that they bear their own fees and expenses, except that each party is required to pay the fees and expenses of the other party upon termination of the agreement in certain situations; includes customary indemnification obligations; and includes mutual releases of the parties, effective upon closing.
The Myrtle Grove Purchase Agreement may be terminated prior to closing, by the mutual approval of the parties; by Vertex Splitter if Vertex-Tensile has failed to consummate the agreement, or breached a covenant, representation or warranty set forth in the agreement, that prevents such closing, and such breach is not cured, if capable of being cured, within 30 days after notice thereof; by Vertex-Tensile if Vertex Splitter has failed to consummate the agreement, or breached a covenant, representation or warranty set forth in the agreement that prevents such closing, and such breach is not cured, if capable of being cured, within 30 days after notice thereof; or by either party if there is a final, non-appealable judgment preventing the closing.
Tensile-Vertex, Vertex Splitter and the Company (collectively, Vertex Splitter and the Company, the “Vertex Parties”) also entered into a Side Letter Re Purchase and Sale Agreements (the “Side Letter”), pursuant to which the parties agreed that in the event that (i) the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Myrtle Grove Purchase Agreement does not occur on or prior to March 31, 2022, and/or (ii) the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Heartland Purchase Agreement does not occur on or prior to June 30, 2022, then, in addition to any of the rights of Tensile-Vertex under the Purchase Agreements: (a) the Vertex Parties will use their best efforts to cause the closings under the Purchase Agreements to occur, including without limitation by raising debt financing, selling equity in a private or public transaction, selling assets and/or otherwise doing all things necessary or appropriate to raise the funds necessary to make the payments required to be made by Vertex Splitter under the Purchase Agreements, in each case on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, subject to certain exceptions; (b) upon the written election of Tensile-Vertex, the Vertex Parties will and will cause their affiliates to consent to the distribution or other payment of any and all cash and cash equivalents of Heartland SPV (including any proceeds from the repayment of that certain $7,000,000 promissory note, issued by Vertex Operating to Heartland SPV on July 1, 2021, as amended to date (the “Heartland Note”)) and any direct and indirect subsidiaries to Tensile-Vertex, with such distribution or other payment to be structured as specified by Tensile-Vertex so as to be tax efficient for Tensile-Vertex; and (c) Tensile-Vertex may, with written notice, cause Heartland SPV to initiate a process intended to result in a sale of Heartland SPV, with Tensile-Vertex being entitled, upon the consummation of such sale, of the greater of (i) 65% of the total net equity proceeds of such sale, and (ii) the amount due to Tensile-Vertex under the Heartland Purchase Agreement as of the date of the consummation of such sale.
Heartland Note Amendment
Also on February 25, 2022, Vertex Operating, the Company and Heartland SPV, entered into a Second Amendment to Promissory Note (the “Second Note Amendment”), which amended the Heartland Note, to extend the due date of the Heartland Note until the earlier of (i) June 30, 2022; and (ii) five (5) calendar days following the closing of a sale of substantially all the assets of Vertex Refining OH, LLC (“VROH”), and/or the sale of membership interests in VROH possessing voting control (with the consent of the Company), provided that the Heartland Note may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty and without the consent of Heartland SPV. The Heartland Note accrues interest at the applicable federal rate of interest from time to time, increasing to 12% upon an event of default.
Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)
The COVID-19 pandemic and actions of governments and others in response thereto has resulted in significant business and operational disruptions, including business closures, supply chain disruptions, travel restrictions, stay-at-home orders, and limitations on the availability and effectiveness of the workforce. The worldwide vaccine rollouts in 2021 have allowed governments to ease COVID-19 restrictions and lockdown protocols; however, the recent increase in COVID-19 cases resulting from the Delta and Omicron variants has created questions about whether lockdown protocols must be adjusted and the ultimate impact of those variants is unknown. Notwithstanding such ‘stay-at-home’ orders, to date, our operations have for the most part been deemed an essential business under applicable governmental orders based on the critical nature of the products we offer.
We sell products and services primarily in the U.S. domestic oil and gas commodity markets. During 2021, we continued to see incremental improvements in the demand for our products and services consistent with the lifting of travel and other government restrictions and the ongoing and state vaccination efforts. Over the year, our business has been gradually recovering after the decline in 2020. 
Our goal through this downturn has been to remain disciplined in allocating capital and to focus on liquidity and cash preservation. We are taking the necessary actions to right-size the business for expected activity levels.
The full extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business and operations currently cannot be estimated and will depend on a number of factors including the scope and duration of the global pandemic, the efficacy of, ability to manufacture a sufficient amount of, and the willingness of the general public to obtain, vaccines.
Currently we believe that we have sufficient cash on hand and will generate sufficient cash through operations to support our operations for the foreseeable future; however, we will continue to evaluate our business operations based on new information as it becomes available and will make changes that we consider necessary in light of any new developments regarding the pandemic.
The pandemic is developing rapidly and the full extent to which COVID-19 will ultimately impact us depends on future developments, including the duration and spread of the virus, the impact of vaccines and virus mutations and the potential seasonality of new outbreaks.
Description of Business Activities:
We are an environmental services company that recycles industrial waste streams and off-specification commercial chemical products. Our primary focus is recycling used motor oil and other petroleum by-products. We are engaged in operations across the entire petroleum recycling value chain including collection, aggregation, transportation, storage, re-refinement, and sales of aggregated feedstock and re-refined products to end users. We operate in three segments: 
(1) Black Oil, 
(2) Refining and Marketing, and 
(3) Recovery. 
We currently provide our services in 15 states, primarily in the Gulf Coast, Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. For the rolling twelve-month period ending December 31, 2021, we aggregated approximately 87.5 million gallons of used motor oil and other petroleum by-product feedstocks and managed the re-refining of approximately 79.7 million gallons of used motor oil with our proprietary TCEP, VGO and Base Oil processes.
Our Black Oil segment collects and purchases used motor oil directly from third-party generators, aggregates used motor oil from an established network of local and regional collectors, and sells used motor oil to our customers for use as a feedstock or replacement fuel for industrial burners. We operate a refining facility that uses our proprietary TCEP and we also utilize third-party processing facilities. TCEP’s original purpose was to re-fine used oil into marine cutterstock; however, in the third quarter of fiscal 2015, that use ceased to be economically accretive, and instead, we operated TCEP for the purposes of pre-treating our used motor oil feedstock prior to shipping to our facility in Marrero, Louisiana. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the original purpose of TCEP once again became economically viable and at that time we switched to using TCEP to re-fine used oil into marine cutterstock; provided that with the decline in oil prices and challenges in obtaining feedstock during early 2020, we switched back to using TCEP for the purposes of pre-treating our used motor oil feedstock prior to shipping to our facility in Marrero, Louisiana, and continuing through the filing date of this report. 
We also operate a facility in Marrero, Louisiana, which facility re-refines used motor oil and also produces VGO and own 85% of an entity which owns a re-refining complex in Belle Chasse, Louisiana, which we call our Myrtle Grove facility.
Our Refining and Marketing segment aggregates and manages the re-refinement of used motor oil and other petroleum by-products and sells the re-refined products to end customers. In addition, we are distributing refined motor fuels such as gasoline, blended gasoline products and diesel used as engine fuels, to third party customers who typically resell these products to retailers and end consumers.
    Our Recovery segment includes a generator solutions company for the proper recovery and management of hydrocarbon streams as well as metals which includes transportation and marine salvage services throughout the Gulf Coast.
Black Oil Segment
Discontinued operations of Vertex include the Black Oil Segment, also referred to as the UMO Business, Refer to “Part II” - “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”, Note 19, “Discontinued Operations” for additional information. 
Our Black Oil segment is engaged in operations across the entire used motor oil recycling value chain including collection, aggregation, transportation, storage, refinement, and sales of aggregated feedstock and re-refined products to end users. We collect and purchase used oil directly from generators such as oil change service stations, automotive repair shops, manufacturing facilities, petroleum refineries, and petrochemical manufacturing operations. We own a fleet of 43 collection vehicles, which routinely visit generators to collect and purchase used motor oil. We also aggregate used oil from a diverse network of approximately 50 suppliers who operate similar collection businesses to ours.
We manage the logistics of transport, storage and delivery of used oil to our customers. We own a fleet of 30 transportation trucks and more than 80 aboveground storage tanks with over 8.6 million gallons of storage capacity. These assets are used by both the Black Oil segment and the Refining and Marketing segment. In addition, we also utilize third parties for the transportation and storage of used oil feedstocks. Typically, we sell used oil to our customers in bulk to ensure efficient delivery by truck, rail, or barge. In many cases, we have contractual purchase and sale agreements with our suppliers and customers, respectively. We believe these contracts are beneficial to all parties involved because it ensures that a minimum 
volume is purchased from collectors and generators, a minimum volume is sold to our customers, and we are able to minimize our inventory risk by a spread between the costs to acquire used oil and the revenues received from the sale and delivery of used oil. Also, as discussed above under “Description of Business Activities”, from time to time, when market conditions warrant (i.e., when oil prices are sufficiently high), we have used our proprietary TCEP technology to re-refine used oil into marine fuel cutterstock. Due to the decline in oil prices and challenges in obtaining feedstock during the first quarter of 2020, we have used TCEP solely to pre-treat our used motor oil feedstock prior to shipping to our facility in Marrero, Louisiana. In addition, at our Marrero, Louisiana facility, we produce a Vacuum Gas Oil (VGO) product that is sold to refineries as well as to the marine fuels market. At our Columbus, Ohio facility (Heartland Petroleum), the ownership of 65% of which was transferred to Tensile in connection with the Heartland SPV (discussed above), effective January 1, 2020, we produce a base oil product that is sold to lubricant packagers and distributors.
Refining and Marketing Segment
Our Refining and Marketing segment is engaged in the aggregation of feedstock, re-refining it into higher value end products, and selling these products to our customers, as well as related transportation and storage activities. We aggregate a diverse mix of feedstocks including used motor oil, petroleum distillates, transmix and other off-specification chemical products. These feedstock streams are purchased from pipeline operators, refineries, chemical processing facilities and third-party providers, and are also transferred from our Black Oil segment. We have a toll-based processing agreement in place with Monument Chemical Port Arthur, LLC (formerly with KMTEX) to re-refine feedstock streams, under our direction, into various end products that we specify. Monument Chemical uses industry standard processing technologies to re-refine our feedstocks into pygas, gasoline blendstock and marine fuel cutterstock. We sell all of our re-refined products directly to end-customers or to processing facilities for further refinement. In addition, we are distributing refined motor fuels such as gasoline, blended gasoline products and diesel used as engine fuels, to third party customers who typically resell these products to retailers and end consumers.
Recovery Segment
The Company’s Recovery Segment includes a generator solutions company for the proper recovery and management of hydrocarbon streams, the sales and marketing of Group III base oils through January 2021, and other petroleum-based products, together with the recovery and processing of metals.
Thermal Chemical Extraction Process
We own the intellectual property for our patented TCEP. TCEP is a technology which utilizes thermal and chemical dynamics to extract impurities from used oil which increases the value of the feedstock. We intend to continue to develop our TCEP technology and design with the goal of producing additional re-refined products, which may include lubricating base oil.
TCEP differs from conventional re-refining technologies, such as vacuum distillation and hydrotreatment, by relying more heavily on chemical processes to remove impurities rather than temperature and pressure. Therefore, the capital requirements to build a TCEP plant are typically much less than a traditional re-refinery because large feed heaters, vacuum distillation columns, and a hydrotreating unit are not required. The end product currently produced by TCEP is used as fuel oil cutterstock. Conventional re-refineries produce lubricating base oils or product grades slightly lower than base oil that can be used as industrial fuels or transportation fuel blendstocks.
We currently estimate the cost to construct a new, fully-functional, commercial facility using our TCEP technology, with annual processing capacity of between 25 and 50 million gallons at another location would be approximately $10 - $15 million, which could fluctuate based on throughput capacity. The facility infrastructure would require additional capitalized expenditures which would depend on the location and site specifics of the facility. Our TCEP technology converts feedstock into a low sulfur marine fuel that can be sold into the new 0.5% low sulfur marine fuel specification mandated under International Maritime Organization (IMO) rules which went into effect on January 1, 2020. As described above, due to the decline in oil prices and challenges in obtaining feedstock in the early part of 2020, we are currently using TCEP for the purposes of pre-treating our used motor oil feedstock prior to shipping to our facility in Marrero, Louisiana. We have no current plans to construct any other TCEP facilities at this time. 
Organizational Structure 
    The following chart reflects our current organization structure, including significant subsidiaries (all of which are wholly-owned, except as discussed below):
Our Industry
The used oil recycling industry is comprised of multiple participants including generators, collectors, aggregators, processors, re-refiners and end users. Generators are entities that generate used oil through conducting oil changes on consumer and commercial vehicles, or machinery and heavy equipment. Collectors are intermediaries who collect used oil from generators as an on-site removal service and transport to aggregators, processors and re-refiners. The collection market is highly fragmented and industry estimates indicate that there are 350-400 used oil collection companies in the United States. Aggregators are specialized businesses that purchase used oil and petroleum by-products from multiple collectors and sell and deliver it as feedstock to processors and re-refiners. Processors and re-refineries, utilize a processing technology to convert the used oil or petroleum by-product into a higher-value feedstock or end-product. Used oil is any oil that has been refined from crude oil or any synthetic oil that has been used and, as a result of such use, is contaminated by physical or chemical impurities. Physical impurities could include contamination by metal shavings, sawdust, or dirt. Chemical impurities could include contamination by water or benzene, or degradation of lubricating additives.
Conventional re-refineries typically employ vacuum distillation and hydrotreating processes to transform used oil into various grades of base oil. Vacuum distillation is a process that removes emulsified contaminated water and separates used oil into vacuum gas oil and light fuels. The vacuum gas oil is then hydrotreated to produce lubricating base oil. Hydrotreating is a process which combines chemical catalysts, heat, and pressure to remove impurities such as sulfur, chlorine, and oxygen and to stabilize the end product. A re-refined lubricating base oil is of equal quality and will last as long as a virgin base oil. In addition, other re-refining processes transform used oil into product grades slightly lower than base oil. These products, along with vacuum gas oil and the end product produced by TCEP, are commonly referred to as intermediate products and are used as industrial fuels or transportation fuel blendstocks.
The petroleum by-products industry is driven by the financial and environmental benefits of recycling, as well as by the amount of petroleum by-product generated each year. Used oil is typically used: (a) as an industrial burner oil, where the used oil is dewatered, filtered and demineralized for use in industrial burners; (b) as hydraulic oil; (c) as bitumen-based products (for road surfacing and roofing); (d) as an additive in manufactured products; or (e) as a re-refined base oil for use as a lubricant, hydraulic or transformer oil - which is how the Company uses such used oil. The market value of recycled oil is based, in large part, on its end use. In general, the market price for used motor oil that is burned as an industrial fuel is driven by the cost of competing fuels, including natural gas, while the market value of re-refined used motor oil is driven by competing petroleum products. 
The extent to which the financial benefits of recycling used oil are realized is driven by operating efficiency in aggregating, storing and transporting used oil supply; the extent to which the used oil is re-refined; and to the price spread between natural gas and crude oil.
According to the U.S. Department of Energy’s Report to Congress dated December 2020, entitled, “Used Oil Management and Beneficial Reuse Options to Address Section 1: Energy Savings from Lubricating Oil Public Law 115-345” (the “U.S. Dept. of Energy Report”), of the annual total U.S. lubricant demand, an average of between 900 million and 1 billion gallons of used oil is collected commercially, while approximately from 200 million gallons of used oil is improperly disposed of into the environment. Of the 900 million and 1 billion gallons collected, approximately 287 million gallons are re-refined into lubricating base oils, approximately 195 million gallons are re-refined into intermediate products with grades slightly lower than base oil, approximately 380 million gallons are burned as an industrial fuel source, approximately 50 million gallons are blended into High Sulphur Fuel Oil (HSFO); and roughly 20 million gallons of used oil is exported—either directly or as-is, or indirectly through blending into HSFO for export to non-marine utility and industrial plants overseas (all numbers are estimates as of 2017). Also pursuant to the U.S. Dept. of Energy Report, each year the U.S. is estimated to generate 425 million used automotive oil filters containing approximately 160,000 tons of steel units and 18 million gallons of oil, , according to a January 2002 feasibility study prepared for the U.S. Department of Energy. We expect that the amount of used oil being re-refined into base oils and intermediate products in the U.S. will stay relatively flat in 2022.
As of the date of this Report, the approximate market price for used oil at the generator level is approximately $0.30 to $0.40 per gallon (which is required to be paid to acquire such used oil), the approximate market price of intermediate re-refined products ranges from $1.85 to $2.00 per gallon, and the approximate price for lubricating base oil ranges from $3.75 to $4.00 per gallon, representing a U.S. market size of approximately $2.0 - $2.75 billion for recycled oil.
As with the financial benefits of recycling used oil, the environmental benefits are also driven by its end use. Environmental regulations prohibit the disposal of used oil in sewers or landfills because used motor oil is insoluble and contains heavy metals and other contaminants that make it detrimental to the environment if improperly disposed; one gallon of used oil can contaminate up to 1 million gallons of fresh drinking water. Additionally, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, it takes 42 gallons of crude oil, but only 1 gallon of used oil, to produce 2.5 quarts of new, high-quality lubricating oil. Compared to burning used oil as an industrial fuel, re-refined oil significantly reduces the amount of toxic heavy metals and greenhouse gases and other pollutants introduced into the environment. In addition, the use of re-refined motor oil conserves petroleum that would have otherwise been refined into virgin base stock oil.
We believe that the used oil recycling market has significant growth potential through increasing the percentage of recycled oil that is re-refined rather than burned as a low-cost industrial fuel. We believe that the financial and environmental benefits of re-refining used oil combined with consumer and commercial demand for high-quality, environmentally responsible products will drive growth in demand for re-refined oil and re-refining capacity in the United States. Furthermore, we believe that increasing consumer and industrial awareness of the environmental impact of improperly disposing used oil may drive additional market growth as approximately 200 million gallons of used oil generated each year are improperly disposed rather than recycled.
Used motor oil is burned by various users such as asphalt companies, paper mills and industrial facilities as an alternative to their base fuels, to offset operational costs. Therefore, the commercial price of used oil is typically slightly less than the base fuels for the burners. Similarly, re-refined oil is used as a substitute for various virgin petroleum-based products with pricing driven by the market price of crude oil. Since there is not an active marketplace for used and re-refined oil prices, we use the prices of natural gas and crude as benchmarks in our industry. Typically, the spread between crude and natural gas prices is an accurate proxy for the potential incremental value of re-refining used oil.
Our Competitive Strengths
Large, Diversified Feedstock Supply Network.
We obtain our feedstock supply through a combination of direct collection activities and purchases from third-party suppliers. We believe our balanced direct and indirect approach to obtaining feedstock is highly advantageous because it enables us to maximize total supply and reduce our reliance on any single supplier and the risk of not fulfilling our minimum feedstock sale quotas. We collect feedstock directly from over 4,500 generators including oil change service stations, automotive repair shops, manufacturing facilities, petroleum refineries and petrochemical manufacturing operations, as well as brokers. We aggregate used oil from a diverse network of approximately 50 suppliers who operate similar collection businesses to ours. 
Strategic Relationships.
We have established relationships with key feedstock suppliers, storage and transportation providers, oil re-refineries, and end-user customers. We believe our relationships with these parties are strong, in part due to our high level of customer service, competitive prices, and our ability to contract (for purchase or sale) long-term, minimum monthly feedstock commitments. We believe that our strategic relationships could lead to contract extensions and expanded feedstock supply or purchase agreements.
Proprietary Technology.
Our proprietary TCEP technology produces a fuel oil cutterstock for the fuel oil market or a refining feedstock. We believe we are able to build TCEP re-refining facilities at a significantly lower cost than conventional re-refineries. We estimate the cost to build a TCEP plant with capacity of up to 50 million gallons at approximately $10 - $15 million, whereas a similar sized base oil plant with vacuum distillation towers and a hydrotreater can cost in excess of $50 million. Notwithstanding the lower cost of TCEP plants, with volume of feedstock during 2021, we do not believe that it makes economic sense to expand our TCEP technology at this time due to the fixed operating costs involved. 
Logistics Capabilities.
We have extensive expertise and experience managing and operating feedstock supply chain logistics and multimodal transportation services for customers who purchase our feedstock or higher-value, re-refined products. We believe that our scale, infrastructure, expertise, and contracts enable us to cost effectively transport product and consistently meet our customers’ volume, quality and delivery schedule requirements.
Scale of Operations.
We believe that the size and scale of our operations is a significant competitive advantage when competing for new business and maintaining existing customer relationships. Price is one of the main competitive factors in the feedstock collection industry and because we are able to effectively leverage our fixed operating costs and economies of scale, we believe that our prices are competitive. Through our network of suppliers and customers, we aggregate a large amount of feedstock, which enables us to enter into minimum purchase and sale contracts as well as accept large volume orders year-round. We believe this is a competitive advantage because it minimizes our suppliers’ inventory risk and ensures our customers’ minimum order volumes are satisfied. In addition, we believe our end customers prefer to work with an exclusive supplier rather than manage multiple customer relationships.
Diversified End Product Sales.
We believe that the diversity of the products we sell reduces our overall risk and exposure to price fluctuations. Prices for petroleum-based products can be impacted significantly by supply and demand fluctuations which are not correlated with general commodity price changes. For instance, in a rising commodity price environment with a significant over-supply of base oil, the price of base oil may fall precipitously while the price of gasoline increases; and in a falling commodity price environment with a shortage of base oil, the price of base oil may increase precipitously while the price of gasoline falls. We offer a diversified product mix consisting of used motor oil, fuel oil, pygas, and gasoline blendstock. We can also control our mix of end products by choosing to either resell collected feedstock or re-refine it into a higher-value product.
Management Team.
We are led by a management team with expertise in petroleum recycling, finance, operations, and re-refinement technology. Each member of our senior management team has more than 22 years of industry experience. We believe the strength of our management team will help our success in the marketplace.
Our Business Strategy
The principal elements of our strategy include:
Pursue Strategic Acquisitions and Partnerships
 We plan to grow market share by consolidating feedstock supply through partnering with or acquiring collection and aggregation assets. Our executive team has a proven ability to evaluate resource potential and identify acquisition targets. The 
acquisitions and/or partnerships could increase our revenue and provide better control over the quality and quantity of feedstock available for resale and/or upgrading as well as providing additional locations for the potential future implementation of TCEP (assuming future favorable market conditions). We also intend to diversify our revenue by acquiring complementary recycling service businesses, refining assets and technologies, and other vertically integrated businesses or assets. We believe we can realize synergies on acquisitions by leveraging our customer and vendor relationships, infrastructure, and personnel, and by eliminating duplicative overhead costs.
During the second quarter 2021, we announced the entry into an agreement to acquire the Mobile refinery from Equilon Enterprises LLC d/b/a Shell Oil Products US, Shell Oil Company and Shell Chemical LP, subsidiaries of Shell plc ("Shell"), subsidiaries of royal Dutch Shell plc. Upon completion of the acquisition, Vertex intends to initiate two capital projects; (1) modify the Mobile refinery's hydrocracking unit to produce renewable diesel fuel on a standalone basis; and (2) development of a pre-treatment facility intended to provide for increased renewable feedstock optionality. 
Expand Feedstock Supply Volume
We intend to expand our feedstock supply volume by growing our collection and aggregation operations. We plan to increase the volume of feedstock we collect directly by developing new relationships with generators and working to displace incumbent collectors; increasing the number of collection personnel, vehicles, equipment, and geographical areas we serve; and acquiring collectors in new or existing territories. We intend to increase the volume of feedstock we aggregate from third-party collectors by expanding our existing relationships and developing new vendor relationships. We believe that our ability to acquire large feedstock volumes will help to cultivate new vendor relationships because collectors often prefer to work with a single, reliable customer rather than manage multiple relationships and the uncertainty of excess inventory.
Broaden Existing Customer Relationships and Secure New Large Accounts
We intend to broaden our existing customer relationships by increasing sales of used motor oil and re-refined products to these accounts. In some cases, we may also seek to serve as our customers’ primary or exclusive supplier. We also believe that as we increase our supply of feedstock and re-refined products, we will have the opportunity to secure larger customer accounts that require a partner who can consistently deliver high volumes.
Re-Refine Higher Value End Products
We intend to develop, lease, or acquire technologies to re-refine our feedstock supply into higher value end products, including assets or technologies which complement TCEP. From the third quarter of 2015 to the fourth quarter of 2019, we utilized TCEP to pre-treat our used motor oil feedstocks prior to shipping to our facility in Marrero, Louisiana; however, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, we once again began using TCEP for the purpose of producing finished cutterstock until the first quarter of 2020, when such use became no longer economical due to falling oil prices, and we once again switched to using TCEP to pre-treat used motor oil feedstocks. We hope that continued improvements in our technologies and investments in additional technologies will enable us to upgrade feedstock into higher value end products, such as fuels and lubricating base oil that command higher market prices. 
Products and Services
We generate substantially all of our revenue from the sale of eight categories of product and services. All of these products are commodities that are subject to various degrees of product quality and performance specifications.
Base Oil
Base oil is an oil to which other oils or substances are added to produce a lubricant. Typically, the main substance in lubricants, base oils, are refined from crude oil.
Pygas
Pygas, or pyrolysis gasoline, is a product that can be blended with gasoline as an octane booster or that can be distilled and separated into its components, including benzene and other hydrocarbons.
Industrial Fuel
Industrial fuel is a distillate fuel oil which is typically a blend of lower quality fuel oils. It can include diesel fuels and fuel oils such as No. 1, No. 2 and No. 4 diesel fuels that are historically used for space heating and power generation. Industrial fuel is typically a fuel with low viscosity, as well as low sulfur, ash, and heavy metal content, making it an ideal blending agent.
Distillates
Distillates are finished fuel products such as gasoline and diesel fuels.
Oil Collection Services
Oil collection services include the collection, handling, treatment and sales of used motor oil and products which include used motor oil (such as oil filters) which are collected from our customers. 
Metals
Metals consist of recoverable ferrous and non-ferrous recyclable metals from manufacturing and consumption. Scrap metal can be recovered from pipes, barges, boats, building supplies, surplus equipment, tanks, and other items consisting of metal composition. These materials are segregated, processed, cut-up and sent back to a steel mill for re-purposing.
Other re-refinery products
 Other re-refinery products include the sales of asphalt, condensate, recovered products, and other petroleum products.
VGO/Marine fuel sales
 VGO/Marine fuel sales relate to the sale of low sulfur fuel meeting the criteria for IMO 2020 compliant marine fuels.
The way that the product categories above fit into our three operating segments (1) Black Oil; (2) Refining and Marketing; and (3) Recovery, are indicated below:

 | Black Oil(1) | Refining and Marketing(2) | Recovery(3)
Base oil | X | | X 
Pygas | | X | 
Industrial fuel | X | X | 
Distillates | | X | 
Oil collection services | X | | 
Metals | | | X 
Other re-refinery products | X | | X 
VGO/Marine fuel sales | X | | 

(1) As discussed in greater detail above under “Black Oil Segment”, the Black Oil segment consists primary of the sale of (a) petroleum products which include base oil and industrial fuels—which consist of used motor oils, cutterstock and fuel oil generated by our facilities; (b) oil collection services—which consist of used oil sales, burner fuel sales, antifreeze sales and service charges; (c) the sale of other re-refinery products including asphalt, condensate, recovered products, and used motor oil; (d) transportation revenues; and (e) the sale of VGO (vacuum gas oil)/marine fuel. 
(2) As discussed in greater detail above under “Refining and Marketing Segment”, the Refining and Marketing segment consists primarily of the sale of pygas; industrial fuels, which are produced at a third-party facility (Monument Chemical); and distillates. 
(3) As discussed in greater detail above under “Recovery Segment”, the Recovery segment consists primarily of revenues generated from the sale of ferrous and non-ferrous recyclable Metal(s) products that are recovered from manufacturing and consumption. It also includes revenues generated from trading/marketing of Group III Base Oils.
Suppliers
We conduct business with a number of used oil generators, as well as a large network of suppliers that collect used oil from used oil generators. In our capacity as a collector of used oil, we purchase feedstock from approximately 4,500 businesses, such as oil change service stations, automotive repair shops, manufacturing facilities, petroleum refineries, and petrochemical manufacturing operations, which generate used oil through their operations.
In our capacity as a broker of used oil, we work with approximately 50 suppliers that collect used oil from businesses such as those mentioned above. 
Customers
The Black Oil segment sells used oil, VGO, base oil and other petroleum feedstocks to numerous customers in the Gulf Coast and Midwest regions of the United States. The primary customers of its products are packagers, distributers, blenders and industrial burners, as described above as well as re-refiners of the feedstock. The Black Oil segment is party to various feedstock sale agreements whereby we sell used oil feedstock to third parties. The agreements provide for us to sell certain minimum gallons of used oil feedstock per month at a price per barrel equal to our direct costs, plus certain commissions, based on the quality and quantity of the used oil we supply.
The Recovery segment does not rely solely on contracts, but mainly on the spot market as well as a strategic network of customers and vendors to support the purchase and sale of its products which are commodities. It also relies on project-based work which it bids on from time to time of which there is no guarantee or assurance of repeat business. 
KMTEX/Monument Chemical Tolling Agreement
On or around April 17, 2013, and effective June 1, 2012, we entered into a Tolling Agreement with KMTEX, Ltd. (“KMTEX” and the agreement as amended to date, the “Tolling Agreement”). The Company was previously party to a tolling agreement with KMTEX which expired pursuant to its terms on June 30, 2010, provided that the parties had continued to operate under the terms of the expired agreement until their entry into the April 2013 Tolling Agreement.
On December 14, 2016, and effective January 1, 2017, we entered into a Third Amendment to Processing Agreement with KMTEX. The amendment formally extended the date of the initial term of the Tolling Agreement to December 31, 2018, provided that if not terminated by either party by written notice to the other, received within ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the initial term, as amended (or any Extension Term, defined below), the agreement automatically renews for a successive one (1) year period (an “Extension Term”). The Tolling Agreement can be automatically extended for up to six (6) Extension Terms from the end of the extended initial term. The amendment also updated the pricing terms of the agreement. As the Tolling Agreement, as amended, was not terminated by either party within 90 days of December 31, 2020, the term of the Tolling Agreement automatically extended for an additional one (1) year period through December 31, 2021, and such agreement could be extended for up to three (3) additional one (1) year extensions. 
During the year ended December 31, 2021, Monument Chemical Port Arthur, LLC. ("Monument Chemical") acquired KMTEX LLC. Effective January 1, 2022, we entered into a Custom Chemical Manufacturing Agreement with Monument Chemical, which replaced and superseded the prior agreement we had with KMTEX. Pursuant to that agreement, Monument Chemical agreed to provide us custom chemical manufacturing and related services in Port Arthur, Texas. The agreement has a term of one year (automatically renewable for additional one year terms thereof, subject to the termination provisions of the agreement) and requires us to pay certain per pound processing fees to Monument Chemical, as well as certain other fees and charges, as well as certain tank rental fees. The agreement contains certain customary confidentiality, indemnification, limitation of liability and insurance requirements, and customary representations and warranties of the parties.
Swap Agreement and Base Oil Agreement
On January 29, 2016, we (through Vertex Operating) and Safety-Kleen Systems, Inc. (“Safety-Kleen”) entered into a Swap Agreement (the “Swap Agreement”). The Swap Agreement has a term of five years, beginning January 29, 2016, and automatically renews for additional one-year terms thereafter unless either party provides the other 90 days prior written notice of their intention not to renew prior to any automatic extension. Pursuant to the Swap Agreement, we and Safety-Kleen agreed to swap certain quantities of used oil feedstock (the agreement includes monthly maximums, quarterly minimums and maximums, and annual maximums of used oil feedstock volume required to be ‘swapped’) between Safety-Kleen's plant in Nevada and our Marrero, Louisiana plant and/or the Cedar Marine Terminal in Baytown, Texas, on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis, with any shortfall in the amount of used oil feedstock ‘swapped’ on a quarterly basis, being paid for in cash based on a discount to U.S. Platts mid-range per gallon rate for Gulf Coast No. 6, 3% oil (the “Platts”). The Swap Agreement could be terminated with 30 days prior written notice in the event either party failed to meet the specifications for oil feedstock set forth in the agreement, a party failed to deliver the required minimum quarterly volumes of oil feedstock during any three consecutive quarters, or a party materially breached a term of the agreement. Effective January 29, 2021, the Swap Agreement initial term expired and the agreement was not renewed.
Additionally, we (through Vertex Operating) and Safety-Kleen also entered into a Base Oil Agreement on January 29, 2016 (the “Base Oil Agreement”). The Base Oil Agreement provides for us to purchase from Safety-Kleen, and Safety-Kleen to sell to us, certain required quantities of base oils and other finished lubricants described in greater detail in the Base Oil Agreement (the “Base Oil”)(the agreement contains quarterly and annual maximum volumes of Base Oil to be acquired by us). The agreement has a term of five years and automatically renews for additional one-year terms thereafter unless either party provides the other 90 days prior written notice of their intention not to renew prior to any automatic extension. Effective January 29, 2021, the Base Oil Agreement initial term expired and the agreement was not renewed. 
Competition
The industrial waste and brokerage of petroleum products industries are highly competitive. There are numerous small to mid-size firms that are engaged in the collection, transportation, treatment and brokerage of virgin and used petroleum products. Competitors include, but are not limited to: Safety-Kleen, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Clean Harbors, Inc.), Rio Energy, Inc., Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc., and Origin Americas LLC (formerly Flex Oil Service, LLC). These competitors actively seek to purchase feedstock from local, regional and industrial collectors, refineries, pipelines and other sources. Competition for these feedstocks may result in increasing prices to obtain used motor oil and transmix feedstocks critical to the success of our business. In order to remain competitive, we must control costs and maintain strong relationships with our feedstock suppliers. Our network of generators and collectors minimizes our reliance on any single supplier. A portion of the sales of the collected and aggregated used motor oil product are based on supply contracts which include a range of prices which change based on feedstock quality specifications and volumes. This pricing structure helps to insulate us from inventory risk by ensuring a spread between costs to acquire used motor oil feedstock and the revenues received for delivery of the feedstock. We believe that price and service are the main competitive factors in the used motor oil collection industry. We believe that our ability to accept and transport large volumes of oil year round gives us an advantage over many of our competitors. In addition, we believe that our storage capacity and ability to process the streams of products we receive as well as our ability to transport the end product by barge, rail and truck provide further advantages over many of our competitors.
Employees
The Company works diligently to attract the best talent from a diverse range of sources in order to meet the current and future demands of our business. We have established relationships with trade schools, world-class universities, professional associations and industry groups to proactively attract talent.
We have a strong employee value proposition that leverages our unique culture, collaborative working environment, shared sense of purpose, desire to do the right thing and ground-breaking work to attract talent to our Company. Although we have a broad footprint in our business, our people feel like they are amongst friends and can be themselves. We empower them to find new and better ways of doing things and the scale of our business means that careers can develop in exciting and unexpected directions.
In 2021, we hired 70 new employees at our Company. When we hire talent, they tend to stay at the Company. The average employee has 5.85 years of service. As of February 21, 2022, we employed 282 full-time employees. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. 
Seasonality
The industrial hydrocarbon recovery business is seasonal to the extent that it is dependent on streams from seasonal industries. For example, asphalt plants burn recycled waste oil in their process, placing pricing and supply availability constraints on the industry during the good weather construction and road building seasons. In our current markets, road paving typically occurs from late spring to early fall. Therefore, it is somewhat easier to procure certain waste streams during winter months when competition for used motor oil feedstock is historically not as strong. Currently we are seeing increased demand for used motor oil feedstocks throughout the year due to the addition of re-refining technologies in the marketplace.
Governmental Regulation, Including Environmental Regulation and Climate Change
Our operations are subject to stringent United States federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to health and safety or the protection of the environment. Additional laws and regulations, or changes in the interpretations of existing laws and regulations, that affect our business and operations may be adopted, which may in turn impact our financial condition. 
    Additionally, the U.S. Departments of Transportation, Coast Guard and Homeland Security as well as various federal, state, local and foreign agencies exercise broad powers over our transportation operations, generally governing such activities as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, safety and permits to conduct transportation business. We may also become subject to new or more restrictive regulations that the Departments of Transportation and Homeland Security, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency or other authorities impose, including regulations relating to engine exhaust emissions, the hours of service that our drivers may provide in any one time-period, security and other matters.
Our compliance challenges arise from various legislative and regulatory bodies influenced by political, environmental, health and safety concerns.
For example, changes in federal regulations relating to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether and new sulfur limitations for product shipped in domestic pipelines resulted in tightened specifications of gasoline blendstock that we were refining, causing a corresponding decrease in revenue and gross margin growth during 2016, as compared to prior years. This change in regulation, as well as other emission-related regulations, had a material impact on the entire petroleum industry, and we adapted and managed our operations by finding materials better suited to comply with these regulations. As such, it is possible that future changes in federal regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results from operations.
We must also obtain and maintain a range of federal, state and local permits for our various logistical needs as well as our planned industrial processes.
The following is a summary of the more significant existing health, safety and environmental laws and regulations to which our operations are subject.
Hazardous Substances and Waste
The United States Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended, referred to as “CERCLA” or the “Superfund” law, and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain defined persons, including current and prior owners or operators of a site where a release of hazardous substances occurred and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these “responsible persons” may be liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies.
In the course of our operations, we occasionally generate materials that are considered “hazardous substances” and, as a result, may incur CERCLA liability for cleanup costs. Also, claims may be filed for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other pollutants. We also generate solid wastes that are subject to the requirements of the United States Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or “RCRA,” and comparable state statutes.
Although we use operating and disposal practices that are standard in the industry, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been released at properties owned or leased by us now or in the past, or at other locations where these hydrocarbons and wastes were taken for treatment or disposal. Under CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws, we could be required to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater), or to perform remedial activities to prevent future contamination.
Air Emissions
The Clean Air Act, as amended, or “CAA,” and similar state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain approvals or permits for construction, modification or operation of certain projects or facilities and may require use of emission controls.
Global Warming and Climate Change
While we do not believe our operations raise climate change issues different from those generally raised by the commercial use of fossil fuels, legislation or regulatory programs that restrict greenhouse gas emissions in areas where we conduct business or that would require reducing emissions from our truck fleet could increase our costs.
Water Discharges
We operate facilities that are subject to requirements of the United States Clean Water Act, as amended, or “CWA,” and analogous state laws for regulating discharges of pollutants into the waters of the United States and regulating quality standards for surface waters. Among other things, these laws impose restrictions and controls on the discharge of pollutants, including into navigable waters as well as the protection of drinking water sources. Spill prevention, control and counter-measure requirements under the CWA require implementation of measures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a hydrocarbon spill. Other requirements for the prevention of spills are established under the United States Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended, or “OPA”, which amended the CWA and applies to owners and operators of vessels, including barges, offshore platforms and certain onshore facilities. Under OPA, regulated parties are strictly liable for oil spills and must establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to cover liabilities related to an oil spill for which such parties could be statutorily responsible.
State Environmental Regulations
Our operations involve the storage, handling, transport and disposal of bulk waste materials, some of which contain oil, contaminants and other regulated substances. Various environmental laws and regulations require prevention, and where necessary, cleanup of spills and leaks of such materials and some of our operations must obtain permits that limit the discharge of materials. Failure to comply with such environmental requirements or permits may result in fines and penalties, remediation orders and revocation of permits. Specifically, in Texas, we are subject to rules and regulations promulgated by the Texas Railroad Commission and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, including those designed to protect the environment and monitor compliance with water quality. In Louisiana, we are subject to rules and regulations promulgated by the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources as to environmental and water quality issues, and the Louisiana Public Service Commission as to allocation of intrastate routes and territories for waste water transportation. We believe that we are in compliance with regulations in the states where we conduct business.
Occupational Safety and Health Act
We are subject to the requirements of the United States Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, or “OSHA,” and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of employee health and safety. OSHA’s hazard communication standard requires that information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations be maintained and provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens.
Transportation Regulations
We may conduct interstate motor carrier (trucking) operations that are subject to federal regulation by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, or “FMCSA,” a unit within the United States Department of Transportation, or “USDOT.” The FMCSA publishes and enforces comprehensive trucking safety regulations, including rules on commercial driver licensing, controlled substance testing, medical and other qualifications for drivers, equipment maintenance, and drivers’ hours of service, referred to as “HOS.” The agency also performs certain functions relating to such matters as motor carrier registration (licensing), insurance, and extension of credit to motor carriers’ customers. Another unit within USDOT publishes and enforces regulations regarding the transportation of hazardous materials, or “hazmat.” 
In December 2010, the FMCSA launched a program called Compliance, Safety, Accountability, or “CSA,” in an effort to improve commercial truck and bus safety. A component of CSA is the Safety Measurement System, or “SMS,” which analyzes all safety violations recorded by federal and state law enforcement personnel to determine a carrier’s safety performance. The SMS is intended to allow the FMCSA to identify carriers with safety issues and intervene to address those 
problems. Although our trucking operations currently hold a “Satisfactory” safety rating from FMCSA (the best rating available), the agency has announced a future intention to revise its safety rating system by making greater use of SMS data in lieu of on-site compliance audits of carriers. We cannot predict the effect such a revision may have on our safety rating.
Our intrastate trucking operations are also subject to various state environmental transportation regulations discussed under “Environmental Regulations” above. Federal law also allows states to impose insurance and safety requirements on motor carriers conducting intrastate business within their borders, and to collect a variety of taxes and fees on an apportioned basis reflecting miles actually operated within each state.
    HOS regulations establish the maximum number of hours that a commercial truck driver may work. A FMCSA rule reducing the number of hours a commercial truck driver may work each day became effective in February 2012 and the compliance date of selected provisions was July 1, 2013. The rule, which is intended to reduce the risk of fatigue and fatigue-related crashes and harm to driver health, prohibits a driver from driving if more than eight hours have passed since the driver’s last off-duty or sleeper berth break of at least 30 minutes and limits the use of the restart to once a week, which, on average, cut the maximum work week from 82 to 70 hours. 
    A new regulation primarily impacting our marine bunker fuel production is known as “IMO 2020”. On January 1, 2020, the International Maritime Organization (the "IMO") implemented a new regulation for a 0.50% global sulphur cap for marine fuels. Under the new global cap, ships that traverse the oceans will be required to use marine fuels with a sulphur content of no more than 0.50%, versus the prior limit of 3.50%, in an effort to reduce the amount of sulphur oxide and decrease pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the global shipping fleet. 
    Our Marrero facility produces and sells IMO 2020 compliant bunker fuel.
Inflation and Commodity Price Risk
We have seen increases in costs when comparing to the prior year as well as inflationary and supply chain pressures across our business in areas such as labor, transportation, supplies and overall energy related expenses. We purchase petroleum and petroleum by-products for consolidation and delivery, as well as for our own refining operations. By virtue of constant changes in the market value of petroleum products, we are exposed to fluctuations in both revenues and expenses. We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of crude oil, No. 6 Fuel Oil and refined petroleum products. To reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows, we use commodity derivative instruments, such as futures and options. Our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors.
    We primarily use commodity derivative instruments as economic hedges, which are not designated as hedging instruments, and we use fair value and cash flow hedges from time to time. 
    Our objectives for holding economic hedges are to (i) manage price volatility in certain feedstock and refined petroleum product inventories and fixed-price purchasing, and (ii) lock in the price of forecasted feedstock, refined petroleum product, and refined petroleum product sales at existing market prices. 
 The purchase of our used motor oil feedstock tends to track with natural gas pricing due to the market’s typical practice of substituting used motor oil for natural gas as a fuel source for various industrial processes. On the other hand, the prices of the products that may in the future be generated through the re-refining processes that we hope to develop are expected to track with market pricing for marine diesel and vacuum-gas oil. The recent rise in oil prices has increased the spread between the price of used motor oil, feedstock and re-refining end-products.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology, trade secrets, technical know-how and other proprietary information. We also enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees.
