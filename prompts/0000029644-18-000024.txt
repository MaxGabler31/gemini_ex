Item 1. Business
General
Donaldson Company, Inc. (Donaldson or the Company) was founded in 1915 and organized in its present corporate form under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1936.
The Company is a worldwide manufacturer of filtration systems and replacement parts. The Company’s core strengths are leading filtration technology, strong customer relationships and its global presence. Products are manufactured at 43 plants around the world and through three joint ventures.
The Company has two operating segments: Engine Products and Industrial Products. Products in the Engine Products segment consist of replacement filters for both air and liquid filtration applications, air filtration systems, liquid filtration systems for fuel, lube and hydraulic applications, and exhaust and emissions systems. The Engine Products segment sells to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in the construction, mining, agriculture, aerospace, defense and truck end markets and to independent distributors, OEM dealer networks, private label accounts and large equipment fleets. Products in the Industrial Products segment consist of dust, fume and mist collectors, compressed air purification systems, gas and liquid filtration for food, beverage and industrial processes, air filtration systems for gas turbines, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane-based products and specialized air and gas filtration systems for applications including hard disk drives and semi-conductor manufacturing. The Industrial Products segment sells to various dealers, distributors, OEMs of gas-fired turbines and OEMs and end users requiring clean filtration solutions and replacement filters.
As a worldwide business, the Company’s results of operations are affected by conditions in the global economic environment. Under most economic conditions, the Company’s market diversification between its OEM and replacement parts customers, its diesel engine and industrial end markets, its global end markets and its diversification through technology has helped to limit the impact of weakness in any one product line, market or geography on the consolidated operating results of the Company.

Seasonality
A number of the Company’s end markets are dependent on the construction, agricultural and power generation industries, which are generally stronger in the second half of the Company’s fiscal year. The first two quarters of the fiscal year also contain the traditional holiday periods, which are typically characterized by more customer plant closures.
Competition
Principal methods of competition in both the Engine and Industrial Products segments are technology, innovation, price, geographic coverage, service and product performance. The Company participates in a number of highly competitive filtration markets in both segments. The Company believes it is a market leader within many of its product lines, specifically within its Off-Road and On-Road product lines for OEMs, and has a significant business in the aftermarket for replacement filters. The Engine Products segment’s principal competitors include several large global competitors and many regional competitors, especially in the Aftermarket business. The Industrial Products segment’s principal competitors vary from country to country and include several large regional and global competitors and a significant number of smaller competitors who compete in a specific geographical region or in a limited number of product applications.
Raw Materials
The principal raw materials that the Company uses are steel, filter media and petrochemical-based products, including plastics, rubber and adhesives. Purchased raw materials represent approximately 60% to 65% of the Company’s cost of goods sold. Steel, including fabricated parts, and filter media each represent approximately 20% of the cost of goods sold. The remainder is primarily made up of petroleum-based products and other raw material components. 
The cost the Company paid for steel during fiscal 2018 varied by grade, but in aggregate, increased during the fiscal year. The steel cost increase was related to U.S. import restrictions placed on foreign-made steel and significant import tariffs placed on steel and aluminum products. The Company’s cost of filter media also varies by type and increased year-over-year. The filter media price increase was driven largely by global price increases on pulp products. The cost of petroleum-based products have also increased year-over-year. The Company anticipates continuing price pressure across our major commodities in fiscal 2019, as compared with fiscal 2018. The Company enters into supply arrangements with certain of its suppliers that allow the Company to reduce volatility in its costs. The Company strives to recover or offset all material cost increases through selective price increases to its customers and the Company’s cost reduction initiatives, which include material substitution, resourcing of vendors, process improvement and product redesigns.
The Company concentrates sourcing of some materials from one supplier or a few supplies, and global supplier production capacity is limited.
Patents and Trademarks
The Company owns various patents and trademarks, which it considers in the aggregate to constitute a valuable asset, including patents and trademarks for products sold under the Ultra-Web®, PowerCore®, Torit®, SynteqTM XP and Donaldson® trademarks. 
Major Customers
The Company had no customers that accounted for over 10% of net sales in the years ended July 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016. The Company had no customers that accounted for over 10% of gross accounts receivable at July 31, 2018 or July 31, 2017.
Backlog
At August 31, 2018, the backlog of orders expected to be delivered within 90 days was $467.1 million. The 90-day backlog at August 31, 2017 was $395.5 million. The backlog of orders expected to be delivered within 90 days increased 26.3% for the Engine Products segment and increased 3.7% for the Industrial Products segment. The increase is due to the continued strong demand across multiple product lines. Backlog is one of many indicators of business conditions in the Company’s markets. However, it is not always indicative of future results for a number of reasons, including the timing of the receipt of orders in many of the Company’s engine OEM and industrial markets and the mix and types of orders in backlog.
Research and Development
During the years ended July 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company spent $59.9 million, $54.7 million and $55.5 million, respectively, on research and development activities, which was 2.2%, 2.3% and 2.5% of net sales, respectively. Research and development expenses include scientific research and the application of scientific advances to the development of new and improved products and their uses. Substantially all commercial research and development is performed in-house.

Environmental Matters
The Company does not anticipate any material effect on its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position during fiscal 2019 due to compliance with government regulations regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment.
Employees
The Company employed approximately 14,000 people as of July 31, 2018.
Geographic Areas
Both of the Company's operating segments serve customers in all geographic regions. The United States (U.S.) represents the largest individual market for the Company's products. Financial information by geographic region appears in Note 18 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
