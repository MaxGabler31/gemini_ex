We also sell related marine products, including engines, trailers, parts, and accessories. In addition, we provide repair, maintenance, and slip and storage services; we arrange related boat financing, insurance, and extended service contracts; we offer boat and yacht brokerage sales and yacht charter services. In the British Virgin Islands we offer the charter of power catamarans, through MarineMax Vacations. Fraser Yachts Group and Northrop & Johnson, leading superyacht brokerage and luxury yacht services companies with operations in multiple countries, are also included in this segment.
 As of September 30, 2022, the Product Manufacturing segment included activity of Cruisers Yachts, a wholly-owned MarineMax subsidiary, manufacturing sport yacht and yachts with sales through our select retail dealership locations and through independent dealers, and Intrepid Powerboats. Cruisers Yachts is recognized as one of the world’s premier manufacturers of premium sport yacht and yachts, producing models from 33’ to 60’ feet. Intrepid Powerboats, also a wholly-owned MarineMax subsidiary, is a producer of customized boats, which incorporate the desires of each individual owner. Intrepid Powerboats follows a direct-to-consumer distribution model and has received many awards and accolades for its innovations and high-quality craftsmanship that create industry leading products in their categories.
 In October 2022, we completed the acquisition of IGY Marinas. IGY Marinas maintains a network of strategically positioned luxury marinas situated in yachting and sport fishing destinations around the world. IGY Marinas has created standards for service and quality in nautical tourism around the world. It offers a global network of marinas in the Americas, the Caribbean, and Europe, delivering year-round accommodations. IGY Marinas caters to a wide variety of luxury yachts, while also being exclusive home ports for some of the world’s largest megayachts.
 We are the largest retailer of Sea Ray and Boston Whaler recreational boats which are manufactured by Brunswick Corporation (“Brunswick”). Sales of new Brunswick boats accounted for approximately 23% of our revenue in fiscal 2022. Sales of new Sea Ray and Boston Whaler boats, both divisions of Brunswick, accounted for approximately 11% and 9%, respectively, of our revenue in fiscal 2022. Brunswick is a world leading manufacturer of marine products and marine engines. We have agreements with Brunswick covering Sea Ray products and Boston Whaler products and are the exclusive dealer of Sea Ray and Boston Whaler boats in almost all of our geographic markets. Additionally, we are the exclusive dealer for Harris aluminum boats, a division of Brunswick, in many of our geographic markets. We also are the exclusive dealer for Italy-based Azimut-Benetti Group, or Azimut, for Azimut and Benetti mega-yachts, yachts, and other recreational boats for the United States. Sales of new Azimut boats and yachts accounted for approximately 8% of our revenue in fiscal 2022. Additionally, we are the exclusive dealer for certain other premium brands that serve certain industry segments in our markets as shown by the table on page three.
 We also are involved in other boating-related activities. We sell used boats at our retail locations, online, and at various third-party marinas and other offsite locations; we sell marine engines and propellers, primarily to our retail customers as replacements for their existing engines and propellers; we sell a broad variety of parts and accessories at our retail locations and at various offsite locations, and through our print catalog; we offer maintenance, repair, and slip and storage services at most of our retail locations; we offer finance and insurance products at most of our retail locations and at various offsite locations and to our customers and independent boat dealers and brokers; we offer boat and yacht brokerage sales at most of our retail locations and at various offsite locations; and we conduct a charter business, which is based in the British Virgin Islands, in which we offer customers the opportunity to charter third-party and Company owned power catamarans.


MarineMax commenced operations as a result of the March 1, 1998 acquisition of five previously independent recreational boat dealers. Since that time, we have acquired 32 additional previously independent recreational boat dealers, multiple marinas, five boat brokerage operations, two superyacht service companies, two full-service yacht repair operations, and two boat and yacht manufacturers. We attempt to capitalize on the experience and success of the acquired companies in order to establish a high standard of customer service and responsiveness in the highly fragmented retail boating industry. As a result of our emphasis on premium brand boats, our average selling price for a new boat in fiscal 2022 was approximately $256,000, an increase from approximately $227,000 in fiscal 2021, compared with the industry average selling price for calendar 2021 of approximately $71,000 based on industry data published by the National Marine Manufacturers Association. We consider a store to be one or more retail locations that are adjacent or operate as one entity or a superyacht services region. Same-store sales include all stores that were open and operated throughout both the current and comparative prior period. Our same-store sales increased 25% in fiscal 2020, increased 13% in fiscal 2021, and increased 5% in fiscal 2022.
 The U.S. recreational boating industry generated approximately $56.7 billion in retail sales in calendar 2021, which is above the former peak of $49.4 billion in calendar 2020. The retail sales include sales of new and used boats; marine products, such as engines, trailers, equipment, and accessories; and related expenditures, such as fuel, insurance, docking, storage, and repairs. Retail sales of new and used boats, engines, trailers, and accessories accounted for approximately $45.7 billion of these sales in 2021 based on industry data from the National Marine Manufacturers Association. The highly-fragmented retail boating industry generally consists of small dealers that operate in a single market and provide varying degrees of merchandising, professional management, and customer service. We believe that many small dealers find it increasingly difficult to make the managerial and capital commitments necessary to achieve higher customer service levels and upgrade systems and facilities as required by boat manufacturers and often demanded by customers. We also believe that many dealers lack an exit strategy for their owners. We believe these factors contribute to our opportunity to gain a competitive advantage in current and future markets, through market expansions and acquisitions.
 Material Updates to Our Strategy
 Since the last discussion of our strategy in our Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, our primary goal remains to enhance our position as the leading recreational boat and yacht retailer and preeminent superyacht services company. Pursuant to this strategy, we have completed recent acquisitions including Fraser Yachts Group, Northrop & Johnson, Skipper Marine Holdings, Inc. and certain affiliates (collectively, "SkipperBud’s"), KCS International Holdings, Inc. and certain affiliates ("Cruisers Yachts"), Intrepid Powerboats, Texas MasterCraft, and IGY Marinas. Our acquisitions of Fraser Yachts Group, Northrop & Johnson, SkipperBud’s, and IGY Marinas increases our superyacht brokerage and luxury yacht services and marina/storage services. Additionally, IGY Marinas’ scale and strategic geographic footprint enables it to provide vertically integrated services to superyacht customers as they travel to popular destinations. Our acquisition of IGY Marinas offers a global network of marinas in the Americas, the Caribbean, and Europe, delivering year-round accommodations. IGY Marinas caters to a wide variety of luxury yachts, while also being exclusive home ports for some of the world’s largest megayachts.
In addition, we continue to broaden and strengthen our digital initiatives. Our digital services are always available and offer our full selection of boats, yachts and charters, as well as our expert team to answer customers’ questions and help them find a boat virtually. Additionally, our Boatyard digital platform allows marine businesses effective and customized digital solutions delivering great customer experiences by enabling customers to interact through a personalized experience tailored to their needs.
 Development of the Company; Expansion of Business
 Since our initial acquisitions in March 1998, we have acquired 32 additional previously independent recreational boat dealers, multiple marinas, five boat brokerage operations, two superyacht service companies, two full-service yacht repair operations, and two boat and yacht manufacturers. Acquired dealers operate under the MarineMax name.
 We continually attempt to enhance our business by providing a full range of services, offering extensive and high-quality product lines, maintaining prime retail locations, pursuing the MarineMax One Price hassle-free sales approach, and emphasizing a high level of customer service and satisfaction.
 We also from time to time evaluate opportunities to expand our operations by potentially acquiring recreational boat dealers to expand our geographic scope, expanding our product lines, opening new retail locations within or outside our existing territories, and offering new products and services for our customers and by potentially acquiring companies to pursue contract manufacturing or vertical integration strategies.
 Apart from acquisitions and our superyacht service locations, we have opened 35 new retail locations in existing territories, excluding those opened on a temporary basis for a specific purpose. We also monitor the performance of our retail locations and close retail locations that do not meet our expectations. Based on these factors and previous depressed economic conditions, we have closed 76 retail locations since March 1998 which includes the 2008 financial crisis, excluding those opened on a temporary basis for a specific purpose and including 4 during the last three fiscal years.

The following table sets forth information regarding the businesses that we have acquired and their geographic regions since fiscal year 2011.

(1)Product line owned by MarineMax
 
We add brands with the intent to either offer a migration path for our existing customer base or fill a gap in our product offerings. As a result, we believe that new brands we offer are generally complementary and do not negatively impact the business generated from our other prominent brands. We also discontinue offering product lines from time to time, primarily based upon customer preferences.
 We strive to maintain our core values of high customer service and satisfaction and plan to continue to pursue strategies that we believe will enable us to achieve long-term success and growth. We believe our expanded product offerings have strengthened our same-store sales growth. We plan to further expand our business through both acquisitions in new territories and new store openings in existing territories. In addition, we plan to continue to expand our other traditional services, including conducting used boat sales at our retail locations, at offsite locations, and digitally; selling related marine products, including engines, trailers, parts, and accessories at our retail locations and at various offsite locations; providing maintenance, repair, and storage services at most of our retail locations; offering our customers the ability to finance new or used boat purchases and to purchase extended service contracts and arrange insurance coverage, including boat property, disability, undercoating, gel sealant, fabric protection, trailer tire and wheel protection, and casualty insurance coverage; offering boat and yacht brokerage sales at most of our retail locations and at various offsite locations; offering boat storage; conducting our yacht charter business; and manufacturing sport yacht and yachts. Our expansion plans will depend, in large part, upon economic and industry conditions.
 U.S. Recreational Boating Industry
 The U.S. recreational boating industry generated approximately $56.7 billion in retail sales in calendar 2021, which is above the former peak of $49.4 billion in calendar 2020. The retail sales include sales of new and used recreational boats; marine products, such as engines, trailers, parts, and accessories; and related boating expenditures, such as fuel, insurance, docking, storage, and repairs. Retail sales of new and used boats, engines, trailers, equipment, and accessories accounted for approximately $45.7 billion of such sales in calendar 2021. To provide historical perspective, annual retail recreational boating sales were $17.9 billion in 1988, but declined to a low of $10.3 billion in 1992 based on industry data published by the National Marine Manufacturers Association. We believe this decline was attributable to several factors, including a recession, the Gulf War, and the imposition throughout 1991 and 1992 of a luxury tax on boats sold at prices in excess of $100,000. The luxury tax was repealed in 1993, and retail boating sales increased each year thereafter except for 1998, 2003, and 2007 through 2010. We believe recreational boating has a natural appeal to consumers, along with other outdoor activities, and will continue to grow in favorable economic conditions absent any unusual industry headwinds (see Risk Factors).
The recreational boat retail market remains highly fragmented with little consolidation having occurred to date and consists of numerous boat retailers, most of which are small companies owned by individuals that operate in a single market and provide varying degrees of merchandising, professional management, and customer service. We believe that many boat retailers are encountering increased pressure from boat manufacturers to improve their levels of service and systems, increased competition from larger national retailers in certain product lines, and, in certain cases, business succession issues.
Products and Services
 We offer new and used recreational boats and related marine products, including engines, trailers, parts, and accessories. While we sell a broad range of new and used boats, we focus on premium brand products. In addition, we assist in arranging related boat financing, insurance, and extended service contracts; provide boat maintenance and repair services; offer slip and storage accommodations; provide boat and yacht brokerage sales; and conduct a yacht charter business.
New Boat Sales
 We primarily sell recreational boats, including pleasure boats and fishing boats. A number of the products we offer are manufactured by Brunswick, a leading worldwide manufacturer of recreational boats and yachts, including Sea Ray pleasure boats, Boston Whaler fishing boats, and Harris aluminum boats. Sales of new Brunswick boats accounted for approximately 23% of our revenue in fiscal 2022. Sales of new Sea Ray and Boston Whaler boats accounted for approximately 11% and 9%, respectively, of our revenue in fiscal 2022. Certain of our dealerships also sell luxury yachts, fishing boats, and pontoon boats provided by other manufacturers, including Italy-based Azimut. Sales of new Azimut boats and yachts accounted for approximately 8% of our revenue in fiscal 2022. Cruisers Yachts, a wholly-owned MarineMax subsidiary, manufactures sport yacht and yachts with sales through our select retail dealership locations and through independent dealers. Intrepid Powerboats, a MarineMax company, manufactures powerboats and sells through a direct-to-consumer model. During fiscal 2022, new boat sales, including sales of Cruisers Yachts and Intrepid Powerboats, accounted for approximately 73.2% or $1.689 billion of our revenue.


We offer recreational boats in most market segments, but have a particular focus on premium quality pleasure boats and yachts as reflected by our fiscal 2022 average new boat sales price of approximately $256,000 an increase from approximately $227,000 in fiscal 2021, compared with an estimated industry average selling price for calendar 2021 of approximately $71,000 based on industry data published by the National Marine Manufacturers Association. Given our locations in some of the more affluent, offshore-oriented boating areas in the United States and emphasis on high levels of customer service, we sell a relatively higher percentage of large recreational boats, such as mega-yachts, yachts, and sport cruisers. We believe that the product lines we offer are among the highest quality within their respective market segments, with well-established trade-name recognition and reputations for quality, performance, and style.
 The following table is illustrative of the range and approximate manufacturer suggested retail price range of new boats that we currently offer, but is not all inclusive.

Our used boat sales depend on our ability to source a supply of high-quality used boats at attractive prices. We acquire substantially all of our used boat inventory through customer trade-ins. We strive to increase our used boat business through the availability of quality used boat trade-ins generated from our new boat sales efforts, which are well-maintained through our service initiatives. Additionally, substantially all of our used boat inventory is posted on our digital properties, which expands the awareness and availability of our products to a large audience of boating enthusiasts. We also sell used boats at various marinas and other offsite locations throughout the country.


To further enhance our used boat sales, we offer extended warranty plans generally available for used boats less than nine years old. The extended warranty plans apply to each qualifying used boat, which has passed a 48-point inspection, and provides protection against failure of most mechanical parts for up to three years. We believe this type of program enhances our sales of used boats by motivating purchasers of used boats to complete their purchases through our dealerships.
 Marine Engines, Related Marine Equipment, and Boating Parts and Accessories
 We offer marine engines and equipment, predominantly manufactured by Mercury Marine, a division of Brunswick, and Yamaha. We sell marine engines and propellers primarily to retail customers as replacements for their existing engines or propellers.

Many of our dealerships have been recognized by Mercury Marine as “Premier Service Dealers”. This designation is generally awarded based on meeting certain standards and qualifications.
 We also sell a broad variety of marine parts and accessories at our retail locations, at various offsite locations, and through our print catalog. These marine parts and accessories include marine electronics; dock and anchoring products, such as boat fenders, lines, and anchors; boat covers; trailer parts; water sport accessories, such as tubes, lines, wakeboards, and skis; engine parts; oils; lubricants; steering and control systems; corrosion control products and service products; high-performance accessories, such as propellers and instruments; and a complete line of boating accessories, including life jackets, inflatables, and water sports equipment. We also offer novelty items, such as shirts, caps, and license plates bearing the manufacturer’s or dealer’s logos. In all of our parts and accessories business, we utilize our industry knowledge and experience to offer boating enthusiasts high-quality products with which we have experience.
 The sale of marine engines, related marine equipment, and boating parts and accessories, which are all tangible products, accounted for approximately 3.3% or $76.7 million of our fiscal 2022 revenue.
 Maintenance, Repair, and Storage Services
 Providing customers with professional, prompt maintenance and repair services is critical to our sales efforts and contributes to our success. We provide maintenance and repair services at most of our retail locations, with extended service hours at certain of our locations. In addition, in many of our markets, we provide mobile maintenance and repair services at the location of the customer’s boat. We believe that this service commitment is a competitive advantage in the markets in which we compete and is critical to our efforts to provide a trouble-free boating experience. To further this commitment, in certain of our markets, we have opened stand-alone maintenance and repair facilities in locations that are more convenient for our customers and that increase the availability of such services. We also believe that our maintenance and repair services contribute to strong customer relationships and that our emphasis on preventative maintenance and quality service increases the potential supply of well-maintained boats for our used boat sales.
 We perform both warranty and non-warranty repair services, with the cost of warranty work reimbursed by the manufacturer in accordance with the manufacturer’s warranty reimbursement program. For warranty work, most manufacturers, including Brunswick, reimburse a percentage of the dealer’s posted service labor rates, with the percentage varying depending on the dealer’s customer satisfaction index rating and attendance at service training courses. We derive the majority of our warranty revenue from Brunswick products, as Brunswick products comprise the largest percentage of our products sold. Certain other manufacturers reimburse warranty work at a fixed amount per repair. Because boat manufacturers permit warranty work to be performed only at authorized dealerships, we receive substantially all of the warranted maintenance and repair work required for the new boats we sell. The third-party extended warranty contracts we offer also result in an ongoing demand for our maintenance and repair services for the duration of the term of the extended warranty contract.
 Our maintenance and repair services are performed by manufacturer-trained and certified service technicians. In charging for our mechanics’ labor, many of our dealerships use a variable rate structure designed to reflect the difficulty and sophistication of different types of repairs. The percentage markups on parts are similarly based on manufacturer suggested prices and market conditions for different parts.
 At many of our locations, we offer boat storage services, including in-water slip storage and inside and outside land storage. These storage services are offered at competitive market rates and include both in-season and out-of-season storage. In October 2022, we completed the acquisition of IGY Marinas. IGY Marinas maintains a network of luxury marinas situated in yachting and sport fishing destinations around the world. IGY Marinas has high standards for service and quality in nautical tourism around the world. It offers a global network of marinas in the Americas, the Caribbean, and Europe, delivering year-round accommodations. IGY Marinas caters to a wide variety of luxury yachts, while also being exclusive home ports for some of the world’s largest megayachts.


Maintenance, repair, rent, and storage services accounted for approximately 5.7% or $130.5 million of our revenue during fiscal 2022 of which, approximately 3.3% or $77.1 million related to repair services, approximately 0.8% or $17.6 million related to parts and accessories for repairs, and approximately 1.6% or $35.8 million related to income from rent and storage service rentals.
 F&I Products
 At each of our retail locations and at various offsite locations where applicable, we offer our customers the ability to finance new or used boat purchases and to purchase extended service contracts and arrange insurance coverage, including boat property, disability, undercoating, gel sealant, fabric protection, trailer tire and wheel protection, and casualty insurance coverage (collectively, “F&I”). We have relationships with various national marine product lenders under which the lenders purchase retail installment contracts evidencing retail sales of boats and other marine products that are originated by us in accordance with existing pre-sale agreements between us and the lenders. These arrangements permit us to receive a portion of the finance charges expected to be earned on the retail installment contract based on a variety of factors, including the credit standing of the buyer, the annual percentage rate of the contract charged to the buyer, and the lender’s then current minimum required annual percentage rate charged to the buyer on the contract. This participation is subject to repayment by us if the buyer prepays the contract or defaults within a designated time period, usually 0 to 180 days. To the extent required by applicable state law, our dealerships are licensed to originate and sell retail installment contracts financing the sale of boats and other marine products.
 We also offer third-party extended service contracts under which, for a predetermined price, we provide all designated services pursuant to the service contract guidelines during the contract term at no additional charge to the customer above a deductible. While we sell all new boats with the boat manufacturer’s standard hull and engine warranty, extended service contracts provide additional coverage beyond the time frame or scope of the manufacturer’s warranty. Purchasers of used boats generally are able to purchase an extended service contract, even if the selected boat is no longer covered by the manufacturer’s warranty. Generally, we receive a fee for arranging an extended service contract. Most required services under the contracts are provided by us and paid for by the third-party contract holder. Beginning in fiscal 2021, we have partnered with a third-party F&I product provider to offer prepaid maintenance plans for select, new models.
We also are able to assist our customers with obtaining property and casualty insurance which covers loss or damage to the vessel. We provide worldwide yacht insurance programs for brokerage houses, yacht management groups, and maritime attorneys. We utilize expertise in complex underwriting, including understanding the exposure of an owner, captain, crew, guests, tenders and navigation to provide clients with uniquely designed protection so customers can cruise confidently.
 During fiscal 2022, fee income generated from F&I products accounted for approximately 3.0% or $69.0 million of our revenue. We believe that our customers’ ability to obtain competitive financing quickly and easily at our dealerships complements our ability to sell new and used boats. We also believe our ability to provide customer-tailored financing on a “same-day” basis gives us an advantage over many of our competitors, particularly smaller competitors that lack the resources to arrange boat financing at their dealerships or that do not generate sufficient volume to attract the diversity of financing sources that are available to us.
 Brokerage Sales
 Through employees or subcontractors that are licensed boat or yacht brokers where applicable, we offer boat or yacht brokerage sales at most of our retail locations. For a commission, we offer for sale brokered boats or yachts, listing them digitally on various sites, advising our other retail locations of their availability through our integrated computer system, and posting them on our website, www.MarineMax.com. Often sales are co-brokered, with the commission split between the buying and selling brokers. We believe that our access to potential used boat customers and methods of listing and advertising customers’ brokered boats or yachts is more extensive than is typical among brokers. In addition to generating revenue from brokerage commissions, our brokerage sales also enable us to offer a broad array of used boats or yachts without increasing related inventory costs. Also, through Fraser Yachts Group and Northrop & Johnson, we offer yacht and superyacht brokerage. During fiscal 2022, brokerage sales commissions accounted for approximately 5.8% or $133.1 million of our revenue.
 Our brokerage customers generally receive the same high level of customer service as our new and used boat customers. Our waterfront retail locations enable in-water demonstrations of an on-site brokered boat. Our maintenance and repair services, including mobile service, also are generally available to our brokerage customers. Generally, the purchaser of a boat brokered through us also can take advantage of MarineMax Getaways!® weekend and day trips and other rendezvous gatherings and in-water events, as well as boat operation and safety seminars. We believe that the array of services we offer are unique in the brokerage business.
 Yacht Charter
 In 2011 we launched a yacht charter business in which we offer customers the opportunity to charter catamarans in exotic destinations, starting with our initial location in the British Virgin Islands. In this business, we sell specifically designed yachts to third parties for inclusion in our yacht charter fleet; enter into yacht management agreements under which yacht owners enable us to put their

yachts in our yacht charter program for a period of several years for a fixed monthly fee payable by us; provide our services in storing, insuring, and maintaining their yachts; and charter these yachts to vacation customers at agreed fees payable to us. The yacht owners will be able to utilize the yachts for personal use for a designated number of weeks during the terms of the management agreement and take possession of their yachts following the expiration of the yacht management agreements.
In addition to the specific business we launched in the British Virgin Islands, we also offer yacht charter services. For a fee, we assist yacht owners in the charter of their vessel by third-parties. Additionally, through Fraser Yachts Group and Northrop & Johnson we offer yacht and superyacht chartering, charter management, yacht management, crew placement, new boat build oversight services and other luxury yacht services. During fiscal 2022, the income from rentals of chartering power yachts, yacht charter fees, and other charter services accounted for approximately 1.7% or $40.7 million of our revenue. Our facilities in the British Virgin Islands and yacht charter fleet suffered damage from Hurricane Irma in September of 2017. Beginning in March 2020, we temporarily closed our facilities in the British Virgin Islands and yacht charters based on guidance from local government and health officials as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Yacht charters resumed during fiscal 2021, but the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the duration for which it may have an impact cannot be determined at this time.
Offsite Sales
 We sell used boats, offer F&I products, and sell parts and accessories at various third-party offsite locations, including marinas.
 Product Manufacturing
 Cruisers Yachts, a wholly-owned MarineMax subsidiary, manufactures sport yacht and yachts with sales through our select retail dealership locations and through independent dealers. Cruisers Yachts is recognized as one of the world’s premier manufacturers of premium sport yacht and yachts, producing models from 33’ to 60’ feet. Intrepid Powerboats, also a wholly-owned MarineMax subsidiary, is recognized as a world class producer of customized boats, reflecting the unique desires of each individual owner. Intrepid Powerboats follows a direct-to-consumer distribution model.
Retail Locations
 We sell our recreational boats and other marine products and offer our related boat services through 78 retail locations in Alabama, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin. Each retail location generally includes an indoor showroom (including some of the industry’s largest indoor boat showrooms) and an outside area for displaying boat inventories, a business office to assist customers in arranging financing and insurance, maintenance and repair facilities, and at certain retail locations boat storage services, including in-water slip storage and inside and outside land storage.
 Many of our retail locations are waterfront properties on some of the nation’s most popular boating locations. Our waterfront retail locations, most of which include marina-type facilities and docks at which we display our yachts and boats, are easily accessible to the boating populace, serve as in-water showrooms, and enable the sales force to give customers immediate in-water demonstrations of various boat models. Most of our other locations are in close proximity to water. The following table sets forth certain of our waterfront properties.

Operations
 Dealership Operations and Management
 We have adopted a generally decentralized approach to the operational management of our dealerships. While certain administrative functions are centralized at the corporate level, local management is primarily responsible for the day-to-day operations of the retail locations. Each retail location is managed by a general manager, who oversees the day-to-day operations, personnel, and

financial performance of the individual store, subject to the direction of a regional president or district president, who generally has responsibility for the retail locations within a specified geographic region. Typically, each retail location also has a staff consisting of an F&I manager, a parts manager, a service manager, sales representatives, maintenance and repair technicians, and various support personnel.
 Sales and Marketing
 Our sales philosophy focuses on selling the pleasures of the boating lifestyle and creating memories of a lifetime with family and friends. We believe that the critical elements of our sales philosophy include our appealing retail locations, no-hassle sales approach, highly trained sales representatives, high level of customer service, emphasis on educating the customer and the customer’s family on boating, and providing our customers with opportunities for boating through our MarineMax Getaways!®. We strive to provide exceptional customer experiences through the best services, products, and technology before, during, and after the sale. Our team and customers are United by Water®.
 Each retail location offers the customer the opportunity to evaluate a variety of new and used boats in a comfortable and convenient setting. Our full-service retail locations facilitate a turn-key purchasing process that includes attractive lender financing packages, extended service agreements, and insurance. Many of our retail locations are located on waterfronts and marinas, which attract boating enthusiasts and enable customers to operate various boats prior to making a purchase decision.
 The brands we offer are diverse in size and use and are spread across our customer activities of leisure, fishing, watersports, luxury, and vacations. We believe the transformative qualities of the water should be shared by everyone, so we created our boat lineup accordingly. Our promise gives our brands meaning and reason to exist next to one another on our showroom floor.
 We sell our boats at posted MarineMax “One Price” that generally represent a discount from the manufacturer’s suggested retail price. Our sales approach focuses on the customer experience by minimizing customer anxiety associated with price negotiation.
 As a part of our sales and marketing efforts, our digital marketing capabilities are a competitive advantage, with the majority of leads originating through our digital properties, including MarineMax.com. Social media is a growing venue for customer engagement and communication and has become a strong medium for connecting with new customers. Additionally, we hold online experience events including immersive boat tours that allow participants to explore boats and yachts from multiple manufactures, segments, and models from nearly any electronic device including their phone, tablet, or computer.
We participate in boat shows and in-the-water sales events at area boating locations, typically held in January, February, March, and toward the end of the boating season, in each of our markets. Boat shows and other offsite promotions are an important venue for generating customer engagement. The boat shows also generate a significant amount of interest in our products resulting in boat sales after the show. Online we are always available and can offer our full selection of boats, yachts and charters, as well as our expert team to answer customers’ questions and help them find a boat virtually.
We emphasize customer education through one-on-one education by our sales representatives and, at some locations, our delivery captains, before and after a sale, and through in-house seminars for the entire family on boating safety, the use and operation of boats, and product demonstrations. Typically, one of our delivery captains or the sales representative delivers the customer’s boat to an area boating location and thoroughly instructs the customer about the operation of the boat, including hands-on instructions for docking and trailering the boat. To enhance our customer relationships after the sale, we lead and sponsor MarineMax Getaways!® group boating trips to various destinations, rendezvous gatherings, and on-the-water organized events that promote the boating lifestyle and memories of a lifetime. Each Company-sponsored event, planned and led by a Company employee, also provides a favorable medium for acclimating new customers to boating, sharing exciting boating destinations, creating friendships with other boaters, and enabling us to promote new product offerings to boating enthusiasts.
 As a result of our relative size, we believe we have a competitive advantage within the industry by being able to conduct an organized and systematic advertising and marketing effort. Part of our marketing capabilities include a customer relationship management system that tracks all customer engagements, evaluates the customers propensity to buy, automatically generates follow-up activities, and facilitates Company-wide availability of a particular boat or other marine products and services desired by a customer.
Suppliers and Inventory Management
 We purchase a substantial portion of our new boat inventory directly from manufacturers, which allocate new boats to dealerships based on the amount of boats sold by the dealership and their market share. We manufacture a portion of our new boat inventory from our Product Manufacturing segment. We also exchange new boats with other dealers to accommodate customer demand and to balance inventory.
 In fiscal 2022, sales of new Brunswick and Azimut boats and yachts accounted for approximately 23% and 8% of our revenue, respectively. Sales of new Sea Ray and Boston Whaler boats accounted for approximately 11% and 9%, respectively, of our revenue in

fiscal 2022. No purchases of new boats and other marine related products from any other manufacturer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in fiscal 2022.
 We have entered into multi-year agreements with Brunswick covering Sea Ray and Boston Whaler. We also have a multi-year agreement with Azimut-Benetti Group for its Azimut product line. We typically deal with each of our manufacturers, other than Brunswick and Azimut-Benetti Group, under an annually renewable, non-exclusive dealer agreement.
 The dealer agreements do not restrict our right to sell any product lines or competing products provided that we are in compliance with the material obligations of our dealer agreements. The terms of each dealer agreement appoints a designated geographical territory for the dealer, which is exclusive to the dealer provided that the dealer is able to meet the material obligations of its dealer agreement.
 Manufacturers generally establish prices on an annual basis, but may change prices at their sole discretion. Manufacturers typically discount the cost of inventory and offer inventory financing assistance during the manufacturers’ slow seasons, generally October through March. To obtain lower cost of inventory, we strive to capitalize on these manufacturer incentives to take product delivery during the manufacturers’ slow seasons. This permits us to gain pricing advantages and better product availability during the selling season. Arrangements with certain other manufacturers may restrict our right to offer some product lines in certain markets.
 We transfer individual boats among our retail locations to fill customer orders that otherwise might take substantially longer to fill from the manufacturer. This reduces delays in delivery, helps us maximize inventory turnover, and assists in minimizing potential overstock or out-of-stock situations. We actively monitor our inventory levels to maintain levels appropriate to meet current anticipated market demands. We are not bound by contractual agreements governing the amount of inventory that we must purchase in any year from any manufacturer, but the failure to purchase at agreed upon levels may result in the loss of certain manufacturer incentives or dealership rights.
Inventory Financing
 Marine manufacturers customarily provide interest assistance programs to retailers. The interest assistance varies by manufacturer and may include periods of free financing or reduced interest rate programs. The interest assistance may be paid directly to the retailer or the financial institution depending on the arrangements the manufacturer has established. We believe that our financing arrangements with manufacturers are standard within the industry.
 We account for consideration received from our vendors in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASC 606”). ASC 606 requires us to classify interest assistance received from manufacturers as a reduction of inventory cost and related cost of sales as opposed to netting the assistance against our interest expense incurred with our lenders. Pursuant to ASC 606, amounts received by us under our co-op assistance programs from our manufacturers are netted against related advertising expenses.
We are party to a Credit Agreement with Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company as Administrative Agent, Swingline Lender, and Issuing Bank, Wells Fargo Commercial Distribution Finance, LLC, as Floor Plan Agent, and the lenders party thereto (the “New Credit Agreement”). The New Credit Agreement provides the Company a line of credit with asset based borrowing availability of up to $750 million and establishes a revolving credit facility in the maximum amount of $100 million (including a $20 million swingline facility and a $20 million letter of credit sublimit), a delayed draw term loan facility to finance the acquisition of IGY Marinas in the maximum amount of $400 million, and a $100 million delayed draw mortgage loan facility. The maturity of each of the facilities is August 2027. The New Credit Agreement is further discussed in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Technology Platform
 We believe that our technology platform, which is utilized by our companies and dealerships and that is continually developed with the latest capabilities, strategically enhances our ability to integrate successfully the operations of our companies and future acquisitions, facilitates the interchange of information, and enhances cross-selling opportunities throughout our company. The platform integrates each level of operations on a Company-wide basis, including but not limited to inventory, financial reporting, budgeting, and sales management. We manage each company’s operations with the platform to execute at the highest level, continually grow, and deliver exceptional customers experiences. Sales representatives use the platform to gain strategic competitive insights, automatically generate follow-up activities, facilitate the availability of Company-wide products and services and monitor the maintenance and service needs of customers’ boats. Company representatives also utilize the platform to provide financing and insurance products, proactively schedule services and continually communicate with customers. We mitigate cybersecurity risks by employing extensive measures, including but not limited to employee training, protective technologies, monitoring and testing, external assessment services and maintenance of protective systems and contingency plans.
Human Capital Resources
 As of September 30, 2022, we had 3,410 employees, 2,301 (67%) of whom were in store-level operations, 933 (28%) of whom were in the yacht manufacturing operations, and 176 (5%) of whom were in corporate administration and management. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relations with our employees to be excellent.
 In managing the business, we devote substantial efforts to recruit employees that we believe to be exceptionally well qualified for their position. We also train our employees to understand our core retail philosophies, which focus on making the purchase of a boat and its subsequent use as hassle-free and enjoyable as possible. Through our MarineMax University, or MMU, we teach our retail philosophies to existing and new employees at various locations and online, through MMU-online. MMU is a modularized and instructor-led educational program that focuses on our retailing philosophies and provides instruction on such matters as the sales process, customer service, F&I, accounting, leadership, and human resources. We also have a specialized service training center and program in Clearwater, Florida where we train our service technicians in best practices.
Sales representatives receive compensation primarily on a commission basis. Each general manager is a salaried employee with incentive bonuses based on the performance of the managed dealership. Maintenance and repair service managers receive compensation on a salary basis with bonuses based on the performance of their departments. Our technology platform provides each store and department manager with daily financial and operational information, enabling them to monitor the performance of their personnel on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. We have a uniform, fully integrated technology platform serving each of our dealerships.
 Our philosophy is to pay competitive base salaries to team members at levels that help us to attract, motivate, and retain highly qualified team members and reduce turnover. Cash incentive bonuses are designed to reward individuals based on our Company’s financial results as well as the achievement of personal and corporate objectives designed to contribute to our long-term success in building shareholder value. Grants of stock-based awards under our 2011 Stock-Based Compensation Plan are intended to align compensation with the price performance of our common stock. Total compensation levels reflect corporate positions, responsibilities, and achievement of goals. As a result of our performance-based compensation philosophy, pay levels may vary significantly from year to year and among our various team members. Performance metrics utilized by our cash compensation plans include pretax income performance bonus, aged inventory, district and regional financial performance targets, and net promoter score (customer satisfaction).
Intellectual Property
 We have registered tradenames and trademarks, including among other marks, “MarineMax” and “United by Water” in over 20 countries and territories. Pursuant to agreements with manufacturers and subject to restrictions in those agreements, we have the right to use and display the trademarks and logos of our manufacturer’s brands at our retail stores as well as in our advertising and promotional materials. The current registrations of our tradenames and trademarks are effective for varying periods of time, which we may renew periodically, provided that we comply with all statutory maintenance requirements, including continued use of each trademark in each country.
Seasonality and Weather Conditions
 Our business, as well as the entire recreational boating industry, is highly seasonal, with seasonality varying in different geographic markets. Over the three-year period ended September 30, 2022, the average revenue for the quarters ended December 31, March 31, June 30 and September 30 represented approximately 20%, 24%, 32%, and 24%, respectively, of our average annual revenues. With the exception of Florida, we generally realize significantly lower sales and higher levels of inventories and related short-term borrowings, in the quarterly periods ending December 31 and March 31. The onset of the public boat and recreation shows in January generally stimulates boat sales and typically allows us to reduce our inventory levels and related short-term borrowings throughout the remainder of the fiscal year. Our expansion into boat storage may act to reduce our seasonality and cyclicality.
 Our business is also subject to weather patterns, which may adversely affect our results of operations. For example, prolonged winter conditions, drought conditions (or merely reduced rainfall levels) or excessive rain, may limit access to area boating locations or render boating dangerous or inconvenient, thereby curtailing customer demand for our products. In addition, unseasonably cool weather and prolonged winter conditions may lead to a shorter selling season in certain locations. Hurricanes and other storms could result in disruptions of our operations or damage to our boat inventories and facilities, as has been the case when Florida and other markets were affected by hurricanes, such as Hurricane Ian in 2022. Although our geographic diversity is likely to reduce the overall impact to us of adverse weather conditions in any one market area, these conditions will continue to represent potential, material adverse risks to us and our future financial performance.
 Governmental Regulations, including Environmental Regulations
Our operations are subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and licensing under various foreign, federal, state, and local statutes, ordinances, and regulations. While we believe that we maintain all requisite licenses and permits and are in compliance with

all applicable federal, state, and local regulations, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain all requisite licenses and permits. The failure to satisfy those and other regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The adoption of additional laws, rules, and regulations could also have a material adverse effect on our business. Various foreign, federal, state, and local regulatory agencies, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), the EPA, and similar foreign, federal, state, and local agencies, have jurisdiction over the operation of our dealerships, repair facilities, and other operations with respect to matters such as consumer protection and privacy, workers’ safety, and laws regarding protection of the environment, including air, water, and soil.
 The EPA has various air emissions regulations for outboard marine engines that impose more strict emissions standards for two-cycle, gasoline outboard marine engines. The majority of the outboard marine engines we sell are manufactured by Mercury Marine. Mercury Marine’s product line of low-emission engines, including the Verado, SeaPro, Pro XS, and other four-stroke outboards, have achieved the EPA’s mandated 2006 emission levels. While we remain committed to supporting sustainable manufacturing and a sustainable environment for all boaters, any increased costs of producing engines resulting from EPA standards, or the inability of our manufacturers to comply with EPA requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 Certain of our facilities own and operate underground storage tanks (“USTs”) and above ground storage tanks (“ASTs”) for the storage of various petroleum products. The USTs and ASTs are generally subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations that require testing and upgrading of tanks and remediation of contaminated soils and groundwater resulting from leaking tanks. In addition, if leakage from Company-owned or operated tanks migrates onto the property of others, we may be subject to civil liability to third parties for remediation costs or other damages. Based on historical experience, we believe that our liabilities associated with tank testing, upgrades, and remediation are unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results.
 As with boat dealerships generally, and parts and service operations in particular, our business involves the use, handling, storage, and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes, including environmentally sensitive materials, such as motor oil, waste motor oil and filters, transmission fluid, antifreeze, freon, waste paint and lacquer thinner, batteries, solvents, lubricants, degreasing agents, gasoline, and diesel fuels. Accordingly, we are subject to regulation by federal, state, and local authorities establishing requirements for the use, management, handling, and disposal of these materials and health and environmental quality standards, and liability related thereto, and providing penalties for violations of those standards. We are also subject to laws, ordinances, and regulations governing investigation and remediation of contamination at facilities we operate to which we send hazardous or toxic substances or wastes for treatment, recycling, or disposal.
 We do not believe we have any material environmental liabilities or that compliance with environmental laws, ordinances, and regulations will, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. However, soil and groundwater contamination has been known to exist at certain properties owned or leased by us. We have also been required and may in the future be required to remove USTs and ASTs containing hazardous substances or wastes. As to certain of our properties, specific releases of petroleum have been or are in the process of being remedied in accordance with state and federal guidelines. We are monitoring the soil and groundwater as required by applicable state and federal guidelines. In addition, the shareholders of certain of the acquired dealers have indemnified us (and such indemnification is continuing) for specific environmental issues identified on environmental site assessments performed by us as part of the acquisitions. We maintain insurance for pollutant cleanup and removal. The coverage pays for the expenses to extract pollutants from land or water at the insured property, if the discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release, or escape of the pollutants is caused by or results from a covered cause of loss. We also have additional storage tank liability insurance and Superfund coverage where applicable. In addition, certain of our retail locations are located on waterways that are subject to federal or state laws regulating navigable waters (including oil pollution prevention), fish and wildlife, and other matters.
 Three of the properties we own were historically used as gasoline service stations. Remedial action with respect to prior historical site activities on these properties has been completed or is being completed in accordance with federal and state law. We do not believe that any of these environmental issues will result in any material liabilities to us.
 Additionally, certain states have required or are considering requiring a license in order to operate a recreational boat. While such licensing requirements are not expected to be unduly restrictive, regulations may discourage potential first-time buyers, thereby limiting future sales, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 Environmental Responsibility
 We operate many retail locations near or on bodies of water that are acutely susceptible to the risks associated with climate change. Such risks include those related to the physical impacts of climate change, such as possibly more frequent and severe weather events, rising sea levels, and/or long term shifts in climate patterns, and risks related to the transition to a lower-carbon economy, such as reputational, market and/or regulatory risks. Our commitment to environmental responsibility and initiatives to reduce our environmental footprint are outlined in our “Environmental Policy.” Our Environmental Policy can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.MarineMax.com under Governance Documents (for the avoidance of doubt, our Environmental Policy and other information contained on or accessible through our website is not incorporated into, and does not form a part of, this Annual Report or

any other report or document we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission). Our Environmental Policy and associated climate related risks and opportunities are reviewed by our Board of Directors on an annual basis or more frequently as needed.
We have engaged in many efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change. For example, we seek out, to the extent feasible, manufacturers committed to the highest levels of sustainability, environmental stewardship, and low-emissions as demonstrated by Mercury Marine. Mercury Marine’s commitment to sustainability and successes are detailed in its 2021 Sustainability Report. Mercury Marine’s accomplishments include winning the 2020 Energy Efficiency Excellence Award from Wisconsin’s Focus on Energy program, 2019 Sustainable Process Award from the Wisconsin Sustainable Business Council for its sustainable use of aluminum, winning the 2018 Sustainable Product of the Year from the Wisconsin Sustainable Business Council for its Active Trim technology, and winning the 2018 Business Friend of the Environment Award for their new V6 and V8 outboard engines. For the 11th consecutive year, the Wisconsin Sustainable Business Council awarded Mercury Marine a “Green Masters” designation, a program measuring a broad range of sustainability issues including energy and water conservation, waste management, community outreach, and education. Mercury Marine has improved energy efficiency by implementing energy‑reducing projects, promoting best practices in energy management and employing new energy technologies, such as using the latest and most energy efficient HVAC systems, LED lighting, top-rated insulation, passive (natural) lighting, weather-stripping around windows and doors, double-door vestibules, automatic and timer-activated doors, and plans to build roof-mounted solar arrays where applicable.
Additionally, Azimut Yachts was awarded ISO 14001 certification, for its consistent and effective management system aimed at reducing the environmental impact of its operations. In addition, to maximize the eco-compatible standards of their yachts, Azimut Yachts adopted RINA (an organization specializing in classification, certification, testing, and inspection) principles to achieve RINA Green Plus notation. Also, MasterCraft's manufacturing facilities operate in alignment with the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems Standard, the ISO 9001 Quality Management Systems standard, and the OHSAS 18001 International Occupational Health and Safety Management System standard. MasterCraft's largest facility, the MasterCraft brand facility, is certified in all three standards. MasterCraft believes it is the only boat manufacturer to achieve all three of these prestigious ISO certifications across production and product development systems.
Further, as opportunities arise we have made targeted investments to support new technology, innovations, and research in the marine industry to reduce emissions, provide environmental stewardship, and support a sustainable environment for all boaters. The Fraser Yachts Group has become the first yacht company to sign the Pact for Energy Transition with the Monaco Government. The energy transition pact was created by the Monaco government to improve energy efficiency and promote renewable energy sources, with the target to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, by allowing residents, workers, businesses, institutions and associations to contribute to the energy transition effort.
We take pride in maintaining our retail locations and marinas for the benefit of the local communities and boaters we serve. We strive to execute a proactive strategy related to environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, and environmental stewardship, which includes investing significant resources in maintaining and developing our retail locations and marinas for the long term. Additionally, several of our marinas have been designated as Clean Marinas. The Clean Marina Program recognizes facilities engaging in environmental best practices and exceeding regulatory requirements in and around waterways.
Corporate Social Responsibility
Our commitment to social responsibility is outlined in our “Human Rights Policy.” Our Human Rights Policy can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.MarineMax.com under Governance Documents (for the avoidance of doubt, our Environmental Policy and other information contained on or accessible through our website is not incorporated into, and does not form a part of, this Annual Report or any other report or document we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission). Our Human Rights Policy is reviewed by our Board of Directors on an annual basis or more frequently as needed. We strive to conduct our business in an ethical and socially responsible way, and are sensitive to the needs of the environment, our customers, our shareholders, our team members and our communities. Our ethical and social responsibility is guided by our MarineMax culture and values which are honesty, trust, loyalty, professionalism, consistency, always do what is right, treat others as we want to be treated, and always consider the long term. Our culture, values, and mission are shared and reinforced with our team members through daily stand up meetings, team events, and online communications. We pride ourselves in supporting our local communities both on and off the water. One way in which our presence is felt within the local community is by providing our team members time to volunteer and assist with Habitat for Humanity housing projects in addition to making charitable donations to Habitat for Humanity. In addition, we support humanitarian aid to countries in need through organizations such as the Red Cross. We also partner with the American Cancer Society to support Breast Cancer Awareness Month across all of our retail operations.
Product Liability
 The products we sell or service may expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or property damage claims relating to the use of those products. Historically, the resolution of product liability claims has not materially affected our business. Manufacturers of the products we sell generally maintain product liability insurance. We also maintain third-party product liability insurance that we

believe to be adequate. We may experience claims that are not covered by, or that are in excess of, our insurance coverage. The institution of any significant claims against us could subject us to damages, result in higher insurance costs, and harm our business reputation with potential customers.
