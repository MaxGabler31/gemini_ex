GENERAL

We were incorporated in Nevada on September 10, 2013, as Betafox Corp. Our limited business until May 11, 2015, when control of our Company changed, was attempting to make candles. Because previous management was unable to raise sufficient capital to enable our Company to develop its intended operations, on that date, Mr. Giorgos Kallides, our previous majority shareholder and sole officer and director, sold his 6,000,000 shares to Future Continental Limited, and resigned all of his positions with our Company. Mr. Pei Lei became our new CEO and Chief Financial Officer, and, as part of the change of control, (a) Mr. Kallides cancelled his loan of $11,672 which was owed to him by our Company, and (b) our previously limited operation was sold to Mr. Kallides for $1 (see Item 11 herein). In October 2015, Future Continental Limited transferred the 6,000,000 shares to Mr. Lei Pei, in consideration of Mr. Pei serving as, and continuing to serve as, our director and CEO. In November 2015, we changed our corporate name to Future World Group, Inc.; and on February 26, 2017, we changed our corporate name to Global Entertainment Clubs, Inc, and again on January 8, 2018 to WEWARDS, INC. The Companys trading symbol is now WEWA.

On August 8, 2016, Mr. Peis 100%-owned company Sky Rover Holdings, Ltd. (Sky Rover) loaned us $1,000,000 (the Loan), pursuant to a three-year, unsecured promissory note bearing interest at 5% (payable in cash or in kind at our option), and convertible into our common shares at $.04 per share (including interest payable in kind). The proceeds of the Loan were used for working capital. On March 5, 2018, this loan and accrued interest of $79,990 was converted in full, into 26,999,750 common shares; and Sky Rover agreed to have all 26,999,750 shares issued directly to Mr. Pei, its 100% owner.

On September 27, 2016, Sky Rover loaned us an additional $2,000,000 to the Registrant. Sky Rover was issued an unsecured convertible promissory note (the Note), which was convertible into the Registrants common shares at any time before the due date, at a conversion price of $.04 per share. On March 5, 2018, this loan and accrued interest of $144,148 was converted in full, into 53,603,700 common shares. These shares were also issued directly to Mr. Pei.

On February 26, 2017, Sky Rover agreed to loan us up to an additional $20,000,000 to the Registrant, of which $8,000,000 was loaned to the Registrant on February 28, 2017. The loan of the $8,000,000, combined with the $4,000,000 which was loaned to the Registrant by Sky Rover since August 2016, means that Sky Rover has loaned a total of $12,000,000 in convertible notes to the Registrant since August, 2016, through February 28, 2017. Sky Rover and the Registrant have not determined when the balance of the $20,000,000 loan will be completed, and it is subject to the terms being agreed upon, i.e., the interest rate, conversion price, and due date.


1

The $8,000,000 loan which was made by Sky Rover to the Registrant on February 28, 2017 is evidenced by an unsecured promissory note (the  $8,000,000 Note), bearing interest at 5% per year (payable quarterly in cash or in stock, in Registrants option, at the conversion price), is due in three years (on February 26, 2020), and is convertible into the Registrants common shares at any time before the due date, at a conversion price of $.08 per share (subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits, forward splits, recapitalizations, a merger, etc.). The Registrant and its affiliate Sky Rover intend, but cannot confirm at this time, that the conversion price of any of the up to $12,000,000 additional loans will be at a conversion price at least equal to the $.08 conversion price of the $8,000,000 loan.

On June 26, 2018, Sky Rover converted $1,500,000 of this $8,000,000 loan, waived all interest, and issued 18,750,000 shares, 14,750,000 shares of which are owned by Mr. Pei, and 4,000,000 shares of which were gifted to other persons, all nonaffiliates of the Company.

If and when Sky Rover converts the remaining $6,500,000 of the $8,000,000 Note at the present conversion price of $.08 per share to 81,250,000 shares, and authorizes those shares to be issued to Mr. Pei, he would then own 182,603,450 of the Registrants 188,733,450 then-issued and outstanding shares (assuming that no other shares are issued before conversion), which would be approximately 96.75% of the then-outstanding shares. 

On June 26, 2018, the Company repaid Sky Rover a total of $5,000,000 in loans previously made by Sky Rover to the Company, consisting of an unsecured $1,000,000 non-convertible loan of February 23, 2017, and $4,000,000 of the convertible promissory note issued on February 26, 2017. Sky Rover waived all accrued and unpaid interest with respect to all $5,000,000 of these repaid loans and agreed that the loans will be repaid directly to Mr. Pei, its 100% owner.

The Registrant has been using the net proceeds of these loans for two main purposes: (I) to develop a mobile app which will enable consumers to purchase goods, and merchants will be able to sell their goods directly to the users through this merchant platform and reward their consumers in the form of Bitcoin; and (II) to complete the development of a blockchain empowered platform to link online games with players who would like to earn points while playing games, with this game platform. 

I. The Merchant Program: On August 6, 2016 the Company signed Statements of Work (SOWs) with Intellectsoft LLC, an unaffiliated company, to perform services for the development and administration of websites to support a mobile app which will enable consumers to purchase goods with local currency, and merchants will be able to sell their goods directly to the users, using this platform.  

In addition to the SOWs with Intellectsoft, between August 20, 2016 and September 27, 2016, the Registrant signed five SOWs with another unaffiliated UK-based company which is also unaffiliated with Intellectsoft, to provide additional services to the Company in connection with the app being developed. The objective of these services, to be completed in two phases, includes (1) creating a white labelled version of Future World which can be packaged up in a way by which small co-operatives of merchants can create their own eco systems of product selling; (2) taking the current version of the app, improving the identified pain points and providing versions in English and Chinese, to allow the app to be used in Asia, Europe and North America, by the merchants and customers in as short a time as possible; and (3) the creation of a prototype of a 3D globe system, visualizing the potential for the globalization of the app into cities.

As of March 6, 2018, the Registrant completed the development (subject to future improvements) of the platform to support a mobile adaptive web app which will enable consumers to purchase goods with local currency, and merchants will be able to sell their goods directly to the users, using this platform and reward their consumers in the form of Bitcoin as rebates. The Registrant is now the owner and licensor of this intellectual property; however, no licensee has yet been signed by the Company, and no revenues have been generated. 

On March 9, 2018, the Registrant, as assignee from the inventors, filed an Application for a Provisional Patent (the Application) for an invention entitled System and Method for Single Registration and Signing. A brief description of the invention, taken from the Application itself, is as follows:

In some embodiments, the disclosed invention is a single registration and transaction signing service (also called RegSign), for example, as a web service that performs two major functions: signing transactions and assisting client web applications in the creation of accounts, for example, on a blockchain platform. The disclosed invention can be integrated with existing client web applications of an ecosystem or platform. In some embodiments, the disclosed invention includes its own UI; client web application that redirects users to the UI whenever they are required to input or view data, e.g., sign a transaction with a transaction password.

Currently, ecommerce platforms provide retailers with an opportunity to connect with consumers whenever and wherever they are and therefore extends the boundaries of a physical retail store. Ecommerce websites and mobile applications accept online payments and allow consumers to track their delivery online. Relative simplicity of setting up and running an ecommerce environment keeps attracting increasingly more merchants that are motivated by the perspectives of enrolling new customers and boosting sales. However, the ecommerce world is now over-supplied with goods and services where the consumers' buying power surrenders to the cost of products they would like to purchase.

A global loyalty points system, according to the disclosed invention, transforms the traditional concept of ecommerce into a concept of cooperative society, a crowdsourcing platform with blockchain token used as a reward to the consumers. The system provides consumers with rewards each time they complete a challenge defined by a merchant. This is intended to make the ecommerce process beneficial to everyone, and to help distribute commercial wealth among the merchants and consumers.

In some embodiments, the loyalty points system is a digital rewards ecosystem based on the blockchain technology. The ecosystem is to be used by both consumers and merchants, and to benefit them as follows:

·
 Merchants, by enrolling their business into the loyalty points ecosystem, are able to attract more consumers to complete the challenges they set up. This is especially useful for small, local business that do not have large and pooled marketing budgets.
 ·
 Consumers that use the loyalty points ecosystem and shop at the merchants that are enrolled in the loyalty points ecosystem, receive loyalty points token rewards for every challenge they complete.
 ·
 The loyalty points ecosystem enables better consumer targeting by allowing the merchants to adjust the size of the reward based on challenge offered, store location, season, time of day, and other parameters.
 ·
 Consumers and merchants are able to earn additional rewards by introducing new consumers and merchants to the ecosystem.
 ·
 Unlike other reward or loyalty programs, the loyalty points ecosystem tokens are intended to be issued in the form of popular open cryptocurrencies, for example, Bitcoin. 

A key advantage of modern blockchain based solutions is lack of centralized control over user transactions. Each user is responsible for authorizing any transaction that involves a transfer of value from this user to another. Such authorization is typically associated with digitally signing a transaction with a private key that is known only to the authorizing user. However, requiring the user to enter the private key every time a transaction needs to be authorized introduces additional friction point in the user flow.

As a result, different approaches are used to cache the private key within the client application, which by itself creates a security risk if the client application is broken into, a hacker can get access to user's private key and therefore be able to sign transactions while impersonating the user.

This risk increases when the client application is architected as a web application. Given the decentralized nature of the loyalty points ecosystem (block-chain loyalty rewards financial system, with multiple independently implemented and managed client applications), a secure web-based solution is desirable for signing transactions that would simplify the signing process from the user perspective. Instead of memorizing and entering long and/or cryptic private key, they user is able to sign the transaction by entering a short transaction password.

In some embodiments, the disclosed invention caches user's private key encrypted with a transaction password; however, it does not store the transaction password. In other words, the disclosed invention is architecturally de-coupled from the block-chain based financial system and is unaware of any business logic contained within the transactions it is used to sign. In some embodiments, the disclosed invention may be optional component rather than a centralized service. In other words, a client application may choose to use the disclosed invention to ensure secure caching of private key, or implement its own caching solution in a secure fashion.

In addition to licensing the merchant platform which the Company owns, the Company also intends to become the exclusive sublicensee of other similar merchant platforms and receive a sublicense fee for the use of the technology.

II. The Game Program: The Company also intends to be the exclusive licensee of an online game (not gambling) platform. F&L Galaxy, Inc. (F&L), a company that is affiliated with the Company by virtue of common control by the Companys principal shareholder and CEO, acquired (from an unaffiliated, privately-owned company) the blockchain technology for use in setting up the global game platform. The Company now expects to become the exclusive licensee, from F&L, of this blockchain technology, which is intended to make "playing games and earning points" more secure and transparent. The points will be accumulated in the form of Bitcoin over time, and would be available for potential cashout. The Registrant intends to partner with other experienced third-party service providers and marketing firms to match online games with players on our platform.

In the game platform, F&L intends to license the technology to the Company exclusively on a worldwide basis, and the Company then intends to sublicense the game platform to unaffiliated White Label licensees. The White Label sublicensees will pay the Company a sublicense fee for the use of the technology based on a certain percentage of the rebates given out to the players.. As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, no definitive agreements have been signed by the Company with F&L with respect to the game platform, and the Company has not generated any revenue from this online game platform. 

Employees. Identification of Certain Significant Employees

We currently have no full-time employees, other than our sole officer and director Mr. Lei Pei, who receives no salary. From April 10, 2018 until May 31, 2018, we reimbursed an affiliated company for the costs of an attorney who worked part-time for us. Beginning June 1, 2018, we are no longer reimbursing that affiliated company for the attorneys cost. We currently work with other software providers to explore business opportunities in the block chain industry. 
Research and Development Expenditures

We have not incurred any other research or development expenditures since our incorporation.

Government Regulation

Because of the current regulatory uncertainties surrounding our business, we do not intend to operate our business in the United States unless and until we are satisfied that our operations will not be in violation of any statutes or regulations. At this time, we are unable to determine what governmental agencies, if any, will have jurisdiction over tour business, or what effect, if any, those government regulations will have over our business.
Patents and Trademarks

We do not own, either legally or beneficially, any patents or trademarks. However, as described previously in Item 1, we have filed for a Provisional Patent Application for an invention entitled System and Method for Single Registration and Signing.
Recent Development

In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report, the Company completed its internal investigation and collected enough evidence to believe that the Company's former accountant, who had access to the Company's bank account, is the suspect for two fraudulent wire transfers that occurred in July 2017 and October 2017. Both payments were sent to an unknown company; each payment was $248,000, totaling $496,000.

The Companys investigation discovered that the former accountant prepared false invoices, sent two unauthorized wire transfers, and falsified bank statements showing transfers were made to a known vendor. She then sent false bank statements and invoices to the Company's outside accountant, who prepared the Company's financial statements. The fraud was discovered when the vendor couldn't match its accounting records with the audit request from the Company's auditor.

On September 13, 2018, the police department in Arcadia, California was notified and a police report was filed. The Companys CEO, Lei Pei, also met with the Companys local bank branch manager, and was told that the bank is not responsible for any fraudulent activities that occurred over 60 days ago. Both the Company and the bank are continuing the investigation, with the intent of bringing the perpetrator to justice, and hopefully retrieving the fraudulently diverted funds.

The Company remains solvent, and is paying its obligations on a timely basis.
