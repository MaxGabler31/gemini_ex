Overview
CIRCOR International, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of Delaware on July 1, 1999. As used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” and “CIRCOR” mean CIRCOR International, Inc. and its subsidiaries (unless the context indicates another meaning). The term “common stock” means our common stock, par value $0.01 per share.
We design, manufacture and market differentiated technology products and sub-systems for markets including industrial, oil & gas, aerospace and defense, and commercial marine. CIRCOR has a diversified flow and motion control product portfolio with recognized, market-leading brands that fulfill its customers’ mission critical needs.

The Company has the following reportable business segments: Industrial (“Industrial segment”), Energy ("Energy segment" or "Energy"), and Aerospace & Defense (“Aerospace & Defense segment”) . We sell our products through distributors, representatives, Engineering, Procurement and Construction ("EPC") companies, as well as directly to end-user customers and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”).
Strategies
Our objective is to enhance shareholder value by focusing on growth, margin expansion, strong free cash flow, and disciplined capital deployment. We have a four-point strategy to achieve these objectives.
1) Grow Organically and Through Acquisitions. We leverage the power of our global design capabilities to develop innovative products that solve our customers’ most challenging and critical problems. New products will be an increasingly important part of our growth strategy going forward. In addition, we are positioning ourselves to grow in parts of our end markets where our products are under-represented. This could include establishing a presence in higher growth geographies where we have a limited presence today. It also could include taking products established in one end-market and selling those solutions into other relevant end markets.
1

In addition to organic growth, we expect to acquire businesses over time. We are primarily focused on companies with differentiated technologies in complementary markets that we already understand and where we expect substantial growth. In addition to strategic fit and differentiated technology, the main criterion for an acquisition is return on invested capital.
2) Simplify CIRCOR. In 2013, we embarked on a long-term journey to simplify CIRCOR. We have a large number of facilities relative to our size and believe that simplifying this structure will not only expand our margins by reducing cost, but will help us improve our customer service, operations, and controls. We obtain an in depth understanding of our customer needs and competitor capabilities in our end markets, and continue to simplify our product portfolio and the number of unique products we offer in the marketplace through active product management. 
3) Achieve World Class Operational Excellence. Our Global Operations and Supply Chain organization is fully committed to achieving operational excellence in support of our customers’ expectations of perfect quality, on-time delivery and market competitiveness. We follow the CIRCOR Operating System ("COS") which creates a disciplined culture of continuous improvement for driving operational excellence including a sales and inventory operations plan that provides for world-class quality and delivery while maintaining an optimal level of working capital. COS is comprised of ten business process attributes designed to engage and empower our employees to recognize and eliminate waste, work real-time problem solving as part of their everyday job experience, and enhance our performance both in operations and business office processes. Under COS our employees participate in a regimented training program and receive regular prescriptive assessments / action plans to drive process maturity. Quantitative performance metrics define site certification levels to help attain and sustain a level of quality, productivity, inventory management and market competitiveness that delights our customers, shareholders, and employees.
4) Build the Best Team. Finally, we have a fundamental belief at CIRCOR that the best team wins. We are committed to attracting the most talented people in our industry and we are committed to investing, engaging, challenging and developing our employees. We believe the best people combined with robust process, appropriate metrics, and individual accountability will deliver extraordinary results.

Customers
For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we had no customers from which we derive revenues that exceed 10% of the Company’s consolidated revenues. Our businesses sell into both long-term capital projects as well as short-cycle demand. As a result, we tend to experience fluctuations in orders, revenues and operating results at various points across economic and business cycles. Our Energy businesses can be cyclical in nature due to the fluctuation of the worldwide price, supply and demand for oil and gas. When the worldwide demand for oil and gas is depressed, the demand for our products used in those markets decreases as our customers with higher production costs will cut back investment and reduce purchases from us. The number of active rigs and wells drilled in North American short-cycle Oil & Gas market is a strong indicator of demand especially for our distributed valves products. In addition, the level of capital expenditures by national oil companies or the oil majors in exploration and production activities drive demand for our long cycle, engineered valves products. Maintenance expenditures during refinery turnarounds drive demand for our refinery valve products. Similarly, although not to the same extent as the Oil & Gas markets, the aerospace, military and maritime markets have historically experienced cyclical fluctuations in demand.

Selling and Distribution
Across our businesses we utilize a variety of channels to market our products and solutions. Those channels include direct sales, distributors, commissioned representatives, and our service centers. Our distribution and representative networks typically offer technically trained sales forces with strong relationships in key markets.
We believe that our well-established sales and distribution channels constitute a competitive strength. We believe that we have good relationships with our representatives and distributors. We continue to implement marketing programs to enhance these relationships. Our ongoing distribution-enhancement programs include reducing lead times, introducing new products, and offering competitive pricing, application design, technical training, and service.
Intellectual Property
We own patents that are scheduled to expire between 2019 and 2030 and trademarks that can be renewed as long as we continue to use them. We do not believe the vitality and competitiveness of any of our business segments as a whole depends on any one or more patents or trademarks. We own certain licenses such as software licenses, but we do not believe that our business as a whole depends on any one or more licenses.
Raw Materials
The raw materials used most often in our production processes are castings, forgings and bar stock of various materials, including stainless steel, carbon steel, bronze, copper, brass, titanium and aluminum. These materials are subject to price fluctuations that may adversely affect our results of operations. We purchase these materials from numerous suppliers and at times experience constraints on the supply of certain raw material as well as the inability of certain suppliers to respond to our needs. Historically, increases in the prices of raw materials have been partially offset by higher sales prices, active materials management, project engineering programs and the diversity of materials used in our production processes.
