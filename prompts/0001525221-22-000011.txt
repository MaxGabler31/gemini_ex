ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

General    
Bristow Group Inc. is the leading global provider of innovative and sustainable vertical flight solutions. We primarily provide aviation services to a broad base of major integrated, national and independent energy companies. We also provide commercial search and rescue (“SAR”) services in multiple countries and public sector SAR services in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) on behalf of the Maritime & Coastguard Agency (“MCA”). Additionally, we offer fixed wing transportation and other aviation related solutions. Our energy customers charter our helicopters primarily to transport personnel to, from and between onshore bases and offshore production platforms, drilling rigs and other installations.
Our core business of providing aviation services to leading global energy companies and public and private sector SAR services provides us with geographic and customer diversity which helps mitigate risks associated with a single market or customer. We currently have customers in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, the Dutch Caribbean, Guyana, India, Mexico, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Norway, Spain, Suriname, Trinidad, the U.K and the United States (“U.S.”).
In certain countries that limit foreign ownership of aviation companies and where we believe it is beneficial to access the local market for aviation support, we conduct our operations through subsidiaries, strategic alliances with foreign partners or through joint ventures with local shareholders. These arrangements, that combine a local ownership interest with Bristow’s experience in providing aviation services to the offshore energy industry, have allowed us to expand operations while diversifying risk.

Segment, Markets and Seasonality 
Aviation services, the single segment in which we conduct our business, is deployed from four regions: Europe, Americas, Africa and Asia Pacific. The current principal markets for our aviation services are in Australia, Brazil, Guyana, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Norway, Suriname, Trinidad, the U.K and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. In addition, we currently have customers in Canada, Chile, India, Mexico and Spain.
Global demand for helicopters in support of offshore oil and gas services is affected by offshore exploration and production. The activity levels are affected by prevailing and anticipated oil and gas prices and price volatility, all of which influence capital spending decisions by our customers. Historically, the prices for oil and gas and, consequently, the level of activity in the offshore energy industry, have been volatile and subject to a variety of factors beyond our control, including but not limited to customer assessments of offshore drilling prospects compared with land-based opportunities, including oil sands and shale formations; customer assessments of cost, geological opportunity and political stability in host countries; worldwide supply of and demand for oil and natural gas; the price and availability of alternative fuels; the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) to set and maintain production levels and pricing; the level of production of non-OPEC countries; the relative exchange rates for the U.S. dollar; and various U.S. and international government policies regarding exploration and development of oil and gas reserves.
Today, we generate a majority of our operating revenues from contracts supporting our energy customers’ offshore production operations, which have long-term transportation requirements. Production activities are typically less cyclical than exploration and development activities. Production platforms remain in place over the long-term and are relatively unaffected by economic cycles, as the marginal cost of operation is low. The remainder of our oil and gas revenues primarily comes from transporting personnel to, from and between offshore drilling rigs. Deepwater activity continues to be a significant segment of the global offshore oil and gas markets and typically involves significant capital investment and multi-year development plans. Such projects are generally underwritten by the energy companies using relatively conservative assumptions relating to oil and gas prices.
Global demand for helicopters in support of government services, such as SAR, is subject to a nation’s willingness to outsource such services and capital spending decisions.
For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, approximately 67% of our total operating revenues were derived from oil and gas services, including emergency response services, provided to customers primarily engaged in offshore energy exploration, development and production activities. Accordingly, our results of operations are, to a large extent, tied to the level of offshore exploration, development and production activity by energy companies. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, approximately 24% of our total operating revenues were derived from government services, and approximately 9% were derived from fixed wing and other services.

Europe
We are one of the largest providers of aviation services in the North Sea, where there are harsh weather conditions and geographically concentrated offshore facilities. Our North Sea operations are subject to seasonality as drilling activity is lower during the winter months due to harsh weather and shorter days. Our customers in this region are primarily international, independent and major integrated energy companies.
U.K. Markets. We provide offshore aviation services to a number of energy companies operating in the U.K. region of the North Sea. We also provide emergency response services through the U.K. SAR contract with the Department of Transport (“DfT”) servicing the public sector SAR needs for all of the U.K. on behalf of the MCA. We also own a controlling stake in the Humberside Airport in Kirmington, United Kingdom (the “Humberside Airport”) where we conduct certain of our SAR operations from a base location at the Humberside Airport.
Norway. We provide offshore aviation services to a number of energy companies operating in the Norwegian North Sea.
Netherlands. In January 2022, we were awarded a 10-year government SAR helicopter contract by the Netherlands Defense Materiel Organization (“DMO”). Services under this contract are expected to commence in November 2022.
Americas
We are one of the largest providers of aviation services in North America with a strong presence in a number of Latin American countries. Our operations in the U.S. are subject to seasonality where fewer hours of daylight in the winter months may result in fewer flight hours.
U.S. Markets. We are one of the largest providers of aviation services in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, which is a major offshore energy exploration, development and production region and one of the largest oil and gas aviation markets in the world. Our customer base in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico consists primarily of international, independent and major integrated energy companies and the U.S. government. In general, the months of December through February in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico have more days of adverse weather conditions than the other months of the year. Additionally, June through November is tropical storm season in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. During a tropical storm, we are unable to operate in the area of the storm, however, flight activity may increase immediately before and after a storm due to the evacuation and return of offshore workers.
Brazil. Brazil has one of the largest deepwater offshore exploration, development and production areas in the world. We currently operate from a network of bases strategically located in Brazil providing aviation services to offshore platforms.
Guyana. With numerous ongoing offshore exploration and development operations, Guyana is becoming one of the largest deepwater offshore exploration sites in the region. We provide offshore aviation services and SAR services.
Trinidad. For over a century, Trinidad has had considerable oil and gas exploration activity on land and in shallow waters. We provide offshore aviation services and SAR services to our customers in the region.
Latin America, Other. In addition to our operations in Brazil and Guyana, we operate helicopters in Suriname, and we lease helicopters and provide technical support to air operators in Chile and Mexico.
Canada. We own a 25% voting interest and a 40% economic interest in Cougar Helicopters Inc. (“Cougar”), a major aviation services provider in Canada. Cougar’s operations are primarily focused on serving the offshore energy industry off Canada’s Atlantic coast and in the Arctic.

Africa
Nigeria. We provide aviation services to the offshore energy industry in Nigeria where the market place for our services is predominantly concentrated in the oil rich shallow waters of the Niger Delta area and in support of deepwater exploration. We also provide fixed wing services in the Africa region offering end-to-end transportation services principally for oil and gas industry customers. Operations in Nigeria are subject to seasonality as the Harmattan, a dry and dusty trade wind, blows between the end of December and the middle of February. At times when the heavy amount of dust in the air severely limits visibility, our aircraft are unable to operate.
Egypt. We own a 25% interest in Petroleum Air Services (“PAS”), an Egyptian corporation that provides helicopter and fixed wing transportation to the offshore energy industry as well as spare fixed wing capacity chartered to tourism operators in Egypt.
Asia Pacific
Australia. We own a regional fixed wing operator (“Airnorth”), based in Darwin, North Territory, Australia, focused on providing both charter and scheduled services targeting the energy and mining industries in Northern and Western Australia as well as international services to Dili, Timor-Leste.
India. We lease helicopters and provide technical support to an operator serving the offshore oil and gas industry.
Equipment and Services 
We own and operate three classes of helicopters:
•Heavy helicopters, which have twin engines, typical passenger capacity of 16 to 19, and approximately 500 mile range, are primarily used in support of the deepwater offshore energy industry, frequently in harsh environments or in areas with long distances from shore, such as those in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Brazil and the North Sea. Heavy helicopters are also used to support SAR operations.
•Medium helicopters, which have twin engines, typical passenger capacity of 12, and approximately 450 mile range, are primarily used to support the offshore energy industry, SAR operations, utility services and corporate uses.
•Light helicopters, which may have single or twin engines, typical passenger capacity of four to seven, and approximately 300-325 mile range, are used to support a wide range of activities, including the offshore energy industry, utility services and corporate uses.
As of March 31, 2022, our total fleet consisted of 229 aircraft, of which 213 were helicopters. Our helicopters consist of 86 heavy helicopters, 83 medium helicopters, 14 light twin engine helicopters and 30 light single engine helicopters. Our fleet also includes 14 fixed wing aircraft and two unmanned aerial vehicles (“UAV”).

The management of our fleet involves a careful evaluation of the expected demand for helicopter services across global markets and the types of helicopters needed to meet this demand. As offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production moves to deeper water, more heavy and medium helicopters and newer technology helicopters may be required. Heavy and medium helicopters fly longer distances at higher speeds and can carry heavier payloads than light helicopters and are usually equipped with sophisticated avionics permitting them to operate in more demanding weather conditions and difficult climates. Heavy and medium helicopters are most commonly used for crew changes on large offshore production facilities and drilling rigs servicing the oil and gas industry and for SAR operations. See “Item 2. Properties” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion on our bases and operating facilities.
Aviation Operating Certificates 
Globally, we provide and operate aircraft under contracts using an Air Operator’s Certificate (“AOC”), typically issued by the relevant country’s applicable regulatory agency. In certain markets, local regulations may require us to partner with another operator, through an alliance or joint venture, who maintains an AOC compliant with the local regulatory requirements. For operating contracts, we are required to provide a complete support package including flight crews, helicopter maintenance and management of flight operations. When we lease helicopters to other operators, our customers generally handle the operational support, although in a few instances we do provide technical support, personnel and/or training.
As of March 31, 2022, we maintained 9 AOC’s in 10 different countries to facilitate our operations.
Customers and Contractual Arrangements
Our principal customers in the markets in which we operate are international, independent and major integrated energy companies and government agencies. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 66% of operating revenues, and the combined revenues from DfT, Equinor ASA and ConocoPhillips Co. accounted for 38% of our operating revenues.
Table of Contents

We contract the majority of our helicopters primarily through master service agreements, subscription agreements, day-to-day contract arrangements, fixed-term noncancellable contracts and dry-leases. Master service agreements and subscription agreements typically require a fixed monthly fee plus incremental payments based on flight hours flown. These agreements have fixed terms ranging from one month to ten years and generally may be canceled without penalty upon 30-365 days’ notice and may also include escalation provisions allowing annual rate increases. Customarily, these contracts do not commit our customers to acquire specific amounts of services or minimum flight hours and permit our customers to decrease the number of helicopters under contract with a corresponding decrease in the fixed monthly payments without penalty. Day-to-day charter arrangements require either a rate for each hour flown with a minimum number of hours to be charged or a daily fixed fee plus an hourly rate based on hours flown.
Our fixed wing services are generally provided through scheduled charter service or regular public transport service. We also provide services to customers on an “ad hoc” basis, which usually entails a shorter notice period and shorter contract duration. Regular public transport service is provided through established daily or weekly flight schedules and is based upon individual ticket sales to customers.
Our leasing customers are typically other helicopter operators that operate our helicopters under their AOCs and retain the operating risk. Leases generally run from one to five years and may contain early cancellation provisions. Under these leases, we may provide only the equipment or provide additional services such as logistical and maintenance support, training services and flight and maintenance crews.
Competitive Conditions
The aviation services industry is highly competitive throughout the world. Customers tend to rely heavily on existing relationships and seek operators with established safety records and knowledge of the operating environment. In most instances, customers charter aircraft on the basis of competitive bidding, and typically an operator must have an acceptable safety record, demonstrated reliability and suitable equipment to bid for work. Upon bidders meeting these criteria, customers typically make their final choice based on operational experience, helicopter preference, aircraft availability, the quality and location of operating bases, customer service, professional reputation and price. Incumbent operators typically have a competitive advantage in the bidding process based on their relationship with the customer, knowledge of the site characteristics and existing facilities to support the operations. In addition, while not the predominant practice, customers may also fulfill their needs by establishing their own flight departments or by facilitating the entry of a new operator in the regions where we operate.
Globally, our primary competitors are CHC Group LLC, NHV Group, Omni Helicopters International, S.A. and PHI, Inc. (“PHI”). We may also face competition from a number of smaller operators which vary by region.
Environmental, Social and Governance
Bristow’s vision is to lead the world in innovative and sustainable vertical flight solutions and we are committed to leading responsibly. Along with our commitment to safe and reliable operations, we have a corporate social responsibility program and focus on environmental responsibility through daily practices as further described in the following sections. Our Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors (the “ESG Committee”) oversees our sustainability initiatives, which include, but are not limited to, prioritizing efforts to reduce our environmental footprint, increasing transparency for our stakeholders, and ensuring our social responsibility program continues to provide value for our employees and the community.
Environmental and Social Initiatives
Bristow seeks to play a positive role in the communities where we operate by conducting our operations in a way that respects the environment and surrounding communities. Additionally, through Bristow Uplift, our social responsibility program, we align our business practices with social investments and work to build strong community relationships that will have a positive impact on our communities and create long-term value for our business.
Environmental Initiatives — In fiscal year 2021, Bristow was one of the first vertical lift operators in the U.K. to obtain International Organization for Standards (ISO) 14001 certification, which certifies that our U.K. operations have an environmental management system in place that monitors, manages, and delivers continuous improvement at our bases of

operations. In fiscal year 2022, Brazil passed an ISO 14001 audit continuing their certification that was obtained in 2018, and we began working to obtain ISO 14001 certification for other operating bases throughout our global footprint. We also have undertaken proactive measures to reduce aircraft emissions and reduce the environmental impact of our operations by monitoring operational practices to reduce our time running the aircraft on the ground, utilizing a fleet of modern and regularly maintained aircraft supported by the latest technologies, such as flight planning software for payload management, and by partnering with our customers to maximize seat utilization, thus reducing the number of flights required. Additionally, we encourage and assist our engine manufacturers, aircraft manufacturers, our customers and other stakeholders to be early and leading adopters of sustainable aviation fuels as we encourage wider availability by our fuel suppliers. We are also transitioning to using more electric ground support vehicles in our operations and have partnered with manufacturers to assist with the development of electric vertical takeoff and landing and short takeoff and landing aircraft.
Bristow Uplift — The five pillars of this program: Education, the Underserved, Health and Wellness, Diversity, and Sustainability; outline areas that we can align all of our social investment initiatives to. Bristow also matches certain employee donations to philanthropic organizations around the world. Through these efforts, we support building strong community relationships through the causes that are most important to our employees, ultimately creating long-term value for our business.
Human Rights — Through our Code of Business Integrity (“COBI”), we have committed to upholding the principles of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and standards such as nondiscriminatory treatment, voluntary employment, freedom of association, minimum wage, anti-harassment, prohibiting forced or child labor, and maintaining a healthy and safe work environment. We have adopted an Antislavery and Human Trafficking Policy that is applicable to our employees. The policy prohibits any use of slavery or human trafficking in Bristow’s supply chain, and as a condition of doing business with Bristow, we require all suppliers of aircraft, parts, and components to agree to comply with our COBI.
Safety, Industry Hazards and Insurance
The safety of our passengers and the maintenance of a safe working environment for our employees is our number one core value and highest operational priority. We have a strong safety culture committed to zero accidents and zero harm. It is owned by each employee and led by our President and Chief Executive Officer, who is responsible for setting the tone at the top. This culture is exemplified by our status as a founding member of HeliOffshore. Aviation services are potentially hazardous and may result in incidents or accidents. Challenges to safe operations include unanticipated adverse weather conditions, fires, human factors, and mechanical failures that may result in death or injury to personnel, damage to equipment, and other environmental or property damage. We are also subject to regulation by OSHA and comparable state agencies, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. Failure to comply with these agencies’ requirements can lead to the imposition of penalties.
Technology and Standards — Bristow’s fleet is configured with the latest safety equipment, including Traffic Collision Avoidance Systems (TCAS), Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning Systems (EGPWS) or Helicopter Terrain Awareness and Warning Systems (HTAWS), Automatic Dependent Surveillance- Broadcast (ABS-B), Helicopter Flight Data Monitoring Systems (HFDM), Health and Usage Monitoring Systems (HUMS), satellite communication and flight following systems, and forward facing tail cameras. During the fiscal year 2022, we also enhanced our mass emergency communication system, which we expect will allow for digital incident management to be adopted in fiscal year 2023, and completed the integration of the company safety information system (BeSAFE) in Brazil, Suriname and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
Systems and Processes — Our safety, legal, and compliance departments oversee our adherence with government regulations, customer safety requirements and safety standards within our organization, the standardization of our base operating procedures and the proper training of our employees. A key to maintaining our strong safety record is developing and retaining highly qualified, experienced, and well-trained employees. We conduct extensive safety training on an ongoing basis and develop, implement, monitor, and continuously improve our safety management system to proactively manage risk and support the physical safety and mental wellness of our employees. Additionally, we have implemented supporting safety programs that include, among many other features, (i) transition and recurrent training using full-motion flight simulators and other flight training devices, (ii) a FAA approved flight data monitoring program (“FDM”) and (iii) health and usage monitoring systems (“HUMS”), which automatically monitor and report on vibrations and other anomalies on key components of certain helicopters in our fleet.
Table of Contents

Culture — Our safety culture and the implementation of the Target Zero program is modeled by each employee and led by our President and Chief Executive Officer, who is responsible for setting the tone at the top. Under COBI, all employees are empowered, and actively encouraged by management, to challenge unsafe acts and conditions, including by exercising his or her “STOP WORK” authority, and participate in safety improvements by the Company. Our strong safety culture is further exemplified by our status as a founding member of HeliOffshore, an organization dedicated to collaboration across the offshore helicopter industry to improve safety around the world.

Government Regulation
Regulatory Matters.  Globally our operations are subject to significant regulations where we operate our equipment or where the equipment is registered or operated and international treaties and conventions. Our results of operations and financial condition are dependent upon our ability to maintain compliance with all such applicable laws, regulations, treaties and conventions. 
United Kingdom
Our operations in the U.K. are subject to the Civil Aviation Act 1982 and other similar English statutes and regulations. We carry persons and property in our aircraft pursuant to an operating license and route license issued by the Civil Aviation Authority (the “CAA”). The holder of an operating license must meet the criteria of Regulation (EC) 1008/2008, as amended and incorporated into U.K. law by the Operation of Air Services (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations. These criteria include, inter alia, an air carrier’s financial fitness, the adequacy of its insurance, and the fitness of the persons who will manage the air carrier. To operate under our route license, the company through which we conduct operations in the U.K., BHL, must be majority owned and controlled by U.K. nationals. 
The CAA regulates our U.K. flight operations and exercises jurisdiction over personnel, aircraft, ground facilities and certain technical aspects of those operations. The CAA often imposes improved safety standards. Under the Licensing of Air Carriers Regulations 1992, it is unlawful to operate any aircraft for hire within the U.K. unless such aircraft are approved by the CAA. Changes in U.K. statutes or regulations, administrative requirements or their interpretation may have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition or on our ability to continue operations in the U.K.
We are subject to the U.K. Bribery Act, which creates criminal offenses for bribery and failing to prevent bribery. We are also subject to new U.K. corporate criminal offenses for failure to prevent the facilitation of tax evasion pursuant to the Criminal Finances Act 2017, which imposes criminal liability on a company where it has failed to prevent the criminal facilitation of tax evasion by a person associated with us.
We are obligated to comply with U.K. and Export Controls and Economic Sanctions regulations that may restrict the export of designated items to certain persons or destinations.  A variety of penalties, both criminal and civil, may be imposed for breaches of these regulations.
Norway
Our operations in the Norway are subject to E.U. statutes and regulations as Norway is a member of the European Economic Area (EEA) and signatory to the European Common Aviation Area Agreement (ECAA). We carry persons and property in our aircraft pursuant to an operating license issued by the Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority. The holder of an operating license must meet the ownership and control requirements criteria of Regulation (EC) 1008/2008, as amended and incorporated into Norwegian law. The company through which we conduct operations in Norway must be majority owned and controlled by E.U. nationals.
United States
As a certified air carrier, our U.S. operations are subject to regulations under the Federal Aviation Act, regulations of the Department of Transportation (“DOT”) and other laws. We carry persons and property in our helicopters under an air taxi Certificate granted by the FAA. The FAA regulates our U.S. flight operations and, in this respect, exercises jurisdiction over personnel, aircraft, ground facilities and certain technical aspects of our operations. The DOT can review our economic fitness to continue our operations at any time and if a substantial change occurs to our management, ownership or capital structure, among other things. The National Transportation Safety Board is authorized to investigate any aircraft accidents and to recommend improved safety standards. Our U.S. operations are also subject to the Federal Communications Act of 1934 because we use radio facilities in our operations.
Under the Federal Aviation Act, it is unlawful to operate certain aircraft for hire within the U.S. unless such aircraft are registered with the FAA and the FAA has issued an operating certificate to the operator. As a general rule, aircraft may be registered under the Federal Aviation Act only if the aircraft are owned or controlled by one or more citizens of the U.S. An operating certificate may be granted only to a citizen of the U.S. For purposes of these requirements, a corporation is deemed to 
Table of Contents

be a citizen of the U.S. if no less than 75% of its voting interests are owned or controlled by U.S. citizens, its president is a U.S. citizen, two-thirds or more of the directors are U.S. citizens and it is under the actual control of U.S. citizens. If persons other than U.S. citizens should come to own or control more than 25% of our voting interest or if any of the other requirements are not met, we have been advised that our aircraft could be subject to deregistration under the Federal Aviation Act, and we might lose our ability to operate within the U.S. Deregistration of our aircraft for any reason, including foreign ownership in excess of permitted levels, would have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct certain operations within our Americas region operations. Therefore, our organizational documents provide for the automatic reduction of voting rights of shares of our outstanding voting capital stock owned or controlled by non-U.S. citizens, to the extent necessary to comply with these requirements. As of March 31, 2022, we believe that non-U.S. citizens owned less than 25% of our outstanding common stock. Given the limited trading of our common stock, our foreign ownership may fluctuate on each trading day, which may result in the reduction of voting rights of shares held by non-U.S. citizens in excess of the 25% threshold pursuant to our organizational documents.
We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the “FCPA”), which generally prohibits us and our intermediaries from making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or receiving preferential treatment.
We are subject to regulations imposed by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control and other U.S. laws and regulations that prohibit dealings with sanctioned countries and certain other third parties.
We are subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”), which controls the export and import of defense-related articles, services and technical data. ITAR dictates that information and material pertaining to defense and military related technologies may only be shared with U.S. persons or organizations unless authorization from the U.S. State Department is received or a special exemption is used. We are also subject to the Export Administration Regulations (the “EAR”) that control the export of commercial and “dual use” goods. Persons or organizations subject to U.S. jurisdiction may incur heavy fines if they violate ITAR or the EAR.
Brazil
In Brazil, an operator must be licensed by the National Agency for Civil Aviation. Any change in the licensing requirements could affect the licenses of Bristow Taxi Aéreo S.A (“Bristow Brazil”). Our ability to conduct our helicopter operating business in Brazil is dependent on our ability to maintain the licenses and AOC of our operating entity, Bristow Brazil. 
Nigeria
We are subject to state and local laws and regulations governing our services. Our operations in Nigeria are also subject to the Nigerian Content Development Act, which requires that oil and gas contracts be awarded to a company that is seen or perceived to have more “local content” than a “Foreign” competitor. Additionally, the Nigerian Content Development Act allows the monitoring board to penalize companies that do not meet these local content requirements up to 5% of the value of the contract.
Environmental
Our business is subject to international and U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and occupational safety and health and highly dependent on the offshore oil and gas industry which is also subject to such laws and regulations, including those that govern the discharge of oil and pollutants into navigable waters. Certain of our business operations, including the operation and maintenance of aircraft, require that we use, store and dispose of materials that are subject to environmental regulation. Failure to comply with these environmental laws and regulations may result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, and we may become subject to regulatory enforcement actions in the form of injunctions and cease and desist orders. We may also be subject to civil claims arising out of a pollution event. Certain environmental laws and regulations may expose us to strict, joint and several liability relating to releases of hazardous materials or contamination conditions regardless of whether we were responsible, and even if our operations were in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations at the time they were conducted. In addition, the operations of our customers in the oil and gas exploration, development and production industry are regulated by environmental laws and regulations that may restrict their 
Table of Contents

activities and may result in reduced demand for our services. To date, such laws and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
These laws include the federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act, which imposes restrictions on the discharge of pollutants to the navigable waters of the U.S. In addition, because our operations generate and, in some cases, involve the transportation of hazardous wastes, we are subject to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which regulates the use, generation, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of certain hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, referred to as CERCLA or the Superfund law, and certain comparable state laws, strict, joint and several liability can be imposed without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the current and former owner and operator of a contaminated site where a hazardous substance release occurred and any company that transported, disposed of or arranged for the transport or disposal of hazardous substances, even from inactive operations or closed facilities, in connection with such contaminated sites. In addition, neighboring landowners or other third parties may file claims for personal injury, property damage and recovery of response cost. We own, lease, and operate properties and facilities that, in some cases, have been used for industrial activities for many years. Hazardous substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons may have been released on or under the properties owned or leased by us, or on or under other locations where such substances have been taken for disposal. In addition, some of these properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners whose treatment, storage and disposal or release of such substances was not under our control. These properties and the substances and wastes disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes, remediate contaminated property, or perform remedial activities to prevent future contamination.
We believe that our operations are currently in material compliance with all environmental laws and regulations. We do not expect that we will be required to make capital expenditures in the near future that are material to our financial position or operations to comply with environmental laws and regulations; however, given the longer term trend of more expansive and stringent environmental laws and regulations, we cannot predict the ultimate cost of complying with these laws and regulations. There can be no assurance, however, that any future laws, regulations or requirements, or that any discharge or emission of pollutants by us (or our customers) will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or our results of operations.
Other
We are subject to state and local laws and regulations including, but not limited to, significant state regulations for our emergency response services. In addition, our operations in other markets are subject to local governmental regulations that may limit foreign ownership of aviation companies. Because of these local regulations, we conduct some of our operations through entities in which citizens of such countries own a majority interest and we hold a noncontrolling interest, or under contracts which provide that we operate assets for the local companies and conduct their flight operations. Changes in local laws, regulations or administrative requirements or their interpretation may have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition or on our ability to continue operations in these areas.
