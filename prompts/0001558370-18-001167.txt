     Item 1. Business
     Overview
     Teladoc, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that was originally formed in Texas on June 13, 2002 and reincorporated in Delaware on October 16, 2008.
 We are the largest and most trusted virtual healthcare provider in the world. Recognized by MIT Technology Review as one of the “50 Smartest Companies”, we are forging a new healthcare experience with better convenience, outcomes and value. We provide virtual access to high quality care and expertise, with a portfolio of services and solutions covering 450 medical subspecialties from non-urgent, episodic needs like flu and upper respiratory infections, to chronic, complicated medical conditions like cancer and congestive heart failure. By marrying the latest in data and analytics with an award-winning user experience and a highly flexible technology platform, we have delivered millions of medical visits to patients around the globe. 
 On July 14, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Best Doctors Holdings, Inc. (“Best Doctors”), an expert medical consultation company. Best Doctors provides technology innovations and services to help employers, health plans and provider organizations to improve health outcomes for the most complex, critical and costly medical issues.
 Over 23 million unique Members now benefit from access to Teladoc 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. We completed approximately 1,463,000 telehealth visits in 2017 and approximately 952,000 telehealth visits in 2016. Paid membership increased by approximately 5.7 million members from December 31, 2016 through December 31, 2017 including the impact from Best Doctors.
 Our portfolio of solutions transform the access, cost and quality dynamics of healthcare delivery for all of our market participants. Our Members rely on Teladoc for a single point of virtual access to resolution to a broad array of healthcare needs, ranging from the flu, to behavioral health to cancer, in an experience designed to meet the expectations of today’s consumers. Employers, health plans, provider organizations, insurance and financial services companies and consumers (our “Clients”) purchase our solutions to reduce their healthcare spending, or to provide a market differentiating service as a complement to their core set of consumer service offerings, while at the same time offering convenient, affordable, high-quality healthcare to their employees or beneficiaries. 
 We believe the value proposition of our solutions is evidenced by our overall Member satisfaction rate of 90% over the last nine years. We further believe any consumer, employer, health plan or provider, insurance and financial service companies interested in a better approach to healthcare is a potential Teladoc Member, Client or Provider.
     The U.S. healthcare system is experiencing a growing crisis of access, cost and quality of care due to inefficiencies in today’s healthcare system and barriers between participants. According to the National Association of Community Health Centers, or the NACHC, approximately 62 million individuals in the United States currently have no or inadequate access to primary care as a result of physician shortages. Absent convenient access to a primary care physician, individuals will most likely either not seek care at all or visit emergency rooms or urgent care clinics, the most expensive and often inefficient settings for their primary care needs.
     These market dynamics impact not only the consumers seeking care, but also the health plans, employers and health systems that ultimately bear all or a portion of these costs. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the CDC, there are approximately 1.25 billion ambulatory care visits in the United States per year, including those at primary care offices, hospital emergency rooms, outpatient clinics and other settings. We estimate that approximately 417 million, or 33%, of these visits could be treated through telehealth. We believe that the total addressable market for telehealth in the United States consists of the ambulatory care telehealth opportunity, a subset of visits currently delivered in urgent and retail care settings and care foregone by those currently not accessing the healthcare delivery system.

 Additionally, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or the AHRQ, there are approximately 168 million behavioral health visits completed in provider offices in the United States per year. We estimate that approximately 131 million, or 78%, of these visits could be treated through telehealth.
     Innovators in other industries have solved access, cost and quality inefficiencies through the implementation of technology platforms and business models that deliver products and services on‑demand and create new economies by connecting and empowering both consumers and businesses. We have taken the same approach to solving the pervasive access, cost and quality challenges facing the current healthcare system. We believe we have created portfolio of solutions uniquely positioned to bridge the supply and demand gap between physicians and consumers by fundamentally changing the way market participants access and deliver healthcare—eliminating traditional barriers and inefficiencies between participants and empowering them to engage in a healthcare marketplace anytime, anywhere. 
     Our solution offers our Clients proven substantial savings opportunities and an attractive return on investment. A study we commissioned with Veracity Analytics, an independent healthcare data analytics company, to perform an independent study of several Clients representing nearly 2 million of our Members as of the end of 2016, found that these Clients saved $472 on average per visit when its Members received care through Teladoc instead of receiving care in other settings for the same diagnosis. Combined with average employee productivity savings of $46, estimated from data provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we saved our Clients approximately $493 million in healthcare delivery costs in 2016.
     We currently serve over 10,000 employers, health plans, health systems and other entities. These Clients collectively purchase access to our solution for more than 23.2 million Members. We believe our business to business to consumer, or B2B2C, distribution strategy is one of the most efficient methods to reach consumers and deliver telehealth to our Members. We have over 35 health plans as Clients, including some of the largest in the United States such as Aetna, Blue Shield of California, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama, Premera Blue Shield and UnitedAd. Health plans serve as Clients as well as distribution channels to self‑insured employer Clients that contract with us through a health plan relationship. Our employer Clients include over 40% of the Fortune 1000 companies. The remainder of our Clients are from channel partners such as brokers, resellers and consultants who sell into a range of small, medium and large enterprises.
     We generate revenue from our Clients on a contractually recurring, per-Member-per-month, subscription access fee basis, which provides us with significant revenue visibility. In addition, we generate additional revenue on a per-telehealth general medical visit basis, through a visit fee. Certain of our Client contracts generate revenue for expert second opinions on a per case basis. Subscription access fees are paid by our Clients on behalf of their employees, dependents, policy holders, card holders, beneficiaries or themselves, while general medical and other specialty visit fees are paid by either Clients or Members. We generated revenue of $233.3 million (including $47.0 million from Best Doctors), $123.2 million and $77.4 million in revenue in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing 89% and 59% year‑over‑year growth from 2016 to 2017 and from 2015 to 2016, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, 85% and 15% of our revenue were derived from subscription access fees and visit fees, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, 82% and 18% of our revenue were derived from subscription access fees and visit fees, respectively. We believe these results are representative of the value proposition we can provide the broader U.S. healthcare system.
     Our Opportunity
     Barriers and inefficiencies in the current U.S. healthcare system present market participants with three major challenges: (i) consumers lack sufficient access to high‑quality, cost‑effective healthcare at appropriate sites of care, while bearing an increasing share of costs; (ii) employers and health plans lack an effective solution that reduce costs while enhancing healthcare access for beneficiaries; and (iii) providers lack flexibility to increase productivity by delivering care on their own terms. Market participants are therefore increasingly unable to effectively and efficiently receive, deliver or administer healthcare. At the same time, the emergence of technology platforms solving massive structural challenges in other industries has highlighted the need for a similar solution in healthcare. We believe there is a significant opportunity to solve these challenges through trusted solutions, such as ours, that match consumer demand

and physician supply at the time of need, provide consumers access to medical opinions from leading global experts, and offer health plans and employers attractive, cost-effective healthcare alternatives for their beneficiaries.
     Growing Healthcare Access Crisis for Consumers
     Consumers in the United States are increasingly challenged to obtain access to affordable healthcare at appropriate sites of care when care is most needed. According to a 2017 Merritt Hawkins study, the average lead time to see a primary care physician across various metro areas was 29 days. We also believe issues around access are projected to get worse. A 2017 study from IHS Markit prepared for the Association of American Medical Colleges found that physician demand continues to grow faster than supply, resulting in a projected total physician shortfall of up to 104,900 physicians by 2030, including a shortage of approximately 43,100 primary care physicians. We believe this projection is supported by the 2016 Survey of America’s Physicians, in which 80.6% of physicians describe themselves as either over-extended or at full capacity. Expected population growth and aging, and the projected gap between supply and demand for access to healthcare services, will place additional pressure on an already overburdened healthcare system that lacks physician capacity and diagnoses-appropriate access points.
     This access crisis has resulted in U.S. consumers either seeking care at inappropriate, more costly settings such as hospital emergency rooms, or foregoing needed care entirely. A 2015 survey from the American College of Emergency Physicians found that almost 50% of physicians polled stated that demands for care coordination including emergency department visits are increasing due to increased difficulty in finding or arranging timely follow-up with primary care physicians and/or specialists. In the same survey, 70% of physicians polled also noted that they believe their emergency department is not adequately prepared for potentially substantial increases in patient volume.
     In addition to challenges finding care, consumers also face challenges accessing the highest-quality care. Owing to reasons ranging from complexity of symptoms, the unusual nature of disease, or physician expertise, medical diagnoses are often incorrect. A 2017 study by the Mayo Clinic published in Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice showed that among a sample of cases that had been referred for second opinions, in 12% of cases the final diagnoses matched the primary diagnoses, in 66% of cases the final diagnoses refined the primary diagnoses, and in 21% of cases the final diagnoses were materially different than the primary diagnoses. Reducing unnecessary treatment related to misdiagnosis has a significant impact on the quality and cost of care a patient receives.
     Healthcare Cost Burden and Lack of Viable Options for Health Plans and Employers
     The U.S. healthcare system is burdened by significant waste and extreme variations in access, cost and quality of care. A study published in The Journal of the American Medical Association estimates that approximately $734 billion, or 27%, of all healthcare spending in 2011 was wasted due to factors such as the provision of unnecessary services, inefficient delivery of care and inflated prices. When consumers are forced to seek care at inappropriate and more costly sites of care, those cost inefficiencies impact not only the consumer, but also the health plans and employers that ultimately bear all or a portion of these costs.
     The costs and associated burdens on health plans, employers and consumers are only expected to increase. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, estimates U.S. national health expenditures reached $3.3 trillion, or approximately 17.9% of the U.S. GDP in 2016, and will reach approximately 19.9% of GDP by 2025. A survey from Milliman in 2017 noted that healthcare costs for an average American family of four exceeded $26,900 in 2017, a 4.3% increase over 2016. A 2017 survey by the National Business Group on Health indicated that employers bear on average 70% of their employees’ healthcare costs and CMS forecasted U.S. employers spent approximately $660 billion on healthcare in 2015. Despite the significant amount of dollars spent, U.S. healthcare outcomes remain inferior relative to those of many other countries.
     The unsustainable levels of spending on healthcare and extreme inefficiencies in the system have driven an increased focus by employers and health plans to control healthcare expenditures. Governments, private insurance companies and self-insured employers, are implementing meaningful cost containment measures, including shifting financial responsibility to patients through higher co-pays and deductibles and delivering healthcare through alternative, more cost-effective methods. According to a 2017 survey by America’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), as of January 

 
  4

 
2016, over 20 million Americans were enrolled in HSA-Qualified High-Deductible Health Plans, a 76% increase since 2011. The increasing shift of financial responsibility to patients coupled with increased pricing transparency has, in turn, heightened beneficiary focus on healthcare alternatives. As consumers take responsibility for a larger share of their healthcare costs and spend more on healthcare services, they are also demanding higher quality care, greater control in how and where they receive care, increased convenience and more service for every dollar spent.
     Challenging Environment for Physicians is Constraining Supply
     In response to increasing pressures, physicians are reducing access to healthcare in multiple ways. The 2016 Survey of America’s Physicians indicated that 48% of physicians plan to take steps to limit access to their practices, including cutting back on the number of patients seen, working part‑time, closing their practices to new members, seeking non‑clinical jobs or retiring. Notably, 47% of surveyed physicians indicated they plan to accelerate retirement given changes in the healthcare environment. A study by Physicians for a National Health Program showed medical billing paperwork and insurance‑related red tape cost the United States economy approximately $471 billion in 2012, 80% of which was wasted due to inefficiency. These constraints have driven physicians to seek more control over the way they deliver care to new and existing patients, increase their income and reduce the amount of time they spend on administration.
     Physicians have responded to these challenges by shifting payment models and patient mix. Medscape’s 2017 Physician Compensation Report showed a 100% increase from 2012 to 2017 in the percent of physicians transitioning to cash-only models, no longer accepting insurance. A 2017 Merritt Hawkins study found that 47.0% of physicians in the United States’ 15 largest cities are not accepting new Medicaid patients. We believe there is a significant opportunity for a single source solution that addresses these physician needs.
     Opportunity to Remove Barriers Through an Innovative Platform that Benefits All Participants
     We believe we have a significant opportunity to solve access, cost and quality of care challenges through a platform that matches consumer demand and physician availability in real-time and asynchronously, and in various modalities such as video, web, mobile and telephone, while offering health plans and employers an attractive, cost-effective alternative for their beneficiaries through our platform. As consumerism in healthcare increases and consumers and providers become accustomed to on-demand services in other industries, they are similarly demanding technology-powered solutions for their healthcare needs. The emergence and subsequent rapid adoption of technologies such as big data and analytics, cloud-based solutions, online video and mobile applications represents an enormous opportunity for healthcare innovation. We believe the confluence of consumer empowerment, emergence of broad technology solutions and focus by all constituents on providing high-quality, cost-effective healthcare creates a unique opportunity for a disruptive platform that transforms the way consumers access, providers deliver and employers and health plans administer high-quality, cost-efficient healthcare.

       Highly Scalable Platform
     Our platform is highly scalable and can currently provide the same level of Member support and response time for upwards of 50,000 visits per day versus our current rate of over 7,000 visits per day on average. Similarly, our platform is currently equipped to serve over 100 million Members. Further, our platform has been built to accommodate the seamless and quick introduction of new services and products, such as behavioral health, dermatology, expert second opinions, laboratory testing and other services that are currently in the development stages. We have the ability to respond quickly to evolving market needs with innovative solutions, such as mobile applications, biometric devices, mobile geofencing and at‑home testing, to enhance our solution and support our leadership position. We believe our highly scalable platform provides us with significant growth opportunities within our existing membership and client bases and allows us to grow with low capital expenditure requirements.      Clinical Capabilities Tailored to Telehealth
     We believe that by directly recruiting, credentialing, training and contracting with our Providers we have built our clinical capabilities in a manner that supports the operational complexity of and commitment to clinical quality required in telehealth. Our physician Providers are board‑certified with an average of 20 years of experience and are credentialed through an NCQA‑certified process. The NCQA’s accreditation process involves a comprehensive on‑site and off‑site review by a team of physicians and managed care experts that evaluates more than 60 quality‑related healthcare standards, including quality management and improvement and utilization management. The results of the evaluation are reviewed by the NCQA’s National Review Oversight Committee prior to their assigning an accreditation level. The NCQA’s requirements are developed with the input and support of health plans, providers, purchasers, unions and consumer groups. The NCQA’s accreditation process is not telehealth specific; rather, since its formation in 1990, the NCQA established, and consistently updates, its quality standards and performance measures for a broad range of healthcare entities by building consensus around important health care quality issues. In determining its quality standards and performance measures, the NCQA works with large employers, policymakers, doctors, patients and health plans to determine areas of focus and how to promote improvement within them. Health plans in every state, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico are NCQA accredited. According to the NCQA, these certified plans cover 109 million Americans, or 70.5% of all Americans enrolled in health plans.
     Our clinical capabilities are designed specifically for telehealth. For example, our Members have the option to share a record of every visit and their EMR with their existing primary care physicians. In circumstances where a Member reports that they do not have a primary care physician, the Teladoc Provider educates the Member on the importance of establishing this relationship. Prior to every visit, the Provider reviews the Member’s proprietary EMR and certifies to this review by completing a multi‑step checklist. During and following the visit, the Provider may reference our over 100 proprietary Evidence Based clinical guidelines and other telehealth‑specific content. In addition, Members and Providers remain connected following visits. Members receive personalized notes, patient education materials and are able to ask questions of our clinical team via the Teladoc Message Center. Approximately 10% of all physician visits are reviewed by our clinical quality assurance staff to ensure adherence to appropriate treatment and prescription patterns. We believe our track record of zero medical malpractice claims is a testament to our Providers’ clinical quality.

  Well‑Established Distribution Channels and Strategic Alliances
     We have developed sales channels and strategic alliances which we believe provide an opportunity to sell our solution through trusted partners. Our solution is sold through a highly efficient and effective B2B2C distribution network wherein we reach consumers through our Clients and channel partners rather than marketing our solution directly to potential Members. We sell through a direct sales force to our Clients who in turn buy our solution on behalf of their beneficiaries. In addition, a range of third‑parties including brokers, agents, benefits consultants and resellers, whom we refer to as channel partners, sell our solution to various end markets. Notably, many of our health plan Clients also act as channel partners because they resell our solution to their administrative service only or ASO accounts and other customers, we also market our behavioral services directly to consumers through digital advertising campaigns. We believe the breadth of our distribution strategy allows us to directly reach consumers and also employers of nearly every size and in nearly every market, which are capable of purchasing our solution for a large number of beneficiaries, rather than attempting to sell our solution one consumer at a time.     Our Growth Strategies
     The following are our key growth strategies.
      Expand Our Comprehensive Virtual Care Delivery Platform
     Teladoc is creating a new paradigm for how consumers access healthcare. We are delivering a single solution to address the complete spectrum of conditions from non-critical, episodic care to chronic, complicated cases. Our mission is to become the central and trusted source for our Clients and Members to address the broadest array of healthcare needs, on their terms, anytime, anywhere. We refer to Teladoc’s integrated offering as our comprehensive Virtual Care Delivery Platform. Our Virtual Care Delivery Platform matches the expectations of today’s digital consumer with a new kind of healthcare experience, leveraging expansive digital clinical services, deep integration with the broader healthcare ecosystem, powerful data & analytics, device & wearables integration and ubiquitous entry points, all of them wrapped in our Surround Sound marketing to drive behavior change and engagement. Our suite of clinical services ranges from high volume, lower acuity offerings such as general medical, dermatology, behavioral health, tobacco cessation, and sexual health to lower volume, higher acuity offerings for Expert Second Opinions, Treatment Decision Support, Critical Care support, Specialty Pharmacy cost containment, and Oncology Insights with IBM Watson.  
    
 We believe that our Virtual Care Delivery Platform addresses significant unmet needs. According to the 2012 white paper from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, approximately 46 million adults in the U.S. suffer from mental illness with more than 11 million adults reporting an unmet need for mental healthcare. Compounding this unmet need, the shortage of psychiatrists and behavioral health resources has become acute nationwide. According to a 2014 Merritt Hawkins report, psychiatrists are essentially aging out of the workforce, with over 70% of psychiatrists 50 years of age or older. The Teladoc provider network underpinning the Virtual Care Delivery Platform addresses the challenges of the current healthcare environment by offering our Clients & Members 24/7/265, on-demand access to 

 
  9

 
over 3,000 board-certified physicians and behavioral health professionals who treat a wide range of conditions and cases. With the addition of the Best Doctors global network, consisting of 50,000+ medical experts in more than 450 medical specialties, we are able to offer solutions to our Members for a range of critical, life-threatening cases such as cancer, musculoskeletal conditions, inflammatory disorders, heart conditions, chronic pain, and many other chronic, complex, and critical medical issues. Finally, we also offer direct-to-Member access to behavioral health professionals who treat conditions such as anxiety and depression.  By bringing these provider networks together under our Virtual Care Delivery Platform, we believe we have created an unrivaled offering that will enable the continued expansion of our product portfolio and solve the biggest challenges of our Clients and Members. 
      Increase Engagement with Our Members by Driving Expanded Access & Enhanced Touch Points
     We believe there is significant opportunity within our existing membership base to increase engagement by continually driving awareness of and loyalty to our solution. We believe our Virtual Care Delivery Platform can become the single source for on-demand, virtual care for our Members. We will continually refine and enhance our user experience, which is a critical driver of new and repeat engagement and we will continue validating our Member satisfaction with surveys and other proactive tools. We are also building robust data repositories to strengthen our predictive models and multi-channel marketing strategies to provide a more complete picture of our Members, enhancing our ability to lead targeted and purposeful campaigns. We will continue to invest heavily in marketing technologies that allow us to increase Member touch-points. In addition, we will continue to actively engage Clients in benefit design, worksite marketing and executive sponsorship strategies to drive awareness about our solution.
     Our mobile app is foundational for Teladoc as we have redefined virtual care delivery and are providing our Members with a better way to navigate their individual care. In 2017, we launched an integrated mobile experience for our joint Teladoc and Best Doctors clients. Our Members now benefit from a single, patient-centered point of access to our Virtual Care Delivery Platform. Further, Consumers are increasingly using mobile devices to take control of their healthcare journey, with nearly 74% of Teladoc visits being requested through mobile. Our new integrated app experience enables our Members to meet their care needs, whenever and wherever they are, removing the complexities of accessing care. As we expand the range of products and services available to our Members, we are investing in a seamless, relevant, and personalized mobile experience that provides smart guidance for our Members. Members will only need to express their healthcare need through a user-friendly, AI-supported, guided interface, and they will be presented with the optimal product or pathway to meet that need.
      Expand Our Membership with New and Existing Clients
     We believe that we offer a highly differentiated suite of solutions for a broad range of market segments, spanning the spectrum of traditional healthcare system participants such as employers, health plans and health systems as well as global financial services businesses and other organizations that have extended their investment in our industry. We intend to increase our membership by adding additional Members from both existing Clients, which we refer to as whitespace, and from new Clients. We plan to execute this strategy by further penetrating existing relationships and by pursuing new relationships through our distribution channels and an expanded sales team. Within existing accounts, we believe our current membership represents only a fraction of the potential Members available to us. Our existing health plan Clients and self‑insured Clients associated with these health plans currently purchase our solution for only a small percentage of their beneficiaries in the aggregate, and we estimate this provides us the opportunity to grow our membership base by more than 50 million individuals by expanding our penetration within our existing Clients alone. Similarly, we have 291 Fortune 1000 Clients, representing a significant opportunity for new Client growth with large employers. A key focus for us in 2018 will be to cross-sell and upsell these Clients our full suite of services. We are investing heavily in new marketing technologies and support staff to aid our sales force in penetrating existing accounts, lead generation, new Client generation and implementations. We further believe that as market leader, we have a strong, established brand and are uniquely positioned to capitalize on the B2C channel in the future.      Leverage Existing Sales Channels and Penetrate New Markets
     We have developed a highly effective and efficient global distribution network. In our core, traditional markets we are targeting large employers and health plans while simultaneously committing incremental sales and marketing

resources to small medium business (“SMB”) sales channel to increase our penetration within this market. Additionally, we intend to further penetrate the provider market, notably hospitals and group physician practices, as we believe our solution offers these markets an attractive platform from which to generate substantial income by acquiring new patients and to better participate in emerging risk‑sharing and value‑based payment models, such as Accountable Care Organizations and Patient‑Centered Medical Homes. Most recently, we made a significant advancement into international markets through our acquisition of Best Doctors. This international Client base, largely comprised of global financial services companies, provides fertile ground for expansion of our product portfolio through existing partners in attractive markets where our infrastructure is already in place. We have preliminarily embarked on exploring the global expansion of telehealth through this new distribution network.
      Expand Across Care Settings & Use Cases
     We intend to expand our solution across use cases and additional care settings. In particular, we plan to leverage our newly acquired Best Doctors network to significantly expand our scope. We also continually explore ancillary opportunities to broaden our business. We believe our services have wide applicability across new use cases, including home care, post discharge, wellness/screening and new areas in chronic care. We are also currently extending or have already offered to our Members additional range and functionality of our benefits applications, and will continue to respond quickly to evolving market needs with innovative solutions, including mobile applications, biometric devices and at‑home testing.      Expand Through Focused Acquisitions
     We plan to continue to leverage our know‑how and the scale of our platform to selectively pursue acquisitions. To date, we have completed six acquisitions that have expanded our distribution capabilities and broadened our service offering, including into areas such as behavioral health. Our acquisition strategy is centered on acquiring products, capabilities, clinical specialties, technologies and distribution channels that are highly scalable and rapidly growing. We will continue to evaluate and pursue acquisition opportunities that are complementary to our business.     Technology and Operations
     Our integrated technology platform supports rapid and efficient access to, and evaluation of, information from a variety of healthcare network participants. It has a user friendly interface designed to empower Members and dependents to remotely access healthcare whenever and wherever each individual chooses (via mobile devices, the Internet, video and phone).
     Our enterprise scale platform is architected for sharing clinical and non clinical data in real time among the Teladoc constituents, which include: Members, Providers, provider network operations centers staff, nurses, SureScripts (for electronic medication prescription writing, routing and fulfillment) and health plans for real time Member eligibility verification , financial responsibility calculations, claims processing, clinical summaries and clinical alerts.
     The Teladoc Provider network leverages our technology platform for managing custom visit queues that automatically and instantly route requested visits to the appropriate Providers based upon proprietary algorithms. Providers use our Internet based application or iOs app for viewing their visit queue, scheduling visits and following the proprietary Teladoc workflow for reviewing Members’ medical history and symptoms, documenting the completed visits, e Prescribing, if appropriate, and sending applicable medical content with follow up instructions to the Member via a secure message center.
     We use data and analytics to predict demand patterns by geography and we recruit and manage our Provider network to meet the demands of our members. Our complex algorithms enable us to effectively manage/allocate supply and onboard Providers to meet demand while maintaining one hour guaranteed response times, with a median response time of less than ten minutes.

 Additionally, our platform’s external connectivity and easy integration with EMR and outside systems extends its functionality and customer features, which include:
    
· | Member real‑time eligibility and financial liability;
--+------------------------------------------------------


· | clinical alerts, including gaps in care integration;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


· | partner integration and operability;
--+-------------------------------------


· | clinical data exchange (including, biometrics and visit information); and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a fully functional RESTful API.
--+--------------------------------

      REST is a stateless, scalable web services architecture that utilizes open communication standards such as HTTP and HTTPS, and has been widely adopted for system to system communications. Having a documented set of RESTful API’s enables our Clients and Members to access our solution using a custom or existing website or mobile app. For example, a Teladoc health plan Client can offer its Members the ability to access our solution through their existing Member portal. Members can also register for Teladoc, complete their medical history, select a pharmacy and request a visit without having to access the Teladoc Member site. All of these functions are provided via the Client’s website or mobile app that completes system calls to the Teladoc API to process the requests.
     The following graphic displays our robust technology architecture that supports our proprietary platforms that service our lines of business:

 The primary goal of our integrated platform architecture is to provide a single member experience for our clients whether they have purchased one or several of our service offerings. This is accomplished via an enterprise services based architecture that isolates functional capabilities into independent, standalone service pods that can be accessed by our member facing web and mobile properties. These services can also be accessed by partners that desire tighter integrations with seamless experiences for their members through Single Sign on (SSO), our SDK and our APIs. These pods can be independently managed and scaled to meet varying usage requirements. 
     We host portions of our application platforms and rely on cloud partners for our infrastructure to serve our users. For the non-cloud based infrastructure, we utilize two redundant data centers in geographically diverse locations. We rely on third party vendors to operate these data centers, which are designed to host computer systems that require high levels of availability and have redundant subsystems and compartmentalized security zones. We utilize commercially available hardware for our data center servers. Due to the sensitive nature of our Members and Clients’ data, we have a heightened focus on data security and protection. We have a rigorous and comprehensive information security program managed by a dedicated department of security engineers and analysts. We have implemented telehealth industry standard processes, policies and tools through all levels of our software development and network administration, including regularly scheduled vulnerability scanning and third party penetration testing in order to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities in our system. On an annual basis, we also undergo independent, third party HIPAA and SSAE 16 audits, and we achieved HiTRUST certification in 2017 (https://hitrustalliance.net/).
     Systems are actively monitored for any signs of unusual behavior and preemptive action is taken when necessary. Encrypted backup files are transmitted over secure connections to a redundant server storage device in a secondary data center. Our data center facilities employ advanced measures to ensure physical integrity, including redundant power and cooling systems, advanced fire and flood prevention, and 24x7 security guards.
     We have also successfully grown our business to a level that supports the establishment of three Teladoc owned provider network operations centers that were opened in December 2016 (Phoenix, AZ) and August 2015 (Lewisville, TX) as well as in July 2017 (Quincy, MA) as a result of the Best Doctors acquisition. Through these internal operations centers, our employees service Teladoc Members and Clients with expanded customer service, compliance monitoring, provider network operations as well as other business support functions.
     The three centers operate on a hosted virtual call center platform providing intelligent call routing across the centers for inbound and outbound member and client services in a geo-redundant enterprise 24 X 7 X 365. Through the platform, the centers operate as one in a virtual environment providing better time zone coverage, resource optimization, and disaster recovery roll-over.
     Sales and Marketing
     We sell our services principally through our direct sales organization. Our direct sales team is comprised of enterprise‑focused field sales professionals who are organized by geography and account size. Our field professionals are supported by a sales operations staff, including product technology experts, lead generation professionals and sales data experts. We maintain relationships with key industry participants including benefit consultants, brokers, group purchasing organizations and health plan and hospital partners.
     We generate Client leads, accelerate sales opportunities and build brand awareness through our marketing programs. Our marketing programs target human resource, benefits and finance executives in addition to technology and health professionals, senior business leaders and healthcare channel partners. Our principal marketing programs include use of our website to provide information about our company and our solution, as well as learning opportunities for potential Members; demand generation; field marketing events; integrated marketing campaigns comprised of direct email and online advertising; and participation in industry events, trade shows and conferences.

 Clients and Members
     Our Clients consist of (i) employers, including 291 Fortune 1000 companies, (ii) health plans and (iii) health systems and other entities. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 10,000 Clients and our services reached over 23.2 million Members. The following is a selection of our Clients:
· | employers, such as Accenture, Bank of America, General Mills, Pepsi, and T‑Mobile;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | health plans, such as Aetna, Premera, Blue Shield of California, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama, UnitedAg, Universal American, Highmark Inc. and CareFirst of Maryland, Inc.; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | health systems, such as Einstein Healthcare Network, Silver Cross Hospital and Highmark Inc.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Within existing accounts, we believe our current membership represents only a fraction of the potential Members available to us. For example, our existing health plan Clients and self‑insured Clients associated with these health plans currently purchase our solution for only a small percentage of their beneficiaries in aggregate, reflecting a significant opportunity for membership growth. We believe there are in excess of 50 million potential Members within these existing Clients alone.
     Research and Development
     Our ability to compete depends, in large part, on our continuous commitment to rapidly introduce new services, technologies, features and functionality. Our product development team, which as of December 31, 2017, consisted of 115 employees, is responsible for the design, development, testing and certification of our solution. In addition, we utilize certain third‑party development services to perform application development and design services. We focus our efforts on developing new products and further enhancing the usability, functionality, reliability, performance and flexibility of our solution.     Competition
     We view as our competitors those companies that currently (or in the future will) (i) develop and market telehealth technology (devices and systems) or (ii) provide telehealth, such as the delivery of on‑demand access to healthcare. In the provision of telehealth, competition focuses on, among other factors, experience in operation, customer service, quality of technology and know‑how and reputation. Competitors in the telehealth market include MDLive, Inc., American Well Corporation and Grand Rounds, Inc., among other smaller industry participants.     Teladoc Physicians, P.A.
     We contract for our providers’ services through the Services Agreement with Teladoc Physicians, P.A. or Teladoc PA, and, therefore, our telehealth providers are not our employees. Under the Services Agreement, we have agreed to serve, on an exclusive basis, as manager and administrator of Teladoc PA’s non‑medical functions and services related to the provision of the telehealth services by physicians employed by or under contract with Teladoc PA. Teladoc PA has agreed to provide our members, through its physicians, access to telehealth services and recommended treatment 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. The Services Agreement also requires Teladoc PA to maintain the state licensure and other credentialing requirements of its physicians. The non‑medical functions and services we provide under the Services Agreement primarily include member management services such as maintaining network operations centers for our members to request a visit with Teladoc PA’s physicians (our providers), member billing and collection administration and maintenance and storage of member medical records. Under the Services Agreement, Teladoc PA currently pays us an access fee of $25,000 per month for network operations center and medical records maintenance, a fixed fee of $65,000 per month for our provision of management and administrative services and a license fee of $10,000 per month for the non‑exclusive use of the Teladoc trade name. The Services Agreement has a 20‑year term and expires in February 2025 unless earlier terminated upon mutual agreement of the parties or unilaterally by a party following the commencement of bankruptcy or liquidation proceeds by the non‑terminating party, a material breach of the Services

Agreement by the non‑terminating party or a governmental or judicial termination order related to the Services Agreement.
     Regulation
     For information regarding significant regulation that affects us, refer to “Regulatory Environment” of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and for a discussion of certain factors that may cause our actual results to differ from currently anticipated results in connection with regulation that affects us, see “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K     OTHER INFORMATION
     Employees
     As of December 31, 2017, we had 1,231 employees. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or party to a collective bargaining agreement.     Intellectual Property
     We own and use trademarks and service marks on or in connection with our services, including both unregistered common law marks and issued trademark registrations in the United States and around the world. We also have trademark applications pending to register marks in the United States and internationally. In addition, we rely on certain intellectual property rights that we license from third parties and on other forms of intellectual property rights and measures, including trade secrets, know‑how and other unpatented proprietary processes and nondisclosure agreements, to maintain and protect proprietary aspects of our products and technologies. Other than the trademarks Teladoc (and design) and Best Doctors (and design), we do not believe our business is dependent to a material degree on trademarks, patents, copyrights or trade secrets. We require our employees, consultants and certain of our contractors to execute confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements in connection with their employment or consulting relationships with us. We also require our employees and consultants to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived during the term of their employment or engagement while using our property or which relate to our business.     Legal Proceedings
 From time to time, Teladoc is involved in various litigation matters arising out of the normal course of business. We consult with legal counsel on those issues related to litigation and seek input from other experts and advisors with respect to such matters. Estimating the probable losses or a range of probable losses resulting from litigation, government actions and other legal proceedings is inherently difficult and requires an extensive degree of judgment, particularly where the matters involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages, may involve discretionary amounts, present novel legal theories, are in the early stages of the proceedings, or are subject to appeal. Whether any losses, damages or remedies ultimately resulting from such matters could reasonably have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows will depend on a number of variables, including, for example, the timing and amount of such losses or damages (if any) and the structure and type of any such remedies. Teladoc’s management does not presently expect any litigation matters to have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.     Seasonality
     We typically experience the strongest increases in consecutive quarterly revenue during the fourth and first quarters of each year, which coincides with traditional annual benefit enrollment seasons. In particular, as a result of many Clients’ introduction of new services at the very end of a calendar year, or the start of each calendar year, the majority of our new Client contracts have an effective date of January 1. Additionally, as a result of national seasonal cold and flu trends, we experience our highest level of visit fees during the first and fourth quarters of each year when compared to other quarters of the year. Conversely, the second quarter of the year has historically been the period of 

 
  15

 
lowest utilization of our Provider network services relative to the other quarters of the year. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly, which could adversely impact the value of our common stock.” included below in this annual report on Form 10-K.
