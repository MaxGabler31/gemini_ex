global network of professionals work with a multi-office approach in an effort to provide clients with the best, most economical project or program solutions.
We strive to provide client value through continuous improvement in our performance. We regularly monitor our clients' expectations, our project delivery protocols and system, and our operational performance. Tools such as our Jacobs Value Enhancing Practices, Global Standard Operating Procedures, project reviews, the Jacobs System to Ensure Project Success ("JSTEPS") and Safe Plans of Action ("SPAs") provide added value to our clients' projects. They also allow us to create performance improvement actions during the project execution. Through continuous improvement, with our tools and our processes, we believe we can offer our clients superior value when they do business with us.
JacobsValue+ SM ("Value Plus") is an internal tool we use to document and quantify the actual value or savings we provide to our clients and their projects. Some of the benefits achieved through the Value Plus program include lower total installed costs, shorter schedules and reduced life cycle costs. Value Plus is implemented at project initiation: a project goal is created and cost-saving ideas are entered into the Value Plus database. When the Value Plus cycle is complete, the project team and client identify and agree on the unique cost and/or schedule reductions for the project.
The Company’s Strategy
Our strategy is based on three key priorities:

• | Build a High Performance Culture - Reinforce a culture of accountability, inspirational leadership and innovation that will drive long-term outperformance;


• | Transform the Core - Fundamentally change the way we operate to improve project delivery, sales effectiveness and business excellence; and


• | Grow Profitably - Execute a balanced strategy focused on organic growth, mergers and acquisitions and active portfolio management to drive profitable growth in the most attractive sectors and geographies.

Employees and Safety
Our employees are our most important and valuable asset. The prevention of job-related injuries is given top priority. It is the policy of the Company to provide and maintain a safe and healthy working environment and to follow operating practices that safeguard all employees and result in a more efficient operation.  BeyondZero® is the name of the global program that promotes our culture of caring and goes beyond efforts to have an incident and injury-free safety performance. We implement a culture of caring where concern for employees' health, safety and welfare extends outside the office, beyond the project site fences and into their homes, cars and all the places where they interact with family, friends and fellow employees. We also have a mental health program that aims to promote positive mental health across our Company.
We strive to present a clear and consistent image of our Company to our clients, employees, shareholders and business partners, regarding how we behave, how we communicate, how we look and most importantly, how our promises to our clients are delivered, anywhere in the world.
We accomplish this foremost through our vision, mission and values, which allow us to behave as one company and unify us worldwide. By keeping our values as a central focus of our Company, we are able to think the same way and arrive at similar conclusions, regardless of our physical location. With respect to our values:
•Our values stand on a foundation of safety and integrity;
•People are the heart of our business;
•Clients are our valued partners;
•Performance excellence is our commitment; and
•Profitable growth is an imperative.
Our Vision statement, “Providing solutions for a more connected sustainable world” underpins our commitment to sustainability. Plan Beyond is how we define and identify our approach to sustainability. Building on BeyondZero and our culture of caring, Plan Beyond helps us to focus on looking beyond our company and how we contribute as a global corporate citizen. Our sustainability activities encompass stakeholders at Jacobs including our clients, our people and wider communities, our supply chain partners and our investors.  Our people are empowered to explore, to innovate and to develop solutions that help our clients deliver their sustainability goals. We have the experience and competency to assist our clients with the challenges of climate change, resilience of cities and infrastructure, efficient procurement, resource reuse and recycling, water resource management, energy source management and environmental protection and enhancement.  
Page 5

As our Company values espouse, people are the heart of our business. It is the talent of our people that is the key to our contribution to achieving our company vision. By their innovation and determination to embed sustainability into their design and delivery of service, we will contribute significantly to address the challenges facing sustainability through the thousands of clients and their stakeholders, whom we work with every year.
Applying the best, most efficient and effective sustainable solutions for clients worldwide, in all major industries in which our clients operate, allows us to make a significant contribution to a safe and sustainable future. We periodically issue a Sustainability Report that describes many of our efforts and accomplishments regarding sustainability.
With respect to human resources, our goal is to establish an inclusive, diverse workplace that energizes the people who fuel our Company's growth. Although we are a large company with a workforce of approximately 80,000 people in over 40 countries, our employees are unified in their focus on superior value, safety and ethical business practices regardless of the country in which they work and employees frequently move around the globe as they grow their careers.
Growth Strategy
Jacobs has grown significantly since its founding in 1947.  Both organic growth and strategic acquisitions play an important part of the Company’s growth strategy. We have acquired and integrated numerous companies over the years that have enhanced our capabilities, geographic reach and offerings.
In terms of organic growth, our relationship-based business model is central to our sustained growth and profitability. We pursue the development of long-term relationships and alliances with our clients. By working with our clients to solve their challenges, we increase our understanding of their overall business needs, as well as the unique technical requirements of their specific projects. This increased understanding enables us to provide superior value to our clients. Our approach provides us with opportunities to market the following services to our clients:

• | Consulting;


• | System enhancements;


• | Pre-design phases of large projects, which include master planning, project permitting and project finance options;


• | Design phase; and


• | Construction, post-start-up and commissioning phases of a facility, including operations and maintenance services.

Our relationships with clients also present ongoing opportunities to expand into adjacent sectors. For example, clients operating in the mining and minerals market often have a need for our infrastructure and buildings capabilities. The same is true for clients operating in other sectors.
We market our services to clients in a wide range of public, institutional, process and industrial sectors. We are able to price contracts competitively and enhance overall profitability while delivering additional value to our clients by integrating and bundling our services and providing differentiated solutions. In complex economic times, we believe we have the ability to evolve along with industry cycles worldwide. When opportunities decrease in a particular sector or geography, other opportunities often increase. Because of our focused industry diversity, we believe we are well positioned to address a wide range of opportunities across many sectors and geographies, which helps us grow our business.
The Role of Strategic Transactions in the Development of Our Business
Jacobs pursues acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions to drive long-term value and profitable growth by positioning us in the most attractive sectors and geographies. When we review acquisition targets, we are conscious of the effect the acquisition may have on our client base. We favor acquisitions that are aligned with our growth strategy, which target enhancements of our capabilities and add value to our customers and shareholders. We do this by (i) expanding into a new client sector; (ii) enhancing the range of services we provide existing clients; and/or (iii) accessing new geographic areas in which our clients either already operate or plan to expand. By expanding into new geographic areas and adding to our existing technical and project management capabilities, we strive to position ourselves as a preferred, single-source provider of technical, professional, and construction services to our clients.
See the following brief description of some of our recent key acquisitions:

It provides services to numerous public transit agencies and is a major provider of professional consulting services to Class 1 railroads across the U.S. 

In line with our strategy of driving long-term value and profitable growth, on October 21, 2018, Jacobs and WorleyParsons Limited, a company incorporated in Australia (“Buyer”), entered into a Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement pursuant to which Buyer agreed to acquire the Company’s Energy, Chemicals and Resource business (the "ECR Business") for an aggregate purchase price of $3.3 billion. The Transaction is expected to close in the first half of calendar year 2019. 
For additional information regarding certain issues related to our acquisition strategy, please refer to Item 1A-  Risk Factors below.
Lines of Business
During the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we reorganized our operating and reporting structure around three global lines of business (“LOBs”), which also serve as the Company’s operating segments: (i) Aerospace, Technology, Environmental and Nuclear, (ii) Buildings, Infrastructure and Advanced Facilities, and (iii) Energy, Chemicals and Resources. This reorganization occurred in conjunction with the integration of CH2M into the Company's legacy businesses, and was intended to better serve our global clients, leverage our workforce, help streamline operations and provide enhanced growth opportunities. The Company’s LOB leadership and internal reporting structures report to the Chief Executive Officer, who is also the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”), and enable the CODM to evaluate the performance of each of these segments and make appropriate resource allocations among each of the segments. The sales function is managed on an LOB basis, and accordingly, the associated cost is embedded in the new segments and reported to the respective LOB presidents. In addition, a portion of the costs of other support functions (e.g., finance, legal, human resources and information technology) is allocated to each LOB using methodologies which, we believe, effectively attribute the cost of these support functions to the revenue generating activities of the Company on a rational basis. The cost of the Company’s cash incentive plan, the Management Incentive Plan (“MIP”) and the expense associated with the Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. 1999 Stock Incentive Plan (“1999 SIP”) have likewise been charged to the LOBs except for those amounts determined to relate to the business as a whole (which amounts remain in other corporate expenses).
Segments
As discussed above, the services we provide fall into the following three lines of business (“LOB”): (i) Aerospace, Technology, Environmental and Nuclear, (ii) Buildings, Infrastructure, and Advanced Facilities and (iii) Energy, Chemicals and Resources which are also the Company’s reportable segments.    
For additional information regarding our segments, including information about our financial results by segment and financial results by geography, see Note 17 - Segment Information of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Aerospace, Technology, Environmental and Nuclear (ATEN) 
We provide an in-depth range of scientific, engineering, construction, nuclear, environmental and technical support services to the aerospace, defense, technical and automotive industries in several countries. Long-term clients include the Ministry of Defence in the U.K., the U.K. Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, NASA, the U.S. Department of Energy ("DoE"), the U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”), the U.S. Special Operations Command ("USSOCOM"), the U.S. Intelligence community and the Australian Department of Defence. Specific to NASA, one of our major government customers in the U.S., is our ability to design, build, operate and maintain highly complex facilities relating to space systems, including test and evaluation facilities, launch facilities and support infrastructure. We provide support to all phases of the nuclear life-cycle from initial planning through design, construction, commissioning, operations and decommissioning/decontamination on government sites within the U.S. and Canada

We provide services to broad sectors including buildings, water, transportation (roads, rail, aviation and ports) and advanced facilities for life sciences, semiconductors, data centers, consumer products and other advanced manufacturing operations throughout North America, Europe, India, the Middle East, Australia and Asia. Our representative clients include national government departments/agencies in the U.S., Europe, U.K., Australia and Asia, state and local departments of transportation within the U.S. and private industry firms.
Typical projects include providing development/rehabilitation plans for highways, bridges, transit, tunnels, airports, railroads, intermodal facilities and maritime or port projects. Our interdisciplinary teams can work independently or as an extension of the client’s staff. We have experience with alternative financing methods, which have been used in Europe through the privatization of public infrastructure systems.
Our water infrastructure group aids emerging economies, which are investing heavily in water and wastewater systems and governments in North America and Europe, which are addressing the challenges of drought and an aging infrastructure system. We develop or rehabilitate critical water resource systems, water/wastewater conveyance systems and flood defense projects. We provide full life cycle services including engineering design, construction management, design build and operations and maintenance.
We also plan, design and construct buildings for a variety of clients and markets. We believe our global presence and understanding of contracting and delivery demands keep us well positioned to provide professional services worldwide. Our diversified client base encompasses both public and private sectors and relates primarily to institutional, commercial, government and corporate buildings, including projects at many of the world's leading medical and research centers, and universities. We focus our efforts and resources in two areas: where capital-spending initiatives drive demand, and where changes and advances in
technology require innovative, value-adding solutions. We also provide integrated facility management services (sometimes through joint ventures with third parties) for which we assume responsibility for the ongoing operation and maintenance of entire commercial or industrial complexes on behalf of clients.
We have specific capabilities in energy and power, master planning, and commissioning of office headquarters, aviation facilities, mission-critical facilities, municipal and civic buildings, courts and correctional facilities, mixed-use and commercial centers, healthcare and education campuses and recreational complexes. For advanced technology clients, who require highly specialized buildings in the fields of medical research, nano science, biotechnology and laser sciences, we offer total integrated design and construction management solutions. We also have global capabilities in the pharma-bio, data center, government
intelligence, corporate headquarters/interiors and science and technology-based education markets. Our government building projects include large, multi-year programs in the U.S. and Europe supporting various U.S. and U.K. government agencies.

We provide our Life Sciences clients single-point consulting, engineering, procurement, construction management and validation project delivery, enabling us to execute capital programs on a single-responsibility basis. Typical projects in the life sciences sector include laboratories, research and development facilities, pilot plants, bulk active pharmaceutical ingredient production facilities, full-scale biotechnology production facilities and tertiary manufacturing facilities. Our manufacturing business areas include the Food & Beverage, Consumer Products and Pulp & Paper markets.
We provide services relating to modular construction, as well as other consulting and strategic planning to help our clients complete capital projects faster and more efficiently. 
In addition, we offer services in containment, barrier technology, locally controlled environments, building systems automation and off-the-site design and fabrication of facility modules, as well as vaccine production and purification and aseptic processing. 
Energy, Chemicals and Resources (ECR)
We serve the energy, chemicals and resources sectors, including upstream, midstream and downstream oil, gas, refining, chemicals and mining and minerals industries. We provide integrated delivery of complex projects for our Oil and Gas, Refining and Petrochemicals clients. Bridging the upstream, midstream and downstream industries, our services encompass consulting, engineering, procurement, construction, maintenance and project management.
We provide services relating to onshore and offshore oil and gas production facilities, including fixed and floating platforms and subsea tie-backs, as well as full field development solutions, including processing facilities, gathering systems, transmission pipelines and terminals. Our heavy oil experience makes us a leader in upgrading, steam-assisted gravity drainage and in-situ oil sands projects. We have developed modular well pad and central processing facility designs. We also provide fit-for-purpose and standardized designs in the onshore conventional and unconventional space, paying particular attention to water and environmental issues. 
In addition, we provide our refining customers with feasibility/economic studies, technology evaluation and conceptual engineering, front end loading (FEED), detailed engineering, procurement, construction, maintenance and commissioning services. We deliver installed engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) solutions as to grass root plants, expansions and revamps of existing units. We have engineering alliances and maintenance programs that span decades with core clients. With the objective of driving our clients’ total installed costs down, we endeavor to leverage emerging market sourcing and high value engineering. Our Comprimo Sulfur Solutions® is a significant technology for gas treatment and sulfur recovery plants around the world.
We provide services to technically complex petrochemical facilities, from new manufacturing complexes to expansions and modifications and management of plant relocations. We have experience with many licensed technologies, integrated basic petrochemicals, commodity and specialty chemicals projects and olefins, aromatics, synthesis gas and their respective derivatives. 
Our mining and minerals business targets the non-ferrous and ferrous metal markets, precious metals, energy minerals (uranium, coal, oil sands), and industrial and fertilizer minerals (borates, trona, phosphates and potash). We work with many resource companies undertaking new and existing facility upgrades, process plant and underground and surface material handling and infrastructure developments.
We offer project management, front-end studies, full engineering, procurement and construction management (“EPCM”), and engineering, procurement and construction (“EPC”) capabilities and completions, commissioning and start-up services specializing in new plant construction, brownfield expansions and sustaining capital and maintenance projects. We are also able to deliver value to our mining clients by providing distinctive adjacent large infrastructure capabilities to support their mining operations.
We provide a wide range of services, technology and manufactured equipment through our specialty chemicals group, where we own and license our proprietary technology. Our specialty chemicals areas are focused on sulfuric acid, sulphur, bleaching chemicals for pulp & paper and synthetic chemicals and manufactured equipment. 
Our global Field Services unit supports construction and operations and maintenance (“O&M”) across the company and performs our direct hire services.
Our construction activities include providing both construction management services and traditional field construction services to our clients. Historically, our field construction activities focused primarily on those construction projects where we perform much of the related engineering and design work (EPC/EPCM). However, we deliver construction-only projects when we 
Page 9

have negotiated pricing and other contract terms we deem acceptable and which result in a fair return for the degree of risk we assume.
In our O&M business, we provide all services required to operate and maintain large, complex facilities on behalf of clients including asset management, direct hire maintenance and operations, complex turn-around planning and execution and small capital programs. We provide key management and support services over all aspects of the operations of a facility, including managing subcontractors and other on-site personnel.
Backlog
Backlog is not a defined measure and our methodology for determining backlog may vary from the methodology used by other companies. Currently, we report a combined backlog number based upon the legacy reporting methodologies used by Jacobs and the acquired business of CH2M prior to the acquisition while we work to harmonize these reporting methodologies as part of the Company's integration activities underway.
We include in backlog the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us. Our policy with respect to O&M contracts, however, is to include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for one succeeding year, regardless of the remaining life of the contract. For national government programs (other than national government O&M contracts, which are subject to the same policy applicable to all other O&M contracts), our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award, whether funded or unfunded, excluding option periods. Because of variations in the nature, size, expected duration, funding commitments and the scope of services required by our contracts, the timing of when backlog will be recognized as revenues can vary greatly between individual contracts. 
Consistent with industry practice, substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the option of the client, including our U.S government work. While management uses all information available to it to determine backlog, at any given time our backlog is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein. Backlog is not necessarily an indicator of future revenues.
Because certain contracts (e.g., contracts relating to large EPC projects as well as national government programs) can cause large increases to backlog in the fiscal period in which we recognize the award, and because many of our contracts require us to provide services that span over a number of fiscal quarters (and sometimes over fiscal years), we evaluate our backlog on a year-over-year basis, rather than on a sequential, quarter-over-quarter basis.
The following table summarizes our backlog for the years ended September 28, 2018, September 29, 2017 and September 30, 2016 (in millions):

 | September 28, 2018 | | September 29, 2017 | | September 30, 2016
Aerospace, Technology, Environmental and Nuclear | $ | 8,857 | | | $ | 6,358 | | $ | 4,472 
Buildings, Infrastructure and Advanced Facilities | 11,376 | | | 6,789 | | | 7,063
Energy, Chemicals and Resources | 7,066 | | | 6,642 | | | 7,226
Total | $ | 27,299 | | | $ | 19,789 | | $ | 18,761

For additional information regarding our backlog including those risk factors specific to backlog, please refer to Item 1A - Risk Factors, and Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations below. Subject to the factors discussed in Item 1A - Risk Factors, we estimate that approximately $10 billion, or 36%, of total backlog at September 28, 2018 will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year.
Significant Customers
The following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the U.S. federal government for each of the last five fiscal years: 

2018 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 | 2014
23% | 19% | 21% | 22% | 18% 

Page 10

Given the percentage of total revenue derived directly from the U.S. federal government, the loss of U.S. federal government agencies as customers would have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, any or all of our government contracts could be terminated, we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work, or payment of our costs could be disallowed. Approximately 94% of revenue derived directly from the U.S. federal government is in the ATEN segment.  For more information on risks relating to our government contracts, see Item 1A - Risk Factors.
Financial Information About Geographic Areas
Selected financial information regarding the geographic areas in which we operate is included in Note 17 - Segment Information of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference. For fiscal 2018, approximately 36% of our revenues were earned from clients outside the United States. Our international operations are subject to a variety of risks, which are described under Item 1A - Risk Factors below.
Contracts
While there is considerable variation in the pricing provisions of the contracts we undertake, our contracts generally fall into two broad categories: cost-reimbursable and fixed-price. The following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by these types of contracts for each of the last five fiscal years:

 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 | 2014
Cost-reimbursable | 76% | 81% | 82% | 83% | 83% 
Fixed-price | 24% | 19% | 18% | 17% | 17% 

In accordance with industry practice, most of our contracts (including those with the U.S. federal government) are subject to termination at the discretion of the client, which is discussed in greater detail in Item 1A - Risk Factors. In such situations, our contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of termination.
When we are directly responsible for engineering, design, procurement and construction of a project or the maintenance of a client’s plant or facility, we reflect the costs of materials, equipment and subcontracts in both revenues and costs. The following table sets forth the approximate amount of such pass-through costs included in revenues for each of the last five fiscal years (in millions of dollars):

2018 | | 2017 | 2016 | | 2015 | 2014
$ | 3,058.6 | | $ | 2,539.3 | | $ | 2,489.9 | $ | 2,602.6 | $ | 2,954.9

On other projects, where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items, these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs. 
Cost-Reimbursable Contracts
Cost-reimbursable contracts generally provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit. The profit element may be in the form of a simple mark-up applied to the labor costs incurred or it may be in the form of a fee, or a combination of a mark-up and a fee. The fee element can also take several forms. The fee may be a fixed amount; it may be an amount based on a percentage of the costs incurred; or it may be an incentive fee based on targets, milestones, or performance factors defined in the contract. In general, we prefer cost-reimbursable contracts because we believe the primary reason for awarding a contract to us should be our technical expertise and professional qualifications rather than price.
Fixed-Price Contracts
Fixed-price contracts include both “lump sum bid” contracts and “negotiated fixed-price” contracts. Under lump sum bid contracts, we typically bid against other contractors based on client-furnished specifications. This type of pricing presents certain inherent risks, including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received, problems with new technologies, and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period. Additionally, it is not unusual for lump sum bid contracts to lead to an adversarial relationship with clients, which is contrary to our relationship-based business model. Accordingly, lump sum bid contracts are not our preferred form of contract, and, as such, the Company has rarely entered into individual lump sum bid contracts that are material to its financial results. In contrast, under a negotiated fixed-price contract, we are selected as the contractor first and then we negotiate a price with our client. Negotiated fixed-price contracts frequently exist in single-responsibility arrangements where we perform some portion of the work before negotiating the total price of the project. Thus, 
Page 11

although both types of contracts involve a firm price for the client, the lump sum bid contract provides the greater degree of risk to us. However, because of economies that may be realized during the contract term, both negotiated fixed-price and lump sum bid contracts may offer greater profit potential than other types of contracts. The Company carefully manages the risk inherent in these types of contracts.  In recent years, most of our fixed-price work has been either negotiated fixed-price contracts or lump sum bid contracts for project services, rather than turnkey construction.
Competition
We compete with a large number of companies across the world. Typically, no single company or companies dominate the market in which we provide services. We compete based on the following factors, among others: price of services, technical capabilities, reputation for quality, safety record, availability of qualified personnel, ability to timely perform work and willingness to accept project-related risk. For more information regarding the competitive conditions in our business, please refer to Item 1A - Risk Factors below.
Employees
At September 28, 2018, we had approximately 74,400 full-time, staff employees (including contract staff). Additionally, as of September 28, 2018, there were approximately 6,400 persons employed in the field on a project basis. The number of field employees varies in relation to the number and size of the maintenance and construction projects in progress at any particular time.
