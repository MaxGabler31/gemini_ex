Our Mission
At Accolade, we envision a world where every person can live their “healthiest life” — a concept that encompasses physical, emotional, financial, and professional wellness. Our mission is to empower people through expertise, empathy, and technology to make the best decisions for their health and well-being.
Business Overview
Accolade enables our members to receive the right healthcare for their individual needs. We call it Personalized Healthcare. Accolade solutions are personal, data driven, and value based to provide a healthcare experience that helps people better understand, navigate, and utilize the healthcare system and workplace benefits. We provide personalized, technology-enabled solutions that help people better understand, navigate, and utilize the healthcare system and their workplace benefits. Our customers are primarily employers that deploy Accolade solutions in order to provide employees and their families (our “members”) a single place to turn for their health, healthcare, and benefits needs. We also offer expert medical opinion services to employer customers and virtual primary care and mental health support, both directly to consumers and to employer customers. Our innovative platform, which we call our True Health Engine, combines open, cloud-based intelligent technology with multimodal support from a team of empathetic and knowledgeable Accolade Health Assistants and clinicians, including registered nurses, physician medical directors, pharmacists, behavioral health specialists, women’s health specialists, case management specialists, expert medical opinion providers, and virtual primary care physicians. We leverage our integrated capabilities, connectivity with providers and the broader healthcare ecosystem, and longitudinal data to engage across the entire member population, rather than focusing solely on high-cost claimants or those with chronic conditions. Our goal is to build trusted relationships with our members that ultimately position us to deliver personalized recommendations and interventions. We believe that our True Health Engine dramatically improves the member experience, encourages better health outcomes, and lowers costs for both our members and our customers.
The U.S. healthcare system is complex and places significant strain on consumers, who struggle to effectively use their healthcare and benefits, make informed decisions about their health, and navigate the fragmented network of providers and third-party benefit programs. Additionally, access to appropriate care and the quality of available care varies widely based on a number of reasons, including economic, social, and geographic. This is commonly referred to as Health Equity. We designed our solutions to follow a clinical model that emphasizes both contextual and concordant care – healthcare that takes into account a person’s lifelong healthcare experience delivered by a team of people who understand their individual need. This approach also takes into account the numerous social determinants of health, such as social, economic, race, and geographic barriers that impact the quality and accessibility of healthcare. The ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic has only served to further exacerbate the complexity and frustration faced by consumers, as they seek information about the availability and accuracy of virus and antibody testing, seek information about vaccinations, or face limits on their ability to access traditional care safely. Partly as a result of these challenges, the payors of healthcare, including managed care companies, the government, employers, and consumers, face significant and rising costs. For large employers in particular, the direct costs are substantial: the total annual employer cost for healthcare is estimated at more than $10,000 per employee. Employers also bear indirect costs in the form of absenteeism, decreased productivity, and diminished morale, all potentially intensified during times when their employees are forced to work remotely due to threats to public health. Despite the significant and growing spend on care, health outcomes are not improving, and misaligned incentives among key constituents thwart meaningful change. A suboptimal consumer experience persists.
We believe the most effective way to improve health outcomes and control cost is to help consumers make better, data-driven healthcare and benefits-related decisions. Based on this belief, we have developed a differentiated

​

platform to support and influence consumer decision-making that is built on a foundation of mission-driven people and purpose-built technology:

● | Accolade Health Assistants. Our Accolade Health Assistants are highly trained professionals who develop trusted relationships with our members and serve as their primary and ongoing point of contact for all issues related to healthcare and benefits.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Clinicians. Our clinicians include registered nurses, physician medical directors, pharmacists, behavioral health specialists, women’s health specialists, case management specialists, expert medical opinion providers, and virtual primary care physicians.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Technology. Our technology platform was designed to deliver highly personalized member experiences at scale, leveraging data and machine learning to derive actionable insights, optimize our care teams’ workflows, and accelerate the pace of our innovation. We ingest and link disparate data points to Accolade-generated data to create a 360-degree member view which our Accolade Health Assistants and clinicians access in our purpose-built member CRM tool, InView. Our secure, open technology platform supports our continuous innovation and the development of additional capabilities to benefit our members.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Developing trusted relationships positions us to positively influence members’ healthcare and benefits-related decision-making and ultimately deliver on our value proposition. 
Through trusted, ongoing engagement, we can meaningfully influence member decisions and help increase valuable healthcare utilization (e.g., primary care visits, prescription refills) and reduce wasteful healthcare utilization (e.g., unnecessary emergency room visits, hospital readmissions, excessive inpatient stays). We further enhance the member experience by educating members on relevant, available benefits, such as wellness programs and telemedicine. In raising awareness of these benefits and seamlessly integrating them into our platform, we can significantly increase their utilization rates.
Our investments in a scalable technology platform have enabled us to acquire complementary services and implement a multi-offering strategy that meets the diverse needs of our existing and prospective customers. Buyers of our offerings have varying priorities and appetites for change to their existing health and benefits packages, and we have therefore developed a solutions portfolio that is designed to support a range of capabilities and services for employers of all sizes. We sell our solutions in four primary offerings that incorporate different aspects of our services:

● | Accolade Expert MD – Expert medical consultations that connect patients to highly qualified condition-specific specialists for both adult and pediatric care
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Accolade Care – Integrated primary care and mental health support
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Core and Plus – A benefits navigation and care solution designed to work with our customers’ existing benefits ecosystem, incorporating elements of all Accolade solutions including Advocacy, Accolade Expert MD, Accolade Care, and the Accolade partner ecosystem. Different offering configurations may also include member services, provider services, and an expanded set of clinical programs that address case and disease management to maximize member engagement and return on investment.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Accolade One – A value-based option that includes all of the Accolade solutions and the Accolade partner ecosystem with a pricing structure that includes a higher portion of revenues associated with outcomes-based measures
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additionally, our modular technology platform has enabled us to quickly offer solutions that meet specific healthcare needs of our population, including solutions such as Accolade Covid Response Care and Mental Health Integrated Care.

Recent Acquisitions
In March 2021, we acquired 2nd.MD, a leading expert second opinion consultation and health care decision support company based in Houston, Texas. 2nd.MD provides a service that allows members to access board-certified national experts across the country for high-value consultations in a real-time video call or by phone in order to provide the member with a rapid second opinion on their medical condition enabling the member to make more informed decisions regarding significant and high-cost care decisions, such as whether to have surgery or elect to have a specific treatment. 
In June 2021, we acquired PlushCare, a provider of virtual primary care and mental health support. The addition of a primary care team extends our ability to improve clinical health outcomes for members and deliver additional cost savings for employers.
In September 2021, we acquired substantially all the assets of HealthReveal, Inc. (HealthReveal). HealthReveal is a clinical artificial intelligence company focused on ensuring patients receive optimal, personalized chronic care to preempt adverse outcomes. 
Competitive Strengths
Our operational and financial success is based on the following key strengths:
Commitment to a differentiated member engagement model. We fundamentally believe in engaging the entire member population to have a sustainable impact on health outcomes and cost. This stands in contrast to the historic industry norm of engaging only the highest-cost, sickest patients with the most complex needs. To do this, we have built a platform to engage with each customer’s eligible member population, build trusted relationships with members, and leverage those relationships to deliver important healthcare interventions when they matter the most. 
Highly qualified and empathetic team with deep clinical experience. Our engagement model integrates “human touch” with a proprietary technology platform to encourage better outcomes for our members. While the right mix of experience and skills is critical, all care team members must demonstrate empathy to be hired, and maintain it to be retained. 
Long-term strategic partner to our customers. We are engaged by employers to solve real issues around the design, coordination, and utilization of their employee benefits programs. Because we help their employees live their healthiest lives, our customers view us as a strategic partner that can provide population health insights and help them manage healthcare benefit costs and complexity, including, crucially, how to ensure the safety of employees returning to the workplace during a pandemic. 
Significant investment in our purpose-built, scalable technology platform. Our offerings are built on an open, cloud-based intelligent platform designed to deliver a highly personalized member experience. Our platform is built for scale — architected to deliver repeatable results and high service levels at a sustainable cost to serve — and leverages extensive data ingestion capabilities and artificial intelligence to derive predictive analytics, deliver targeted population health insights, and recommend the right care intervention for our members at the right time. 
Attractive operating model supported by a PMPM recurring revenue model, providing a high degree of visibility. As of February 28, 2022, we had over 600 employer customers that collectively purchase access to our solutions for more than 10 million members. We principally generate revenue from our customers on a recurring PMPM fee basis, with contracts generally three years in length, which together provide us with significant revenue visibility. Our ability to deliver significant and measurable return on investment for our customers in the form of improved clinical and financial outcomes has led to a gross dollar retention of 98%, 99%, and 99% for the fiscal years ended February 28(29), 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. 
Deeply experienced management team dedicated to cultivating a mission-driven culture. Our senior leadership team has extensive healthcare, technology, and business-scaling expertise from decades of leadership 

6



​

experience at world-class organizations. Our senior management team has a long track record of working together, both at Accolade and at previous firms, with some members of our senior leadership team having worked together for over 20 years. We share our mission with the dedicated and passionate people that we employ, and our culture is a driving factor in our ability to attract and retain top talent. 
Our Growth Strategy
Key elements of our growth strategy include:
Grow our customer base. We believe there is a substantial opportunity to further grow our customer base in our large and under-penetrated market that includes thousands of self- and fully-insured employers in the United States. Our sales and marketing team draws on advanced demand-generation strategies to reach and educate the market about our offerings and increase the opportunities to grow our customer base. We maintain a cohort of highly referenceable customers in support of new customer acquisition. 
Retain and expand relationships with our customers. By delivering measurable outcomes to our customers, we can achieve strong customer retention, which enables us to expand and deepen these relationships. The addition of expert medical opinion through the acquisition of 2nd.MD and virtual primary care through the acquisition of PlushCare are examples of new offerings that complement our existing solutions and can be sold as standalone solutions or provide cross-sell opportunities to drive incremental revenue. As we build upon our trusted partner status with these customers, we have the opportunity to cross-sell our additional capabilities, as well as services offered by our ecosystem partners.
Invest in technology. We have made significant investments in our technology platform to expand our capabilities with respect to how we engage with our members and deliver our solutions and care interventions. By leveraging our technology in areas such as machine learning, predictive analytics, and multimodal communication, we believe we can generate more efficiencies in our operating model while simultaneously improving our ability to deliver better health outcomes and lower costs for both our members and our customers.
Continue to develop new offerings. We are constantly innovating to enhance our model and develop new offerings, including our recently introduced Accolade Care and Accolade One. Our ability to act as a trusted advisor to our members and customers positions us to identify new opportunities for additional offerings that can meet their existing and emerging needs. Our open technology platform also allows us to efficiently add new applications on top of our existing technology stack, such as Accolade COVID Response Care and Mental Health Integrated Care. 
Expand into adjacent markets. We see significant additional opportunity in adjacent markets, including expanding with the TRICARE population and working with other government-sponsored health plans, such as Medicare Advantage and Managed Medicaid (as well as traditional Medicare and Medicaid), along with those administered by Veterans Affairs. Our focus and experience in the navigation and coordination of benefits and healthcare, coupled with our technology investments, position us to take advantage of emerging healthcare trends surrounding care coordination and value-based care initiatives. We believe that we can leverage our existing platform and scalable solutions to successfully expand into these markets.
Opportunistically pursue partnerships. We have historically integrated new and complementary capabilities into our offerings by forming strategic partnerships and other relationships with third parties. We believe our partners choose us because of our entrepreneurial and collaborative culture and dedication to continuous innovation. We develop and maintain partnerships with a number of healthcare companies to offer our customers a broader range of services and a more seamless healthcare experience. Those partnerships include health plan partners such as Humana and Blue Cross of California, technology partners like Change Healthcare, and chronic and clinical solutions providers such as SWORD, Virta, RxSavings, and Headspace.
Our Clinical Philosophy
We believe health outcomes are improved and overall healthcare spend is lowered when personalized care guidance and coordination are effectively delivered. Our clinical philosophy governs the ways we help members as they 

7



​

contemplate and consume care. Increasing healthcare spend is a lagging indicator of the need for support — our engagement model seeks to engage all members, regardless of healthcare spend or the complexity of medical needs, and support them as early as possible in their care journeys.
Our Offerings
We have developed a continuum of offerings to address the market’s varied perspectives on how best to improve healthcare and benefits utilization, along with buyers’ varying appetites for change. All of our offerings have been built on the same technology stack, meaning each is capable of fully leveraging our integrated platform — combining people and technology to deliver value to our customers. We can unpack and combine our capabilities into differentiated bundles, while maintaining scale and efficiency by operating on a single platform.
Overview of Accolade’s Multi-offering Strategy
Accolade Total Health and Benefits has historically been our most comprehensive offering from which the majority of our revenues are derived today. Our technology platform enabled us to unbundle aspects of this comprehensive offering to create additional standalone offerings and integrate newly acquired solutions. Following our acquisition of 2nd.MD in March 2021, we began offering customers expert medical consultation (primarily for high-complexity, high-cost conditions) as a standalone service as well as a capability that can be incorporated into other core offerings. Following our acquisition of PlushCare in June 2021, we began offering virtual primary care and mental health services directly to consumers and commercial customers. We have further leveraged our technology platform to develop add-on offerings and to integrate acquired solutions that target specific challenges faced by our customers.
As of September 2021, we began offering our solutions as four primary offerings, including two new solutions and new naming for the solutions described above. The new solutions – Accolade One and Accolade Care – combine the capabilities of Accolade’s historical navigation and advocacy solutions with our acquired primary care, mental health, and expert medical opinion services, augmented by artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data-driven recommendations. The new solutions are in their early stages of implementation, with initial customer implementations started in January 2022. Additionally, we announced new solution bundles incorporating all of our existing solutions to reflect the evolution and maturation of our offering portfolio. With these changes, our current offerings include:

● | Accolade Expert MD – Expert medical consultations that connect patients to highly qualified condition-specific specialists for both adult and pediatric care
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Accolade Care – Integrated primary care and mental health support
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Core and Plus – A benefits navigation and care solution designed to work with our customers’ existing benefits ecosystem, incorporating elements of all Accolade solutions including Advocacy, Accolade Expert MD, Accolade Care, and the Accolade partner ecosystem. Different offering configurations may also include member services, provider services, and an expanded set of clinical programs that address case and disease management to maximize member engagement and return on investment.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Accolade One – A value-based option that includes all of the Accolade solutions and the Accolade partner ecosystem with a pricing structure that includes a higher portion of revenues associated with outcomes-based measures
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Accolade has developed additional add-on solutions, such as Mental Health Integrated Care that directly address the pronounced need among our employer customers for help with overall benefits management. 
Our Technology Platform
With great conviction that technology can help scale and optimize the Accolade engagement model, we began making substantial investments to create an industry-leading, open, cloud-based platform in 2016. This technology 

8



​

platform, built utilizing artificial intelligence, microservices, and data analytics, enables us to deliver personalized experiences to our full member population throughout their healthcare journeys. We have established a highly experienced Product & Technology organization that has extensive experience in machine learning, artificial intelligence, data science, engineering, and product management.
In order to fuel our machine learning processes, we have made a concerted effort to source what we view as a massive, powerful, and differentiated data set. We pair Accolade data (encounter and activation history, conditions/medications/procedures, barriers to care, assessment responses, care plans) with the data we ingest from:

● | our employer customers (eligibility and membership data);
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | carriers and pharmacy benefits managers (claims data, plus benefit plan and formulary details);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | providers (verification of benefits and eligibility checks, pre-authorizations, and utilization management discharge instructions);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and commercial insurers (billions of claims, comprehensive provider directories, and price data); and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ecosystem partners (registrations, interactions, assessments/care plans).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

With this combination of data, we are able to apply machine learning tactics to generate predictive insights about our members. For example, we calculate various scores for members that quantify their relationship with us, overall health status, and their propensity to take a desired action. These scoring techniques inform recommended actions for our Accolade Health Assistants and clinicians that are surfaced to InView, as well as recommendations delivered directly to our members as part of our activation capabilities and/or self-service.
Our Go-to-Market Strategy
We employ a multipronged go-to-market strategy to drive adoption of our solutions. We have strategically curated our offerings portfolio to ensure we have a compelling value proposition at an appropriate price point that resonates with each specific customer segment.
Sales Organization. We principally sell our solutions through our direct salesforce and have invested meaningfully in creating a scaled and focused team to capture the new customer growth opportunities. Our field sales professionals are organized by account size, region, and existing versus prospective customers. This organizational structure enables us to deliver context-specific, tailored messaging that resonates with each customer segment. Our sales team possesses deep domain expertise in health benefits management and boasts long-term relationships with key decision makers within our prospective customer organizations. We believe the effectiveness of our sales organization is evidenced by growing adoption of our platform by large strategic customers, as well as strong recent traction with enterprise and mid-market customers where we see meaningful additional revenue opportunity.
Customer Success Organization. Our customer success team (formerly known as customer partnerships) provides strategic insights, point solutions recommendations, and day-to-day account support to our customers. The team is focused on deepening existing customer relationships and cross-selling new offerings where appropriate. This organization is comprised of dedicated customer support teams to serve each customer’s specific needs and also focuses on deepening existing customer relationships through sales of our new offerings.
Strategic Partnerships. We selectively form partnerships to further drive customer acquisition and adoption of our personalized, technology-enabled solutions platform. For example, in March 2019, we partnered with Humana and formed a joint go-to-market strategy, which we launched in two initial geographic markets. In October 2019, concurrent with a $20 million preferred stock investment from Humana, we expanded our partnership to add a broader base of solutions targeting self- and fully insured customer prospects and significantly expand our target geographic markets.

​

In addition, in February 2020, we entered into a strategic relationship with Change Health to increase each party’s capabilities for serving its customers and members. The arrangement includes the joint development of new and improved capabilities and service agreements to expand datasets available to Accolade for various analytics to better support members. 
We believe the breadth of our go-to-market and distribution strategy enables us to reach customers of nearly every size across markets.
Marketing
We generate customer leads, accelerate sales opportunities, and drive brand awareness through our marketing programs. Our marketing programs target benefits and finance executives, senior business leaders, health professionals, brokers, consultants, third-party administrators, and suppliers.
In addition to our direct sales organization, we maintain relationships with a range of third parties including brokers, benefits consultants, third-party administrators, and trusted suppliers. These partners supplement our direct sales force and help sell our offerings into select end markets by way of warm introductions and advice as we field prospective customers’ requests for proposals. We have developed strong relationships with our partners and have a well-established reputation within our partner community. We proactively educate our partners on our solutions and value proposition to ensure we are appropriately represented to prospective customers.
Competition
We believe no single competitor offers a similarly comprehensive platform combining personalized, technology-enabled solutions with highly trained professionals. However, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience competition from a number of companies, including those who are well-established and may have greater resources, and those who may become meaningful competitors in the future. Our competitors generally fall into three categories: large health plans that provide member and provider services, such as the Blue Cross Blue Shield health plans (e.g., Anthem), Cigna, UnitedHealth Group, and Aetna; traditional advocacy and navigation companies, such as Quantum Health and Health Advocate; and an emerging cohort of companies that traditionally provided virtual primary and mental health care, telemedicine, and expert medical opinion services, and/or exclusively digital services and are increasingly adding some version of navigation support to their offering, most notably Included Health (Grand Rounds), Amino, Alight (Compass), Teladoc, and Vera Whole Health (Castlight). We believe the primary competitive factors for our industry include:

● | level of member engagement;
--+----------------------------


● | ability to influence members to improve health and financial outcomes;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | level of customer and member satisfaction;
--+-------------------------------------------


● | ease of integration with employer benefits programs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


● | price;
--+-------


● | breadth and depth of platform functionality;
--+---------------------------------------------


● | modern and open technology supporting integration with third-party applications;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ability to recruit and retain skilled employees and clinicians;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | access to and ability to derive insights from large, disparate data sets;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

10



​


● | advanced analytics capabilities to create personalized recommendations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | brand awareness and reputation;
--+--------------------------------


● | regulatory compliance; and
--+---------------------------


● | ability to rapidly innovate and respond to changing customer needs and legislative developments.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While certain of our competitors may have greater resources, recognition, larger customer bases, or longer-standing offerings, we believe that we compete favorably against our competitors based on these criteria. We believe that our platform dramatically improves member experience, encourages better health outcomes, and lower costs for both our members and our customers. As our market grows and continues to evolve through technology or regulatory-driven changes, we expect it will continue to attract interest from existing larger companies who may be able to invest more resources in solutions development and sales and marketing while leveraging their existing relationships, as well as interest from new entrants, who could introduce new solutions.
Intellectual Property
We believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, nondisclosure agreements, and employee nondisclosure and invention assignment agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights.
These intellectual property rights and procedures may not prevent others from creating a competitive technology platform or otherwise competing with us. We may be unable to obtain, maintain, and enforce the intellectual property rights on which our business depends, and assertions by third parties that we violate their intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
We continually review our product and technology efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property, and have been granted several patents in the United States and continue to prosecute several pending patent applications in the United States. We have several registered trademarks in the United States.
Government Regulation
HIPAA and Other Privacy and Security Requirements
Numerous state, federal, local, and foreign laws and regulations govern the collection, dissemination, use, privacy, confidentiality, security, availability, integrity, and other processing of personal or sensitive data (including PHI and PII). These laws and regulations include the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA). In addition, several states within the United States have enacted or proposed data privacy laws. For example, Virginia passed the Consumer Data Protection Act, Colorado passed the Colorado Privacy Act, and Utah passed the Consumer Privacy Act. Additionally, we are, or may become, subject to various U.S. federal and state consumer protection laws which require us to publish statements that accurately and fairly describe how we handle personal data and choices individuals may have about the way we handle their personal data.
For example, HIPAA establishes a set of national privacy and security standards for the protection of PHI by health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, referred to as covered entities, and individuals and entities that perform services for them which involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, known as business associates and their subcontractors. We are considered a business associate under HIPAA. As such, we could be subject to periodic audits for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Standards 

11



​

by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and our customers. HIPAA also implemented the use of standard transaction code sets and standard identifiers that covered entities must use when submitting or receiving certain electronic healthcare transactions, including activities associated with the billing and collection of healthcare claims. HIPAA imposes mandatory penalties for certain violations. However, a single breach incident can result in violations of multiple standards. HIPAA also authorizes state attorneys general to file suit on behalf of their residents. Courts may award damages, costs, and attorneys’ fees related to violations of HIPAA in such cases. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action allowing individuals to sue us in civil court for violations of HIPAA, its standards have been used as the basis for duty of care in state civil suits such as those for negligence or recklessness in the misuse or breach of PHI.
In addition, HHS is required under HIPAA to establish a methodology whereby harmed individuals who were the victims of breaches of unsecured PHI may receive a percentage of the Civil Monetary Penalty fine paid by the violator, which is yet to be publicly proposed or implemented. HIPAA further requires that patients be notified of any unauthorized acquisition, access, use or disclosure of their unsecured PHI that compromises the privacy or security of such information, with certain exceptions related to unintentional or inadvertent use or disclosure by employees or authorized individuals. HIPAA specifies that such notifications must be made without unreasonable delay and within a certain time period after discovery of the breach. Depending on the number of patients affected by a breach, it may be required to be reported to HHS without unreasonable delay, and HHS will post the name of the breaching entity on its public web site. Breaches affecting a certain number of patients in the same state or jurisdiction must also be reported to the local media. For breaches affecting smaller numbers of patients, the covered entity must record it in a log and notify HHS at least annually.
Likewise, the CCPA creates individual privacy rights for consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA imposes obligations on covered companies to provide specific disclosures related to a company’s collection, use, and disclosure of personal data and to respond to certain requests from California residents, related to their personal data (for example, requests to know of the business’s personal data processing activities, to delete the individual’s personal data, and to opt out of certain personal data disclosures). In addition, it is anticipated that the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (CPRA), effective January 1, 2023, will expand the CCPA. The CPRA will, among other things, give California residents the ability to limit use of certain sensitive personal data, establish restrictions on personal data retention, expand the types of data breaches that are subject to the CCPA’s private right of action, and establish a new California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the new law.
There are numerous other federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations that protect the confidentiality, privacy, availability, integrity, and security of PHI and other types of PII. These laws and regulations in many cases are more restrictive than, and may not be preempted by, HIPAA and its implementing rules. These laws and regulations are often uncertain, contradictory, and subject to changed or differing interpretations, and we expect new laws, rules, and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and information security to be proposed and enacted in the future. 
Foreign data privacy and security laws (including but not limited to the EU GDPR and UK GDPR) impose significant and complex compliance obligations on entities that are subject to those laws. As one example, the EU GDPR applies to any company established in the EEA and to companies established outside the EEA that process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EEA or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the EEA. These obligations may include limiting personal data processing to only what is necessary for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes; requiring a legal basis for personal data processing; requiring the appointment of a data protection officer in certain circumstances; increasing transparency obligations to data subjects; requiring data protection impact assessments in certain circumstances; limiting the collection and retention of personal data; increasing rights for data subjects; formalizing a heightened and codified standard of data subject consents; requiring the implementation and maintenance of technical and organizational safeguards for personal data; mandating notice of certain personal data breaches to the relevant supervisory authority(ies) and affected individuals; and mandating the appointment of representatives in the UK and/or the EU in certain circumstances.

Other Health Care Laws
Our business activities are subject to a complex set of regulations and rigorous enforcement, including by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), U.S. Department of Justice, HHS, Office of the Inspector General and Office of Civil Rights, and numerous other federal and state governmental authorities. In addition, our employees, consultants and commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements. Federal and state healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to conduct business include:

● | HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of protected health information on certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, their business associates as well as their covered subcontractors that access or otherwise process individually identifiable health information on their behalf; HIPAA also created criminal liability for knowingly and willfully falsifying or concealing a material fact or making a materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | state laws governing professional licensure, the corporate practice of medicine and other healthcare professions and related fee-splitting laws;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as the CMS programs, including Medicare and Medicaid;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal civil false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false claims, or knowingly using false statements, to obtain payment from the federal government;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;

The Affordable Care Act, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. Further, our operations may subject us to various laws relating to the licensure and corporate practice of a health care profession. These laws, in particular, vary greatly by state and are subject to broad interpretations by regulators.
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Any action brought against us for violations of these laws or regulations, even if successfully defended, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. We may be subject to private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers on behalf of the federal or state governments, with potential liability under the federal False Claims Act including mandatory treble damages and significant per-claim penalties.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal or state laws described above or any other current or future fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including significant criminal, civil, and administrative penalties, damages and fines, disgorgement, additional reporting requirements, and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of noncompliance with these laws, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as contractual damages, curtailment of our business activities, and reputational harm.
Additionally, in the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed reforms of the healthcare system in an effort to contain costs, improve quality, and expand access to care, including the proposed modification to some of the aforementioned laws. We expect there to continue to be a number of healthcare-related legislative initiatives that may significantly affect the healthcare industry, particularly in light of the new presidential administration. These reform initiatives may, among other things, result in modifications to the aforementioned laws and/or the implementation of new laws affecting the healthcare industry.
