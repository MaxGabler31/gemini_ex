ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
History and Overview
 
Velt International Group Inc. (formerly A & C United Agriculture Developing Inc., or “Velt” or the “Company”) is a Nevada corporation formed on February 7, 2011. Our current principal executive office is located at 1313 N. Grand Ave. #16, Walnut, CA 91789. Tel: 626-262-7379.
 
On March 13, 2017, Yidan (Andy) Liu and Jun (Charlie) Huang, the principal stockholders of the Company (“Sellers”), entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Chin Kha Foo, the assignee of Choa-Jung Lee, and his assigns (the “Buyers”), pursuant to which, among other things, Sellers agreed to sell to the Buyers, and the Buyers agreed to purchase from Sellers, a total of 24,000,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company of record and beneficially by Sellers (the “Purchased Shares”). The Purchased Shares represented approximately 64% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, resulting in a change of the control of the Company.
 
In addition to the U.S. operation, the Company established a subsidiary A & C Agriculture Developing (Europe) AB (“A&C Europe” or the “Subsidiary”) in Stockholm, Sweden on October 24, 2013, which is located at Gamla Sodertaljevagen 134A, 141 70 Segeltorp, Sweden. On August 5, 2017, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) to sell of its equity interest in A & C Europe.
 
Prior to the change of control, the Company’s long-term goal was focus on solving some of the major challenges in China, such as pollution and food safety issues for the general public, as well as raising funds to grow the business. The Company has changed its focus to develop mobile application system (the “mobile app”) which supports third party payment, online booking and other management functions. This mobile app allows users to get special discounts when the users purchase from merchants listed in the mobile app through its online payment system.
 
The mobile app relies on big data management to create a large consumer base that mostly connects with traditional retailers and some of the online stores. Although internet consumption is very popular at present, the management believes that traditional offline businesses continue to have a very large market demand. This is because the traditional offline stores can directly bring visual senses to the customers and stimulate customer desires as well as consumer confidences.
 
The Board of the Directors approved the reverse split of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock whereby each twenty shares of common stock will be converted into one share of common stock. The stock split became effective with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) on May 21, 2018.
 
The Company will be also focus on other revenue generated businesses in the year of 2019 which could potentially increase the profits of the Company.
 
During the next 12 months, we anticipate continuing our efforts to raise capital through follow up meetings with potential investors, although there is no assurance we will raise capital from any of them as we have no contracts, agreements or commitments from this or other funding sources. 
 
Recent Developments
 
On December 6, 2017, the Company entered into a Mobile Application Development and Maintenance Agreement (the “Mobile Agreement”), pursuant to which, the Company will develop and design a mobile application (the “App”) for a third-party Hong Kong company. Velt will develop the App’s interface and functions, including the App’s ability to book airline ticket, train ticket and taxi cabs, and to play online games, to facilitate payments for utilities and other services, and to facilitate shipping services and so forth.
Products and Services
 
Our current product and service will be focus on the app system development and application. Meanwhile, we will also search for different business opportunities to be acquired by the Company.
 
We will continue to improve our app system in order to expand our customer base. The potential customer resource of our app system will be mainly from enterprise customers that will use our app system to serve their end-users.
 
Strategy
 
Our strategy is to target the small to medium-sized business market that will utilize our app system to serve their customer database. Except to build up a customized app system for our enterprise customers, we will also help our customers to improve and maintain the customized app system. We hope this one-stop service to will better serve our potential enterprise customers.

Competitive Conditions
 
The app services industry is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to constant technological change and intense marketing by providers with similar products and services. 
 
Most of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources, larger customer bases, longer operating histories, greater name recognition and more established relationships in the industry than we have. As a result, certain of these competitors may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies that could hinder our ability to market our services. We believe that our key competitive advantages are our ability to deliver reliable, high quality service in a cost-effective manner. We cannot provide assurances, however, that these advantages will enable us to succeed against comparable service offerings from our competitors. 
Employees
 
As of September 30, 2018, we had 2 employees, all of whom performed operational, technical and administrative functions. No payroll will be paid to the employees before the Company generates net profits. We believe our future success will depend to a large extent on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified employees. We consider our employee relations to be good. None of these employees belong to labor unions.
