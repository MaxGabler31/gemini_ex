Item 1. Business.
Overview
We are a San Diego-based commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to developing and commercializing innovative products to address unmet needs in women’s sexual and reproductive health, including hormone-free, woman-controlled contraception and protection from certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
Our first commercial product, Phexxi, was approved by the FDA on May 22, 2020 and is the first and only FDA-approved, hormone-free, woman-controlled, on-demand prescription contraceptive gel for women. We commercially launched Phexxi in September 2020 in the United States. We intend to commercialize Phexxi in all other global markets through partnerships or licensing agreements. 
We are evaluating Phexxi for two potential new indications: the prevention of chlamydia and the prevention of gonorrhea in women. These are two of the most pervasive STIs in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that four million new chlamydia infections and 1.6 million new cases of gonorrhea occurred in 2018 alone. The number of reported cases is lower than the estimated total number because almost 60% of women infected with chlamydia have no symptoms. This is a concern because chlamydia and gonorrhea have been reported to be responsible for one-third to half of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) cases. PID can cause serious, long-term problems including infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain.
Currently, there are no FDA-approved prescription products for the prevention of either of these dangerous infections. In October 2020, we initiated our confirmatory Phase 3 clinical trial of Phexxi for these potential indications (EVOGUARD). We expect top-line results from EVOGUARD in the second half of 2022. 
The FDA has designated Phexxi, using the investigational name EVO100, (EVO100) as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) for the prevention of urogenital chlamydia infection and the prevention of urogenital gonorrhea infection in women. QIDP designation provides several important potential advantages to a future drug product, including possible priority review of its marketing application, and a longer period of marketing exclusivity under the FDA statutes. The FDA has also granted Fast Track designations to EVO100 for both potential new indications. 
EVO200 vaginal gel (EVO200), our investigational candidate for the reduction of recurrent bacterial vaginosis (BV), uses the same proprietary vaginal pH modulator platform as Phexxi. EVO200 has been designated a QIDP by the FDA for this indication. In a Phase 1 dose-finding trial for this indication, the highest dose formulation of the study drug demonstrated reduced vaginal pH for up to seven days following a single administration. We may decide to pursue further development of EVO200 in the future.
Phexxi, EVO200, and other product candidates in development share similar non-hormonal, acid-buffering, bioadhesive properties. However, they are designed differently to target viral and bacterial pathogens while playing an integral role to the survival of healthy bacteria in the vagina, enabling women to achieve better sexual and reproductive health. 
Our Leadership Team
We have assembled a world-class team with industry-recognized expertise in the development and commercialization of products in women’s sexual and reproductive health. 
Our Strategy 
Key elements of our strategy include:
•Successfully commercialize Phexxi. Our primary focus is the successful commercialization of Phexxi in the United States. Outside the United States, we intend to commercialize Phexxi through strategic partnerships or license agreements in several key target regions, including the Greater European Union plus the United Kingdom (EU), Asia Pacific (APAC), and Latin America (LATAM). We believe this approach will allow us to effectively deploy our capital to maximize the inherent value of Phexxi for the benefit of all stakeholders.
•Leverage our vaginal pH modulator platform to develop and commercialize novel, first-in-class products for women. Following the successful development and FDA approval of Phexxi for the prevention of pregnancy, we are continuing the clinical development of our vaginal pH modulator platform, including our Phase 3 program 
evaluating the potential of Phexxi to prevent chlamydia and gonorrhea in women and the development of additional product candidates. 
•Expand our intellectual property position by pursuing opportunities to extend the exclusivity of our highly differentiated and proprietary product candidates. We intend to aggressively pursue additional and new patent applications to broaden our intellectual property portfolio. We continue to seek domestic and international patent protection and endeavor to proactively file patent applications for new commercially valuable inventions.
•Build our product portfolio and leverage our U.S. sales force through business development. We intend to opportunistically acquire or in-license additional products and/or product candidates to enhance our offerings and complement our core competencies in women’s health. 
Contraceptive Market Overview 
United States Contraceptive Market
The total U.S. contraceptive market was valued at $7.35 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach approximately $9.6 billion by 2027 with a compound annual growth rate of 4.2% year-over-year between 2020 and 2027. 
Current contraceptive options include: 
•devices designed to prevent pregnancy through physical means, such as condoms and diaphragms;
•hormone-based pharmaceutical products, including oral contraceptives (OCs), vaginal rings, transdermal patches, intramuscular injections, subcutaneous implants and intrauterine devices (IUDs), which can be associated with undesirable side effects such as weight gain, loss of libido and mood changes that may lead women to discontinue their use and seek alternative contraceptive methods;
•a hormone-free copper IUD; and
•Phexxi, a prescription vaginal pH modulator that was introduced to the market in September 2020.
The only non-hormonal option within the top five sales-generating segments in 2019 was the male condom, which is an over-the-counter (OTC) product. Besides condoms, the only currently available OTC products in the United States are nonoxynol-9 containing (N-9) spermicides. These surfactant-based products can potentially cause genital irritation and inflammation that may increase the risk of contracting human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or other STIs from an infected partner. The FDA requires specific warnings to appear on all N-9 products that state: “this product does not protect against HIV/AIDS or other STDs and may increase the risk of getting HIV from an infected partner” as well as: “Do not use if you or your sex partner has HIV/AIDS. If you do not know if you or your sex partner is infected, choose another form of birth control method.” 
As shown in the chart below, in the United States, 13.1 million women use no method of birth control, putting them at risk of unintended pregnancy. An additional 10.3 million women in the United States rely on condoms or some other form of non-hormonal OTC birth control (e.g. rhythm, withdrawal). Another 18.8 million women in the United States use prescription birth control methods, which are predominantly hormone-based with the sole exception of the copper IUD.

Market Opportunity: Contraception 
Hundreds of millions of women worldwide seek sexual and reproductive health products that provide them with their self-defined control of their individual needs during their (on average) 30+ years of fertility. As such, women using contraception consider the most appropriate methods for their purposes and intended use. According to the United Nations, in 2017, model-based estimates indicated that approximately 75% of women of reproductive age (18 to 49) worldwide required some form of family planning. 
Innovation and new product introductions in the women’s reproductive and sexual health care arena have been limited when compared to other therapeutic categories. While several new contraceptive category entrants have been introduced over the last couple of years, we believe Phexxi is the first innovative contraceptive method introduced in the United States since NuvaRing was approved by the FDA in 2001. 
According to the CDC, reducing the percentage of all unintended pregnancies has been one of the National Health Promotion Objectives since its establishment in 1980. Despite efforts to reduce their incidence, over two million unintended pregnancies occur in the United States annually. Following decades of minimal change or increase, the percentage of unintended pregnancies in the United States decreased slightly from 2008 to 2011. Despite this decrease, 45%, or 2.8 million of the 6.1 million total pregnancies in the United States, were unintended in 2011 (Finer et al., NEJM, 2016). 
Our Commercial Product 
Phexxi as a Contraceptive
Phexxi vaginal gel is the only FDA-approved, hormone-free, on-demand, woman-controlled prescription contraceptive drug product available in the United States. We believe Phexxi’s attributes address significant gaps and underserved and unmet needs in the contraceptive market and make it an attractive contraceptive choice for women.
Phexxi key benefits:
•Hormone-free: Phexxi is an innovative gel that works to prevent pregnancy without the use of hormones. Because Phexxi is completely hormone-free, women do not have to worry about the hormone related side effects like weight gain, mood swings, or blood clots which are associated with hormonal birth control methods. 
•Only when you need it: With Phexxi, women no longer need to have birth control in their bodies 24/7. Phexxi is used in the moment, right before each and every act of sex, so no daily commitment is required. This also makes Phexxi easily reversible, providing women with a flexible option for family planning. 
•First in class: Phexxi is the first and only hormone-free prescription birth control gel that women control. Phexxi works to prevent pregnancy by maintaining the vaginal pH, which reduces sperm motility, and lowers the chance of sperm reaching the egg. This revolutionary mechanism of action is unique to Phexxi, meaning there are no other products like it in the market. 
•Woman-controlled: Phexxi puts women in control of their bodies and their pregnancy prevention. With Phexxi, there is no need to rely on a partner to bring a condom and no need to head into the doctor’s office for an injection or procedure to prevent pregnancy. The quick and easy pre-sex application is designed with spontaneity and convenience in mind.
We believe Phexxi is a disruptive entry to the U.S. contraceptive landscape. Phexxi is designed to address underserved and unmet needs in the birth control market, as seen in the table below. Women are becoming highly aware of the hormones that they put in their bodies, with ~75% of women having some concerns or completely opposing hormonal birth control. These women are a part of the approximately 23 million women who are currently not using hormonal birth control methods, and who we are seeing as a large subset of early adopters of Phexxi. 
Our sales data further support the uptick of early adopters with almost half of prescriptions coming from women who were not using a method of contraception in the previous year. This data indicates that the Phexxi reach goes beyond those women who have fallen out of the birth control funnel, and extends to a robust amount of women who are switching from other prescription birth control methods to Phexxi, further highlighting that the key attributes of Phexxi are appealing to a wide range of women. Additionally, we are seeing that the majority of women (~80%) starting Phexxi are under the age of 40, which is promising for long term adoption of the brand.

Vaginal pH Modulator Mechanism of Action
A normal vaginal pH of 3.5 to 4.5 is important for maintaining good vaginal health. At this optimal pH level, the vagina contains a balance of necessary healthy bacteria. Additionally, a vaginal pH in this range is inhospitable to sperm as well as certain viral and bacterial pathogens. 
Phexxi was developed to have acid-buffering (pH 3.5), bioadhesive and viscosity-retaining properties to provide effective acidification of the male ejaculate in the vagina and to form a long-lasting layer of gel over the vaginal and cervical surfaces. Typically, the introduction of semen (pH = 7.2-8.0) into the vagina causes a rise in pH above 6.0 due to the alkalinity of the ejaculate, which neutralizes the normally acidic vaginal environment and allows for the survival of sperm. The active ingredients in Phexxi produce a normal vaginal pH (3.5-4.5) even in the presence of semen, creating an inhospitable environment for sperm. The maintenance of the acidic vaginal pH reduces the availability of calcium ions which are needed to drive sperm tail movement. In vitro studies show immediate sperm motility reduction. Phexxi prevents pregnancy by reducing sperm motility, inhibiting sperm from reaching the ovum to form a zygote. Other properties contributing to Phexxi’s mechanism of action are its capacity to maintain sufficient viscosity even upon dilution with the introduction of semen into the vagina, impede cervical mucus penetration, and form a protective layer over the vaginal and cervical epithelium.
The diagram below shows the respective pH levels of the vagina and semen.
Commercialization Strategy
Our strategy is to commercialize Phexxi and to leverage our vaginal pH modulator platform to develop and commercialize novel, first-in-class products for women. We have deployed a dedicated sales team and developed a telehealth platform and media strategy focused on maximizing the commercial return from Phexxi in the United States.
Outside of the United States, we plan to focus on three key regions – the EU, APAC, and LATAM. Our intent is to establish regional and/or global partnerships in these regions by either sublicensing the commercialization rights or entering into distribution agreements with one or more third parties for the commercialization of Phexxi and our product candidate. We expect these third parties to be involved in the regulatory process in their respective markets as well as any clinical trials to support regulatory submissions, if required.
Commercialization of Phexxi in the United States
We believe the United States market is the largest commercial opportunity for Phexxi and our product candidates. In September 2020, we commercially launched Phexxi, with a sales force promoting Phexxi directly to obstetricians/gynecologists and their affiliated health professionals, who collectively write the majority of prescriptions for contraceptive products. Our sales force currently comprises approximately 57 regional sales representatives and eight business managers, supported by a self-guided virtual HCP learning platform. Additionally, we offer women direct access to Phexxi via our telehealth platform where women can directly meet with an HCP to determine their eligibility for a Phexxi prescription and potentially have it written by the HCP, filled and mailed directly to them by a third-party pharmacy. 
Our comprehensive commercial strategy for Phexxi includes marketing and product awareness campaigns targeting women of reproductive potential in the United States, including the approximately 23 million women who are not using hormonal contraception and the approximately 18.8 million women who are using a prescription contraceptive, some of whom, particularly pill users, may be ready to move to an FDA-approved, non-invasive, hormone-free contraceptive, as well as certain identified target HCP segments. In addition to marketing and product awareness campaigns, our commercial strategy includes payer outreach and execution of our consumer digital and media strategy. 
These efforts are complemented by multi-channel marketing campaigns to raise brand awareness, including direct-to-consumer (DTC) and health care professional campaigns. These key initiatives are supported by advertising campaigns encompassing social media, print and digital media, paid search initiatives, and public relations efforts. 
On February 14, 2021, we launched our first DTC advertising campaign, known as the Get Phexxi campaign (Get Phexxi) designed to increase awareness and educate women on the benefits of Phexxi. Get Phexxi highlights some of the struggles women face when choosing among the many available methods of contraception, including the lack of control with condoms, constant daily use of the pill, and abstinence required for cycle tracking. 
On September 9, 2021, we launched a national campaign featuring brand ambassador and Emmy Award-winning celebrity Annie Murphy, known as the House Rules campaign (House Rules), designed to broaden awareness and drive uptake of Phexxi. The House Rules campaign has significantly increased our target audience awareness of Phexxi, driven women to request a trial from their HCPs and driven significant increases in new HCPs recommending and prescribing Phexxi. Through December 31, 2021, the House Rules DTC campaign has impacted key metrics. The number of ex-factory units sent to distributors grew each quarter in 2021 and totaled 89,163 for the year. The largest growth occurred in the fourth quarter, with an increase in ex-factory units sent to distributors of 73% in Phexxi units shipped compared to the third quarter. This growth in the fourth quarter was propelled by over 22,600 new patients starting Phexxi, a 56% increase as compared to the third quarter. Ex-factory growth was further driven by a significant growth in refills (over 9,700 refill prescriptions, a 111% increase compared to the third quarter).
Our experienced team of key account directors and medical affairs team also focus on educating key payer accounts, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), key opinion leaders and medical associations about the importance of offering a wider set of options to women seeking non-hormonal, woman-controlled contraceptive methods. These educational activities have been and will continue to be supported by presentation of clinical data at key national congresses (such as the annual meetings of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Society of Family Planning, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, and Nurse Practitioners in Women’s Health), clinical publications, and additional market development activities. 
Payer and Reimbursement Strategy: United States 
Pricing Strategy
Our pricing strategy for Phexxi was informed by extensive payer research including discussions with decision makers at major health plans and PBMs across the United States who control nearly 83 million commercial lives. Based on this gathered intelligence, we initially priced Phexxi at $267.50 per box of 12 applicators, which on an annualized basis is comparable to the average annual cost of other branded contraception products. As of October 1, 2021, Phexxi is priced at $294.00 per box of 12 applicators, which when annualized is comparable to all other contraceptives commercially available today. 
Phexxi is classified in the databases and pricing compendia of Medi-Span and First Databank, two major drug information databases that payers consult for pricing and product information, as the first and only “Vaginal pH Modulator.” 
Third-party Payers
Market acceptance and sales of Phexxi and our other product candidates, assuming approval, will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for these products will be available from third-party payers, which include government health administration authorities, managed care organizations, private health insurers and PBMs. Third-party payers decide which therapies they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any product are made on a payer-by-payer basis. One payer’s determination to provide coverage for a drug does not assure that other payers will also provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for that drug.
Managed care organizations and other private insurers frequently adopt their own payment or reimbursement reductions. The continued integration between commercial health plans and PBMs has increased the negotiating power of these entities. Third-party payers increasingly employ formularies, which may not include all the products approved for a particular indication, to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion. We continue to work with both health plans and PBMs to secure additional formulary positioning for Phexxi. 
We continue working to increase the number of lives covered and to gain preferred formulary position for Phexxi. As of December 2021, IQVIA, a leading healthcare data science company, reports that approximately 80% of Phexxi prescriptions are being approved either by payers or through Evofem patient support programs. We have coverage for approximately 55% of U.S. commercial lives, including approximately nine million lives covered at no out-of-pocket cost and approximately 13.7 million lives covered under our December 2020 contract award from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.
We are also participating in government programs that include the 340B and the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, which took effect January 1, 2021, and affords access to Phexxi for the U.S. Medicaid population, comprising approximately 68 million members, including approximately 16.8 million women 19-49 years of age.
In January 2022, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and the U.S. Department of Labor separately issued updated guidance related to contraceptive access. The new guidance specifies that most insurers and PBMs 
must provide coverage with no out-of-pocket costs to women, for FDA-approved contraceptive products, like Phexxi, prescribed by health care providers.
Under the HRSA Women's Preventive Services Guidelines, the full range of FDA-approved, granted, or cleared contraceptives, effective family planning practices, and sterilization procedures should be available as part of contraceptive care. The full range of contraceptives is clarified to include those currently listed in the FDA's Birth Control Guide and any additional contraceptives approved, granted, or cleared by the FDA. The HSRA guidelines take effect in plan year 2023, with earlier adoption allowed.
Under the U.S. Department of Labor's published tri-agency clarification regarding contraceptive coverage, plans are required to cover an FDA-approved, cleared, or granted contraceptive if a provider deems it medically necessary at $0 cost share, whether or not it is specifically identified in the current FDA Birth Control Guide. Additionally, plans cannot require patients to try and fail multiple options within a method, or force trying and failing other methods, if a provider deems a product medically necessary.
We believe these updates are a very significant step forward toward ensuring contraceptive access for all women at zero copay under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
We continue to work with the FDA’s Office of Women’s Health to update its Birth Control Guide (Guide) to include a new category for vaginal pH modulators, as the current guide does not have a place for Phexxi due to its unique mechanism of action. While the HRSA and Department of Labor guidance are clear that plans are required to cover FDA- approved contraception at $0 cost share, whether or not it is specifically identified in the FDA Birth Control Guide, we believe there is still merit to the Guide being current and accurate. The Guide is used as an educational tool by obstetrician/gynecologists, and we therefore believe it should include all FDA-approved methods of birth control. To support this initiative, we have launched a grassroots coalition that shows the public’s support of the need for updating the chart. 
Contraceptive Market Landscape
The modern contraception market was established in 1960 with the introduction of “the pill,” the first oral contraceptive widely available to women in the United States. As shown in the timeline below, there was no notable innovation providing additional options in women’s reproductive health until almost 30 years after the introduction of “the pill,” when pharmaceutical companies introduced the non-hormonal copper IUD and synthetic hormonal products with different hormonal delivery systems, including the hormonal IUD, implants, the patch, and vaginal ring.
We expect that Phexxi vaginal gel will grow the prescription birth control user market when considering the 28.3 million women who are currently at risk for pregnancy and do not use hormone-based contraceptives as their primary form of contraception. Additionally, as women’s expectations change throughout their contraceptive journey, we expect Phexxi to compete for market share in at least three categories: 1) Hormonal short acting reversible contraceptives consisting of oral contraceptive pills, patches, and rings; 2) Long-Acting Reversible Contraception (LARC), comprising IUDs, implants, and injectables; and 3) OTC methods, dominated primarily by the male condom.
Prescription Contraception
In the United States, an estimated 18.8 million women use prescription contraception. 
OCs
Oral contraceptives (OCs), also known as the pill, are the most commonly used form of birth control in the United States today. There are two main kinds of hormonal OCs: combination birth control pills, which contain both estrogen and progestin, and the progestin only pill. OCs typically must be taken at the same time every day to be the most effective.
LARC
LARC is not dependent on user adherence, which appeals to those who benefit from a passive form of birth control with no daily requirement to take a pill. However, many women have opted against the IUD for fear of a bad insertion experience or having something in them (i.e. a “foreign body effect”). For other women who opt into the insertion procedure, many have decided to remove their IUD due to the hormonal and other side effects that they experience. Others have been deterred by the risks of IUDs brought to light by ongoing lawsuits.
Implants
The contraception implant must be implanted under the skin and removed by a qualified HCP, requiring a medical procedure. It provides contraception by releasing hormones over a three-year period. The implant is marketed in the United States as Nexplanon by Organon. 
IUDs
The copper IUD was introduced to the market in 1988 and provides protection by disrupting sperm motility and damaging sperm so that they are prevented from joining with an ovum. Today, the copper IUD is principally marketed by Cooper Surgical, Inc. as Paragard.

The hormonal IUD is principally offered under the brand names, Kyleena, Skyla and Mirena, a family of products from Bayer Pharmaceuticals. All IUDs must be inserted and removed by a physician.
Non-oral, Hormonal Contraceptives
Contraceptive Patch
The weekly contraceptive patch was introduced in 2000 by Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen division; however, deaths resulting from venous thromboembolism due to hormonal exposure had a significant negative impact on the patch and led to label changes restricting utilization. Following the loss of exclusivity, Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen division exited women’s health care and contraception as a promotional category. A new branded patch was launched in late 2020 under the brand name Twirla (Agile Therapeutics) and is competing against a generic entrant Xulane (Mylan).
Vaginal Ring
The hormonal vaginal ring by Merck & Co. was introduced to the market in 2001; however, generic versions are now available. The ring is used for three weeks and then removed for a week during menses and a new hormonal vaginal ring is inserted. The efficacy of the vaginal ring is similar to hormonal oral contraception. Users of the vaginal ring report the same incidence of hormone related side effects as those using oral hormonal contraception. 
An annual hormonal vaginal ring was launched in the United States in 2020 under the brand name Annovera (TherapeuticsMD). 
Injectables
The primary injectable hormonal contraceptive on the market is Depo-Provera offered by Pfizer Inc. Each injection provides protection for up to 12 to 14 weeks, but patients must receive injections once every 12 weeks to get optimal contraceptive protection. Depo-Provera was introduced to the market in 1992.
Non-prescription OTC
In the United States, an estimated 10.3 million women rely on OTC products for their contraceptive needs.
Condoms are the dominant product offering in OTC sales. Approximately six million women depend on condom use as their only method of birth control. The predominant brands are Trojan (Church & Dwight) and Durex (Reckitt Benckiser). 
Additional OTC products include spermicides, which are available in sponges, jelly/creams and foams. Spermicides carry a black box warning label and have very limited utilization.
Vaginal pH Modulator
New adopters of Phexxi are expected to come equally from each category discussed, as interest in Phexxi falls into three distinct segments: (1) those women who are not currently using hormone-based contraceptives; (2) those women awaiting an alternative to hormonal contraception; and (3) those women who are expected to utilize Phexxi as added protection to their current form of birth control. Our market research has indicated that the hormone-free, on-demand, woman-controlled aspect of Phexxi makes it an attractive option across the entire competitive set.
Ex-United States Markets
In markets outside of the United States, we intend to establish regional and/or global partnerships by either sublicensing the commercialization rights or entering into distribution agreements with one or more third parties for the commercialization of Phexxi and/or the applicable product candidate in that market.
In October 2021, we submitted the registration for our hormone-free contraceptive vaginal gel to the Mexican Regulatory Agency COFEPRIS (Comisión Federal para la Protección contra Riesgos Sanitarios) (COFEPRIS). In January 2022, we submitted registrations to the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control in Nigeria and the Ethiopian Food and Drug Authority. These are the first tranche of several strategic regulatory submissions planned under Evofem's 2020 Global Health Agreement with Adjuvant Capital. 
Manufacturing
We outsource the manufacturing of Phexxi (and our investigational product candidates) to a third party. We are currently contracted with a gel manufacturer to manufacture Phexxi in accordance with all applicable current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) regulations, as well as in compliance with all applicable laws and other relevant regulatory agency requirements for manufacture of pharmaceutical drug products and combination drug-device products. As of December 31, 2021, we estimated that we had manufactured inventory on hand to support approximately fifteen months of anticipated demand for Phexxi.
We are currently installing a second filling and packaging line at our manufacturer. We expect this line will be installed and qualified for manufacturing in 2022, thereby increasing our production capabilities to meet anticipated market demand for Phexxi.
Our Pipeline 
Phexxi for STI Prevention
Our lead clinical program is evaluating Phexxi (using the investigational name EVO100) for the prevention of chlamydia and gonorrhea in women – the two most frequently reported bacterial infections in the United States. Currently, there are no FDA‑approved prescription products for the prevention of either of these common STIs. The FDA has designated EVO100 (Phexxi) a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) for the prevention of urogenital chlamydia infection and the prevention of urogenital gonorrhea infection in women. The FDA has also granted Fast Track designations to EVO100 (Phexxi) for both potential new indications.
According to the CDC, any sexually active person can be infected with chlamydia or gonorrhea. Despite the CDC recommendation for condom use to prevent STIs, U.S. rates of infection with chlamydia and gonorrhea climbed in 2019 for the sixth consecutive year. The CDC reported 1.8 million new cases of chlamydia in 2019, the most ever reported, and over 600,000 new cases of gonorrhea, also the highest reported. The number of reported cases is lower than the estimated total number because infected people are often unaware of, and do not seek treatment for, their infections. Almost 60% of women infected with chlamydia have no symptoms. Based on these reports, an estimated 78 million women 18-65 years of age who are sexually active in the United States could be at risk to contract these STIs. 
Chlamydia and gonorrhea have been reported to be responsible for one-third to one-half of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) cases. PID can cause serious, long-term problems including infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain. We believe this represents a significant unmet medical need, as well as a commercial opportunity. 
In December 2020, the CDC updated its “Treatment Guidelines for Gonococcal Infection” due to the increasing resistance of gonorrhea and other organisms to treatment with the antibiotic azithromycin, which was the prior standard of care. 
Phase 2B/3 Trial for STI Prevention
In 2019, we completed AMPREVENCE, a double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 2B/3 trial (AMPREVENCE) to evaluate the efficacy of Phexxi for the prevention of sexual transmission of chlamydia (primary endpoint) and gonorrhea (secondary endpoint). This trial enrolled 860 women, 18 to 45 years of age, at approximately 50 sites in the United States. 
AMPREVENCE met both its primary and secondary endpoints of reducing the risk of chlamydia and gonorrhea infection, respectively, and demonstrated that Phexxi was generally safe and well tolerated. The infection rate of chlamydia among women who used Phexxi for the four-month study period was 4.9% (n=14/288) compared to 9.8% among those who used placebo for four months (n=28/287) (p=.024), a relative risk reduction of 50% in the primary endpoint. Among the reported cases of gonorrhea infection, the infection rate was 0.7% in the Phexxi arm (n=2/280), compared to 3.2% in the placebo arm (n=9/277) (p=.03), a relative risk reduction of 78% in the secondary endpoint. Phexxi was generally safe and well tolerated in this study population with the number of adverse events similar across both arms (7.2% for Phexxi and 7.5% for placebo) and no serious treatment-related adverse events reported.
Prior to the Phase 2B/3 trial, the FDA indicated that if AMPREVENCE met its primary endpoint, it could be considered as one of two pivotal trials required for approval of Phexxi for the prevention of chlamydia in women.
EVOGUARD
Based on the positive and statistically significant top-line results of our Phase 2B/3 AMPREVENCE trial, we initiated our Phase 3 EVOGUARD clinical trial in October 2020. We completed enrollment in March 2022 and expect to report top-line EVOGUARD results in the second half of 2022. Assuming positive results from the trial, we expect to submit a marketing application for Phexxi in the first half of 2023 with an anticipated FDA action date under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act in the second half of 2023. This is due to the potential for priority review afforded by the Fast Track Designation granted to EVO100 (Phexxi) by the FDA for the prevention of both chlamydia and gonorrhea. The FDA also designated EVO100 (Phexxi) a QIDP in 2022 for the prevention of urogenital chlamydia infection in women and in 2017 for the prevention of urogenital gonorrhea infection in women. 
A summary of the EVOGUARD study and design is provided below.

EVOGUARD is a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to enroll 1,730 women with a prior chlamydia or gonorrhea infection and who are at risk for future infections. Participants are enrolled for a 16-week interventional phase followed by a one-month follow-up period. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Phexxi in the prevention of urogenital chlamydia and gonorrhea infections. The design of the study is illustrated in Figure 1. 
EVO200 Vaginal Gel for Recurrent Bacterial Vaginosis
Our investigational candidate for the reduction of recurrent bacterial vaginosis (BV), EVO200 vaginal gel, uses the same proprietary vaginal pH modulator platform as Phexxi. In a Phase 1 dose-finding trial for this indication, the highest dose formulation of the study drug demonstrated reduced vaginal pH for up to seven days following a single administration. 
The FDA has designed EVO200 as a QIDP for this indication. 
MPT Vaginal Gel for HIV Prevention
In December 2021, we launched a collaboration with Orion Biotechnology Canada Ltd. (Orion) to evaluate the compatibility and stability of Orion’s novel CCR5 antagonist, OB-002, in Phexxi with the goal of developing a Multipurpose Prevention Technology (MPT) product candidate for indications including the prevention of HIV in women. This collaboration will focus on determining compatibility and stability of OB-002 in Phexxi and is expected to yield results in the third quarter of 2022. Assuming positive preclinical results, Evofem and Orion will seek government and philanthropic funding for subsequent clinical trials of the MPT vaginal gel product candidate.
Thin Film Project
We have contracted with the University of South Australia to develop a vaginally applied thin film as a second-generation vaginal pH modulator product. The target indications of the thin film are the prevention of pregnancy, chlamydia, and gonorrhea in women. The lead thin film candidates have been selected, and stability data has been generated with positive results. Phase 2 of the project is planned for 2022, and the activities are to optimize the lead candidates and select the appropriate packaging for long term storage.
Rush License Agreement
In 2014, we entered into an amended and restated license agreement with Rush University (the Rush License Agreement) pursuant to which Rush University granted us an exclusive, worldwide license of certain patents and know-how related to our multipurpose vaginal pH modulator technology (the Rush License IP) authorizing us to make, distribute and commercialize products and processes for any and all therapeutic, prophylactic and/or diagnostic uses, including, without limitation, use for female vaginal health and/or birth control. Pursuant to the Rush License Agreement, we are obligated to pay quarterly royalty payments in amounts equal to a single-digit percentage of the gross amounts we receive on a quarterly basis less certain deductions incurred in the quarter based on a sliding scale. We are also obligated to pay a minimum annual royalty amount of $100,000 to the extent these earned royalties do not equal or exceed $100,000 in a given year. A minimum annual royalty amount of $100,000 was first required for the annual period commencing on January 1, 2021. The royalty costs for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $0.2 million. 
We also have the right to sub-license our rights to affiliates (without the prior approval of Rush University) and to third parties (with the prior written approval of Rush University). To the extent Rush University approves of a third-party sub-license, in lieu of any royalty payment obligation under the Rush License Agreement, we would then be under an obligation to pay Rush University a sub-license fee equal to a percentage of any sublicensing revenue received from any third-party sub-licensee. Rush University retained a royalty free, non-exclusive license from us for the Rush License IP for non-commercial research purposes.
The Rush License Agreement contains additional customary representations and warranties, covenants, indemnification and insurance and confidentiality provisions for agreements of its type. The Rush License Agreement may be terminated upon mutual written consent of both parties or by a non-breaching party if the other party commits a breach or default of any covenant in the agreement and fails to cure this breach within 30 days after receiving written notice of the breach or default.
Unless terminated in accordance with its terms, the Rush License Agreement continues until the expiration, revocation or invalidation of the last of the patents or the abandonment of the last patent application included within the licensed patents and technology, including any patent claiming an improvement made during the term of the Rush License Agreement in the course of research supported or developed by Rush University utilizing the technology.
Intellectual Property 
We strive to protect the proprietary vaginal pH modulator gel technology both internationally and domestically. We seek and maintain patents intended to cover our product candidates, and their methods of use, as well as any other inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We endeavor to properly file patent applications for new inventions we believe may have commercial value. We also may rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
Our success will depend on our ability, in part: to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; to defend and enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights; and to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We will also rely on continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
As of February 28, 2022, we owned or had exclusive license to 41 issued patents and allowed applications in the United States and other countries and jurisdictions, and had 25 patent applications pending in the United States and other countries and jurisdictions. This includes two U.S. patents which cover Phexxi and its labeled indication that are listed in the U.S. FDA publication Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the Orange Book) following their submission to the FDA on June 3, 2020.
We have the Rush License IP, which provides general protection for our vaginal pH modulator platform. Our vaginal pH modulator platform could be eligible for regulatory extensions to at least 2026 in the United States and in certain European jurisdictions, if granted by those regulatory bodies. Rush University has submitted a patent term extension (PTE) application requesting a five-year PTE for the U.S. patent and has received two Orders Granting Interim Extension (OGIE), which have extended the expiration of the U.S. patent by two years to 2023. Further, we solely own several patent application families relating to the composition and therapeutic use of our vaginal pH modulator gel, which, upon issue, would expire at the earliest in 2033. We believe that our licensed and solely owned non-hormonal birth control gel patents and pending patent applications, combined with our substantial know-how in this field, will continue to provide opportunities for us to establish a significant barrier to competitor entry into the market.
In addition to patents, we rely, and expect to rely, on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive positions. For example, certain aspects of the composition, manufacturing, and use of Phexxi are protected by unpatented trade secrets and know-how. Although trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect, we seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, through confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, collaborators, and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for these incidents. In addition, our trade secrets and know-how may otherwise become known or may be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by third parties in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting intellectual property, including trade secret, know-how and inventions.
Trademark Basics and Strategy
We own or have rights to various trademarks, copyrights and trade names used in our business, including Evofem and Phexxi. All of our logos and trademarks appearing in this Annual Report are the property of Evofem Biosciences, Inc. All other third-party trademarks appearing in this Annual Report are the property of their respective holders. Our use or display of other parties’ trademarks, trade dress, or products in this Annual Report is not intended to, and does not, imply a relationship with, or endorsement or sponsorship of us, by the trademark, trade dress, or product owner.
Government Regulation and Product Approval 
The research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing, among other things, of our products are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory requirements, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and other medical products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and its implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending New Drug Applications (NDAs), warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions and/or criminal prosecution.
Drug Development and FDA Review and Approval Process
Our product candidates may not be marketed in the United States until the product has received FDA approval. The steps to be completed before a drug may be marketed in the United States include:
a.completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies, performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations;
b.submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to permit human clinical testing of the therapeutic candidate;
c.approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
d.completion of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, current good clinical practices (cGCPs), and other clinical-trial related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug for each proposed indication;
e.submission to the FDA of an NDA for marketing approval, including payment of application user fees;
f.satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations;
g.satisfactory completion of FDA bioresearch monitoring inspections of selected investigational sites at which the drug product was subject to clinical trials to assess compliance with cGCP regulations; and
h.FDA review and approval of the NDA, including satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review of the product candidate, where appropriate or if applicable, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the product in the United States.
Before testing any drug product candidate, including our product candidates, in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. The preclinical developmental stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals, which support subsequent clinical testing. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin.
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after an IND for an investigational drug candidate is submitted to the FDA and human clinical trials have been initiated.
The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials in the United States may begin and is required to be updated annually. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about issues such as the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and imposes a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance. We currently have two active INDs on file with the FDA: one for prevention of urogenital chlamydia, urogenital gonorrhea, and our BV product candidate (EVO200), and one for EVO100 (Phexxi) under which the ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial relating to prevention of chlamydia and gonorrhea (EVOGUARD) is being conducted. 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. The trial protocol and informed consent information for trial subjects in clinical trials must also be approved by an IRB for each institution where the trials will be conducted, and each IRB must monitor the trial until completion; an IRB may halt a trial under its jurisdiction for safety reasons. Trial subjects must sign an informed consent form before participating in a clinical trial. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive good clinical practice regulations and regulations for informed consent and privacy of individually identifiable information.
Clinical trials necessary for product approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap.
a.Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
b.Phase 2: This phase involves studies in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
c.Phase 3: Larger clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population, often at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product labeling. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow up. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
In addition, information about certain clinical trials, including details of the protocol and study results, must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on the ClinicalTrials.gov data registry. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration of the clinical trial. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in some cases for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and of the clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, and controls and proposed labeling, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. An NDA must be accompanied by payment of a significant user fee to the FDA (for example, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, this application fee exceeds $2.8 million). Annual program fees are also assessed on each sponsor of an approved NDA after a drug’s approval. Section 505(b)(1) and Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA are the provisions governing the type of NDAs that may be submitted under the FDCA. Section 505(b)(1) is the traditional pathway for new chemical entities when no other new drug containing the same active pharmaceutical ingredient or active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance, has been approved by the FDA. As an alternate pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations of previously approved products, a company may file a Section 505(b)(2) NDA. Section 505(b)(2) permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. 
During the 60 days after submission, the FDA reviews any NDA submitted to ensure that it is sufficiently complete for substantive review before the FDA accepts the NDA for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept the NDA for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. For most applications involving first-in-kind molecular entities, FDA has ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date for an application with priority review. Priority review can be applied to drugs intended to treat a serious condition and that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment by providing a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness, or that provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. Even if the NDA is filed by the FDA, companies cannot be sure that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Moreover, the FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and the review process for both standard and priority new drug applications may be extended by FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer the application to an appropriate advisory committee, typically a panel of independent clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of the advisory committee, but it typically considers such recommendations when making final decisions on marketing approval. The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy or “REMS” plan if it determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks and to assure the safe use of the drug or biological product. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. The FDA determines the requirement for a REMS, as well as the specific REMS provisions, on a case-by-case basis. If the FDA concludes a REMS plan is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve an NDA without a REMS, if required.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cGCPs. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMP requirements is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
The approval process is lengthy and often difficult, and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data and information. On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter, or CRL. A CRL generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, 
or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with the submission of additional information responding to the deficiencies identified in a prior CRL, however, the FDA ultimately may decide that a new drug application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
When issued, an NDA approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications as described in the application. Further, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval trials, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a product’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, the FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing trials or surveillance programs. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing or any time thereafter, and certain types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Post-Approval Requirements in the United States
Following approval of a new product or indication, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting approved drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”). Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including adverse publicity, enforcement action by the FDA, corrective advertising, consent decrees and the full range of civil and criminal penalties available to the FDA. Prescription drug promotional materials also must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the approved drug, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require the applicant to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials. 
Any limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur while the product is on the market. 
FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMPs. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our product and product candidates must meet cGMP requirements and satisfy the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities’ satisfaction before any product candidate is approved and our commercial products can be manufactured. Evofem relies, and expects to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of its products and product candidates in accordance with cGMPs. These manufacturers must also comply with cGMPs that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation, and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or combination products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMPs, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including recall.
After approval of a drug is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, or imposition of additional post-market surveillance or clinical trials to assess new safety risks. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters or other enforcement-related letters or clinical holds on investigational or post-approval clinical trials;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and
•consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal health care programs; or mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information.
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA), which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. More recently, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA), was enacted with the aim of building an electronic system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the United States, including most biological products. The DSCSA mandates phased-in resource-intensive obligations for pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers over a 10-year period that is expected to culminate in November 2023. From time to time, new legislation and regulations may be implemented that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. For example, FDA is expected to release proposed regulations in 2022 in order to amend the national standards for licensing of wholesale drug distributors by the states; establish new minimum standards for state licensing third-party logistics providers; and create a federal system for licensure for use in the absence of a State program, each of which is mandated by the DSCSA It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or regulatory changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
Hatch-Waxman Act and Marketing Exclusivity
Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the Hatch-Waxman Amendments) to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute and also enacted Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug (RLD). Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug. In contrast, Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. A Section 505(b)(2) applicant may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies, if it can establish that reliance on studies conducted for a previously-approved product is scientifically appropriate. Unlike the ANDA pathway used by developers of bioequivalent versions of innovator drugs, which does not allow applicants to submit new clinical data other than bioavailability or bioequivalence data, the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway does not preclude the possibility that a follow-on applicant would need to conduct additional clinical trials or nonclinical studies; for example, they may be seeking approval to market a previously approved drug for new indications or for a new patient population that would require new clinical data to demonstrate safety or effectiveness. The FDA may then approve the new product for all or some of the label indications for which the RLD has been approved, or for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant, as applicable.
Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. The Orange Book listing for the Phexxi vaginal gel NDA includes two patents covering the product’s composition of matter and its method of use in prevention of pregnancy. Except for patents covering methods of use for which the follow-on applicant is not seeking approval, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed in the Orange Book for the RLD, when an ANDA applicant submits its application to the FDA. To the extent the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, such an applicant is also required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. 
Specifically, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant for a follow-on drug product with respect to each patent must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed by the original applicant; (ii) the listed patent already has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a specified date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the new product. 
If a Paragraph I or II certification is filed, the FDA may make approval of the application effective immediately upon completion of its review. If a Paragraph III certification is filed, the approval may be made effective on the patent expiration date specified in the application, although a tentative approval may be issued before that time. If an application contains a Paragraph IV certification, a series of events will be triggered, the outcome of which will determine the effective date of approval of the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application. 
A certification that the new product will not infringe the RLD’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the follow-on applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders for the RLD once the applicant’s NDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a legal challenge to the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of their receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant. Alternatively, if the listed patent holder does not file a patent infringement lawsuit within the required 45-day period, the follow-on applicant’s ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA will not be subject to the 30-month stay.
In addition, under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the referenced RLD has expired. These market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a drug containing a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. 
The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for a NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving follow-on applications for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity also will not delay the submission or approval of a traditional NDA filed under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. However, an applicant submitting a traditional NDA would be required to either conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. The Phexxi NDA is subject to this form of three-year new product exclusivity, which expires on May 22, 2023.
Designation of and Exclusivity for Qualified Infectious Disease Products
In 2012 as part of the Food Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, Congress passed legislation known as the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act (GAIN Act), which amended the FDCA to encourage the development of antibacterial and antifungal drug products that treat pathogens that cause serious and life-threatening infections. The law grants an additional five years of marketing exclusivity upon the approval of an NDA for a drug product previously designated by FDA as a QIDP. As a result, if applicable to a designated QIDP, upon approval the periods of five-year new chemical entity exclusivity and three-year new clinical investigation exclusivity would become ten years and eight years, respectively.
A QIDP is defined in the GAIN Act to mean “an antibacterial or antifungal drug for human use intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections, including those caused by: (1) an antibacterial or antifungal resistant pathogen, including novel or emerging infectious pathogens;” or (2) certain “qualifying pathogens.” A “qualifying pathogen” is a pathogen that has the potential to pose a serious threat to public health (e.g., resistant gram positive pathogens, multi-drug resistant gram negative bacteria, multi-drug resistant tuberculosis and Clostridium difficile) and that is included in a list established and maintained by FDA. A drug sponsor may request FDA to designate its product as a QIDP any time before the submission of an NDA for that indication. FDA must make a QIDP determination within 60 days of the designation request. A product designated as a QIDP may be granted priority review by FDA upon submission and can also qualify for “Fast Track” status, described further below. We have received two QIDP designations from the FDA for EVO100 (Phexxi) for the prevention of urogenital infection in women with both chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Fast Track and Priority Review Designations
The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited development or review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs include Fast Track designation and priority review designation.
To be eligible for a Fast Track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need by providing a therapy where none exists or a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. Fast Track designation provides opportunities for more frequent interactions with the FDA review team to expedite development and review of the product. The FDA may also review sections of the NDA for a Fast Track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor and the FDA agree on a schedule for the submission of the application sections, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the sponsor or rescinded by the FDA if the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. A product candidate designated as a QIDP is eligible for Fast Track designation under the provisions of the GAIN Act, but the NDA sponsor must specifically request Fast Track designation from the agency as with non-infectious disease product candidates. Fast Track designation may be requested concurrent with or at any time after the QIDP designation. In addition, although QIDP designation may be requested prior to submission of an Investigational New Drug Application (IND), a request for Fast Track designation may only be made concurrently with, or any time after, submission of an IND.
The FDA also may designate a product for priority review if it is a drug or biologic that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines at the time that the marketing application is submitted, on a case- by-case basis, whether the proposed drug represents a significant improvement in treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting drug reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, or evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority review designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months for an original new molecular entity NDA from the date of filing. Although the FDA automatically gives priority review designation to the first application submitted for a specific drug product and indication for which a QIDP designation was granted, a subsequent application from the same sponsor for the same product and indication will receive priority review designation only if it otherwise meets the criteria for priority review.
Finally, even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, Fast Track designation and priority review do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process.
We have received two Fast Track designations from the FDA for EVO100 (Phexxi) for the prevention of urogenital chlamydia and gonorrhea infection in women.
Patent Term Restoration in the United States
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited PTE under other provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. These PTEs permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for any patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND, and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension, and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any PTE or restoration.
Other United States Governmental Regulations and Environmental Matters
If we establish international operations, we will be subject to compliance with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the FCPA), which prohibits corporations and individuals from paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. We also may be implicated under the FCPA for activities by our partners, collaborators, contract research organizations, vendors or other agents.
Importantly, United States authorities that enforce the FCPA, including the Department of Justice, deem most health care professionals and other employees of foreign hospitals, clinics, research facilities and medical schools in countries with public health care or public education systems to be “foreign officials” under the FCPA. If and when we interact with foreign health care professionals and researchers in testing and marketing our products abroad, we must have policies and procedures in place sufficient to prevent us and agents acting on our behalf from providing any bribe, gift or gratuity, including excessive or lavish meals, travel or entertainment in connection with marketing our products and services or securing required permits and approvals such as those needed to initiate clinical trials in foreign jurisdictions. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the maintenance of books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and the development and maintenance of an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws and regulations. Various laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the purchase, storage, movement, import and export and use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our research work are or may be applicable to our activities. Certain agreements involving exclusive license rights, if any, or acquisitions, if any, may be subject to national or supranational antitrust regulatory control, the effect of which cannot be predicted. The extent of government regulation, which might result from future legislation or administrative action, cannot accurately be predicted.
Review and Approval of Drug Products in the European Union
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are and will be subject, either directly or through our distribution partners, to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and future commercial sales and distribution of our products, if approved in those markets.
We must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in non-U.S. countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of a product in those countries. Moreover, the time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. As of January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom (UK) is no longer a member state of the European Union (EU), and therefore a separate marketing authorization application (MAA) and approval will be required to market a medicinal product in the UK. 
We are currently assessing the optimal regulatory legal basis for the Phexxi MAA in the EU and the UK. As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed in the EU only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained. Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls.
Pursuant to the European Clinical Trials Directive, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the EU has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of an EU member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. Clinical trial applications must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by the European Clinical Trials Directive and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. In April 2014, the new Clinical Trials Regulation, Regulation EU No 536/2014 (Clinical Trials Regulation) was adopted and it came into application on January 31, 2022. The Clinical Trials Regulation will be directly applicable in all the EU member states, repealing the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. Conduct of all clinical trials performed in the EU will continue to be bound by currently applicable provisions until the new Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable. The extent to which ongoing clinical trials will be governed by the Clinical Trials Regulation will depend on when the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable and on the duration of the individual clinical trial. If a clinical trial continues for more 
than three years from the day on which the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable, the Clinical Trials Regulation will at that time begin to apply to the clinical trial.
The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the EU. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed by the competent authorities of all EU member states in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted. Part II is assessed separately by each EU member state concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned EU member state. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation.
To obtain marketing approval of a drug in the EU, an applicant must submit an MAA either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all EU member states, Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products (such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines) and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is of 150 days, excluding stop-clocks.
The decentralized procedure is available to applicants who wish to market a product in specific EU member states where such product has not received marketing approval in any EU member states before. The decentralized procedure provides for an applicant to apply to one-member state to assess the application (the reference member state) and specifically list other member states in which it wishes to obtain approval (concerned member states). Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application based on identical dossiers and related materials, including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labelling and package leaflet, to the reference member state and each concerned member state. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment report and drafts of the related materials within 210 days after receipt of a valid application which is then reviewed and approved commented on by the concerned member states. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report and related materials, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials.
In the EU, only products for which marketing authorizations have been granted may be promoted. A marketing authorization is valid for five years in principle and the marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. To this end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the drug on the EU market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing member state within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause). Even if authorized to be marketed in the EU, prescription-only medicines may only be promoted to health care professionals, not the general public. All promotion should be in accordance with the particulars listed in the summary of product characteristics. Promotional materials must also comply with various laws, and codes of conduct developed by pharmaceutical industry bodies in the EU which govern (among other things) the training of sales staff, promotional claims and their justification, comparative advertising, misleading advertising, endorsements, and (where permitted) advertising to the general public. Failure to comply with these requirements could lead to the imposition of penalties by the competent authorities of the EU member states. The penalties could include warnings, orders to discontinue the promotion of the drug product, seizure of promotional materials, fines and possible imprisonment.
EU Regulatory Exclusivity
In the EU, new products authorized for marketing (i.e., reference products) qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic applicants from relying on the pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic marketing authorization in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until ten years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The ten-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
Rest of the World Regulation
For other countries outside of the EU and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia, or Africa, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with cGCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Other U.S. Health Care Laws and Regulations
We must comply with various U.S. federal and state laws, rules and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws. HCPs and third-party payers play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products and medical devices. Our current and future arrangements with health care professionals, principal investigators, consultants, third-party payers and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other health care laws and regulations. Such restrictions under applicable federal and state health care laws and regulations, include but are not limited to the following:
Anti-Kickback Statute – the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, among other things, prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federally funded health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate the statute in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.
Civil and Criminal False Claims Laws – the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act, which can be enforced by private citizens through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government.
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 – the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making any false statements relating to health care matters; as in the case of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate the statute in order to have committed a violation. Additionally, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH), and its implementing regulations impose certain obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization, on entities subject to the law, such as certain HCPs, health plans, and health care clearinghouses and their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the creation, use, maintenance or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information.
False Statements Statute – the federal False Statements Statutes prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement to the federal government, including executive or administrative agencies.
Sunshine Act – the federal transparency or “sunshine” requirements of the ACA requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to annually report to the Department of Health and Human Services (the DHHS) information related to payments and other transfers of value made to physicians, teaching hospitals and certain advanced non-
physician health care practitioners, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
State Transparency Laws – some U.S. state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to HCPs and other HCPs or marketing expenditures; some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and to track and report gifts, compensation and other remuneration provided to physicians, in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other HCPs or marketing expenditures and pricing information; and some state and local laws require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives.
State and Foreign Regulatory Concerns – there are analogous State and foreign laws and regulations, such as State Anti-Kickback and False Claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving health care items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payers, including private insurers. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health and personal information. These laws differ from each other in significant ways and may conflict, while applying simultaneously with HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
The scope and enforcement of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change. Notably, in November 2020, DHHS finalized significant changes to the regulations implementing the Anti-Kickback Statute, as well as the civil monetary penalty rules regarding beneficiary inducements, with the goal of offering the health care industry more flexibility and reducing the regulatory burden associated with those fraud and abuse laws, particularly with respect to value-based arrangements among industry participants. Regulatory authorities might challenge our current or future activities under these laws, regulations, and safe harbors. Any such challenge could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with these laws will involve substantial costs. Any investigation of us or the third parties with whom we contract, regardless of the outcome, would be costly and time consuming. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, monetary fines, imprisonment, disgorgement of profits, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs, debarment under the FDCA, additional reporting or oversight obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with the law, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
Health Care Reform and Potential Changes to Laws and Regulations
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, legislative and regulatory changes both enacted and proposed related to the health care system, which could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. In particular, the FDA’s and other regulatory authorities’ policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted. For example, in December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act), was passed by Congress and signed into law. The Cures Act, among other things, is intended to modernize the regulation of drugs and devices and to spur innovation, but its ultimate implementation is uncertain. In addition, in August 2017, the FDA Reauthorization Act was signed into law, which reauthorized the FDA’s user fee programs and included additional drug and device provisions that build on the Cures Act. Furthermore, the next FDA reauthorization package is currently being negotiated and is due to be finalized by Congress in 2022, while several other FDA-related changes are also being proposed in Congress, including within a “Cures 2.0” bill that is likely to have bipartisan support. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we otherwise may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in health care systems with the stated goals of containing health care costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans; imposed mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries as a condition for manufacturers’ outpatient drugs coverage under Medicare Part D; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to test innovative payment and service delivery 
models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending. As another example, the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act, signed into law on December 27, 2020, incorporated extensive health care provisions and amendments to existing laws, including a requirement that all manufacturers of drug products covered under Medicare Part B report the product’s average sales price (ASP) to DHHS beginning on January 1, 2022, subject to enforcement via civil money penalties.
Since its enactment, there have been judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and as a result certain sections of the ACA have not been fully implemented or effectively repealed. However, following several years of litigation in the federal courts, in June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the ACA when it dismissed a legal challenge to the ACA’s constitutionality. Further legislative and regulatory changes under the ACA remain possible, although the new federal administration under President Biden has signaled that it plans to build on the ACA and expand the number of people who are eligible for health insurance subsidies under it. It is unknown what form any such changes or any law would take, and how or whether it may affect the pharmaceutical industry as a whole or our business in the future. We expect that changes or additions to the ACA, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, such as changes allowing the federal government to directly negotiate drug prices, and changes stemming from other health care reform measures, especially with regard to health care access, financing or other legislation in individual states, could have a material adverse effect on the health care industry in the United States.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which began in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional congressional action is taken. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act), which was signed into law on March 27, 2020, and was designed to provide financial support and resources to individuals and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, and extended the sequester by one year, through 2030, in order to offset the added expense of the 2020 cancellation. The suspension was subsequently extended through March 31, 2022, with a reduction of the suspension to 1% sequester through June 30, 2022.
As another example, on December 20, 2019, President Trump signed the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2020 into law (P.L. 116-94) that includes a piece of bipartisan legislation called the Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent Samples Act of 2019 (the CREATES Act). The CREATES Act aims to address the concern articulated by both the FDA and others in the industry that some brand manufacturers have improperly restricted the distribution of their products to deny generic product developers access to samples of brand products. Because generic product developers need samples to conduct certain comparative testing required by the FDA, some have attributed the inability to timely obtain samples as a cause of delay in the entry of generic products. To remedy this concern, the CREATES Act establishes a private cause of action that permits a generic product developer to sue the brand manufacturer to compel it to furnish the necessary samples on “commercially reasonable, market-based terms.” Whether and how generic product developers will use this new pathway, as well as the likely outcome of any legal challenges to provisions of the CREATES Act, remain highly uncertain and its potential effects on our future commercial products are unknown. Other new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other health care funding, which could have an adverse effect on customers for our approved product and, accordingly, our financial operations.
Additionally, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of manufacturers’ pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. DHHS has solicited feedback on various measures intended to lower drug prices and reduce the out-of-pocket costs of drugs and has implemented others under its existing authority. For example, in 2020, the FDA finalized a rulemaking to establish a system whereby state governmental entities could lawfully import and distribute prescription drugs sourced from Canada. More recently, in July 2021, President Biden issued a sweeping executive order on promoting competition in the American economy that includes several mandates pertaining to the pharmaceutical and health care insurance industries. Among other things, the executive order directs the FDA to work towards implementing a system for importing drugs from Canada (following on the Trump administration notice-and-comment rulemaking on Canadian drug importation that was finalized in October 2020). The Biden order also called on DHHS to release a comprehensive plan to combat high prescription drug prices, and it includes several directives regarding the Federal Trade Commission’s oversight of potentially anticompetitive practices within the pharmaceutical industry. The drug pricing plan released by DHHS in September 2021 in response to the executive order makes clear that the Biden Administration supports aggressive action to address rising drug prices, including allowing DHHS to negotiate the cost of Medicare Part B and D drugs, but such significant changes will require either new legislation to be passed by Congress or time-consuming administrative actions.
Coverage, Pricing, and Reimbursement
Sales of Evofem’s products approved for marketing by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities depend, in part, on the extent to which such products will be covered by third-party payers, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed care organizations. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug or biological products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of Evofem’s FDA-approved products will be made on a payer-by-payer basis. Prescriptions generated through the Phexxi telehealth platform may be subject to additional payer requirements. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our approved products to each payer separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, and mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of general controls and measures, coupled with the tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceutical drugs. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the DHHS as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price (AMP), to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. Congress has expressed its intention to repeal or repeal and replace the ACA. If that is done, many if not all of the provisions of the ACA may no longer apply to prescription drugs.
The marketability of any products for which Evofem has or will receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. An increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States has increased, and Evofem expects will continue to increase, the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to currently available therapies (so called health technology assessment) in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of Evofem’s approved drug products. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
