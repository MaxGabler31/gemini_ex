ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Overview 
 
Our Business 
 
We are a clinical stage pharmaceutical company with a growing pipeline of clinical programs for the treatment of highly resistant cancers and viruses. We have three core technologies, based substantially on discoveries made at and licensed from MD Anderson Cancer Center (MD Anderson) in Houston, Texas. We have six drug candidates, three of which have now shown human activity in clinical trials.
Core Technologies
 
Our core technologies consist of the following: a) Annamycin, a “next generation” anthracycline designed to be different than currently approved anthracyclines by eliminating cardiotoxicity and avoiding the multidrug resistance mechanisms that can limit the efficacy of the approved products. (Annamycin has shown no cardiotoxicity in subjects treated to date in Moleculin’s clinical trials); b) our WP1066 Portfolio, which includes WP1066 and WP1220, two of several Immune/Transcription Modulators in the portfolio designed to inhibit p-STAT3 (phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription) among other transcription factors associated with tumor activity, while also stimulating a natural immune response to tumors by inhibiting the errant activity of Regulatory T-Cells (TRegs); and c) our WP1122 Portfolio, which contains compounds (including WP1122, WP1096, WP1097) designed to exploit the potential uses of inhibitors of glycolysis such as 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), which we believe may provide an opportunity to cut off the fuel supply of tumors by taking advantage of their high level of dependence on glucose in comparison to healthy cells.
Clinical Trials
 
In the US and Europe, we have completed or are currently conducting clinical trials for three of our drug candidates – Annamycin, WP1066, and WP1220. All trials are or were in the Phase 1 portion, except the WP1220 trial, which was a proof-of-concept clinical trial. During 2021, we had four active clinical trials evaluating either Annamycin or WP1066 in the US and Europe. In 2021 and early 2022, there were also three “right-to-try” (or their foreign equivalent) uses of Annamycin and WP1066. Of the four clinical trials active in 2021, two of those are internally funded trials (the difference between “internally” and “externally” funded trials is discussed below) of Annamycin. One is studying relapsed and refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in Europe, and one is investigating soft tissue sarcoma metastasized to the lungs (STS lung metastases) in the US. The other two trials are externally funded studies of WP1066 in brain tumors, both in the US, one of which was terminated during the year because the Principal Investigator in that trial moved to a new institution. We successfully concluded an internally funded Phase 1 AML clinical trial in Europe in early 2022, establishing a Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) for Annamycin as a single agent. We are in the process of locking the database and beginning the completion of the Clinical Study Report (CSR) for that study.
 
During 2021, we filed applications or began recruiting for four clinical trials in the US and Europe. The investigational new drug (IND) application in the US for a Phase 1b/2 trial of Annamycin for the treatment of STS lung metastases was filed in late 2020 with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The IND went into effect in early 2021 and this trial began recruiting subjects shortly thereafter. In 2021, we also filed and received clearance for an IND for a Phase 1 trial for WP1122 treating glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in adults, and consistent with our strategy of leveraging external funding for many of our clinical trials, we intend to seek opportunities for an investigator-initiated clinical trial in cancer patients in 2022. We also filed in October 2021 a clinical trial application (CTA) to commence a Phase 1a clinical trial of WP1122 in the United Kingdom for the treatment of COVID-19 for which we later received the appropriate authorization to proceed. In early March 2022, we filed an amended protocol with both the Riverside Ethics Committee and Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The amendment updated the level of dilution of the oral solution to ensure that WP1122 is fully dissolved in a wider range of pharmacy environments. We believe that the risk/benefit aspect of the study was not affected by this change. Once this amendment is approved, we expect this internally funded trial to begin in the first half of 2022.
 
We also filed a CTA in Poland in November 2021 for a Phase 1/2 trial for the treatment of relapsed and refractory AML with a combination of Annamycin and Cytarabine (AnnAraC) for which we received Central Ethics approval in December 2021. Upon receipt of approval from the Office for Registration of Medicinal Products, Medical Devices and Biocidal Products (URPL), we plan to proceed with this trial. This trial builds on the safety and dosage data from the two successfully concluded single agent Annamycin AML Phase 1 trials in the US and Europe and is supported by preclinical animal data from our ongoing sponsored research at MD Anderson. The AnnAraC trial is expected to begin during the first half of 2022.
 
In addition to the trials described above, we expect that an investigator sponsored trial will be initiated in Europe in 2022 to study an alternative dosing regimen for Annamycin in the treatment of STS lung metastases. During 2022, we may also have another investigator led trial outside of the US (partially internally funded) focused on the use of WP1122 for the treatment of subjects with COVID-19. The volatility and unpredictability of COVID-19 incidence in various countries may limit our ability to recruit certain subjects and could make it infeasible for us to conduct a Phase 2 clinical trial on a timely basis, or at all. As mentioned earlier, the WP1066 brain tumor trial at MD Anderson was terminated in 2021, as the original lead physician investigator moved to another institution. We expect another externally funded Phase 1/2 investigator led trial to replace the MD Anderson trial in 2022. That trial’s IND will likely reference our WP1066 GBM IND filed in early 2022, once cleared by the FDA. We expect this new trial to investigate WP1066 in combination with radiation for the treatment of adult brain tumors.

As summarized and explained further below, we expect up to ten clinical trials (or more, if we proceed with a COVID-19 trial in addition to the UK trial) to be active or concluded by the end of 2022.

1 This is a summary of the detailed discussion below and does not include compassionate use/right-to-try usage of our drug candidates. Terms are defined elsewhere in this document including “internal” versus “external” funding. Additionally, “Met safety endpoints” means that no drug-related serious and unexpected adverse events occurred as defined in the trial protocol. All data presented are preliminary unless a CSR has been issued for the trial referenced.
 
Human Activity
 
Three of our drug candidates have shown activity in humans to date. Prior to 2021, a US Phase 1 trial for Annamycin in AML successfully met its safety endpoint (including the absence of cardiotoxicity) and demonstrated human activity in the reduction of circulating bone marrow blasts despite the trial being conducted at what were expected to be subtherapeutic dosages (not exceeding 120 mg/m2) based on the European AML study. This US study’s CSR was issued in 2021. In the final cohort of the European Phase 1 single-agent Annamycin trial, where the RP2D was determined to be 240 mg/m2, there was a preliminary objective response rate (ORR) of 60% (three out of five) in subjects receiving a full course of treatment.
 
In an investigator-initiated trial (IIT) trial of WP1066 (our lead inhibitor of p-STAT3) for the treatment of pediatric brain tumors, both a clinical and an objective response was demonstrated in a patient with diffuse interstitial pontine glioma (DIPG), one of several indications for which WP1066 has been granted a “rare pediatric disease” designation, which could potentially qualify WP1066 for a priority review voucher upon approval of a New Drug Application (NDA).
 
The CSR issued in 2021 for a clinical trial of WP1220, another drug candidate in the WP1066 Portfolio, for the topical treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) documented in 60% of subjects (3 out of 5) PR that was confirmed by a subsequent evaluation one month later with one of the subjects having a near total resolution of their lesions (93% decrease). The median time to PR was 56 days. Stable disease was the best response documented for remaining 40% of subjects (2 out of 5), resulting in clinical benefit for 100% of subjects. All subjects (100%) survived up to 112 days of follow-up.

Funding Strategy 
 
By “internally funded” we mean that the primary costs of the preclinical activity and clinical trials are funded and sponsored by us. By “externally funded” we mean that the preclinical work is performed by external collaborators and for the clinical trials are physician-sponsored or IITs. For externally funded research, any grant funds that support such preclinical work or clinical trials and most of the associated expenses do not flow through our financial statements. For externally funded preclinical activities and clinical trials, we do provide drug product and other supporting activities for which costs are shown in our financial statements.
 
Additionally, we are seeking collaborative partners to further clinical research on all three of our core programs. Specifically, we have ongoing discussions with potential partners to support a Phase 2 clinical trial of WP1220 in CTCL. The ultimate course of action depends on the outcome of additional regulatory and preclinical work. These trials may be internally or externally funded, depending on the timing and nature of the studies. Utilizing our sponsored research, we are further evaluating WP1122 and other molecules in that portfolio (WP1096 and WP1097) for the treatment of COVID-19 and other viruses. These discussions, unless otherwise described herein, are preliminary. The volatility and unpredictability of COVID-19 incidence in various countries may limit our ability to recruit certain subjects and could make it infeasible for us to conduct a Phase 2 clinical trial on a timely basis, or at all.
 
Working Environment
 
Our headquarters and laboratory are in Houston, Texas, and our workforce, as of year-end 2021, consisted of twenty-one full and part-time employees, including contractors devoting more than 20 hours per week, in the US and Europe, which are leveraged with other service providers and contractors worldwide working in a primarily virtual environment, even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. This number increased to twenty-two in early 2022. We do not have manufacturing facilities and all manufacturing activities are contracted out to third parties. Additionally, we do not have a sales organization. Our overall strategy is to seek the best value for our shareholders either via potential outlicensing or collaborative opportunities with other pharmaceutical companies with existing marketing, sales and distribution or via the development of contracted marketing, sales and distribution capability if and when our drugs are approved.
 
The spread of COVID-19 has caused significant volatility in US and international markets, including Poland, where we conduct some of our clinical trials, and Italy, where our drug supply is produced. There has been limited temporary interruption of our drug supply, and the ability to monitor activities were limited at most Polish clinics where we are conducting trials, which could delay our ability to collect data and authorize new subject recruitment. Additionally, we believe COVID-19 has materially slowed the ability of approved sites to recruit subjects for our trials in Poland. Although, the impact of the pandemic appears to be lessened, this continues to be a volatile situation that could continue to improve or worsen at any time. Furthermore, there is significant uncertainty around the breadth and duration of business disruptions related to COVID-19, including the impact on the US and international economies and, as such, we are therefore unable to determine if those circumstances will have a material impact to our operations.
 
Additionally, war, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties (such as the current crisis in Ukraine) and other business interruptions could cause damage to, disrupt or cancel the conduct of our clinical trials on a global or regional basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, clinical sites or vendors with which we do business. Such events could also decrease the availability of subjects interested or able to enroll in our clinical trials or make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products and services to our clinical investigational sites. In addition, territorial invasions can lead to cybersecurity attacks on technology companies, such as ours, located outside of the conflict zone. In the event of prolonged business interruptions due to geopolitical events, we could incur significant losses, require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume our business or clinical operations. While having operations in neighboring Poland, we have no operations directly in Russia or Ukraine, but we do not and cannot know if the current uncertainties in these geopolitical areas, which are unfolding in real-time, will escalate and result in broad economic and security conditions or rationing of medical supplies or production facilities, which could limit our ability to conduct clinical trials or result in material implications for our business. In addition, our insurance policies typically contain a war exclusion of some description and we do not know how our insurers are likely to respond in the event of a loss alleged to have been caused by geopolitical uncertainties.
 
We cannot determine whether these events will materially impact our overall business and operations, recruitment, and our drug supply in the future.
 
Mission and Strategy Overview
 
We are a clinical stage pharmaceutical company with a growing pipeline of clinical development programs for the treatment of highly resistant cancers and viruses. For cancers, these include AML, GBM, STS lung metastases, pancreatic cancer, CTCL, other vital organ metastases, and others. With regard to viruses, our current focus is the possible treatment of COVID-19, its variants and potential future coronaviruses, while additional preclinical work has demonstrated possible activity against HIV, Zika, and Dengue fever. Our diverse pipeline of technologies was built around the recognition that many highly resistant tumors tend to have a common set of traits, including an increase in multidrug resistance mechanisms, an evasion of the natural immune system, a marked upregulation of certain key oncogenic transcription factors and an increased dependence on glycolysis for energy production. Many of these traits are also common to certain viruses and we believe each of these elements may be addressed by the unique and innovative mechanisms introduced by one or more of our three core technologies. As detailed within, although we have conducted a significant amount of preclinical and early-stage clinical work that we consider promising, there is no guarantee that any future study will be conducted or will be successful, or that our product candidates, if approved, will ultimately be successfully commercialized.
 
We believe our technologies may provide an opportunity to help the many patients in need of alternative therapies, both as single agents and in combination with numerous existing technologies that often fail as tumors present immediate or acquired resistance. We believe showing even modest improvements in highly resistant cancers and viruses may lead to approval pathways that may potentially reduce the time and capital required to ultimately realize success.
 
Our technology is licensed from MD Anderson via exclusive licenses, which are discussed in more detail below. In February 2019, we announced our sublicensing agreement to WPD Pharmaceuticals (WPD), an entity associated with one of our cofounders and the chair of our science advisory board, Dr. Waldemar Priebe. WPD recently announced their facilitation of a grant equivalent to $1.5 million to the Maria Sklodowska-Curie National Research Institute of Oncology (MSCNRIO) to fund a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of Annamycin for the treatment of STS lung metastases. The grant-funded clinical trial is led by Prof. Piotr Rutkowski, MD, PhD, Head of Department of Soft Tissue/Bone Sarcoma and Melanoma at the MSCNRIO in Warsaw, Poland. As we continue to generate additional human data, we intend to pursue additional strategic collaborations on a regional basis for each of our drug candidates. Additionally, we are independently exploring other grant funded opportunities.

This increase in potential outside funding should allow us to concentrate our internal resources primarily on Annamycin, WP1122, and alternate methods of delivery for WP1066. This allows us to prioritize our internal funding to core clinical trials that we think may lead to an approval pathway and/or a strategic licensing opportunity. Accordingly, we have increased our focus on clinical trial pathways for Annamycin, which is now in clinical trials for two different indications. We have now seen human activity in three drug candidates, some of which that we think are capable of supporting an approval pathway with continued positive developments in their respective clinical trials. We continue to internally fund our WP1122 antiviral program, as we now have an approved CTA for a Phase 1 clinical trial intended to establish an RP2D, however the volatility and unpredictability of COVID-19 incidence in various countries may limit our ability to recruit certain subjects and could make it infeasible for us to conduct a Phase 2 clinical trial on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, the FDA recently cleared an IND for the study of WP1122 in GBM and we intend to identify investigators interested in collaborating on the potential oncology indications for this drug candidate.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We have obtained worldwide, exclusive licenses from MD Anderson Cancer Center (MD Anderson) to issued US patents and pending US patent applications for each of our drug candidates, as well as pending foreign patent applications or issued foreign patents. With respect to certain patents or patent applications, we are co-owners with MD Anderson, in which instances we have exclusively licensed MD Anderson’s rights in those patents or patent applications. Where MD Anderson has sole ownership of patents licensed to us, MD Anderson is responsible for the prosecution and maintenance of those patent applications, with input from us and at our expense. Where MD Anderson jointly owns patent applications with us, we are responsible for prosecution and maintenance of those patents and patent applications at our expense. As new discoveries arise with respect to our drug candidates, we and MD Anderson seek to protect our rights to those inventions by filing new patent applications. There can be no assurance that patent applications will issue as patents or, with respect to issued patents, that they will provide us with significant protection.
 
Issued patents generally expire 20 years after their filing date, subject to adjustment or extension under certain circumstances. For instance, the expiration of US patents may be adjusted to account for prosecution delays, if any, by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Some jurisdictions, including the US and countries belonging to the European Patent Convention, will extend the expiration of an unexpired patent for an approved pharmaceutical product by some portion of time required for clinical development and regulatory review. We intend to seek patent term extensions for patents for our product candidates where available. In addition, certain pharmaceutical regulatory bodies, including the US FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), provide some period of exclusivity for new pharmaceutical products independent of patent protection. In the US, regulatory exclusivity can range from three (3) years for a product with a previously approved active pharmaceutical ingredient to seven (7) years for a novel product designated as an Orphan Drug. We have obtained Orphan Drug designation (ODD) from the FDA for Annamycin for the treatment of AML and intend to seek ODD for Annamycin and other product candidates for other orphan diseases for which we seek to develop these drugs.
 
The following provides a general description of our patent portfolio and is not intended to represent an assessment of claim limitations or claim scope.
 
Annamycin
 
We have pending patent applications directed to the synthetic processes for lyophilized Annamycin and for reconstitution of our Annamycin drug product candidate. We have exclusively licensed MD Anderson’s rights in these applications, which are co-owned by MD Anderson and us. The applications are pending in jurisdictions worldwide, including but not limited to Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, European Patent Organization, Japan and the US Both applications have a filing date of June 25, 2020. We also have rights to a patent application, filed on November 23, 2020, directed to the use of Annamycin for the treatment of certain lung cancers.
p-STAT3 Inhibitors
 
WP1066. We have rights to four issued US patents for WP1066. These patents claim WP1066 and other molecules, as well as methods of treating disease using WP1066. Foreign counterparts to the US patents are issued in Canada, Europe, Israel, India, Japan and South Korea. These patents have an international filing date in December 2004, and in certain instances have had the patent term adjusted. We also have rights to a patent application directed to the combination of WP1066 with checkpoint inhibitors.
 
WP1220. We have rights to three issued US patents which claim compositions of WP1220, as well as foreign counterparts issued in China, Eurasia, Europe, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore and Ukraine. These patents have an international filing date in June 2009. In addition, we have rights to an issued US patent for the treatment of skin disorders using WP1220, with a filing date in September 2009.
 
WP1122
 
We have rights to an issued US patent with claims to compositions of WP1122 and methods for treating cancer using WP1122, with an international filing date in June 2009. We also have rights to foreign counterparts issued in China, Europe, and Japan. In addition, we have rights to US and foreign patent applications directed to the treatment of viral diseases with WP1122 and other anti-metabolites including WP1096 and WP1097, with a filing date in March 2021.
 
Our Drug Candidate Programs
 
Annamycin Program
 
Overview
 
We consider Annamycin to be a "next generation" anthracycline, unlike any currently approved anthracyclines, as it is designed to avoid multidrug resistance mechanisms and cardiotoxicity (the efficacy of all currently approved anthracyclines is limited by both multidrug resistance and cardiotoxicity). Our preclinical studies support this intended design and, to date, we have demonstrated no signs of cardiotoxicity in our three Phase 1 clinical trials utilizing Annamycin as assessed, as recently as January 2022, by an expert in cardiotoxicity associated with chemotherapy at the Cleveland Clinic. Additionally, we reported from our clinical trials evidence that Annamycin may have a substantially lower incidence of alopecia (hair loss) than currently prescribed anthracyclines such as doxorubicin.
 
    6 

  

The FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) to Annamycin for the treatment of AML and for soft tissue sarcomas, which means the agency believes we have established a medically plausible basis for using the drug for those indications. Additionally, Fast Track Designation was also granted by the FDA for Annamycin for both the treatment of AML and STS lung metastases. A drug that receives Fast Track designation is eligible for some or all of the following:
 

• | More frequent meetings with FDA to discuss the drug's development plan and ensure collection of appropriate data needed to support drug approval; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | More frequent written communication from FDA about such things as the design of the proposed clinical trials and use of biomarkers; 
• | Eligibility for other FDA expedited programs, if relevant criteria are met; and 
• | New Drug Application (NDA) for review by FDA, rather than waiting until every section of the NDA is completed before the entire application can be reviewed. NDA review usually does not begin until the sponsor has submitted the entire application to the FDA

 
A Phase 1 clinical trial of Annamycin as a single agent for the treatment of relapsed and refractory (R/R) AML in the US was successfully concluded in 2020. The FDA requested that we demonstrate that Annamycin could be safely administered to subjects up to the lifetime maximum allowable level of anthracycline (LTMAD) established by the FDA and the trial met this primary endpoint. The FDA established the LTMAD because of concerns about cardiotoxicity associated with currently approved anthracyclines when administered above the LTMAD. An updated independent safety review in early 2022 of certain preliminary data of the first 30 subjects in our three Annamycin clinical trials (treating both AML and STS lung metastases) concluded there was no evidence of cardiotoxicity. 19 of the 30 subjects evaluated had been treated above the LTMAD and none have shown evidence of any cardiotoxicity.
 
As a result of discussions with the FDA, we focused our continuing efforts on establishing an RP2D for Annamycin in our Phase 1/2 single agent R/R AML clinical trial Europe, which was ongoing throughout 2021. In February 2022, we successfully concluded the Phase 1 portion of that trial and established the RP2D of 240 mg/m2. In that trial we continue to demonstrate no signs in cardiotoxicity in subjects treated. In the final cohort, five subjects received a full course of Annamycin and demonstrated an ORR of 60% with two partial responses (PRs) and one complete response with incomplete recovery of neutrophils and/or platelets (CRi). In light of recent preclinical research suggesting that the combination of Annamycin with Cytarabine (AnnAraC) may be more effective for R/R AML patients than Annamycin as a single agent, we have elected to begin the process of commencing a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in Europe evaluating AnnAraC rather than to expend resources on the expansion (Phase 2) arm of the single agent trial. These preclinical animal studies showed that AnnAraC was 68% more effective (median overall survival or OS) than Annamycin as a single agent and 241% more effective than Cytarabine (also known as Ara-C) alone.
 
Accordingly, we filed a CTA with the URPL in Poland in November 2021 for a Phase 1/2 trial treating AML with AnnAraC and received approval in December 2021 from the Bioethics Committee of the Medical University of Karol Marcinkiewicz in Poznań (Ethics Committee). We are in correspondence with the URPL and expect to receive their approval and to begin this trial in the first half of 2022. We can provide no assurance that such approval will be received.
 
We received clearance from the FDA to proceed with a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of Annamycin as a potential treatment for soft tissue sarcomas (STS) metastasized to the lungs. Our preclinical work on Annamycin demonstrated activity against certain cancers (including STS) metastasized to the lungs. In December 2020, the FDA allowed our IND to go into effect to study Annamycin for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma lung metastases. This allowed us to begin a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in the US for patients with STS lung metastases after first-line therapy for their disease. The trial began in the first half of 2021. In December 2021, we reported preliminary interim results from this clinical trial as we concluded the safety review of the third cohort and opened the fourth cohort in a dose escalation trial, which continues to document preliminary clinical activity for this drug. We are currently in the fourth cohort and have expanded the cohort due to a dose limiting toxicity (DLT). The first three subjects in this cohort preliminarily exhibited stable disease per the protocol after two cycles and continued in the study. Due to the DLT, the fourth cohort is being expanded to enroll an additional three subjects at this dose level. In the absence of any additional DLTs at this dose level, we have the option to continue escalation to explore the fifth cohort at 450 mg/m2 dose level or to declare the RP2D to be 390 mg/m2.
 
Additionally, we announced in February 2021 promising preclinical studies involving Annamycin targeting osteosarcoma metastasized to the lungs. Via our sponsored research, we plan to further investigate the treatment of other cancer metastases and other cancers such as liver, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers among others.
 
Prior Development 
 
We took over the development of Annamycin after two prior drug development companies, Callisto Pharmaceuticals and Aronex Pharmaceuticals, ceased development work for various clinical and business reasons, leading to the termination of their INDs by the FDA. The basis for our decision to proceed notwithstanding the most recent prior developer’s abandoning the project is that we believed the actual clinical data as reported by Dr. Robert Shepard, our Chief Medical Officer and the prior developer’s Chief Medical Officer at the time of the clinical trials, to the 2009 Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), and as further reported by the Principal Investigators of the clinical trials in a peer-reviewed journal article (Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2013 August; 13(4): 430-434. doi:10.1016/j.clml.2013.03.015.), supported further clinical evaluation. In addition, the conclusion published in the 2013 Clinical Lymphoma, Myeloma & Leukemia Journal article was that “Single agent nanomolecular liposomal annamycin appears to be well-tolerated and (demonstrates) evidence of clinical activity as a single agent in refractory adult ALL.” As reported in both the ASCO presentation and the 2013 journal article referenced, the definition of efficacy is based on the following Response Criteria: “Response criteria were achievement of CR defined as ≤5% blasts, granulocyte count of ≥1×109/L, and a platelet count of ≥100×109/L. Partial remission was defined the same as CR, except for the presence of 6% to 25% blasts. Hematologic improvement was defined as for CR but platelet count of ≥1×109/L.” The summary of subject response from the 2013 journal article reads: “After determining the MTD, a 10-patient phase IIA was conducted. Eight of the patients completed one cycle of the three days of treatment at the MTD. Of these, five (62%) demonstrated encouraging anti-leukemic activity with complete clearing of circulating peripheral blasts. Three of these subjects also cleared bone marrow blasts with one subsequently proceeding onto successful stem cell transplantation. The other two subjects developed tumor lysis syndrome and unfortunately expired prior to response assessment.” In our review of these trials, we confirmed that the activity demonstrated in this summary corresponds with a “Partial Remission” as described in the Response Criteria and that the three subjects who “cleared bone marrow blasts” correspond with “CR” (Complete Response).
 
The Callisto trial was the second trial to study Annamycin in acute leukemia. The first trial was sponsored by Aronex Pharmaceuticals. When Callisto acquired the technology and made changes in manufacturing methods, they had to conduct another Phase 1 dose ranging trial. Both trials yielded some human activity with Annamycin in AML but at different MTDs. We believe the different MTDs were due to subtle differences in the manufacturing and reconstitution processes of Aronex and Callisto, mainly regarding liposomes.
 
The production of liposome formulated anthracyclines is very sensitive to subtle changes in production method and starting materials. It is partly for this reason that, more than 10 years later and with entirely new contractors, we had to run additional Phase 1 dose ranging studies and the technology we assisted in developing yielded additional new patent applications for formulation and reconstitution of Annamycin.

The Importance of No Cardiotoxicity 
 
We have received multiple reports from an independent expert cardiology assessment and the last such report in January 2022 continued to confirm the absence of any cardiotoxicity relating to treatment with Annamycin in our three Phase 1 clinical trials to date. That report updated the independent safety review of certain preliminary data for the first 30 subjects in our clinical trials in the US and Europe with Annamycin targeting AML and the STS lung metastases which concluded there was no evidence of cardiotoxicity. The review included analysis of ejection fraction, echo strain and certain troponin levels intended to assess the potential for both acute and chronic heart damage. Additionally, we reported evidence that Annamycin may have a substantially lower incidence of alopecia (hair loss) than currently prescribed anthracyclines such as doxorubicin. Although 65%-92% of subjects treated with doxorubicin typically experience hair loss, the incidence to date in subjects treated with Annamycin is less than 10% (Gonzalez et al. 2018; DOXORUBICIN HYDROCHLORIDE -package insert. New York, NJ: Pfizer Injectables; 2019). Alopecia is considered an important factor in quality of life for many cancer patients.
 
Chemotherapy continues to be a cornerstone of cancer therapy. Despite the progress made with immunotherapy and precision medicine, the first-line treatment for many cancers continues to include chemotherapy. And, in part because of the emphasis placed on alternatives to chemotherapy, we believe that not enough has been done to improve chemotherapeutic agents to make them safer, especially with regard to cardiotoxicity (damage to the heart), and more effective. Anthracyclines are a class of chemotherapy drugs designed to destroy the DNA (by creating iron-mediated free oxygen radicals, damaging the DNA and cell membranes, and inhibiting topoisomerase II) of rapidly producing cancer cells. Acute leukemia is one of a number of cancers that are usually treated with anthracyclines. In the case of acute leukemia, anthracyclines are typically used in “induction therapy,” where the goal is often to induce sufficient remission of patients’ blood-born tumor cells to allow for a potentially curative bone marrow transplant.
 
Two key factors limit the safety and effectiveness of anthracyclines: cardiotoxicity and multidrug resistance. We believe Annamycin may significantly reduce the impact of these two factors. If early human data from the clinical activity thus far are borne out, of which there can be no assurance, Annamycin may ultimately provide clinically meaningful benefits over currently approved anthracyclines in treating certain cancers. Preliminary data from very early-stage clinical trials suggest acute leukemia as a potentially opportune indication in which to further study Annamycin.
 
One of the key dose-limiting toxicities associated with currently available anthracyclines (including the anthracycline in the approved drug, Vyxeos) is the propensity to induce life-threatening heart damage (also known as cardiotoxicity). This is a particularly significant risk for pediatric leukemia patients, whose life spans can be severely shortened by the induction therapy intended to cure them of acute leukemia. In the animal model recommended by the FDA as an indicator of human cardiotoxicity, the non-liposomal (free) form of Annamycin has been shown to be significantly less likely than doxorubicin to create heart lesions in mice, and the liposomal formulation (L-Annamycin) has been shown in these same models to have reduced cardiotoxicity to the point where it is unlikely to cause harm to human patients. If this same characteristic continues to be shown in humans, it may allow Annamycin to be used more aggressively to help patients achieve remission. This would be especially valuable in the case of pediatric acute leukemia (both AML and ALL) because of the potential impact of cardiotoxicity on long-term survival. In our clinical trials for Annamycin, we are collecting data to further validate the design intent of Annamycin to have little or no cardiotoxicity. Unless otherwise noted, all of our references to Annamycin refer to the liposomal form (L-Annamycin).
 
In addition, the effectiveness of currently approved anthracyclines is limited by their propensity for succumbing to “multidrug resistance.” This can occur where, as a natural defense mechanism, transmembrane proteins acting as transporters (one type of which is referred to as a “P-glycoprotein pump” or “ABCB1 transporter”) develop on the outer surface of cells to expel perceived threats like anthracyclines. In many instances, the likelihood of cardiotoxicity (and other serious side effects) prevents increasing the dosing of current therapies in order to overcome multidrug resistance. As a result, most patients cannot receive current anthracyclines in doses that are adequate to produce lasting remission and thereby qualify for a bone marrow transplant. A laboratory study has suggested that Annamycin may resist being expelled by P-glycoprotein pumps and similar multidrug resistance transporters, which may mean the drug circumvents multidrug resistance. This characteristic has been shown in pre-clinical testing to allow for higher drug uptake in diseased cells, which we believe could allow for more effective induction therapy with less risk to the patient, especially in relapsed patients.
 
Annamycin as a Single Agent in AML
 
The prior development history of Annamycin in acute leukemia suggested that a possible approval pathway exists by positioning Annamycin as a single agent for the treatment of R/R AML. Notwithstanding the recent approval of multiple drugs for this indication, most of these drugs are targeted therapies that are helpful to only a small percentage of the overall AML patient population. A significant unmet need still exists for those patients that are refractory to or relapse from the traditional first-line induction therapy (known as “7+3”) designed to induce remission of AML and, in some cases, prepare patients for a curative bone marrow transplant. Unfortunately, the majority of AML patients do not respond adequately to the current first-line therapies. In addition, approximately 40% of AML patients are deemed “unfit” for 7+3 due to the intensity of this chemotherapy. We estimate that a significant portion of those patients are deemed unfit because of the potential for cardiotoxicity inherent in the anthracyclines currently used in 7+3. Given its lack of cardiotoxicity, single agent Annamycin may also provide a viable treatment alternative for such patients. Hence our initial clinical trials in R/R AML, as discussed more fully below, were focused on Annamycin as a single agent, and establishing an RP2D, which we were able to establish in early 2022.
 
Annamycin in Combination with Cytarabine (also known as Ara-C) in AML
 
As a part of our ongoing sponsored research at MD Anderson, animal testing has indicated that the combination of Annamycin with Ara-C (AnnAraC) provides a synergistic effect that is more effective in AML mouse models than either drug alone. These data were presented at the 62nd Annual Meeting & Exposition of the American Society for Hematology (ASH) under the title: "High Efficacy of Liposomal Annamycin (L-ANN) in Combination with Cytarabine in Syngeneic p53-null AML Mouse Model."
 
This study was conducted in a highly aggressive AML mouse model where median survival is approximately 13 days. For animals treated with AnnAraC, median survival ranged from 56 to 76 days, thus expanding median survival by 585%, with some animals, after treatment, having no signs of any tumors. Additionally, when looking at median overall survival (OS), AnnAraC demonstrated a 68% improvement in the OS compared to Annamycin as a single agent and a 241% increase in OS compared to Cytarabine alone. We believe these experiments support initiation of clinical development of the combination of Annamycin and Ara-C in AML patients.

Although Annamycin has already shown human activity as a single agent in its two Phase 1 AML clinical trials and has shown no signs of cardiotoxicity, the observed synergy in vitro and confirmatory in vivo data suggest that the combination of Annamycin and Ara-C could be more effective in a clinical setting than Annamycin as a single agent. This would be consistent with current practice to use Ara-C in combination with an anthracycline like Annamycin. The current first-line therapy for AML patients is the combination of an anthracycline and Ara-C in a regimen referred to as "7+3" where Ara-C is administered daily for 7 days in parallel with 3 daily doses of an anthracycline. Simply substituting the currently used anthracycline in a similar 7+3 regimen with Annamycin would represent a familiar and well-practiced treatment modality. Beyond that, we believe it would have the added advantages that Annamycin has been shown in published research to be active against tumor cells resistant to doxorubicin and, importantly, has the potential to remove the concern for cardiotoxicity, a significant toxic side effect of currently used anthracyclines. Thus, we are now focusing our efforts on an AnnAraC trial for the treatment of AML in Europe in the first half of 2022.
 
Annamycin as a Single Agent in STS Lung Metastases
 
We announced in April 2019 that our ongoing sponsored research at MD Anderson demonstrated that Annamycin can significantly improve survival in an aggressive form of triple negative breast cancer metastasized to the lungs in animal models. We know that Annamycin was previously shown to be significantly more potent than doxorubicin in both Lewis lung carcinoma in vivo and small cell lung cancer in vitro models. In addition to seeing activity in animal models of triple negative breast cancer metastasized to the lungs, we are also seeing activity in colon cancer metastasized to the lungs. The particular animal models used in our testing are considered to represent very aggressive forms of cancer.
 
Furthermore, a poster entitled, "Liposomal annamycin inhibition of lung localized breast cancer," was presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium held in December 2019. The published poster (https://www.moleculin.com/san-antonio-bc-symposium-poster/) shows substantially increased survival in both triple negative breast cancer and colon cancer lung metastases animal models. It should also be noted that treatment with Annamycin resulted in long-term survival of a significant number of animals, even when cancer was reintroduced into the animals post initial treatment, suggesting the development of beneficial immune memory. A reduction in tumor growth was demonstrated as well as a reversal of tumor activity resulting in an almost complete reduction of tumor burden.
 
We announced in early 2021 that Annamycin demonstrated consistently high antitumor activity in vivo in tested animal models of different types of lung-localized cancers, including sarcoma. These promising findings correlate with surprisingly high uptake of Annamycin to the lungs in animal models. We found in our studies that the Annamycin uptake is over 30-fold higher than that of doxorubicin, the primary first-line chemotherapy for soft tissue sarcoma. The limited pulmonary uptake of doxorubicin in animal models may help explain its limited activity against STS lung metastases in humans. Additionally, our clinical data to date show no cardiotoxicity associated with the use of Annamycin, and the published research demonstrate Annamycin’s ability to avoid multidrug resistance mechanisms, both of which are often treatment-limiting effects of anthracyclines (which includes doxorubicin) in this setting. Taken together, these factors suggest that Annamycin could represent an important treatment to help address a significant unmet need in patients with STS lung metastases.
 
In February 2021, we announced that a preclinical study in animals has confirmed a significant therapeutic benefit of Annamycin against metastatic osteosarcoma. As of day 130 of the study, the survival rate for animals treated with Annamycin was 100%, compared with only 10% for untreated animals. Computerized tomography scans demonstrated that animals treated with Annamycin exhibited suppression of tumor growth and not a single death was observed in the treated animals, whereas observed tumor burden was believed to have contributed to the rapid death of 90% of untreated animals. We believe these data are a promising indication of the possibility of Annamycin’s impact on other cancers metastasized to the lungs. We caution that these are preclinical animal data and we can provide no assurance that we will see similar results in our clinical trials.
 
It is estimated that there are approximately 36,000 new cases of STS in the seven major markets (US, EU5 and Japan) each year. Our clinical advisors estimate that approximately half of all STS patients will eventually develop lung metastases from their primary tumor. Although first-line treatments such as surgical resection, chemotherapy and radiation may provide initial therapeutic benefit for approximately one third of those patients, there are no approved or emerging second-line therapies for the remaining patients who relapse or are refractory. Although the lungs tend to be a major site of relapse, when we began our own clinical trial using Annamycin against STS lung metastases, we were aware of only two active clinical trials specifically targeting STS lung metastases, indicating that Annamycin currently faces limited competition in this area of development.
 
Along with the results in STS lung metastases, our animal models have shown activity in other lung metastases, including osteosarcoma, colorectal and triple negative breast cancer, as well as meaningful concentration levels of Annamycin in the liver, spleen and pancreas. Additionally, when tested in a highly aggressive AML mouse model, Annamycin significantly reduced tumor burden in the spleen, lungs and liver, leading to an increase in survival. Based on these promising preclinical data, we believe the ultimate market opportunity for Annamycin could be larger than just STS lung metastases. As such, we may expand our clinical trials into these areas in the near term using externally funded trials. 
 
Clinical Trials for Annamycin

In 2022, we expect there will be three clinical trials ongoing that involve Annamycin for the treatment of R/R AML or STS lung metastases. We recently concluded our Annamycin single agent AML trial in Europe, safely establishing an RP2D, and are now focusing on a European Phase 1/2 AML trial with AnnAraC (combination of Annamycin with Ara-C) which we believe will begin in the first half of 2022. Additionally, our Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in the US for the treatment of STS lung metastases is ongoing, and a third investigator led trial with Annamycin treating STS lung metastases using a different dosing regimen than the US trial should begin in Poland during the second half of 2022. This is in addition to the successfully completed US Phase 1 clinical trial of single agent Annamycin treating R/R AML.
US R/R AML Trial
 
We filed our IND application for a Phase 1/2 trial in the US with Annamycin for the treatment of R/R AML, with the clinical strategy of increasing the prior developers’ MTD mentioned above, in February 2017, which was allowed in September 2017. The FDA required us to limit dosages to subjects to a lifetime maximum anthracycline exposure of 550 mg/m2 in this trial which in effect limited the maximum dose in our trial to 120 mg/m2. Subject treatment began in the US in March 2018. In February 2020, we announced that our open label, single arm US Phase 1 portion of a Phase 1/2 trial had concluded its second cohort and met its primary objective of demonstrating the safety of Annamycin in treating relapsed or refractory AML. At that time, we received an independent expert cardiology assessment confirming the absence of cardiotoxicity in the first 19 subjects treated with Annamycin in both our US and European Phase 1 clinical trials.
 
    9 

  

The FDA requested that we demonstrate that Annamycin could be safely administered to subjects up to the lifetime maximum allowable level of anthracycline (LTMAD) established by the FDA and the trial met this primary endpoint. The FDA established the LTMAD because of concerns about cardiotoxicity associated with currently approved anthracyclines when administered above the LTMAD. An updated independent safety review in early 2022 of certain preliminary data of the first 30 subjects in our three Annamycin clinical trials concluded there was no evidence of cardiotoxicity. Importantly, 19 of the 30 subjects evaluated were treated above the LTMAD. As stated in our CSR, one of seven (or 14.3%) subjects achieved a morphological leukemia-free state (MLFS). MLFS is defined as <5% blasts in the bone marrow with no blasts with Auer rods and no extramedullary disease. This was at what we viewed as a subtherapeutic dose level when compared to MB-105. As a result of discussions with the FDA, we focused on establishing an RP2D in our single agent R/R AML trial in Europe (discussed below), which we have recently announced, and, as requested by the FDA, we continue to generate additional safety and efficacy data prior to considering continuation of our US R/R AML trial.
 
European R/R AML Trial
 
In August 2017, we met with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to discuss a CTA (Clinical Trial Authorization) in Europe for the study of Annamycin for the treatment of R/R AML. In December 2017, the Ethics Committee in Poland approved our Phase 1/2 trial of Annamycin for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML. A final approval was required by the Polish National Office which was received in June 2018. This enabled our Phase 1/2 clinical trial there to study Annamycin for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML to begin. The EMA did not impose a lifetime maximum anthracycline exposure limit in this trial.
 
In the final cohort of this trial, subjects were treated at 240 mg/m2. Two subjects were preliminarily reported to have DLT events which were later classified as adverse events (AEs) following a review by the Safety Review Committee of the protocol DLT definitions. However due to the preliminary DLT designation at the time, the cohort was expanded and eventually enrolled a total of eight subjects, with five receiving the full course of Annamycin. An amendment to the Annamycin clinical trial protocol allowed for a change in the DLT criteria as it relates to transient grade 3 elevations and allowed dosing of three additional subjects in the 240 mg/m2 cohort. Of the eight subjects that were dosed three subjects experienced AEs or SAEs. One fully resolved and another resolved to a grade 2 in the same day. One subject treated experienced an SAE (grade 2 infusion reaction) not currently listed in the investigator brochure (IB) therefore this is a Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) that required reporting to regulatory bodies, which was done. In this cohort the eight subjects received an average of approximately seven prior regimens, representing heavily treated subjects.
 
Of the five receiving a full course of Annamycin at 240 mg/m2, a 60% ORR was experienced with two PRs and one CRi. Coupling these data with the preclinical animal studies showing AnnAraC having greater efficacy than Annamycin or Cytarabine alone, as mentioned above, we established 240 mg/m2 as the RP2D for this trial and switched our focus to initiating the combination study. We also continued to see no signs of cardiotoxicity with all but three subjects having been reviewed by the expert, as mentioned above. These last three subjects will be included in future updated reviews by the expert. With these data we successfully concluded the Phase 1 portion of this trial in February of 2022 and will now focus on treating AML utilizing AnnAraC, as discussed more fully below.
 
While this will establish an RP2D for Annamycin in this single agent AML trial and will assist in establishing the starting dose in our planned trial using AnnAraC in treating AML, we do not believe it will limit the dose escalation in either the AnnAraC or STS trials, which are both discussed in more detail below.
 
Plans for a Phase 1/2 Trial of AnnAraC in AML in Europe
 
Based on the preclinical data discussed above, we are preparing to start a new clinical trial for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML with the combination of Annamycin with Ara-C. We expect this clinical trial to begin in the first half of 2022. We intend for our planned study of AnnAraC in AML to have a similar trial design to the recently concluded Phase 1/2 study of Annamycin as a single agent in AML. We believe safety data from our current single agent trial will enable us to begin the combination trial at a higher starting dose of Annamycin in the Phase 1 portion that our starting does in our monotherapy AML trial.
 
As part of these plans in 2021, we filed a CTA in Poland for a Phase 1/2 trial treating AML with a combination of Annamycin and Cytarabine (AnnAraC) and received approval in December 2021 from the Bioethics Committee of the Medical University of Karol Marcinkiewicz in Poznań (Ethics Committee) and we expect allowance from the URPL in time to begin this trial in the first half of 2022. However, we cannot provide assurance that such approval will be received. This trial builds on the safety and dosage data from the two prior single agent Annamycin AML Phase 1 trials in the US and Europe that have been successfully concluded. We also utilized preclinical animal data from our sponsored research conducted simultaneous with our clinical trials to support this new combination trial. In that animal study Annamycin in combination with Cytarabine demonstrated a 68% improvement in the median overall survival (OS) compared to Annamycin as a single agent and a 241% increase in OS compared to Cytarabine alone.
 
Study Design for R/R AML - 
 
We have been studying Annamycin in both the US and Europe in Phase 1/2 open label, single arm clinical trials to assess the safety and efficacy of Annamycin as a single agent for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory AML. The US and European trials had essentially the same study design, consisting of a Phase 1 intended to establish a "Recommended Phase 2 Dose" (RP2D), to which the studies may then proceed in the Phase 2 portion. The Phase 1 portion of the studies provided for escalating doses in cohorts of 3 subjects each, with each successive cohort receiving the next higher dose level until "dose limiting toxicities" prevent further increases. Cohorts 1, 2, 3 and 4 in Europe received a dose of 120, 150, 180 and 210 mg/m2, respectively, and the results allowed us to advance to Cohort 5 with dosing at 240 mg/m2. Refer to the discussion above for an update on this trial.
 
Cohort 1 in the US started at 100 mg/m2, and the results supported moving to Cohort 2 at 120 mg/m2, which has now been fully recruited, treated, and evaluated. Our US Phase 1 trial met its primary endpoint, demonstrating the safety of Annamycin in treating AML when delivered to subjects at or below the lifetime maximum anthracycline dose established by the FDA. The primary safety signal was the absence of cardiotoxicity, a serious and often treatment-limiting issue prevalent with currently approved anthracyclines. The European trial benefited from a more aggressive dose escalation scheme than was allowed in the US trial and, as a result, reached higher dose levels.

We have been and intend to continue reporting top-line results by cohort in all of our Annamycin clinical trials, with each announcement also including an update on any other related trials. Top-line results will include reporting of any drug-related adverse events (AEs) and assessment of cardiotoxicity, including ECHO (echocardiogram) or MUGA (MUGA stands for multiple-gated acquisition and is also known as radionuclide ventriculography (RVG, RNV) or radionuclide angiography (RNA); it is a type of nuclear imaging test intended to show how well the heart is pumping) scans measuring change in ejection fraction and measuring certain blood troponin levels, which is considered a biomarker for potential long-term cardiovascular impairment. Top-line results will also include the number of partial responses (PRs), complete responses (CRs) and subjects deemed capable of progressing to a potentially curative bone marrow transplant, which we term "bridge to transplant" (BTs), each of which is essentially a function of the magnitude of reduction in a subject's bone marrow blasts. For purposes of these clinical trials, a CR means that the subject's bone marrow blasts reduced to 5% or less (with CRi meaning a CR where there was incomplete recovery of white blood cell and/or platelet counts), a PR means the subject's bone marrow blasts reduced by 50% and resulted in a blast count of 25% or less, and a BT means subjects are deemed capable of progressing to a potentially curative bone marrow transplant.
 
Safety of Annamycin in R/R AML Subjects - 
 
Our US Phase 1 trial met its primary endpoint, demonstrating the safety of Annamycin in treating R/R AML when delivered to subjects at or below the lifetime maximum anthracycline dose established by the FDA. The primary safety signal was the absence of cardiotoxicity, a serious and often treatment-limiting issue prevalent with currently approved anthracyclines. Additionally, we recently concluded our European R/R AML trial, as discussed above, and not only set an RP2D but also met the trial’s primary safety signal with the absence of cardiotoxicity. As discussed above, this was determined by echocardiograms, as well as cardiac health biomarkers, principally certain blood troponin levels, which are considered an indicator of potential long-term heart damage. The data showed no cardiotoxicity in all of the subjects evaluated in the both Phase 1 trials.
 
An updated independent safety review in early 2022 of certain preliminary data of the first 30 subjects in our three Annamycin Phase 1 clinical trials, which again concluded there was no evidence of cardiotoxicity. Importantly, 19 of the 30 subjects have been treated above the LTMAD.
 
Compared to previous studies of other anthracyclines, we believe this is an important event. For example, a review published in Cardiovascular Drugs and Therapy (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5346598/) reported that 65% of patients who received the equivalent of 550 mg/m2 of doxorubicin (a current standard of care anthracycline) exhibited sub-clinical cardiotoxicity, defined as a reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction >10% points to a value <50%. In the 5 subjects mentioned above who were treated in our European trial above 550 mg/m2, no evidence of cardiotoxicity was detected. The same published review also suggested that a better long-term indicator of cardiotoxicity may be the measurement of an increase in a biomarker called troponin. When measured as an early biomarker of cancer therapy-related cardiotoxicity, troponin rise occurs consistently in 21% - 40% of patients after treatment with current standard of care anthracycline chemotherapy and, per the published review, such an increase in troponin is associated with an increased risk of heart disease later in life. Overall, some form of cardiotoxicity, short-term or long-term, occurs in 65% of such patients. Of the 30 subjects treated thus far in all three of our Annamycin clinical trials and where safety has been assessed, none has shown a clinically significant increase in troponin levels, again supporting the absence of cardiotoxicity. As previously noted, although these data are, in our view, promising, there remains significant additional clinical investigation to be done, and there can be no guarantee of the future results. 
 
US STS Lung Metastases Trials
 
Our preclinical work on Annamycin demonstrated activity against certain cancers metastasized to the lungs, including soft tissue sarcoma (STS), osteosarcoma and triple negative breast cancer. In December 2020, we disclosed that the FDA allowed our IND to go into effect to study Annamycin for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma lung metastases. This allowed us to begin a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in the US for subjects with this indication after first-line therapy for their disease. This trial began in June of 2021. We also disclosed in December 2020 that the FDA had granted ODD to Annamycin for the treatment of soft tissue sarcomas, in addition to the existing ODD for Annamycin in relapsed or refractory AML.
 
Also, in December 2021, we reported preliminary interim results from our US Phase 1b/2 clinical trial as we concluded the safety review of the third cohort and opened the fourth cohort in the dose escalation portion of trial, which continues to document preliminary human activity for this drug. The Phase 1b/2 study is a US multi-center, open-label, single-arm study that in Phase 1b will determine the MTD and/or the RP2D and safety of Annamycin. The Phase 2 portion of the study will explore the efficacy of Annamycin as a single agent at the RP2D for the treatment of subjects with STS with lung metastases for whom prior chemotherapy has failed, and for whom new chemotherapy is considered appropriate. A minimum of three subjects will be enrolled in each cohort of the Phase 1b portion of the study until an MTD is identified, after which there will be a determination of the RP2D based on an assessment of both safety and efficacy. Up to 25 subjects will be enrolled at the RP2D in Phase 2 to further evaluate efficacy.
 
Three of the six subjects in the first two cohorts reached four or more months with stable disease or better. In a patient population where the median progression free survival time in patients with soft tissue sarcoma with metastases that have failed initial systemic therapy is approximately 1.6 to 2.0 months, without effective therapy which includes subjects treated with a placebo. (A. Comandone, F. Petrelli, A Boglione, S. Barn: Salvage Therapy in Advanced Adult Soft Tissue Sarcoma. The Oncologist 2017;22:1518–1527), we believe Annamycin has the potential to bring a new and effective treatment option to patients with this significant unmet need. We are also encouraged by the pace of recruitment to date for this trial.
 
The summary of interim data from the first four cohorts of the study are as follows:
 
First Cohort (210 mg/m2):
 

• | Two subjects had stable disease up to 6 cycles (4.5 months) but were then discontinued due to progressive disease. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | One subject discontinued after the first cycle. The end of study scan was performed, and stable disease was observed. However, the subject discontinued from the study because the initiation of the second cycle was delayed greater than 6 weeks from the previous dose.

 
    11 

  

Second Cohort (270 mg/m2):
 

• | In one subject, the scan at the end of the second cycle showed that there was a partial response (PR, >30% reduction in tumor size), and this was stable when the subject was scanned at the end of cycle 4. The subject subsequently discontinued from the study due to that subject electing to undergo surgical resection to potentially eradicate disease.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | One subject was discontinued from the study after 2 cycles after the end of cycle 2 scan revealed progressive disease. 
• | One subject received 1 cycle of treatment but discontinued treatment for reasons unrelated to Annamycin. The end of study scan revealed progressive disease. 

Third Cohort (330 mg/m2):
 

• | One subject discontinued after the first cycle. An interim, unscheduled scan revealed progressive disease and the subject was discontinued from the study. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | One subject was discontinued from the study after 2 cycles as a scan after the end of cycle 2 revealed progressive disease. 
• | One subject received 2 cycles and end of cycle 2 scans showed stable disease. However, subject withdrew consent from the study to pursue local standard of care.

Fourth Cohort (390 mg/m2):
 
Efficacy data for the fourth cohort are incomplete as not all subjects have received their scans.
 

• | One subject received 2 cycles and end of Cycle 2 scans showed Stable Disease. The subject currently continues on study with Cycle 3. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | One subject is currently in Cycle 2. This subject experienced a DLT of febrile neutropenia. It did resolve and the subject continued in the study. End of Cycle 2 scans showed Stable Disease. The subject currently continues on study with Cycle 3.
• | One subject received 2 cycles and end of Cycle 2 scans showed Stable Disease. The subject currently continues on study with Cycle 3. 

 
The statements above are based on interim data and should be considered preliminary and subject to change.
 
We have now completed initial enrollment in the fourth cohort of the Phase 1b portion of the study with dosing increased to 390 mg/m2 and expect to announce that cohort’s full preliminary results in the near term. Due to the DLT noted above, the fourth cohort is being expanded to enroll an additional three subjects at this dose level. In the absence of any additional DLTs at this dose level, we have the option to continue escalation to explore the fifth cohort at 450 mg/m2 dose level or to declare the RP2D to be 390 mg/m2. If a second DLT occurs at the 390mg/m2 dose level, three subjects may be enrolled into one additional dose level at 360mg/m2 to confirm the MTD/RP2D. If the fifth cohort is deemed safe, we may continue to escalate until an MTD is reached. Therefore, up to twenty-one subjects or more may be enrolled in the Phase 1b portion of the study, unless a determination is made to add additional cohorts beyond the fifth cohort or we establish an RP2D.
 
We are also collaborating with WPD and physicians in Poland and are currently pursuing a physician-sponsored clinical trial in Europe. WPD announced their facilitation of a grant equivalent to $1.5 million USD to the Maria Sklodowska-Curie National Research Institute to fund a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of Annamycin for the treatment of STS lung metastases. The grant-funded clinical trial will be led by Prof. Piotr Rutkowski, MD, PhD, Head of Department of Soft Tissue/Bone Sarcoma and Melanoma at the Maria Sklodowska-Curie National Research Institute of Oncology in Warsaw, Poland, and it will be operated independently of our study in the US. The trial will use a dosing regimen of once per week rather than once every 21 days as in the US trial. We expect this trial to begin in 2022.
 
US STS Lung Metastases Trial - Study Design
 
In Phase 1b, Annamycin is administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion over 2 hours on Day 1, followed by 20 days off (1 cycle = 21 days). Subjects visit the study site every 21 days (±3 days) at which time safety monitoring, including adverse events (AEs), a physical examination, laboratory evaluations (clinical chemistry, complete blood count), vital signs, weight measurements, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, and electrocardiograms (ECGs) are performed, followed by an IV infusion of study drug. Cardiac function is followed by echocardiogram (ECHO) scans at screening, at the end of the first two cycles and then every other cycle thereafter, at the end of treatment visit, and if feasible, during follow up at 6 months (±1 month) and 1 year (±1 month) after study drug discontinuation. As long as the Investigator considers that the benefits of treatment with Annamycin continue to outweigh the risks, treatment will continue every 21 days until tumor progression is observed or unacceptable toxicity occurs.
 
Tumor response is monitored every 6 weeks (±1 week) from Cycle 1 Day 1 during treatment, at the End of Treatment visit, and then every 3 months (±1 month) until disease progression using RECIST 1.1 criteria. Those subjects who leave the study after a maximum response is achieved and who do not start another therapy will be followed every 3 months (±1 month) for progression-free survival (PFS). If a subject receives further therapy after discontinuing from the study, they will only be followed for overall survival (OS) and if feasible, follow-up ECHO scans at 6 months (±1 month) and 1 year (±1 month) will be conducted after study drug discontinuation.
 
The WP1066 Portfolio Program
 
We have a license agreement with MD Anderson pursuant to which we have been granted a royalty-bearing, worldwide, exclusive license for the patent and technology rights related to our WP1066 Portfolio and its close analogs, molecules targeting the modulation of key oncogenic transcription factors. In 2019, the FDA granted ODD for WP1066 for the treatment of glioblastoma, which means the agency believes we have established a medically plausible basis for using the drug to treat glioblastoma.
 
We believe our WP1066 Portfolio (including lead drug candidates WP1066 and WP1220) we believe, represents a novel class of agents capable of hitting multiple targets, including the activated form of a key oncogenic transcription factor, STAT3. A substantial body of published research has identified STAT3 as a master regulator of a wide range of tumors and has linked the activated form, p-STAT3, with the survival and progression of these tumors. For this reason, it is believed that targeted inhibition of p-STAT3 may be an effective way to reduce or eliminate the progression of these diseases. During 2021, we have been working on developing an appropriate IV formulation for WP1066 or its analogs. As a result of these studies, we believe that the lead molecule WP1066 may be our best candidate for intravenous administration and efforts to identify and optimize the best strategy for IV delivery are currently underway. Additionally, we determined that the stability of WP1732, another molecule in the WP1066 Portfolio was less than satisfactory and, as such, in March 2021 we terminated our license for WP1732 with MD Anderson.

The high level of anticancer activity demonstrated in multiple tumors in animal models by WP1066 is potentially related to its ability to also inhibit such important key oncogenic transcription factors such as c-Myc and HIF-1α. In addition to direct anticancer effects not related to the function of the immune system, our lead drug candidate WP1066 has also been shown to boost immune response in animals, in part by inhibiting activity of TRegs, which are coopted by tumors to evade the immune system. We believe the dual effect of (1) directly inhibiting tumor growth and inducing tumor cell death and (2) separately boosting and directing the natural immune response to tumors is therapeutically promising. If additional preclinical and clinical data validate these two avenues of apparent activity, this class of drugs may be well-suited to treat a wide range of tumors, both as single agents and as critical elements of successful combination therapies targeting even some of the most difficult-to-treat cancers.
 
The recent oncology drug landscape has been dominated by immunotherapy, specifically including checkpoint inhibitors. In the last 5 years, checkpoint inhibitors (such as Opdivo and Keytruda) have reached over $10 billion in annual revenues. To summarize checkpoint blockade therapy, the T-Cells within an individual’s own immune systems should be capable of identifying tumor cells and destroying them before they destroy the individual. Unfortunately, tumors develop the ability to prevent this natural immune response by regulating the expression of certain receptors referred to as “immune checkpoints” that then bind to T-Cells and prevent them from attacking the tumor. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are antibodies that block these receptor mechanisms and allow the T-Cells to act normally and attack the tumor. 
 
In certain types of tumors, like melanoma, checkpoint inhibitors work well, and the results can be impressive, creating durable suppression of tumors where no other therapy had succeeded. However, despite the outstanding results in select patients, checkpoint inhibitors benefit only a limited number of patients in certain cancers, and they are essentially not effective in what are called “non-responsive” tumors like glioblastoma and pancreatic cancer, among others. As a result, companies are now focusing heavily on combination therapies, combining immune checkpoint inhibitors with chemotherapy, as well as other agents. We believe there is a need for new chemotherapeutic agents that, by their specific mechanism of action, would produce potent combination effects with immune checkpoint inhibitors, and that additionally can boost immune system response on their own. In this regard, there is early preclinical evidence that WP1066, as a single agent, may have the ability to reverse immune tolerance in brain tumor patients (Cancer Res, 67(20), 9630, 2007), and preliminary data in animal models that suggests WP1066 may have a potential for combination use with checkpoint inhibitors. We intend to pursue additional study to build on this preclinical evidence and preliminary animal model data.
 
Recently published research papers have presented several findings that may point to new opportunities for our WP1066 class of drugs. One such article suggested that our STAT3 inhibitor WP1066 abrogated PD-L1/2 expression in cancer cells and may be a useful agent in addition to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy in cancer patients (J Clin Exp Hematop, 57(1), 21-25, 2017). Other published results show that CTLA4-induced immune suppression occurs primarily via an intrinsic STAT3 pathway, suggesting that, through its inhibition of activated STAT3, WP1066 might work well in combination with this checkpoint inhibitor (Cancer Res, 77(18), 5118–28, 2017).
 
A separate paper presents selected key transcription factors as being responsible for the upregulation of an often-targeted checkpoint actor in tumors known as PD-L1. Some of the most important transcription factors identified were HIF-1α, c-Myc and STAT3, the very targets for which WP1066 was designed (Front Pharmacol, 2018 May 22, 9:536, doi: 10.3389/ fphar.2018.00536, eCollection 2018).
 
WP1066

WP1066 is our flagship Immune/Transcription Modulator. It has been the subject of over 50 peer-reviewed articles and its activity against p-STAT3 has now been validated in independent labs around the globe. This discovery was inspired by a naturally occurring compound (caffeic acid) in propolis (from honeybees). Caffeic acid has shown a natural ability to inhibit p-STAT3, which is considered a master regulator of inflammatory processes that support tumor survival and proliferation.
 
WP1066 has exhibited an ability to inhibit other key oncogenic transcription factors, including c-Myc and HIF-1α. A critical characteristic of WP1066 and its analogs is the ability to inhibit p-STAT3 independently of upstream cell signaling. We believe this overcomes the limitations of many other drugs designed to inhibit STAT3 activity by blocking upstream receptors.
 
Another important attribute of WP1066 (unlike some of our other Immune/Transcription Modulators) is its apparent ability in pre-clinical testing to cross the blood brain barrier, which we believe makes it a good candidate for potentially treating brain tumors and other malignancies of the central nervous system. WP1066 has shown significant anti-tumor activity and increased survival in a wide range of tumor cell lines and animal models.
 
As with other analogs in this portfolio, WP1066 also has a demonstrated in animal models the ability to boost a natural immune response to tumor activity. In animal models, WP1066 has been shown to upregulate STAT1, a transcription factor associated with immune stimulation. At the same time, it has been shown to reduce levels of Regulatory T-Cells, or TRegs, which are coopted by tumors to protect themselves from attack by the patient’s natural immune system. This forms a unique dual action (directly attacking the transcription factors that support tumor development and separately boosting the natural immune response to tumors) that may make WP1066 uniquely suited to treat a wide range of tumors and may also serve as an important element in combination therapies targeting some of the most difficult cancers.
 
In vitro testing has shown a high level of activity for WP1066 against a wide range of solid tumors, and in vivo testing has shown significant activity against head and neck, pancreatic, stomach, and renal cancers, as well as metastatic melanoma and glioblastoma, among others. In vivo testing in mouse tumor models indicates that WP1066 inhibits tumor growth, blocks angiogenesis (a process that leads to the formation of blood vasculature needed for tumor growth) and increases survival.
 
Our own sponsored research and published findings from independent researchers point to the possibility that administration of WP1066 could lead to improved treatment results in many patients receiving checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Additionally, in April 2019 we announced that preclinical data supporting activity of our STAT3-inhibiting Immune/Transcription Modulators was presented by Dr. Waldemar Priebe, our co-founder and chair of our Scientific Advisory Board, at the 2019 Annual Meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) in Atlanta, GA. The abstract (AACR Abstract: https://www.moleculin.com/inhibition-of-stat3-in-pancreatic-ductal-adenocarcinoma-and-immunotherapeutic-implications/) and the presentation included data resulting from preclinical evaluation in pancreatic cancer models of the STAT3 inhibitor WP1066. In vitro efficacy of this inhibitor was assessed using proliferation and apoptosis induction assays in a panel of patient-derived and commercially available Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell lines. WP1066 was shown to be potent and to induce apoptosis and inhibit p-STAT3 and its nuclear localization in all tested PDAC cell lines. Observed IC50 values ranged from 0.5 to 2 μM. Importantly, WP1066 shows in-vivo efficacy in preliminary experiments when tested alone or in combination with T cell immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Clinical Trials for the WP1066 Portfolio
 
In 2021, two trials were underway with WP1066. The first trial was a physician-sponsored Phase 1 trial of WP1066 in adult subjects with recurrent malignant glioma and brain metastasis from melanoma which the FDA allowed to proceed in December 2017. In July 2018, this trial opened for recruitment in the US. This dose-escalation Phase 1 brain tumor clinical trial via a physician-sponsored IND with MD Anderson Cancer Center has generated pharmacokinetic data for orally dosed WP1066. Those data demonstrated sufficient bioavailability of our drug via oral administration to show the presence of WP1066 in blood plasma on a dose-dependent basis. In early 2021, investigators at MD Anderson began the fourth cohort in the dose escalation phase.
 
In the first quarter of 2021, we were notified that the physician sponsoring the MD Anderson trial was leaving MD Anderson. MD Anderson has chosen to terminate this trial. We are actively pursuing the process to file our own IND for WP1066 so physician sponsored trials can reference our IND, although we can provide no assurance as to when, or if, this filing will be completed. Another physician-sponsored Phase 1 trial is being considered for the treatment of adult GBM with WP1066 in combination with radiation, although no assurances can be given that such trial will begin.
 
In July 2020 we announced that a peer-reviewed article published in Clinical Cancer Research (Clin Cancer Res June 30 2020 DOI:10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-4092) reported findings that WP1066, used in combination with traditional whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) resulted in long-term survivors and enhanced median survival time relative to monotherapy in mice with implanted human brain tumors. The paper can be accessed at: https://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/early/2020/06/30/1078-0432.CCR-19-4092.full-text.pdf
 
The study was performed by lead author Martina Ott, Ph.D., Instructor of Neurosurgery, senior author Amy Heimberger, M.D., professor of Neurosurgery, and a team of researchers at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. In this study, C57BL/6 mice underwent intracerebral implantation of GL261 glioma cells, WBRT, and treatment with WP1066, a blood-brain barrier penetrant inhibitor of the STAT3 pathway, or the two in combination. The role of the immune system was evaluated using tumor rechallenge strategies, immune incompetent backgrounds, immunofluorescence, immune phenotyping of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (via flow cytometry), and nanostring gene expression analysis of 770 immune-related genes from immune cells, including those directly isolated from the tumor microenvironment.
 
The combination of WP1066 and WBRT resulted in long-term survivors and enhanced median survival time relative to monotherapy in the GL261 glioma model (combination vs. control p<0.0001). Immunological memory appeared to be induced, because mice were protected during subsequent tumor rechallenge. The therapeutic effect of the combination was completely lost in immune incompetent animals. Nanostring analysis and immunofluorescence revealed immunological reprogramming in the brain tumor microenvironment specifically affecting dendritic-cell antigen presentation and T cell effector functions. The study indicates that the combination of STAT3 inhibition and WBRT enhances the therapeutic effect against gliomas in the central nervous system by inducing dendritic-cell and T cell interactions in the brain tumor, which seems to be a requirement for a fully functional immune response
 
This study is consistent with preliminary data we announced previously. Importantly, the study indicated the potential that the combination of STAT3 inhibition with whole brain radiotherapy had the capacity to enhance the therapeutic effect against established tumors as well as developing immune memory that appears to prevent recurrence. With this preclinical data, we believe that another physician-sponsored Phase 1 trial could be considered for the treatment of GBM with WP1066 in combination with radiation, although no assurances can be given that such trial will begin.
 
At the 2009 annual meeting of the Society for Neuro Oncology (SNO), Emory University researchers reported encouraging activity in animals with their in vitro pediatric brain tumor models using WP1066. Based on these data, they filed and received clearance to proceed with an IND for a trial to treat children with recurrent or refractory malignant brain tumors with WP1066. This trial is being conducted at the Aflac Cancer & Blood Disorders Center at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta.
 
The Emory trial for pediatric brain tumors has now treated three subjects in the first two cohorts of the Phase 1 dose escalation portion of physician-sponsored clinical trial for the treatment of pediatric brain tumors with WP1066. One subject has been treated in the third cohort at the dose level of 8mg/kg. Two more subjects will be treated at this dose level. Emory University has amended its protocol to allow dosing at 16 mg/kg after these two additional subjects have been dosed, and the third cohort dosing has been deemed safe. In that trial, one of the subjects in the first cohort with DIPG showed an apparent response to the treatment with both clinical improvement and radiologic reduction of tumor size. We caution that these is preliminary data, and no conclusions should be drawn from this single event. 
 
WP1220 
 
An analog of WP1066, referred to as WP1220, was previously the subject of an IND (WP1220 was referred to as “MOL4239” for purposes of this IND) related to use of the molecule in the topical treatment of psoriasis. Clinical trials were commenced on WP1220 in the US but were terminated early due to limited efficacy in the topical treatment of psoriatic plaques. Notwithstanding its limitations in treating psoriasis, our pre-clinical research in multiple CTCL cell lines has suggested that WP1220 may be effective in inhibiting CTCL. Based on these data, we are pursuing discussions with various pharmaceutical companies to further development of this molecule. CTCL is a potentially deadly form of skin cancer for which there are limited treatment options. 
 
Clinical Activity WP1220 – 
 
In August 2019, we completed full enrollment in a proof-of-concept clinical trial in Poland to study WP1220 for the treatment of CTCL. Polish authorities approved our CTA for this use in January 2019, and the trial began enrolling subjects in March 2019. In February 2020, we announced the final data from our CTCL clinical trial of WP1220, which were published and presented by Dr. M. Sokolowska-Wojdylo in conjunction with the 4th Annual World Congress of Cutaneous Lymphomas in Barcelona, Spain on February 13, 2020. The final results supported the safety of topical WP1220 and demonstrated an improvement in the Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Severity (CAILS) score.

Mycosis Fungoides or MF, the most common variant of CTCL, is a disease with symptomatic, disfiguring skin lesions. STAT3, an oncogenic transcription factor, has been identified as a critical regulator of MF, whereby the activation of STAT3 through phosphorylation (p-STAT3) has been linked to tumor proliferation and suppression of immune responses. Preclinical testing demonstrated that WP1220, a synthetic compound, potently inhibits the activity of p-STAT3 and the growth of CTCL cell lines. This Phase 1 study was designed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of WP1220 after topical treatment of CTCL.
 
Of 5 subjects enrolled, 11 lesions were assessed according to the CAILS scoring system. The only related adverse event (AE) was mild contact dermatitis in one subject that the Investigator deemed was not related to the drug. 4 of the 5 subjects improved in CAILS scores on index lesions, with one exhibiting stable disease, with a median reduction of 56% (range 25-94%). 3 of the subjects exhibited a PR. Improvement was noted within 7 days of treatment initiation and maintained 1 month after discontinuation. Of the 11 lesions, 45% exhibited a CR or a 50% or more reduction in CAILS and 55% exhibited stable disease with 100% showing a clinical benefit. Independent dermatologic review based on photographic documentation was conducted and corroborated these findings.
 
Although this was a small proof-of-concept clinical trial, WP1220, topically applied, had no safety issues and appeared to be effective in MF. We believe this is the first demonstration in humans suggesting that inhibition of p-STAT3 with topical therapy has efficacy in CTCL. As a result of this, we continue to actively seek third-party collaborations to begin a Phase 2a/2b trial with approximately 60 subjects.
 
IV Formulation for the WP1066 Portfolio 
 
The topical application WP1220 does not appear to result in systemic exposure to the drug, which is desirable in the case of a topical drug targeting a dermatologic condition, however, WP1066 is currently administered orally with the intent of systemic uptake. Although preliminary data from physician-sponsored brain tumor trials indicate that the oral administration of WP1066 does result in detectable levels of WP1066 in plasma, we believe our opportunity for successful development of a p-STAT3 inhibitor would be expanded if we were able to develop a compound capable of intravenous (IV) administration. In 2020, we began developing IV formulation methods for WP1066 that might address its lack of solubility. We also invested in research to identify molecular analogs that may be more soluble and, therefore, easier to develop for IV administration. Although we intend to continue our work toward a viable IV formulation of WP1066, there can be no assurance that this effort will be successful.
 
The WP1122 Portfolio Program
 
WP1122 Portfolio Program Overview
 
We have a license agreement with MD Anderson pursuant to which we have been granted a royalty-bearing, worldwide, exclusive license for the patent and technology rights related to our WP1122 Portfolio and similar molecules focused on inhibitors of glycolysis and glycosylation. These new compounds are designed to exploit the potential uses of inhibitors of glycolysis such as 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), which we believe may provide an opportunity to stop the fuel supply of tumors by taking advantage of their high level of dependence on glucose in comparison to healthy cells. A key drawback to 2-DG is its lack of drug-like properties, including a short circulation time and poor tissue/organ distribution characteristics. Our lead Metabolism/Glycosylation Inhibitor, WP1122, is a prodrug of 2-DG that appears to improve the drug-like properties of 2-DG by increasing its circulation time and improving tissue/organ distribution. New research also points to the potential for 2-DG to be capable of enhancing the usefulness of checkpoint inhibitors. Considering that we believe 2-DG lacks sufficient drug-like properties to be practical in a clinical setting, we believe WP1122 has the opportunity to become an important drug to potentiate existing therapies.
 
We believe this technology has the potential to target a wide variety of solid tumors, which eventually become resistant to all treatments, and thereby provide a large and important opportunity for novel drugs. Notwithstanding this potential, we are currently focused on the use of WP1122 and related analogs for the treatment of central nervous system malignancies and especially glioblastoma multiforme. Although less prevalent than some larger categories of solid tumors, cancers of the central nervous system are particularly aggressive and resistant to treatment. The prognosis for such patients can be particularly grim and the treatment options available to their physicians are among the most limited of any cancer. The American Cancer Society has estimated 24,530 new cases of brain and other nervous system cancers will occur in the United States in 2021, resulting in 18,600 deaths. Despite the severity and poor prognosis of these tumors, there are few FDA-approved drugs on the market. 
 
Additionally, based on independent preclinical data, we believe that this technology has the potential to impact hard to treat viruses that also rely heavily on glycolysis and glycosylation. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we initiated development of the WP1122 portfolio with preclinical work on WP1122 for the treatment of COVID-19.
 
During 2020, we announced that in vitro testing corroborated the antiviral potential of WP1122, including for the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for COVID-19. Subsequently, we had written communications with the FDA regarding the clinical development of WP1122 for the treatment of COVID-19. Based on guidance from the FDA, we believed that we needed to demonstrate efficacy in a COVID-19 animal model in order to proceed with an IND for COVID-19 clinical trials in the US. At that time, availability of validated COVID-19 animal models was limited. For this reason, we evaluated opportunities to pursue COVID-19 clinical development outside the US. The IND-enabling preclinical work already completed for WP1122 is mostly similar to the preclinical work we originally planned as part of developing WP1122 for cancer indications. Accordingly, we filed and subsequently received clearance for an IND to study WP1122 in GBM as described below.
 
An early 2021 study of 2-DG in COVID-19 subjects was conducted by the Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences (INMAS), a lab of Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO), in collaboration with Dr Reddy's Laboratories (DRL), Hyderabad, India. INMAS-DRDO scientists initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial on 2-DG in COVID-19 subjects in May 2020 during the first wave of the pandemic. This was followed by a Phase 3 study and an approval in May 2021, by Drugs Controller General India (DCGI) for emergency use of 2-DG as an adjunct therapy in subjects with moderate to severe COVID-19.
 

As per the interim available data, the Phase 2 trial reported a median time difference of 2.5 days to achieve normalization of specific vital signs parameters in the 2-DG arm when compared to Standard of Care (SoC). Subsequently, the Phase 3 trial was pursued which showed that a higher proportion of subjects improved symptomatically and became free from supplemental oxygen dependence in the 2-DG arm (42%) when compared to the SoC arm (31%) by the end of day three of treatment. ( Sahu KK, Kumar R. Role of 2-Deoxy-D-Glucose in COVID-19 disease: A potential game-changer. J Family Med Prim Care. 2021;10(10):3548-3552. Doi:10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_1338_21). Given that WP1122 is prodrug of 2-DG designed to improve its circulation time and tissue/organ uptake, we consider this human data regarding 2-DG to be potentially relevant to the potential for WP1122 to be useful in treating COVID-19. The MHRA had access to this and other data in approving our CTA, as discussed below, and did not require an animal testing model.

Clinical Trial for COVID-19 with WP1122
 
On April 6, 2021, we announced the engagement of IQVIA Biotech, a contract research organization (CRO) to manage our efforts to begin potential clinical trials of WP1122 for the treatment of COVID-19. On October 19, 2021, we announced that we received authorization from the MHRA to commence a Phase 1a clinical trial of WP1122 in the United Kingdom. Furthermore, we also announced that we received a favorable opinion from the London - Riverside Research Ethics Committee in the UK to begin the study, which is expected to be conducted at the Medicines Evaluation Unit in Manchester, United Kingdom. In early March 2022, we filed an amended protocol with both the Riverside Ethics Committee and the MHRA. The amendment updated the dilution of the oral solution to achieve full dissolution of WP1122. No risk/benefit to the study was affected because of this change. Once this amendment is approved, we plan to begin this trial in the first half of 2022. The Phase 1a study in healthy human volunteers will investigate the effects of a single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple days of ascending dosing (MAD) of WP1122 administered as an oral solution. Dose escalation will take place in sequential SAD cohorts, and MAD will start as soon as SAD has completed at least 3 dosing cohorts in which WP1122 is found to be safe and well-tolerated.
 
This study in healthy volunteers will explore safety and pharmacokinetics (PK), and subsequent clinical development will be in subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 to further evaluate safety and establish a favorable risk/benefit profile. The Company expects to enroll approximately 80 healthy volunteers in the United Kingdom. The primary endpoint (SAD and MAD) for the study is safety and tolerability, which will be assessed by the frequency of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events, treatment-emergent adverse events, and AEs of special interest. These will be presented by severity and seriousness, system organ class, preferred term and cohort. Clinically significant changes from baseline in clinical laboratory values, physical examination, vital signs, and electrocardiograms will be documented. The secondary endpoint (SAD and MAD) of the study will be the assessment of PK parameters of WP1122 and its 3 active metabolites. Total duration of study participation for each subject will be up to 4 weeks during SAD and up to 5 weeks during MAD.
 
Potential Clinical Trial for GBM with WP1122
 
On December 1, 2021, we announced that the FDA allowed our IND application to study WP1122 for the treatment of GBM to go forward. With this IND now cleared, we plan to seek a partner to conduct an externally funded Phase 1 open label, single arm, dose escalation study of the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of oral WP1122 in adult subjects with GBM. Such a trial would enable parallel development of WP1122 as a cancer therapy. Consistent with our strategy of leveraging external funding for many of our clinical trials, we intend to seek opportunities for an investigator-initiated clinical trial of WP1122 in cancer patients in 2022. There is no assurance that we will be successful in finding an investigator with access to externally sourced funds.
 Additionally, we will rely on external collaborations for testing other molecules in the WP1122 portfolio against other hard to treat viruses such as HIV, Dengue fever, and Zika.
 Overview of The Market for Our Oncology Drugs
 The American Cancer Society (https://www.cancer.org/latest-news/facts-and-figures-2022.html - as of March 2022) estimates that cancer continues to be the second most common cause of death in the US, after heart disease. A total of 1.9 million new cancer cases and 609,360 deaths from cancer are expected to occur in the US in 2022, which is about 1,670 deaths a day. These statistics do not include either basal cell or squamous cell skin cancers because US cancer registries are not required to collect information on these cancers. These numbers also do not account for the effect the COVID-19 pandemic has likely had on cancer diagnoses and deaths because they are projections based on reported cases through 2018 and deaths through 2019.
Market for Annamycin 
 
Digestive, reproductive, breast and respiratory cancers comprise most of expected cancer diagnoses in 2022, while cancers like leukemia and brain tumors are considered “rare diseases.” Leukemia in particular, can be divided into acute, chronic and other, with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) comprising 26,710 of the estimated 60,650 new cases expected in the United States in 2022. The National Cancer Institute estimates that cancer-related direct medical costs in the US were $183 billion in 2015 and are projected to increase to $246 billion by 2030, a 34% increase based only on population growth and aging. However, the projection is likely an underestimate because of the growing cost of prescription medicines, with the list price for many now more than $100,000 annually.
 
Our lead drug candidate, Annamycin, is in a class of drugs referred to as anthracyclines, which are chemotherapy drugs designed to destroy the DNA of targeted cancer cells. The approved anthracyclines most commonly used are daunorubicin and doxorubicin and, prior to the expansion of their generic equivalents, annual revenues generated from anthracyclines have been estimated in the range of $770 million. Acute leukemia is one of a number of cancers that are treated with anthracyclines. One industry report estimates that annual drug revenues generated from the demand for AML-related therapies in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Spain were in the range of $153 million in 2016, and it is estimated that this number is increasing with the increase in approved AML treatments – estimated to rise to $1.6 billion by 2025. Of this worldwide amount, The US market is estimated to comprise the largest share.
 
Leukemia is a cancer of the white blood cells and acute forms of leukemia can manifest quickly and leave patients with limited treatment options. AML is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults. It occurs when a clone of leukemic progenitor white blood cells proliferates in the bone marrow, suppressing the production of normal blood cells. Currently, the only viable option for acute leukemia patients is a bone marrow transplant, also known as a hematopoietic stem cell transplant, which is successful in a significant number of patients. However, in order to qualify for a bone marrow transplant, the patient’s leukemia cells must be decreased to a sufficiently low level. This usually begins with a therapy referred to as “7+3,” which consists of combining seven injections of Cytarabine with 3 infusions of an anthracycline to induce remission (a complete response, or “CR”). This therapy had not improved since it was first used in the 1970s and we estimate that this induction therapy had a success rate of about 20% to 25%. A revision to this therapy was approved in the form of a drug called Vyxeos, which involves combining Cytarabine and an anthracycline (daunorubicin) into a single liposomal injection given 3 times. This improvement appears to have increased the level of CRs to 34% and the overall survival by 3.5 months. Unfortunately, the current clinically approved anthracyclines (including Vyxeos) are cardiotoxic (i.e., can damage the heart), which can limit the dosage amount that may be administered to patients. Additionally, the tumor cells often present de novo or develop resistance to the first-line anthracycline, through what is called “multidrug resistance,” enabling the tumor cells to purge themselves of the available anthracyclines. Consequently, in the majority of these patients there remains no effective therapy for inducing remission sufficient to enable a potentially curative bone marrow transplant and unfortunately most patients will succumb quickly to their leukemia. If a patient’s leukemia reappears before they can be prepared for a bone marrow transplant, they are considered to have “relapsed.” If a patient fails to achieve a sufficient response from the induction therapy to qualify for a bone marrow transplant, they are considered to be “refractory” (resistant to therapy). Together, this group of relapsed and refractory AML patients constitutes our primary focus for treatment with Annamycin and our intent is to pursue FDA approval for Annamycin as a second-line induction therapy for adult relapsed or refractory AML patients.
 
    16 

  

We believe that pursuing approval as a second line induction therapy for adult relapsed or refractory AML patients is the shortest path to regulatory approval, but we also believe that one of the most important potential uses of Annamycin is in the treatment of children with either AML or ALL (acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which is more common in children). Accordingly, we also intend to pursue approval for pediatric use in these conditions when practicable.
 
Soft tissue sarcoma is a broad term for cancers that start in soft tissues (muscle, tendons, fat, lymph and blood vessels, and nerves). These cancers can develop anywhere in the body but are found mostly in the arms, legs, chest, and abdomen.
 
The lungs are the most frequent site of metastasis from soft-tissue sarcomas. From several studies, it has been estimated that approximately 30% of the STS cases develop lung metastases. Effective systemic therapies for metastatic STS are currently limited; when possible, surgical removal of the lung metastases (known as pulmonary metastasectomy, PM) is the preferred treatment. Metastasectomy and/or chemotherapy are the most common treatments offered to patients with metastatic sarcoma. Pulmonary metastasectomy, either video-assisted or through a formal thoracotomy, has been shown to increase overall survival in select populations of both osseous and soft tissue sarcoma patients. The market is expected to grow as a result of factors like an increase in the patient pool.
 
We believe that the market size of STS with lung metastases in the seven major markets is expected to rise from $177 million in 2017 to reach $198 million by 2030. According to our estimates, the highest market size of STS with lung metastases was estimated in the United States, followed by Germany. The market of STS with lung metastases is categorized into first-line and second-line therapies. The therapies in first-line treatment involve surgery, off-label treatment, and stereotactic radiation therapy (SBRT). We estimate that around 80% of patients taking the first-line treatment due to relapse of the disease progress on to second-line treatment. Since we know of no approved or emerging therapies for treatment of relapsed/refractory patients, we believe that first-line therapies are often used again in second-line management. Other cancers metastasize to the lungs, including osteosarcoma, breast and colon cancers, for which the relapsed or refractory population is estimated to exceed 8,000 in the US. In addition, there are over 20,000 annual cases of testicular, thyroid, endometrial, renal and cervical cancers which metastasize to the lungs. Given this backdrop, we believe the best initial pathway for Annamycin is to pursue the second-line treatment of STS lung metastasis.
 
Based on our research, we believe that there were approximately 60,000 pancreatic cancer diagnoses and 48,000 deaths in the US last year. Incidence of pancreatic cancer in the US is expected to grow to 90,000 by 2040. While pancreatic cancer only accounts for 3.2% of all cancer diagnoses, it has the highest mortality rate of all cancers and is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the US, behind lung and colon cancer. The most effective treatment for pancreatic cancer is surgery, but only 20% of cases are eligible for a surgical approach. The 80% of non-resectable pancreatic cancers are typically treated with chemotherapy and other pharmacotherapies. Global sales of drugs used for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, including Abraxane, Lynparza and Tarceva, exceeded $3 billion in 2020, though this figure includes sales for treatment of other cancers as well. Abraxane will become generic in 2022 which should impact this number. There is a tremendous amount of clinical development activity in pancreatic cancer, with 551 trials ongoing, of which 32 were late-stage.
 
Market for Our WP1066 (STAT3) Portfolio
 
Our active development program for WP1066, has potential applications (among others) in the treatment of brain tumors, another rare disease for which there are few available treatments. The leading brain tumor drug is temozolomide, a drug introduced under the brand name Temodar. In 2012, one industry source reported annual revenues of approximately $882 million for Temodar before the expiration of its patent protection, at which point generic versions of the drug began to enter the market and reduce prices.
 
WP1066 is our most published asset (over 50 peer reviewed articles), and we believe it is one of very few drug candidates in the market focused on the inhibition of p-STAT3, and that its mechanism of action is unique. Clinical research on WP1066 is currently focused on the treatment of adult GBM and childhood brain tumors, including DIPG. An industry recognized data source in late 2020 estimated that the incidence rate of primary malignant brain and central nervous system tumors in the US is 7.4 cases per 100,000 person-years. This translates to an incidence of approximately 20,000 cases of malignant brain cancer per year. It is estimated that more than 81,000 people were living with a diagnosis of primary malignant brain and central nervous system tumor in the United States in 2000. In Europe in 2002, 33,000 people were diagnosed with primary brain/CNS cancers, and of which 85-90% are brain tumors. Incidence in Asians is significantly lower and based on the results of several large epidemiological studies, we estimate a Japanese incidence of close to 3,000 a year. Gliomas (mainly glioblastoma and astrocytomas) account for 78% of malignant tumors.
 
Diffuse Interstitial Pontine Glioma (DIPG) - also called: Pontine Glioma or Brainstem Glioma – is a type of pediatric (6-9 years old) tumor that starts in the brain stem. These tumors are called gliomas because they grow from glial cells, a type of supportive cell in the brain. DIPG falls into the Glioma staging system, so they can be classified according to the four stages below based on how the cells look under the microscope. The grades are from the least severe to the most severe: Low Grade: Grade I or II means that the tumor cells are the closest to normal; and High Grade: Grade III or IV means that these are the most aggressive tumors. The main issue with DIPG is that most of these tumors are not classified by grade because biopsy or removal of the tumor is not safe because of the location of the tumor, so they are diagnosed by their appearance on MRI. Symptoms usually develop rapidly in the majority of subjects because of the fast growth of these tumors. The most common symptoms are issues related to balance and walking; eyes, chewing and swallowing, nausea and vomiting, headaches and facial weakness or drooping (usually one side). 10-20% of all pediatric gliomas are DIPG. DIPG impacts an estimated 200 to 400 children per year in the US alone. After diagnosis, median survival is usually nine months. Only 10% live for more than two years. When compared to pediatric glioblastoma, the prognosis for DIPG is the worst with less overall survival. There are no effective treatments for DIPG.
 
We believe there is a significant unmet need for an effective treatment for DIPG. While chemotherapy trials of over 200 drugs have not shown any impact on the disease, a DIPG subject in the first cohort of the Emory University study of WP1066 responded to treatment with both a radiologic reduction in tumor size and a clinical improvement in symptoms. While this is only an “n” of one, we believe the response is important and encouraging, especially since we believe this was a subtherapeutic dose level. In December 2020, we announced that the FDA had approved our request for a "Rare Pediatric Disease" designation for our drug candidate WP1066. The designation may entitle us to receive a transferrable Priority Review Voucher (PRV) upon approval of an NDA for one of three indications, including DIPG, medulloblastoma and atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor. We believe that the early activity we are seeing in WP1066 is both surprising and encouraging. The approval of these three Rare Pediatric Disease designations is a reminder of just how important our efforts are to potentially help children with brain tumors. These vouchers are issued upon drug approval of the rare disease indication from the FDA and once issued, can be transferred to other drug developers. PRVs have historically had significant value and have recently been sold for up to $100 million or more.

Additionally, WP1220 which is in the WP1066 Portfolio, has shown activity in a clinical trial for the treatment of CTCL. CTCL is a neoplastic transformation of T-lymphocytes and most often occurs between the ages of 40 and 60. Unlike other forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, CTCL is initially manifested as skin lesions (mycosis fungoides "MF"), but later stages involve lymph nodes, circulating tumor cells in the blood, as well as viscera. MF is considered a low-grade cutaneous lymphoma which we estimate accounts for more than half of primary CTCLs. Early-stage MF (Stages I and II; ~70% of subjects) is generally treated with skin-directed treatments (topical therapy) using systemic drugs that do not have significant side effects as secondary treatments. Advanced-stage MF requires more aggressive (systemic) therapies due to more extensive involvement of tissues and organs. Treatment is based mainly on a recently published European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) guideline. A consensus guideline for clinical endpoints and response criteria to be incorporated into clinical trials was published. However due to the rarity of this disease, it has been difficult to perform randomized studies. There is currently no cure for this disease.
 
The incidence of CTCL is approximately 16,000 worldwide in 2020 (US + EU 48%) and estimated to be growing to 18,000 by 2026. Asia has the highest incidence (38%). Prevalence is estimated to be 42,000 in US & EU growing to 45,000 with prevalence in Japan growing to a total of 49,000 by 2026. Since this is a chronic disease, we believe introduction of a new topical therapy that is more effective and less toxic than currently available topical drugs (if that is what is shown) would be important to this market. The US market was estimated to represent $40 million in annual sales in 2020, yet consists of technologies that are as much as 40 years old. Our WP1220 proof of concept trial for the treatment of CTCL was conducted in 5 subjects, including the treatment of a total of 11 lesions and concluded with a lesion objective response rate (ORR) of 45%, no adverse events and 55% stable disease, resulting in 100% clinical benefit. 60% of the subjects responded with a PR. We believe that a significant unmet need remains for early stage (Stages IA through IIA) CTCL, and therefore, we believe a meaningful opportunity exists for WP1220.
 
Market for Our WP1122 Portfolio
 
Certain cancers depend heavily on glycolysis and glycosylation for growth and survival. Additionally, viruses depend on glycolysis and glycosylation for infectivity and replication. Glycolysis and glycosylation can be disrupted by using a glucose decoy known as 2-DG. While 2-DG has been shown to be effective in vitro and may have some activity in humans, its lack of drug-like properties limits its efficacy. Based on our preclinical testing in vitro (against cancers and viruses) and in vivo (against certain cancers only), WP1122 appears to improve the drug-like properties of 2-DG by creating a prodrug of 2-DG that reaches much higher tissue/organ concentrations than 2-DG alone. We believe WP1122 should be well suited as a treatment for highly glycolytic cancers such as GBM and pancreatic cancer.
 
In addition to the market for GBM described above, pancreatic cancer is a rare and difficult to treat form of cancer. Cancers of the pancreas are a very serious health issue in the United States where pancreatic cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths following breast cancer; lung cancer, colon cancer, and prostate cancer. Due to difficulties in diagnosis, the intrinsic aggressive nature of pancreatic cancers, and the sparse systemic treatment options available, only approximately 4% of patients diagnosed with pancreatic adenocarcinoma will be alive five years after diagnosis.
 
We believe that WP1122 may also be effective at treating COVID-19. Hundreds of drug candidates have been tested in COVID-19 since the disease became pandemic in early 2020. Many approved COVID-19 therapies, such as therapeutic antibodies and anti-the viral drugs molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir, have demonstrated activity against SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes COVID-19. Other therapies, such as the JAK inhibitor baricitinib, act on host-based mechanisms, importantly by reducing inflammation. WP1122 is being evaluated to act by both host-based and viral mechanisms. Many experts believe that COVID-19 will eventually become endemic, and that a dynamic similar to influenza will emerge. In this scenario, we estimate that there could be approximately 4 million cases of COVID-19 in the US annually by 2027. Should WP1122 prove effective at treating COVID-19, of which there is no assurance, we expect that contract sales to governments will have an important role in the market. 
 
Our License Agreements 
 
Sponsored Research and License Agreements with MD Anderson
 
We have licensed all of our technology from MD Anderson, and we also sponsor research there as well.

Annamycin
 
On June 29, 2017, we entered into a patent and technology license agreement with MD Anderson licensing certain technology related to the method of preparing Liposomal Annamycin and on December 17, 2021 we entered into an amendment to this agreement to include certain technology related to the method of reconstituting Liposomal Annamycin. On December 2, 2021, we entered into a patent and technology license agreement with MD Anderson licensing certain technology related to lung targeted therapies with Annamycin. The terms and payments of which are included in the summary above. The terms of these agreements extend until the later of 20 years from the effective date of the agreements, or the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent. In addition, commencing on the four-year anniversary of each agreement, MD Anderson has the right to remove any jurisdiction from such agreement, upon 90 days’ notice, if we have not commercialized or are not using commercially reasonable efforts actively and effectively to attempt to commercialize a licensed invention in such jurisdiction.
WP1066 Portfolio
 
The rights and obligations to a June 2010 Patent and Technology License Agreement entered into by and between Moleculin LLC and MD Anderson (the “2010 Agreement”) have been assigned to us. Therefore, we have obtained a royalty-bearing, worldwide, exclusive license to intellectual property rights, including patent rights, related to our WP1066 drug product candidate. On February 3, 2022, we entered into a new patent and technology license agreement (the “2022 Agreement”) with MD Anderson licensing certain technology related to WP1066 checkpoint inhibitors. In consideration for these agreements, we must make payments to MD Anderson including an up-front payment, milestone payments and minimum annual royalty payments for sales of products developed under the license agreement. Annual maintenance fee payments will no longer be due upon marketing approval in any country of a licensed product under the 2010 Agreement. One-time milestone payments are due upon commencement of the first Phase III study for a licensed product within the United States, Europe, China or Japan; upon submission of the first NDA for a licensed product in the United States; and upon receipt of the first marketing approval for sale of a licensed product in the United States. The term of the 2010 Agreement extends until the later of 15 years from the effective date of the agreement, or the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent. The term of the 2022 Agreement extends until the later of 20 years from the effective date of the agreement, or the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent. In addition, MD Anderson may terminate the 2022 Agreement if we fail to file for an IND for a Phase 1 study before February 2, 2025 in the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom or China.
WP1122 Portfolio
 
The rights and obligations to an April 2012 Patent and Technology License Agreement entered into by and between IntertechBio and MD Anderson (the “2012 Agreement”) have been assigned to us. Therefore, we have obtained a royalty-bearing, worldwide, exclusive license to intellectual property, including patent rights, related to our WP1122 Portfolio and to our drug product candidate, WP1122. On December 3, 2021, we entered into a new patent and technology license agreement (the “2021 Agreement”) with MD Anderson licensing certain technology related to WP1122 anti-viral treatments. The terms and payments of these agreements are included in the summary above. The 2012 Agreement was amended in May 2020 to provide for extension of a certain milestone requirement and allowed for us to extend such milestone upon our request and extension payment. The initial milestone required us to file an IND with the FDA for a Phase I study by February 20, 2021. We extended the deadline for this milestone to August 20, 2021 by paying an extension fee. On August 3, 2021, we filed a CTA in the United Kingdom to commence a Phase 1a clinical trial of WP1122. MD Anderson agreed that this CTA filing would further extend the deadline to file an IND with the FDA for a Phase I study until February 2022. In December 2021, we submitted an IND for the treatment of GBM with WP1122 to the FDA, thus meeting the IND filing milestone. The term of the 2012 agreement extends until the later of 15 years from the effective date of the agreement, or the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent. In addition, MD Anderson may terminate the 2012 agreement if we fail to commence a Phase 1 study for a licensed product prior to November 20, 2022; or if we fail to commence a Phase 2 study for licensed product prior to November 20, 2024. The term of the 2021 agreement extends until the later of 20 years from the effective date of the agreement, or the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent. In addition, MD Anderson may terminate the 2021 agreement if we fail to file an IND or its foreign equivalent for a Phase 1 study for a licensed product prior to December 3, 2024; or if we fail to commence a Phase 1 study for licensed product prior to December 3, 2026. We believe that the filing and clearance of a WP1122 Phase 1 clinical trial for COVID-19 in the UK and subsequent start of that trial will meet these milestone requirements.
WPD Licensing Agreement 
 
On December 20, 2021, we amended our sublicense agreement with WPD Pharmaceuticals (WPD), originally entered into on February 19, 2019, pursuant to which we sublicensed to WPD certain intellectual property rights, including rights to Annamycin, its WP1122 portfolio, and its WP1066 portfolio, which sublicense was previously amended on March 22, 2021 (as amended, the “WPD Agreement”). WPD is affiliated with Dr. Waldemar Priebe, our founder. Under the WPD Agreement, we granted WPD a royalty-bearing, exclusive license to research, develop, manufacture, have manufactured, use, import, offer to sell and/or sell products in the field of human therapeutics under the licensed intellectual property in the countries of Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, Romania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Greece, Austria, Russia, Netherlands, Turkey, Belgium, Switzerland, Sweden, Portugal, Norway, Denmark, Ireland, Finland, Luxembourg, Iceland (licensed territories).
 
Pursuant to the WPD Agreement, WPD agreed that it must use Commercially Reasonable Development Efforts (CRDE) to develop and commercialize products in the licensed territories. For purposes of the WPD Agreement, the term CRDE means the expenditure, either directly or through the guarantees of grants, by or on behalf of WPD or any of its affiliates of at least: (i) $2,500,000 during the first four (4) years (the “Initial Hurdle Date”) immediately following the date of the original agreement, or February 19, 2019, on the research, development and commercialization of sublicensed products in the licensed territories; and (ii) a minimum of $2,100,000 annually for each of the five (5) years after the Initial Hurdle Date on the research and development of sublicensed products in the licensed territories.

During the term of the WPD Agreement, to the extent we are required to make any payments to MD Anderson pursuant to our license agreements with MD Anderson, whether a milestone or royalty payment, as a result of the research and development or sale of a sublicensed product, WPD shall be required to advance or reimburse us for such payments. In further consideration for the rights granted by us to WPD under the WPD Agreement, WPD agreed to pay us a royalty percentage at a rate equal to the royalty rate owed MD Anderson under our license agreements with MD Anderson plus an additional royalty (the “override royalty percentage”) equal to 1.0% of net sales of any sublicensed products, provided, however, if WPD spends: (i) more than $14.0 million in CRDE, the override royalty percentage will decrease to 0.75% of net sales; or (ii) more than $17.0 million in CRDE, the override royalty percentage will decrease to 0.5% of net sales.
 
With certain exceptions, the WPD Agreement will remain in full force and effect until the expiration of the last patent within the sublicensed patents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we have the right, in our sole discretion, to terminate the WPD Agreement in whole, or to materially amend the agreement by removing a portion of the sublicensed subject matter, in connection with certain fundamental transactions or in connection with the granting to an unaffiliated third party of a license or sublicense to all or to a material portion of the sublicensed subject matter within all or substantially all of the licensed territories (such event, the “buyback event”) by making a payment to WPD based on the percentage of licensed territories involved in the buyback event as compared to the overall world healthcare spend and the extent to which WPD has satisfied its CRDE requirements.
 
On December 19, 2021, we consented to allow WPD, upon a default to a third-party lender that had advanced funds to WPD (the “Lender”), to assign the WPD Agreement to the Lender, subject to certain conditions and subject to the Lender granting us the right to terminate the WPD Agreement upon any assignment as follows. If the assignment occurs, we have the right at any time during the remaining term of the WPD Agreement to terminate the agreement by paying the Lender $1.7 million (the “Termination Fee”) in the form of $1.0 million in cash and the issuance to Lender of our common stock valued at the remaining balance due (based on valuing each share of common stock issued at the greater of $3.00 per share or 30% less than the five day trading average of the common stock for the five trading days prior to the date the notice of termination is delivered; provided that if the assignment occurs and if we do not exercise the above termination right within 90 days of the Assignment Date: (i) the Initial Hurdle Date will be extended for a period of 3 years; and (ii) the Termination Fee shall increase (A) $2.0 million prior to the later of March 1, 2023 or 105 days from the assignment date; (B) $2.2 million prior to the later of March 1, 2024 or one year and 105 days from the assignment date; or, (C) $2.4 million thereafter. Upon any assignment, we will pay the Lender $0.2 million to cover legal and transaction fees related to the termination.
 
Animal Life Sciences Licensing Agreement
 
On February 19, 2019, we sublicensed certain intellectual property rights, including rights to Annamycin, our WP1122 portfolio, and our WP1066 portfolio in the field of non-human animals to Animal Life Sciences, LLC (ALI) (the “ALI Agreement”). ALI is affiliated with Dr. Waldemar Priebe, our founder. Under the ALI Agreement, we granted ALI a worldwide royalty-bearing, exclusive license to research, develop, manufacture, have manufactured, use, import, offer to sell and/or sell products in the field of non-human animals under the licensed intellectual property. This license is subject to the terms in the prior agreements entered into by the Company and MD Anderson.
 
During the term of the ALI Agreement, to the extent we are required to make any payments to MD Anderson pursuant to our license agreements with MD Anderson, whether a milestone or royalty payment, as a result of the research and development or sale of a sublicensed product, ALI shall be required to advance or reimburse us such payments. In further consideration for the rights granted by us to ALI under the ALI Agreement, ALI agreed to pay us a royalty percentage at a rate equal to the royalty rate we owe MD Anderson under our license agreements with MD Anderson plus an additional royalty equal to 5.0% of net sales of any sublicensed products. As additional consideration, ALI issued us a 10% ownership interest in ALI.
 
With certain exceptions, the ALI Agreement will remain in full force and effect until the expiration of the last patent within the sublicensed patents.
 
Prior Sublicenses
 
In 2015, we entered into certain patent and technology development and license agreements with Dermin sp. z o.o. (Dermin). In connection with such agreements, certain intellectual property rights related to Annamycin, our WP1122 portfolio, and our WP1066 portfolio were licensed to Dermin and Dermin was granted a royalty-bearing, exclusive license to manufacture, have manufactured, use, import, offer to sell and/or sell products in the field of human therapeutics under the licensed intellectual property in certain countries in Europe and Asia. In July 2019, Dermin assigned its rights under the foregoing license agreements to an affiliated entity, Exploration Invest Pte Ltd. (Exploration). On July 30, 2019, we and Exploration entered into an agreement pursuant to which we issued Exploration shares of Company common stock valued at $0.5 million (based on the greater of the closing price of the common stock on the date of the agreement or the 10-day average closing price prior to the date of the agreement) in exchange for the modifying the license agreements to: (i) limit the licensed territory solely to Poland; and (ii) limit the patent rights and technology rights licensed to Exploration to the patent rights and technology rights that existed on the date the original license agreements were entered into with Dermin. In February 2022, we entered into a termination agreement with Exploration pursuant to which Exploration agreed to terminate all the above licenses for a one-time payment of $400,000. As of the date hereof, all the above licenses have been terminated.
Corporate History
 
We were founded in 2015 by Walter Klemp (our chairman and CEO), Dr. Don Picker (our Chief Science Officer) and Dr. Waldemar Priebe of MD Anderson (Chairman of our Scientific Advisory Board) in order to combine and consolidate the development efforts involving several oncology technologies, based on license agreements with MD Anderson. Dr. Priebe is a Professor of Medicinal Chemistry in the Department of Experimental Therapeutics, Division of Cancer Medicine, at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. This effort began with the acquisition of the Annamycin development project from AnnaMed, Inc. followed by the acquisition of the license rights to the WP1122 Portfolio from IntertechBio Corporation. Further, on behalf of Moleculin, LLC, we entered into a co-development agreement with Houston Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which culminated with the merger of Moleculin, LLC into MBI coincident with our initial public offering allowing us to gain control of the WP1066 Portfolio.
 
In June 2018, we formed Moleculin Australia Pty. Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary to oversee pre-clinical development in Australia. The Australian government provides an aggressive incentive for research and development carried out in their country. We believe having an Australian subsidiary could provide a great opportunity for quality, pre-clinical and clinical development and reduce the overall cost of our continued drug development efforts.
 
On January 29, 2021, we completed a one-for-six reverse stock split of our shares of common stock and proportionate reduction in the number of authorized shares of common stock from approximately 72,000,000 shares to approximately 12,000,000. The reverse stock split was effected in accordance with the authorization adopted by our stockholders at our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders.
 
In July 2021, we formed Moleculin Amsterdam B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary, primarily to act as our legal representative for clinical trials in Europe for Moleculin Biotech, Inc.

Competition
 
We operate in a highly competitive segment of the pharmaceutical market, which market is highly competitive as a whole. We face competition from numerous sources including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies, and private and public research institutions. Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, product development, manufacturing and marketing resources. Additionally, many universities and private and public research institutes are active in cancer research, and some may be in direct competition with us. We may also compete with these organizations to recruit scientists and clinical development personnel. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
 
The unmet medical need for more effective cancer therapies is such that oncology drugs are one of the leading class of drugs in development. These include a wide array of products against cancer targeting many of the same indications as our drug candidates. While the introduction of newer targeted agents may result in extended overall survival, we believe that induction therapy regimens are likely to remain a cornerstone of cancer treatment in the foreseeable future.
 
There are a number of established therapies that may be considered competitive for the cancer indications for which we intend to develop our lead product candidate, Annamycin. A key consideration when treating AML patients is whether the patient is suitable for intensive therapy. The standard of care for the treatment of newly diagnosed AML patients who can tolerate intensive therapy is cytarabine in combination with an anthracycline (e.g., doxorubicin or daunorubicin), typically referred to as a “7+3” regimen. For some patients, primarily those less than 60 years of age, a stem cell transplant could also be considered if the induction regimen is effective in attaining a CR (Complete Response). The 7+3 regimen of cytarabine in combination with an anthracycline has been the standard of care for decades. A patient not suitable for intensive therapy may be offered the option for low-intensity therapy such as low-dose cytarabine, azacitidine or decitabine. It should be noted that, in the United States, these are not approved by the FDA for the treatment of AML patients and there remains no effective therapy for these patients or for relapsed or refractory AML, with the exception of some recently approved targeted therapies that have demonstrated a low level of activity for limited subgroups of AML patients. The initial focus for Annamycin development is in patients for whom the standard induction regimen has failed. Also, several major pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies are aggressively pursuing new cancer development programs for the treatment of AML.
 
A number of attempts have been made or are under way to provide an improved treatment for AML. Celator Pharmaceuticals reported Phase III clinical trial results for a new combined formulation of cytarabine and daunorubicin (commonly used induction therapy drugs) they call Vyxeos. This new liposome formulation provides a 5:1 ratio of cytarabine and daunorubicin in each of three injections. When compared with patients receiving 7 injections of cytarabine and 3 injections of daunorubicin (traditional 7+3 induction therapy), patients receiving Vyxeos achieved an average increase in overall survival of approximately 3.5 months (9.5 months compared with 6 months). Despite this extension of overall survival, Vyxeos did not reduce the toxic side effects of daunorubicin (including cardiotoxicity) and it failed to qualify a majority of patients for curative bone marrow transplant. With these results, Jazz Pharmaceuticals acquired Celator in 2016 and obtained FDA approval. More recently, a new drug called venetoclax, which is indicated for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) in combination with certain antibody therapies, has been found to be effective for the treatment of AML.
 
Drugs attempting to target a subset of AML patients who present with specific gene mutations, such as one referred to as FLT3, have recently received FDA approval, but by definition serve only subsets of the AML population. Other targeted therapies are currently in clinical trials, as well as other approaches that include immunotherapy relying on other biomarkers, other attempts at improved chemotherapy and alternative approaches to radiation therapy. Other approaches to improve the effectiveness of induction therapy are in early-stage clinical trials and, although they do not appear to address the underlying problems with anthracyclines, we can provide no assurance that such improvements, if achieved, would not adversely impact the need for improved anthracyclines. A modified version of doxorubicin designed to reduce cardiotoxicity is in clinical trials for the treatment of sarcoma and, although this drug does not appear to address multidrug resistance and is not currently intended for the treatment of acute leukemia, we can provide no assurance that it will not become a competitive alternative to Annamycin. Although we are not aware of any other single agent therapies in clinical trials that would directly compete against Annamycin in the treatment of relapsed and refractory AML, we can provide no assurance that such therapies are not in development, will not receive regulatory approval and will reach market before our drug candidate Annamycin. In addition, any such competing therapy may be more effective and/or cost-effective than ours.
 
Soft-tissue sarcomas which have metastasized to the lungs are extremely difficult to treat. There are an estimated 13,600 new cases of soft-tissue sarcoma diagnosed each year, and of those that metastasize, approximately 70% of metastases occur to the lungs. The current standard of care consists of anthracycline therapy or newer-generation drugs such as pazopanib. However, only 20% of patients with STS lung metastases respond to these treatments. There are competitive efforts underway to develop new treatments for STS, including metastatic STS, but few specifically target STS metastases to the lungs.
 
Non-resectable pancreatic cancers are typically treated with chemotherapy and other pharmacotherapies, including Abraxane, Lynparza and Tarceva. While these products have been commercially successful, their success rates at treating pancreatic cancer are low and fatality rates remain high. This has led to a tremendous amount of clinical development activity in pancreatic cancer, with 551 trials ongoing, resulting in significant competition for pancreatic cancer patients among clinical trials, which could impact development timelines.
 
Several products have established efficacy for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19, and the continued development of additional therapies has resulted in competition for patients in clinical trials. Products which have obtained approval, either on an emergency use basis or pursuant to full regulatory review, include antiviral antibody therapies from Lilly, Regeneron, GSK and AstraZeneca; small molecule antiviral drugs from Pfizer and Merck; and targeted anti-inflammatory drugs from Lilly and others. If proven to be effective against COVID-19, WP1122 would be expected to compete with other host-based therapies including targeted anti-inflammatory drugs.
 
Competition for other indications targeted for each of our drug candidates is described above.
 
Government Regulation
 
Government authorities at the federal, state and local level in the US, and in analogous levels in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, import, export, record-keeping, reporting, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. The pharmaceutical drug product candidates that we develop must be approved by the FDA before they may be marketed and commercially distributed in the US, and by regulators in other countries before being marketed and commercially distributed there.
 
    21 

  

In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical products such as our product candidates under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and implementing regulations. Pharmaceutical products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Obtaining regulatory approvals and complying with post-approval requirements generally is expensive, labor-intensive and time-consuming. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial enforcement action, which could include refusal to permit clinical trials, refusal to approve an application, withdrawal of an approval, issuance of a warning letter, product recall, product seizure, suspension of production or distribution, fines, refusals of government contracts, and restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
Development and Approval
 
The process required by the FDA before a pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the US generally involves the following:
 

• | Completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices (GCP) and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed pharmaceutical product for its intended use;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission to the FDA of an NDA for marketing approval that includes substantial evidence of safety and effectiveness from results of clinical trials, as well as the results of preclinical testing, detailed information about the chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and proposed labeling and packaging for the product;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Review of the product candidate by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the pharmaceutical product is produced, to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the pharmaceutical product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential FDA audit of the preclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA, including agreement on post-marketing commitments, if applicable.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The development and approval process, as well as post-approval requirements and restrictions, require substantial resources, attention and effort, and the prospects for approval and continued compliance are inherently uncertain.
 
Preclinical Testing. Before testing any compound in humans in the US, a company must generate extensive preclinical data. Preclinical testing generally includes laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as toxicological and pharmacological studies in animals to assess the product’s safety and activity. The preclinical work must be done in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, requirements, the Animal Welfare Act, and other applicable regulations. The sponsor must submit the preclinical data in an IND, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol. Unless the FDA notifies the sponsor otherwise, an IND becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, and the proposed clinical trial may begin. If it expresses concerns to the sponsor, FDA may impose a “clinical hold,” which precludes beginning the study until the issues are resolved. Similarly, once a study has begun, the FDA may impose a clinical hold suspending further activity, pending resolution of agency concerns. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in a clinical trial beginning or that, once begun, a clinical trial will not be suspended or terminated.
 
IND Application. Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or subjects with the targeted disease under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the clinical trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, how the results will be analyzed and presented and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with FDA’s good clinical practice, or GCP, regulations, which are intended to safeguard study subjects and support the validity of the resultant data. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board (IRB) at, or servicing, each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study participants and for determining that the risks to study participants are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that each study subject (or his or her legal representative) must sign, and is responsible for monitoring the conduct of the study until completed.
 
Clinical testing. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 

• | Phase 1: The pharmaceutical product is initially administered to humans, usually a small group of healthy human subjects, but occasionally to subjects with the targeted disease. This latter case is usually reserved for product candidates intended for severe or life-threatening diseases (such as cancer) and/or when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers. Phase 1 trials generally are intended to determine the metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness. Because our product candidates are being studied for treating cancers and contain cytotoxic agents, our Phase 1 studies are conducted in late-stage cancer patients whose disease has progressed after treatment with other agents, and are focused on establishing a maximum tolerable dose (MTD).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: Here the product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to develop data regarding effectiveness, to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule, to gather additional safety information, and to identify patient populations with specific characteristics where the pharmaceutical product may be more effective.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3: Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. The studies must be well controlled and usually include a control arm for comparison. One or two Phase 3 studies are usually required by the FDA for an NDA approval, depending on the disease severity and other available treatment options. In some instances, an NDA approval may be obtained based on Phase 2 clinical data, often with the understanding that the approved drug can be sold subject to a confirmatory trial to be conducted post-approval.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    22 

  

Additionally, post-approval studies, also referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are often used to gain additional information about use of the product for its approved indication, and may at times be required by the FDA as a condition of approval.
 
Clinical trials require submission of annual progress reports to the FDA, and certain events, especially safety-related information, may require making reports to the FDA, investigators, and/or the IRB, and can lead to suspension, modification, or cessation of ongoing trials. Accordingly, clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all.
 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies, develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements.
 
The sponsor of a clinical trial or the sponsor’s designated responsible party may be required to register certain information about the trial and disclose certain results on government or independent registry websites, such as ClinicalTrials.gov. Additionally, a manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious disease or condition is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for individual patient access to such investigational drug. This requirement applies on the earlier of the first initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial of the investigational drug or, as applicable, 15 days after the drug receives a designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy.
 
NDA Submission and Review. The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the pharmaceutical product candidate, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA seeking approval to market the product. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), as amended, the submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of a substantial fee, although the fee may be waived under certain circumstances, which may or may not be applicable to us or our partners for any of our product candidates. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, as amended, an NDA or supplement to an NDA generally must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers depending on the designated pathway for submission.
 
The FDA first examines a submitted NDA to determine if the application is sufficiently complete to be accepted for review. If not, the agency may refuse to file the NDA, informing the sponsor of inadequacies to be addressed in a resubmitted application. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once an NDA is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the application. Pursuant to goals established under PDUFA, the FDA aims to complete the review within 10 months of the 60-day filing date, which would be within 12 months of the date of submission, but that deadline is extended in certain circumstances, including by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 
The FDA also has programs intended to expedite the development and review of new drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and address unmet medical needs and/or provide benefits over existing therapies. They include:
 

• | Priority Review, under which FDA aims to complete the NDA review within eight months of the date of submission; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Accelerated Approval, where a product may be approved on the basis of data demonstrating an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (IMM) that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit;
• | Fast Track, which may provide for FDA review of sections of the NDA on a rolling basis, before the complete application is submitted; and 
• | Breakthrough Therapy, which also provides for rolling review and other actions to expedite review of the NDA. 

 
The availability of these programs is determined by the facts surrounding each specific product candidate, the disease or condition it is intended to treat, and the availability and characteristics of alternative treatments. Because those factors are subject to change, even if a product or application is granted designation for one (or more) of these programs, the benefits of the program may ultimately not be available. Additionally, the FDA may rescind designations for certain expedited programs (specifically, Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy) if the agency determines the product candidate no longer meets the criteria for such programs.
 
The FDA review of an NDA focuses on determining, among other things, whether the proposed product candidate is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product candidate is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product candidate’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel pharmaceutical products or pharmaceutical products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. The FDA may also determine that a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) is necessary to assure the safe use of the product. Among other things, a REMS can include restrictive conditions under which the product may be distributed, which may have a negative impact on the product’s commercial success. If the FDA concludes that a REMS is needed, the NDA sponsor must submit a proposed REMS, and the product will not be approved until FDA determines that the proposed REMS is adequate. 
 
The FDA usually will inspect the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured, and will not approve the product candidate unless the agency determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with IND study requirements and GCP. The NDA review process also includes evaluation of the proposed labeling, which is often the subject of significant back-and-forth between the sponsor and the agency.
 
The NDA review and approval process is lengthy and difficult, and may involve FDA requests for additional data or information, which may extend the process and/or lead the agency to refuse to approve the application. This is the case even if requested data or information are submitted, because data are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than the sponsor does. If it decides not to approve an NDA, the FDA will issue a complete response letter, which usually describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA and may include recommended actions the applicant might take for the FDA to reconsider the application. The deficiencies may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or more significant, such as requiring additional clinical trials. An applicant receiving a complete response letter may either revise and resubmit the NDA or withdraw the application.
 
    23 

  

FDA approval of an NDA may impose significant limitations that could weaken the commercial value of the product. This could take the form of a narrow indication or dosage, requiring the labeling to contain contraindications, warnings or precautions to address perceived safety issues, or mandating a REMS that significantly restricts or imposes burdens on how the product is distributed. Additionally, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing as a condition of approval. In particular, the FDA requires Phase 4 testing as a condition of accelerated approval, and may withdraw accelerated approval of a product if a sponsor fails to timely conduct such studies or if those studies fail to confirm safety or effectiveness. Such post-approval requirements can materially impact a product’s commercial prospects. Post-approval modifications to a drug product, such as changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require development and submission of additional information or data in a new or supplemental NDA, which would also require prior FDA approval.
 
Regulatory Exclusivities. The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of drugs intended to treat rare diseases or conditions, which generally are diseases or conditions affecting less than 200,000 individuals in the US. If a sponsor demonstrates that a drug is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, the FDA grants orphan drug designation (ODD) for the product for that use. The benefits of ODD include research and development tax credits and exemption from user fees, including the significant application fee otherwise required with submission of an NDA. A drug that is approved for an indication that is within the product’s orphan drug designation is granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity (ODE). During that period, the FDA generally may not approve any other application for product with the same active moiety for the same use, although there are exceptions, most notably when the later product is shown to be clinically superior to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. A court decision in 2021 broadened the scope of ODE, but the impact of that decision is yet to be determined.
 
ODD and ODE are also available from the European Union (EU). ODD in the EU is generally available for drug products intended to treat life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made. If the orphan-designated product continues to meet the criteria for orphan designation at approval, the approval for an orphan-designated indication conveys a 10-year exclusivity period, during which the competent authorities in the EU may not accept another marketing authorization application and may not grant another marketing authorization for a similar medicinal product (i.e., a medicinal product with an identical active substance, or an active substance with the same principal molecular structural features and that acts via the same mechanisms) for the same therapeutic indication. The 10-year period can be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for the ODD, which can include if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify market exclusivity. In the EU, ODE does not preclude granting a marketing authorization for a similar medicinal product for the same therapeutic indication, if that medicinal product is demonstrated to be safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is unable to supply sufficient quantities of the product.
 
Products that are approved to treat rare diseases that are serious or life-threatening and where the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect patients under the age of 19 years of age may qualify for the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher (RPDPRV) program, in which the product sponsor receives upon approval a voucher for priority review of another product. The voucher can be used by the sponsor for a subsequent application that would not in its own right qualify for priority review, or it may be sold to another company for that use. In either case, a RPDPRV may have significant value. Under the current statutory sunset provisions for the RPDPRV program, after September 30, 2024, FDA may award a voucher for an approved rare pediatric disease product application only if the sponsor has rare pediatric disease designation for the drug, and that designation was granted by September 30, 2024. After September 30, 2026, FDA may not award any rare pediatric disease priority review vouchers.
 
We received ODD for Annamycin for the treatment of AML in 2018, and in 2020 for the treatment of soft tissue sarcomas, and Fast Track Designation for Annamycin for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML in April 2019. We received ODD for WP1066 for the treatment of glioblastoma in 2019. If WP1066 is timely approved for the treatment of any of the following pediatric diseases, we may qualify for a Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher: ependymoma, medulloblastoma, diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, or atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor, provided that related statutory sunset provisions are extended.
 
The federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) also provides for a grant of five-year exclusivity with approval of a product containing a new chemical entity (NCE), which generally means that the active moiety has never before been approved in any drug. During this exclusivity period, which runs from the date of the product’s approval, FDA may not accept for filing any Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) for a generic version of the product or any 505(b)(2) NDA (generally an NDA that relies on data that are not the sponsor’s and for which the sponsor has not obtained a right of reference) for a product with the same active moiety. There are circumstances under which the follow-on application can be submitted at four years, and there are provisions that operate to preclude approval of the application for an additional period of time. Also, NCE exclusivity does not block approval of a “full” NDA (generally, an NDA in which the data are the sponsor’s or for which the sponsor has obtained a right of reference). The NCE exclusivity scheme is complicated and evolving; for that reason, although we believe that some of our products will qualify for five-year NCE exclusivity, we cannot be certain that will receive such exclusivity, or that if we do, the exclusivity will effectively protect our market position.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Once approved, products are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, cGMP compliance, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, prohibitions on promoting pharmaceutical products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the pharmaceutical product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available pharmaceutical products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not directly or indirectly market or promote such off-label uses. If ongoing regulatory requirements are not met, or if safety or manufacturing problems occur after the product reaches the market, the FDA may at any time withdraw product approval or take actions that would limit or suspend marketing. Additionally, the FDA may require post-marketing studies or clinical trials, changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, or the implementation of other risk management measures, including distribution-related restrictions, if there are new safety information developments. Further, failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences including adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, actions by the US Department of Justice and/or US Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties.
 
    24 

  

We rely and expect to continue to rely on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our product candidates. Manufacturers of our product candidates are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the agency’s cGMP regulations and related policies. The cGMP regulations require, among other things, adhering to requirements relating to organization and training of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, quality control and quality assurance, as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Pharmaceutical product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of pharmaceutical products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and the FDA inspects equipment, facilities, and processes used in manufacturing pharmaceutical products prior to approval. The FDA and certain state agencies also conduct periodic unannounced inspections to re-inspect equipment, facilities, and processes for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Failure to comply with applicable cGMP requirements and conditions of product approval may lead the FDA to take enforcement actions or seek sanctions, including fines, issuance of warning letters, civil penalties, injunctions, suspension of manufacturing operations, operating restrictions, withdrawal of FDA approval, seizure or recall of products, and criminal prosecution. Although we periodically monitor the FDA compliance of our third-party manufacturers, we cannot be certain that our present or future third-party manufacturers will consistently comply with cGMP and other applicable FDA regulatory requirements.
 
Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or NDA sponsor, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
 
Patent Term Restoration 
 
If we receive FDA approval of our pharmaceutical product candidates, and depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our pharmaceutical product candidates, some of our product candidates covered by US patents may be eligible for limited patent term restoration under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for the patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process for a product the approval of which is the first permitted commercial marketing of the active pharmaceutical ingredient. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a date 14 years after the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved pharmaceutical product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent unless an extension is obtained. The US Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and renders a decision on the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may be able to apply for extension of patent term for one or more of our currently licensed patents or any future owned patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending upon the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA. We cannot be certain that any of our product candidate’s will qualify for patent term restoration or, if so, for how long the patent term will be extended.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any pharmaceutical product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and in markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part upon the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include government payers such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a pharmaceutical product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the pharmaceutical product. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific pharmaceutical products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not, and frequently do not, include all the FDA-approved pharmaceutical products for a particular indication. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. A payer’s decision to provide coverage for a pharmaceutical product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. In addition, in the United States there is a growing emphasis on comparative effectiveness research, both by private payers and by government agencies. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our pharmaceutical product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. To the extent other drugs or therapies are found to be more effective than our products, payers may elect to cover such therapies in lieu of our products and/or reimburse our products at a lower rate.
 
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Community, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed upon. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular pharmaceutical product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 
The marketability of any pharmaceutical product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect this will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we may receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.

International Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our future drugs. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a drug, we must obtain approval of a drug by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the drug in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
 
Under European Union regulatory systems, marketing authorizations may be submitted either under a centralized or mutual recognition procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The mutual recognition procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessment report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval.
 
In addition to regulations in Europe and the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial distribution of our future drugs.
