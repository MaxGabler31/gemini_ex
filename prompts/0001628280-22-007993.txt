Our Company
We are a rapidly-growing specialty distributor and select manufacturer of environmentally-friendly disposable foodservice products and related items. We are a nimble supplier of a wide range of products for the foodservice industry, including food and take-out containers, bags, tableware, cups, lids, cutlery, straws, specialty beverage ingredients, equipment, gloves and other products. Our products are available in plastic, paper, biopolymer-based and other compostable forms. Our Karat Earth® line provides environmentally friendly options to our customers, who are increasingly focused on sustainability. We offer customized solutions to our customers, including new product development, design, printing and logistics services.
While a majority of our revenue is generated from the distribution of our vendors’ products, we have select manufacturing capabilities in the U.S., which allows us to provide customers with broad product choices and customized offerings with short lead times. For the year ended December 31, 2021, distribution accounted for approximately 75% of our net sales, while manufacturing accounted for approximately 25% of our net sales. We expect manufacturing to remain a relatively small portion of our sales mix in fiscal year 2022, but believe it provides us with the flexibility to provide customized products with short lead times to complement our global sourcing capabilities. To that end, we operate our business strategically and with broad flexibility to provide both our large and small customers with the wide spectrum of products they need to successfully run and grow their businesses. We believe our ability to source products quickly on a cost-effective basis via a global supplier network, complemented by our manufacturing capabilities for select products, has established us as a differentiated provider of high-quality products relative to our competitors.
Our customers include a wide variety of national and regional distributors, restaurant chains, retail establishments and online customers. Our products are well suited to address our customers’ increased focus on take-out and delivery capabilities. Our diverse and growing blue chip customer base includes well-known fast casual chains such as Applebee’s Neighborhood Grill + Bar, Chili’s Grill & Bar, PF Chang's, Texas Roadhouse, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Corner Bakery Cafe and TGI Fridays, as well as fast food chains including The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, El Pollo Loco, In-N-Out Burger, Jack in The Box, Popeyes, Panda Express, Raising Cane’s Chicken Fingers and Torchy’s Tacos. As our capabilities, product offering and footprint expand, we are also beginning to supply products to national and regional supermarket chains, airlines, sports and entertainment venues and other non-restaurant customers. Our strong brand recognition in the foodservice industry, nimble operations and rapidly increasing size and scope of our distribution and logistics network provide us with a significant advantage that enables us to acquire new customers as well as increase our business with existing customers. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, no single customer represented more than 10% of our revenue. 
We have recently made significant investments to establish and grow our e-commerce distribution channel www.lollicupstore.com. This channel, utilized primarily by small- and medium-sized businesses, served over 73,000 customers during the year ended December 31, 2021, with our online net sales growing by 51.4% compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Our e-commerce channel offers the entire range of our products for online procurement, and we believe it will continue to be a key growth driver for our business going forward. Additionally, the e-commerce channel enables us to cross market other products to our customers that they may be purchasing from competitors.
We classify our customers into four categories: distributors, national and regional chains, retail and online.
•    Distributors: national and regional distributors across the U.S. that purchase our products and provide a channel to offer our products to restaurants, offices, schools, government entities and other end users.
•    National and regional chains: typically fast casual and fast food restaurants with locations across multiple states to which we supply specified products. We enter into sales contracts with a subset of our national and regional chains customers, providing visibility into future revenue.
•    Retail: primarily regional bubble tea shops, boutique coffee shops and frozen yogurt shops that often purchase our specialty beverage ingredients and related items.
•    Online: small businesses, often with less than two locations, such as small restaurants, bubble tea shops, coffee shops, juice bars, smoothie shops and some customers who purchase for personal use.
The diversity of our customer types provides us with the ability to source products efficiently while maintaining a broad product offering, as we are able to sell many products across multiple customer segments. We expect a large proportion of our growth to come from national and regional chains and our higher margin online customers.
The disposable foodservice products industry is large and growing. Our industry is benefiting from shifting consumer preferences towards both food delivery and “to-go” ordering, a trend that pre-dated the COVID-19 pandemic. As consumer preferences have evolved, foodservice establishments have realized that the at-home dining experience is closely linked to the quality of the packaging utilized. Rapidly growing demand for quality take-out packaging solutions coupled with ongoing global supply chain disruptions have also contributed to significant capacity constraints and product shortages within the industry.
 We have generated significant growth through the continued expansion of our customer base and increasing penetration into existing customers. We have increased our total customers from approximately 45,000 in 2020 to over 77,000 in 2021. In addition, we have been able to grow our wallet share with many customers, in particular our national and regional chains, by supplying them a broader range of our foodservice disposables and related products. We believe that the current environment has accelerated the shift in consumer preferences towards food delivery and “to-go” ordering, which we expect to continue in the foreseeable future.
We currently operate manufacturing facilities and distribution and fulfillment centers in Chino, California and Rockwall, Texas. In addition, we operate other distribution centers located in Rockwall, Texas, Branchburg, New Jersey, Sumner, Washington, Summerville, South Carolina and Kapolei, Hawaii. The distribution and fulfillment centers are strategically located in proximity to major population centers, including the Los Angeles, New York, Seattle, Atlanta and Honolulu metro areas. 
Competitive Strengths 
We believe the following strengths fundamentally differentiate us from our competitors and drive our success:
One-stop shop with a diverse product offering for the foodservice market and highly nimble sourcing capabilities
We leverage our diversified global supplier network and offer customers a wide selection of single-use disposable foodservice products, with over 8,600 SKUs across a broad range of product categories. Key offerings include food and take-out containers, bags, tableware, cups, lids, cutlery and straws primarily sourced through our diverse supplier base. Our strong relationships with our suppliers allow us to offer customers products that both preserve the highest possible food quality and meet the unique needs of their business. Furthermore, these supplier relationships allow us to offer custom-branded and custom-designed products with fast turnaround times and at competitive prices. Our Karat Earth® specialty line of environmentally friendly products are made from renewable resources that are ethically sourced. Also, we have never used Styrofoam in any of our Karat products. Our Karat Earth® line provides environmentally friendly options that include food and take-out containers, bags, tableware, cups, lids, cutlery and straws.
Customers can order products that are plain or custom printed to feature their brand. We intend to invest further in research and development for our Karat Earth® line to significantly expand our product offering to meet the needs of our customers and the evolving regulatory landscape.
We often are a key supply chain partner integral to the daily operations of our customers. Our ability to quickly provide premium products at competitive prices has typically allowed us to become a trusted supplier to our customers. Through an ongoing feedback loop, as customer demand varies and new needs emerge, we are able to act nimbly and qualify new suppliers quickly to augment our product offering. These capabilities make us a key partner to our customers. 
Focus on distribution and advanced logistics network, complemented by flexible manufacturing capabilities
We consider our increasingly sophisticated distribution capabilities and related strength in logistics to be an important core competency and key differentiator from our competitors. We own a fleet of 26 trucks, 34 trailers, 11 bobtails, one yard goat and 17 chassis, and as of February 2022, employ 45 drivers in our logistics division. 
This model has resulted in more efficient distribution to customers, reducing the need for reliance on third-party logistics providers such as FedEx and United Parcel Service. Our strategically located facilities give us a strong national footprint, which positions us well to serve regions across the U.S. in a timely fashion. We intend to continue to add to our capabilities via further distribution center openings and expansions, the purchase of additional vehicles, the hiring of additional drivers and additional logistics service offerings.
Our California, Texas and Hawaii facilities have a portion of operational capacity dedicated to manufacturing capabilities. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 25% of our revenues were generated from the sale of products manufactured in-house. We view distribution as our primary focus and growth driver while utilizing our manufacturing capabilities as a complement to the base distribution business. This approach allows us to procure products at competitive prices by being able to compare procurement costs versus domestic manufacturing costs to help determine whether it is more efficient to produce ourselves versus relying on suppliers.
Diverse and growing blue-chip customer base
We sell and distribute a broad portfolio of single-use disposable foodservice products to more than 77,000 customers nationwide including leading chain restaurants, distributors, convenience stores, retail establishments and online customers. Our blue-chip customers include leading fast casual chains such as Chili’s Grill & Bar and Chipotle Mexican Grill, as well as fast food chains El Pollo Loco and Panda Express, among others. We intend to further expand our customer base by selling our products to non-traditional foodservice customers, including regional and national supermarket chains, airlines, sports and entertainment venues and other non-restaurant customers. Plans for such expansion are already underway and beginning to yield positive results and a diversification of our customer base.
Significant financial momentum
We continue to achieve strong revenue growth, including growing net sales at a compound annual growth rate of 21.1% over the last five years while significantly improving our margin profile. This margin increase can be attributed primarily to an increase in higher margin business-to-business and e-commerce sales, a shift in product mix to higher margin products (i.e. take-out containers, films, foils and bags), reduced reliance on Chinese suppliers, mitigating the effect of tariffs, and the continued enhancement of operation and manufacturing efficiency.
Experienced and growth-oriented management team
We have assembled a strong executive management team to lead our company in its next phase of growth, supported by a deep bench of functional area leads across the organization. Our co-founders Alan Yu and Marvin Cheng have worked together over the last 20 years to aggressively drive growth across the business. Joanne Wang joined us in 2003 and was appointed Chief Operating Officer in 2018, helping to drive our pricing structure and sales training programs and overseeing general operational functions. Our Chief Financial Officer, Jian Guo, joined us in 2022, bringing years of public company experience to further bolster our finance and accounting functions.
Growth Strategy 
Our goal is to become a leading single-source provider to a broad set of customers for all of their disposable foodservice products and related needs. We plan to continue to grow our business and increase our profitability through the following key initiatives:
Continue to build our e-commerce distribution channel
We believe there is an opportunity to significantly grow our higher margin e-commerce business to a more meaningful percent of revenue by continuing our investments in people, software and technology. By committing additional resources and upgrading our website and online advertising efforts, we expect to enhance our e-commerce experience to better support the needs of our customers. Our e-commerce retail channel is our highest margin channel of distribution. By offering our entire range of products online and bolstering our logistics capabilities, our customers can conveniently order products themselves on an ad hoc basis. We believe that offering free shipping could result in significant increases to our e-commerce revenue, and are evaluating introducing a subscription model similar to Amazon Prime to drive additional growth in this area. 
Disrupt the traditional foodservice supply chain
The traditional foodservice supply chain consists of manufacturers selling through a multi-layer distribution and logistics network before the product reaches the end customer. As a full service distributor ourselves, we are able to provide products directly to the end user, eliminating the need for the traditional multi-layer supply chain. Environmental pressure on single-use disposable plastics is already causing a need for new sources of supply. The Karat Earth® brand is a plant-based line of compostable products that meets the growing demand for renewable and ethically-sourced products. Our nimble operating model can serve customers more quickly than the traditional supply chain, which allows us to react rapidly to customers’ changes in demand.
Grow our base business with incremental revenue from existing customers
We intend to continue to increase penetration within our existing customer base. We believe there is an opportunity to offer additional product lines allowing us to become a true “one-stop” supplier. Our unique ability to serve customers as a reliable supplier with strong customer service at competitive prices has positioned us to be a frequent recipient of requests for proposals from our existing customers as they look for new sources of supply. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our national and regional chains net sales grew 26.7% over the year ended December 31, 2020 as we grew our business with existing customers and added new customers. Offering a larger range of products, coupled with our ability to provide custom specifications and configurations to existing products, will allow us to better serve the needs of our customers and increase retention further. We have historically experienced consistently high customer retention rates as a result of our dedication to our customers and our hands-on approach. For the year ended December 31, 2021 our major customer retention rate, defined as year over year retention of our top 200 customers, was 95%. 
Expand our customer base via new capabilities, geographies, products, services and end markets
We believe our addressable market continues to grow as emerging businesses like Grubhub, Uber Eats, DoorDash and others expand the need for foodservice disposable products. We plan to continue to add new experienced sales team members to broaden our reach and more efficiently provide customer service as we grow. We also intend to add to our distribution capabilities by expanding our existing distribution centers and considering opportunities for additional distribution centers in the United States. In addition, we plan to continuously evaluate and expand our product and service offerings to respond to customer demand and enter new end markets, including sports venues, supermarket chains, airlines and other non-traditional foodservice markets. We see substantial opportunity to further expand our customer base with many individual customers through our select food and drink offerings (i.e. bubble tea, coffee, sauces and syrups) available via our e-commerce channel. In addition, we see significant opportunity with supermarket chains to gain wallet share by providing fruit trays, vegetable containers, compostable meat trays and other related items, all of which are higher margin products than some of our other products.
Pursue strategic acquisitions
We have the opportunity to capitalize on our existing infrastructure and expertise by continuing to selectively pursue opportunistic acquisitions in order to expand the breadth of our distribution and logistics network, increase our operating efficiency and add additional products and capabilities. Although we do not have current plans to pursue a specific acquisition target, we may explore such targets in the next 12 months. We continue to consider and evaluate certain acquisition opportunities across the United States that we expect would enhance our national footprint. Additionally, the potential to acquire existing and new suppliers, particularly in the U.S., may further reduce our reliance on the Asian supply chain, creating more diversified sourcing options for our customers.
Our Industry
The disposable foodservice products industry is large and growing. The primary categories of disposable foodservice products include food packaging, containers, tableware, cups, lids, cutlery, straws, napkins and bags. The large breadth and scope of products is reflected in the diverse nature of the industry participants, which range from large international conglomerates to smaller regional and niche companies. As a result, the industry is represented by a large number of companies and remains highly fragmented. Similarly, end customers of the disposable foodservice products industry are equally diverse in composition. The restaurant and foodservice categories that are the primary purchasers of our products include quick service restaurants, fast casual, convenience stores, specialty drink establishments, casual dining and increasingly, premium casual and family dining restaurants. We estimate our growth to significantly outpace the industry average given our increase in sales of high demand items like take-out containers and bags, our ability to continuously augment our product offering to address customer needs and our avoidance of product categories in decline, including Styrofoam and other materials in the process of being banned under various governmental regulations.
The industry is currently experiencing a period of both growth and transition as a result of several key factors that have emerged in recent years and have accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. These include the growing market for food delivery and take-out dining; new governmental regulations primarily resulting from an increasingly environmentally-conscious public; and growing consolidation within the disposable foodservice products industry. We believe that we will benefit from a continuation of these market trends due to our diverse product offering, customer-centric approach, commitment to environmentally-friendly products and the flexibility of our business model.
Food delivery and take-out
With the growing trend towards at home dining and mobility-oriented e-commerce, food delivery and take-out dining are currently experiencing rapid growth. Data from the National Restaurant Association and Technomic shows that operators are increasingly acknowledging the importance of off-premises dining, with 78% of operators saying off-premises programs are a strategic priority. Based on data from Uber’s acquisition of Postmates, the online delivery market was $19 billion in 2018 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 18.1% to $61 billion by 2025. This growth is driven in large part by e-commerce companies such as Grubhub, Uber Eats, DoorDash and others. We believe the market opportunity will continue to expand for years to come. In order to benefit from this growing market trend, foodservice establishments are actively trying to provide a high quality at-home dining customer experience that is comparable to the in-restaurant experience. Central to this effort is food quality and overall presentation where take-out containers and related products play a critical role. Restaurants are seeking to develop high quality, customized disposables that not only provide the freshest and best possible food experience, but also provide a premium, branded at-home dining experience.
Governmental regulations 
Environmental concerns regarding disposable products broadly have resulted in a number of significant changes that are specific to the foodservice industry, including regulations applicable to our customers. State and local governments have been actively enacting legislation that prohibits certain types of end-products as well as the use of certain raw materials used in manufacturing. In September 2018, the state of California effected legislation that severely restricts the use of plastic straws in full service restaurants beginning January 1, 2019. Similar legislation has been enacted by local governments and municipalities throughout the country. In addition to plastic straws, in July 2018, the city of Seattle banned the use of plastic utensils at all foodservice businesses. Additionally, numerous local legislative prohibitions on the use of single use Styrofoam 
products have been implemented. This includes New York City, where a ban on single use Styrofoam became effective in January 2019 and a state-wide ban on single-use plastic carryout bags became effective in March 2020. As of March 2022, 12 states have passed state-wide legislation regarding single-use plastic bags, and nine states have passed state-wide legislation regarding Styrofoam products. We expect this trend to continue on a national scale as foodservice establishments are looking to source alternative products made from biodegradable materials and other environmentally-friendly options. We believe we are well positioned to benefit from increasing government regulation and environmental concerns given our strong portfolio of sustainable products, including our Karat Earth® line.
Additionally, evolving foreign trade policy by the U.S. federal government has resulted in the imposition of tariffs on a number of imported foodservice disposable products, including those imported from China. To avoid the resulting higher product costs, many domestic purchasers may seek to establish alternative distribution channels and source products from U.S. based manufacturers or from other, non-tariffed countries.
Industry consolidation
Over the last several years, there has been significant consolidation within the industry, both in distribution and manufacturing. This is due in part to larger and more established companies seeking to generate growth and maintain profitability through the expansion of their product offering. As is common in the disposable foodservice products industry, larger companies typically broaden their product portfolio through the acquisition of established companies, rather than building out new product categories organically. As consolidation occurs, existing customers often find themselves facing challenges of changing product availability, discontinuations, increasing prices, support staff turnover and other potential transition-related challenges. These challenges can be highly disruptive to a customer’s business and as a result, the customers often seek out other stable and more reliable channels for product sourcing.
Our Products
We offer a wide selection of high-quality, cost effective food packaging products and disposables.
We work in close collaboration with our customers to develop products to meet the needs unique to their individual businesses. This includes developing containers and food storage items that are both visually appealing and that deliver the best possible food quality and freshness. Additionally, we are able to custom print or label many of our products, to help our customers brand the at home dining experience of their customers. We supply a wide range of products for the foodservice industry, including:
•    food and take-out containers;
•    bags;
•    tableware;
•    cups;
•    lids,
•    cutlery,
•    straws,
•    specialty beverage ingredients;
•    equipment; and
•    gloves.
Karat Earth®
Karat Earth® is our specialty line of environmentally-friendly products that are made from renewable resources that are ethically sourced. We have never used Styrofoam in any of our Karat products. The Karat Earth® line includes food containers, tableware, cups, lids, utensils and straws. Customers can order products that are plain or custom printed to feature their brand.
Our Karat Earth® products are Cedar Grove Certified and Biodegradable Products Institute (BPI) Certified Compostable. Karat Earth® plastic products are made from polylactic acid (PLA) sourced from NatureWorks Ingeo PLA. Ingeo PLA is a non-petroleum based, biopolymer that is manufactured from plant sugars. Due to its material composition, Ingeo PLA is non-volatile, non-toxic and odorless if incinerated.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, net sales of our Karat Earth® products increased by 19.2% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. We intend to invest in research and development for our Karat Earth® line to significantly expand our product offering to meet the needs of our customers and the evolving regulatory landscape. 
Our Distribution and Logistics Network
We sell and distribute our products to over 77,000 customers across the United States. We partner with foodservice establishments of every size, with our customers ranging from large multi-national restaurant chains to regional and smaller-chain establishments. Our customers benefit from our broad product offering which allows them to streamline their procurement process by purchasing all of their disposable goods from a single-source provider. We also sell our products directly to leading restaurant supply companies that distribute products to a wide range of food-service establishments internationally.
Our growing sales force works closely with our customers to tailor the optimal mix of products to meet the unique needs of their businesses. We intend to continue to hire additional sales personnel nationally to expand our sales reach, geographic footprint and increase our penetration into the different market segments of the foodservice industry.
We work closely with our customers to develop an optimal logistics and supply chain solution customized to their businesses. We have built a flexible distribution system which allows our customers to order and receive products on a timely basis based on the real-time needs of their businesses. In addition to regularly scheduled delivery intervals, our customers can order and schedule delivery of products via telephone, facsimile, email or through our online e-commerce platform at www.lollicupstore.com and our storefront on Amazon.com. Our regional warehouses and distribution centers allow us to deliver products on a timely basis to key population centers across the United States. Depending on the needs of our customers, final product delivery to their stores or affiliated distribution centers occurs via courier package delivery or through our company-employed delivery drivers.
E-Commerce Platform
In 2004, we established our e-commerce platform at www.lollicupstore.com, to provide an additional channel for our customers to purchase our products. We have recently made significant investments to establish and grow our e-commerce distribution channel. This channel, utilized primarily by small- and medium-sized businesses, served over 73,000 customers during the year ended December 31, 2021, growing net sales by 51.4% compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. We primarily attribute this growth to increased sales of take-out containers, bags and related products tied to amplified take-out and delivery activity that commenced during the second quarter of 2020 as the U.S. adapted to restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with our increased marketing and promotional efforts. We have recently added a storefront on Amazon.com to complement our www.lollicupstore.com to enable easier and broader access for online customers. We view this as part of a broader acceleration in the shift in consumer preferences towards food delivery and “to-go” ordering, which we expect to continue in the foreseeable future. Our e-commerce channel offers the entire range of our products for online procurement, and we believe it will continue to remain a key growth driver for our business going forward. Additionally, the e-commerce channel enables us to cross market other products to our customers that they may be purchasing from competitors. We are evaluating introducing a subscription model similar to Amazon Prime to drive additional growth in this area.

Corporate Information
We were founded in 2000 by Alan Yu and Marvin Cheng in San Gabriel, California as Lollicup USA Inc., a California corporation. Initially our business was focused on the establishment, franchising and licensing of bubble tea stores nationwide. Considered a pioneer for the bubble tea business in North America, our business grew rapidly from a single Lollicup Tea Café store in 2000 to more than 60 stores in 2006. In order to ensure consistency across our stores, we expanded our focus in 2004 to include the distribution of supplies for the bubble tea industry. In 2013, we sold the retail bubble tea business to certain of Lollicup’s shareholders. In 2014, as a result of a growing demand across the foodservice industry for our packaging goods, we began distributing and manufacturing products under our Karat brand in our California facility. 
In September 2018, we incorporated Karat Packaging Inc. in Delaware, and the Company, Lollicup, and Messrs. Yu and Cheng and the other shareholders of Lollicup (together, the “Lollicup Shareholders”) entered into a share exchange agreement and plan of reorganization whereby the Lollicup Shareholders exchanged their shares of common stock in Lollicup for an equal number of shares of common stock of the Company, resulting in Lollicup becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Our principal executive and administrative offices are located at 6185 Kimball Avenue, Chino, CA 91708, and our telephone number is (626) 965-8882. Our website address is www.karatpackaging.com. For additional historical information about us, see Note 1 — Nature of Operations in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or (the "Exchange Act"), and have elected to take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosure available for smaller reporting companies.
