Item 1. Business
General

BK Technologies Corporation (NYSE American: BKTI) (together with its wholly owned subsidiaries, “BK,” the “Company,” “we” or “us”) is a holding company that, through BK Technologies, Inc., its operating subsidiary, provides two-way radio communications equipment of high quality and reliability. All operating activities described herein are undertaken by our operating subsidiary. 

In business for over 70 years, BK designs, manufactures and markets American-made wireless communications products consisting of two-way land mobile radios (“LMRs”), repeaters, base stations and related components and subsystems. Two-way LMRs can be units that are hand-held (portable) or installed in vehicles (mobile). Repeaters expand the range of two-way LMRs, enabling them to operate over a wider area. Base station components and subsystems are installed at radio transmitter sites to improve performance by enhancing the signal and reducing or eliminating signal interference and enabling the use of one antenna for both transmission and reception. We employ both analog and digital technologies in our products.

Our digital technology is compliant with the Project 25 standard (“P-25”) for digital LMR equipment.  The P-25 has been adopted by representatives from the Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials-International (“APCO”), the National Association of State Technology Directors (“NASTD”), the United States (“U.S.”) Federal Government and other public safety user organizations.  Our P-25 digital products and our analog products function in the very high frequency (“VHF”) (136MHz - 174MHz), ultra-high frequency (“UHF”) (380MHz - 470MHz, 450MHz - 520MHz), and 700-800 MHz bands.  Our P-25 KNG and KNG2 Series mobile and portable digital radios have been validated under the P-25 Compliance Assessment Program (“CAP”) as being P-25 compliant and interoperable with the communications network infrastructure of six of our competitors.  Since we do not provide our own communications network infrastructure, we believe CAP validation provides confidence for federal, state and local emergency response agencies that our products are a viable and attractive alternative for use on the infrastructure of our competitors.

We offer products under the brand name BK Technologies. Generally, BK Technologies-branded products serve the government and public safety markets.

BK Technologies, BKR and BK Radio-branded products consist of high-specification, P-25 compliant, LMR equipment with extensive features and capabilities designed for professional radio users primarily in government, public safety and military applications.

We believe that our products and solutions provide superior value to a wide array of customers with demanding requirements, including, for example, emergency response, public safety, homeland security and military customers of federal, state and municipal government agencies, as well as various commercial enterprises. Our two-way radio products excel in applications with harsh and hazardous conditions. They provide high-specification performance, durability and reliability at a lower cost relative to comparable offerings.

We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on October 24, 1997. We are the resulting corporation from the reincorporation merger of our predecessor, Adage, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation, which reincorporated from Pennsylvania to Nevada effective as of January 30, 1998. Effective on June 4, 2018, we changed our corporate name from “RELM Wireless Corporation” to “BK Technologies, Inc.”

On March 28, 2019, we implemented a holding company reorganization. The reorganization created a new holding company, BK Technologies Corporation, which became the new parent company of BK Technologies, Inc. BK Technologies Corporation’s only significant assets are the outstanding equity interests in BK Technologies, Inc. and any other future subsidiaries of BK Technologies Corporation. The holding company reorganization was intended to create a more efficient corporate structure and increase operational flexibility.

ThinkEquity, a division of Fordham Financial Management, Inc., acted as sole book-running manager for the offering. The net proceeds from the offering have been and will be primarily for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, capital expenditures, operational purposes, strategic investments and potential acquisitions in complementary businesses.

Industry Overview

LMR communications consist of hand-held (portable) and vehicle-mounted (mobile) two-way radios commonly used by the public safety sector (e.g., police, fire, and emergency responders), military and commercial business concerns (e.g., corporate disaster recovery, hotels, airports, farms, transportation service providers, and construction firms), and government agencies within the U.S. and abroad. LMR systems are constructed to meet an organization’s specific communications needs. The cost of a complete system can vary widely, depending on the size and configuration. Likewise, the cost of radio sets can range from under $100 for a basic analog portable, to thousands of dollars for a fully featured P-25 digital unit. Typically, there are no recurring airtime usage charges. Accordingly, LMR usage patterns are considerably different from those for cellular and other wireless communications tools. LMR usage often consists of direct radio-to-radio communications outside of the range of a communication network with one-to-many members of a group. Also, LMR functions with push-to-talk operation (i.e., no call set-up or dialing a phone number is required). LMR communications often consist of multiple short (five second) transmissions between multiple members of a group. For the public safety sector, this is known as Mission Critical Voice. The average useful life of a unit can vary, depending upon the application in which the unit is deployed and its handling.

LMR systems are the most widely-used and longest-used form of wireless dispatch communications in the U.S., having been first placed in service in 1921. LMR was initially used almost exclusively by law enforcement, and all radio communications were transmitted in an analog format. Analog transmissions typically consist of a voice or other signal modulated directly onto a continuous radio carrier wave. Over time, advances in technology decreased the cost of LMR products and increased their popularity and usage by businesses and other agencies. Responding to the growing usage, additional radio frequency spectrum was allocated by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) for LMR use.

More recently, growth of the LMR industry has been limited by several factors such as the maturity of markets, funding and budgets for government and public safety agencies, and limited availability of radio frequency spectrum, which hinders existing users in expanding their systems and potential new users from establishing new systems.

Years ago, as a result of the limited spectrum availability, the FCC mandated that new LMR equipment utilize technology that is more spectrum-efficient. This effectively meant that the industry had to migrate to digital technology. Responding to the mandate, the APCO, the NASTD, the U.S. Federal Government and the Telecommunications Industry Association (“TIA”), in concert with several LMR manufacturers, including BK, recommended a standard for digital LMR devices that would meet the FCC spectrum-efficiency requirements and provide solutions to several problems experienced primarily by public safety users. The standard is called P-25. The primary objectives of P-25 are to: (i) allow effective and reliable communication among users of compliant equipment, regardless of its manufacturer, known as interoperability, (ii) maximize radio spectrum efficiency and (iii) promote competition among LMR providers through an open system architecture.

Although the FCC does not require public safety agencies or any radio users to purchase P-25 equipment or otherwise adopt the standard, compliance with the standard is a primary consideration for government and public safety purchasers. In addition, U.S. Federal Government grant programs that provide assistance in funding for state and local agencies to purchase interoperable communications equipment for first responders strongly encourage and often require compliance with the P-25 standard. Accordingly, although funding for LMR purchases by many government agencies is limited, we believe that, as users upgrade and replace equipment, demand for P-25 LMR equipment will continue to grow. Additionally, the P-25 standard has also been widely adopted in other countries. The migration to P-25 equipment is primarily limited to government and public safety agencies. Radio users in the business and industrial market utilize alternative digital technologies (e.g., Digital Mobile Radio) and analog LMR products.

Presently, the market is dominated by one supplier, Motorola Solutions, Inc., which offers a broader range of products than we do, including multiband radios. However, the open architecture of the P-25 standard is designed to eliminate the ability of one or more suppliers to lock out competitors. Formerly, because of proprietary characteristics incorporated in many LMR systems, a customer was effectively precluded from purchasing additional LMR products from a supplier other than the initial supplier of the system. Additionally, the system infrastructure technology was prohibitive for smaller suppliers to develop and implement. P-25 provides an environment in which users will increasingly have a wider selection of LMR suppliers, including smaller suppliers such as BK.

Description of Products and P-25 CAP Compliance 

We design, manufacture, and market wireless communications equipment consisting of two-way LMRs, repeaters, base stations and related components and subsystems. We do not provide complete, integrated, communications systems and infrastructure. Two-way LMRs can be units that are hand-held (portable) or installed in vehicles (mobile). Repeaters expand the range of two-way LMRs, enabling them to communicate over a wider area. Base station components and subsystems are installed at radio transmitter sites to improve performance by enhancing the signal, reducing or eliminating signal interference and enabling the use of one antenna for both transmission and reception.

We employ both analog and digital technologies in our products. Our digital products are compliant with P-25 specifications. Our P-25 digital products and our analog products function in the VHF (136MHz - 174MHz), UHF (380MHz - 470MHz, 450MHz - 520MHz), and 700-800 MHz bands.

Our P-25 KNG, KNG2 and BKR Series mobile and portable digital radios have been validated under the P-25 CAP as being P-25 compliant and interoperable with the communications network infrastructure of six of our competitors. Since we do not provide our own communications network infrastructure, we believe CAP validation provides confidence for federal, state and local emergency response agencies that our products are a viable and attractive alternative for use on the infrastructure of our competitors.

The P-25 CAP is a voluntary program that allows LMR equipment suppliers to formally demonstrate their products’ compliance with P-25 requirements. The purpose of the program is to provide federal, state and local emergency response agencies with evidence that the communications equipment they are purchasing satisfies the P-25 standard for performance, conformance and interoperability. The program is a result of legislation passed by the U.S. Congress to improve communication interoperability for first responders and is a partnership of the U.S Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”)’s Command, Control and Interoperability Division, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, radio equipment manufacturers and the emergency response community.

Description of Markets

Government and Public Safety Market

The government and public safety market includes military, fire, rescue, law enforcement, homeland security and emergency responder personnel, both domestic and international. In most instances, BK Radio-branded products serve this market and are sold either directly to end-users or through two-way communications dealers. Sales to government and public safety users represented substantially all of our sales for 2021 and 2020. 

Government and public safety users currently use products that employ either P-25 digital or analog technology. However, public safety users in federal, state and local government agencies and certain other countries are migrating to digital P-25 products. The evolution of the standard and compliant digital products is explained in the preceding “Industry Overview” section.

Business and Industrial Market

This market includes enterprises of all sizes that require fast and affordable push-to-talk communication among a discrete group of users, such as corporate disaster recovery, hotels, construction firms, schools and transportation service providers. Users in this market continue to predominantly utilize analog products. We offer products to this market under the RELM brand name. Our sales in this market may be direct to end-users or to dealers and distributors who then resell the products. Our sales to this market represented approximately 3% of our total sales for 2021 and 8% for 2020. 
Engineering, Research and Development

Our engineering and product development activities are conducted by a team of 31 employees. Their primary development focus has been the design of a new line of next-generation P-25 digital products, the BKR Series, which are in the process of supplanting our KNG and KNG2 products. The first product in this line was introduced in August 2020, with additional models planned. The first models in the KNG line were introduced in 2008 and are included on our primary federal contract vehicles. Subsequently, we added UHF and 700-800MHz products, as well as P-25 Phase II TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) trunking. The KNG2 Series was introduced in 2016. Our KNG, KNG2, and BKR products also provide encrypted operation for secured communication, GPS location and network authentication capabilities.

A segment of our engineering team is responsible for product specifications based on customer requirements and participates in quality assurance activities. They also have primary responsibility for applied and production engineering.

For 2021 and 2020, our engineering and development expenses were approximately $8.1 million and $7.9 million, respectively. The increase was primarily attributed to engineering staff expenses, which are focused on new BKR product development initiatives.

Intellectual Property

We presently have no U.S. patents in force, however, we have 6 pending U.S. patent applications. We have registered federal trademarks related to the names “BK Technologies,” “BK Radio” and “Radios for Heroes” and have applied for registration of “BKR.” We rely on trade secret laws and employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights.
Manufacturing and Raw Materials

Our manufacturing strategy is to utilize the highest quality and most cost-effective resources available for every aspect of our manufacturing. Consistent with that strategy, we have successfully utilized a hybrid of Florida-based internal manufacturing capability in concert with outside contract arrangements for different manufacturing processes. In recent years, the breadth of our internal manufacturing capabilities has been expanded. Our outside manufacturing contract arrangements have been managed and updated to meet our present requirements, including increasing relationships with American concerns. This hybrid approach has been instrumental in controlling our product costs, allowing us to be competitive and manage our product costs.

Contract manufacturers produce various subassemblies and products on our behalf. Generally, the contract manufacturers procure raw materials from BK-approved sources and complete manufacturing activities in accordance with our specifications. Manufacturing agreements and purchase orders govern the business relationship with the contract manufacturers. These agreements and purchase orders have various terms and conditions and may be renewed or modified upon agreement by both parties. Their scope may also be expanded to include new products in the future.

We plan to expand our internal manufacturing capabilities and U.S.-based relationships, combined with other American manufacturers and suppliers where it furthers our business objectives. This strategy allows us to effectively manage quality, product costs and lead-times while focusing other resources on our core technological competencies of product design and development. We believe that, in certain circumstances, the use of experienced, high-quality, high-volume manufacturers can provide greater manufacturing specialization and expertise, higher levels of flexibility and responsiveness, and faster delivery of product, all of which contribute toward product cost control. To ensure that products manufactured by others meet our quality standards, our production and engineering team works closely with our contract manufacturers in all key aspects of the production process. We establish product specifications, select the components and, in some cases, the suppliers. We retain all document control. We also work with our contract manufacturers to improve process control and product design and conduct periodic on-site inspections.

We rely upon a limited number of both American and foreign suppliers for several key products and components. Approximately 31% of our material, subassembly and product procurements in 2021 were sourced from seven suppliers. We place purchase orders from time to time with these suppliers and have no guaranteed supply arrangements. In addition, certain components are obtained from single sources. During 2021 and 2020, our operations were not materially impaired due to delays from single-source suppliers. However, the absence of a single-source component could potentially delay the manufacture of finished products. We manage the risk of such delays by securing secondary sources, where possible, and redesigning products in response to component shortages or obsolescence. We strive to maintain strong relationships with all of our suppliers. We anticipate that the current relationships, or others that are comparable, will be available to us in the future.

Seasonal Impact

We may experience fluctuations in our quarterly results, in part, due to governmental customer spending patterns that are influenced by government fiscal year budgets and appropriations. We may also experience fluctuations in our quarterly results, derived, in part, from sales to federal and state agencies that participate in wildland fire-suppression efforts, which may be greater during the summer season when forest fire activity is heightened. In some years, these factors may cause an increase in sales for the second and third quarters, compared with the first and fourth quarters of the same fiscal year. Such increases in sales may cause quarterly variances in our cash flow from operations and overall financial results.
Significant Customers

Sales to the U.S. Government represented approximately 36% and 51% of our total sales for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These sales were primarily to various government agencies, including those within the DHS, the U.S. Department of Defense (“DOD”), the USFS and the U.S. Department of Interior (“DoI”). 
Backlog

Our backlog of unshipped customer orders was approximately $13.1 million and $5.9 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Changes in the backlog are attributed primarily to the timing of orders and their fulfillment, which can be impacted by factors related to our supply chain.
Competition

We compete with other domestic and foreign companies primarily in the North American market, but also internationally. One dominant competitor, Motorola Solutions, Inc., is estimated to have well in excess of half the market for LMR products. We compete by capitalizing on our advantages and strengths, which include price, product quality and customer responsiveness.
Governmental Regulation 

We are subject to various international and U.S. federal, state and local laws affecting our business. Any finding that we have been or are in noncompliance with such laws could result in, among other things, governmental penalties. Further, changes in existing laws or new laws may adversely affect our business and could also have the effect of limiting capital expenditures by our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

In connection with our U.S. Government contracts, we are subject to the U.S. Federal Government procurement regulations that may provide the buyer with the right to audit and review our performance, as well as our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, our business is subject to government regulation based on the products we sell that may be subject to government requirements, such as obtaining an export license or end-user certificate from the buyer, in certain circumstances. If a government audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, or if we are alleged to have violated any laws or regulations governing the products we sell under our government contracts, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with U.S. Federal Government agencies.

Our products are regulated by the FCC in the U.S. and similar agencies in other countries where we offer our products. Consequently, we and our customers could be positively or negatively affected by the rules and regulations adopted from time to time by the FCC or regulatory agencies in other countries. For example, our wireless communications products, including two-way LMRs, are subject to FCC regulations related to radio frequency spectrum. As a result of limited spectrum availability, the FCC has mandated that new LMR equipment utilize technology that is more spectrum-efficient, which effectively meant that the industry had to migrate to digital technology. These types of mandates may provide us with new business opportunities or may require us to modify all or some of our products so that they can continue to be manufactured and marketed, which may lead to an increase in our capital expenditures and research and development expenses.

As a public company, we are also subject to regulations of the SEC and the stock exchange on which we are listed (NYSE American). 

Some of our operations use substances regulated under various federal, state, local and international laws governing the environment and worker health and safety, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the ground, air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites, as well as relating to the protection of the environment. Certain of our products are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws governing chemical substances in electronic products. During 2021, compliance with these U.S. federal, state and local and international laws did not have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. 

Human Capital Resources

As of December 31, 2021, we had 113 employees, most of whom are located at our West Melbourne, Florida facility; 56 of these employees are engaged in direct manufacturing or manufacturing support, 31 in engineering, 15 in sales and marketing, and 11 in headquarters, accounting and human resources activities. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreements, nor has there ever been a labor-related work stoppage. We believe our relations with our employees are good. 

The Company complies with all applicable state, local and international laws governing nondiscrimination in employment in every location in which the Company operates. All applicants and employees are treated with the same high level of respect regardless of their gender, ethnicity, religion, national origin, age, marital status, political affiliation, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability or protected veteran status.

Our mission is to remain deeply rooted in the critical communications industry for all military, first responders, and public safety heroes. Our four guiding principles: growth, tenacious commitment to quality, continuous improvement, and a keen focus on being customer-centric, continuously drive our efforts to be the best partner for our customers, investment for our shareholders, neighbor in our community and to provide an empowering work environment for our employees. 

The Company is committed to the health, safety and wellness of its employees. We have modified our business practices and implemented certain policies at our offices in accordance with best practices to accommodate, and at times mandate, social distancing and remote work practices, including restricting employee travel, modifying employee work locations, implementing social distancing and enhanced sanitary measures in our facilities, and cancelling attendance at events and conferences. In addition, we have invested in employee safety equipment, additional cleaning supplies and measures, re-designed production lines and workplaces as necessary and adapted new processes for interactions with our suppliers and customers to safely manage our operations.
