Item 1.  Business 
Introduction 

The original Buckeye Pipe Line Company was founded in 1886 as part of the Standard Oil Company (“Standard Oil”) and became a publicly owned, independent company after the dissolution of Standard Oil in 1911.  Expansion into petroleum products transportation after World War II and subsequent acquisitions thereafter ultimately led to Buckeye Pipe Line Company becoming a leading independent common carrier pipeline.  In 1964, Buckeye Pipe Line Company was acquired by a subsidiary of the Pennsylvania Railroad, which later became the Penn Central Corporation.  In 1986, Buckeye Pipe Line Company was reorganized into a master limited partnership (“MLP”), Buckeye Partners, L.P. We are a publicly traded Delaware master limited partnership, and our limited partnership units representing limited partner interests (“LP Units”) are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “BPL.”  Buckeye GP LLC (“Buckeye GP”) is our general partner.  Unless the context requires otherwise, references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Partnership” or “Buckeye” are intended to mean the business and operations of Buckeye Partners, L.P. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

We own and operate a diversified global network of integrated assets providing midstream logistic solutions, primarily consisting of the transportation, storage, processing and marketing of liquid petroleum products.  We are one of the largest independent liquid petroleum products pipeline operators in the United States in terms of volumes delivered, with approximately 6,000 miles of pipeline. We also use our service expertise to operate and/or maintain third-party pipelines and terminals and perform certain engineering and construction services for our customers. Our global terminal network comprises more than 115 liquid petroleum products terminals with aggregate tank capacity of over 118 million barrels across our portfolio of pipelines, inland terminals and marine terminals located primarily in the East Coast, Midwest and Gulf Coast regions of the United States as well as in the Caribbean.  Our global network of marine terminals enables us to facilitate global flows of crude oil and refined petroleum products, offering our customers connectivity between supply areas and market centers through some of the world’s most important bulk storage and blending hubs.  Our flagship marine terminal in The Bahamas, Buckeye Bahamas Hub Limited (“BBH”), is one of the largest marine crude oil and refined petroleum products storage facilities in the world and provides an array of logistics and blending services for the global flow of petroleum products.  Our Gulf Coast regional hub, Buckeye Texas Partners LLC (“Buckeye Texas”), offers world-class marine terminalling, storage and processing capabilities. We are also a wholesale distributor of refined petroleum products in certain areas served by our pipelines and terminals.
Recent Developments 
Strategic Review
In November 2018, we announced the completion of a comprehensive review of the Partnership’s near and long-term strategy (the “Strategic Review”), conducted with oversight from the Board of Directors of Buckeye GP (the “Board”). The Strategic Review included an evaluation of various alternatives designed to maximize long-term value for our unitholders by:

• | Maintaining our investment-grade credit rating by reducing leverage;


• | Providing increased financial flexibility, eliminating the need to access the public equity markets to fund planned annual growth capital; and


• | Reallocating capital to the higher return growth opportunities across our remaining assets.

As a result, we have taken the following actions to accomplish these objectives:

(i) | On December 17, 2018, we closed on the $450.0 million sale of a package of non-integrated domestic pipeline and terminal assets. These assets include: (i) our jet fuel pipeline from Port Everglades, Florida to Ft. Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and Miami International Airport; (ii) our pipelines and terminal facilities serving Reno-Tahoe International Airport, San Diego International Airport, and the Federal Express Corporation terminal at the Memphis International Airport; and (iii) our refined petroleum product terminals in Sacramento, California and Stockton, California (the “DPTS asset package”). Proceeds were used to reduce debt in December 2018. 


(ii) | On January 17, 2019, we closed on the sale of our 50% equity interest in VTTI for $975.0 million. Proceeds were used to reduce debt during the first quarter of 2019. 


(iii) | Established a distribution policy that allows us to retain a portion of internally generated cash flow to deploy to investments such that we do not expect to need to access the public equity markets for the foreseeable future.

South Texas Transactions
In April 2018, as part of our strategy to serve the production growth in crude oil and related products from the Permian Basin, we expanded our marine terminal presence in Corpus Christi, Texas through the following transactions: (i) acquired our business partner’s 20% interest in our Buckeye Texas consolidated subsidiary, and (ii) formed a joint venture with Phillips 66 Partners LP (“Phillips 66 Partners”) and Gray Oak Gateway Holdings (“Marathon”) to develop a new deep-water, open-access marine terminal in Ingleside, Texas at the mouth of Corpus Christi Bay (the “South Texas Gateway Terminal” or “STG Terminal”). 
We acquired our partner’s interest in Buckeye Texas for $210.0 million, and as a result we now own 100% of Buckeye Texas. The change in our ownership interest was accounted for as an equity transaction, representing the acquisition of a noncontrolling interest. 
The STG Terminal will be constructed and operated by us. We continue to secure additional minimum volume throughput commitments and storage contracts from customers, and our current plan is to increase the scope of this project from 3.4 million barrels of storage to 6.8 million barrels, based on current contracted throughput and storage volumes. Our construction plan also includes connectivity to multiple pipelines delivering volumes into the Corpus Christi market from growing Permian Basin production and other sources. In addition, we plan to build two deep-water vessel docks capable of berthing very large crude carrier (“VLCC”) petroleum tankers as part of the initial scope of construction. 
The STG Terminal is expected to commence and ramp up operations by mid-2020, and is supported by long-term minimum volume throughput commitments and storage contracts from credit-worthy customers, including our joint-venture partners. We own a 50% interest in the STG Terminal, and Phillips 66 Partners and Marathon each own a 25% interest. The total construction cost for the STG Terminal is estimated on a 100% basis at $480.9 million, or a net of $240.5 million to our interest. During 2018, we invested $42.2 million and committed to fund our proportionate share of the anticipated total construction costs. We account for our interest in STG Terminal, which is included in our Global Marine Terminals segment, using the equity method of accounting. 
Class C Units Issuance and Conversion to LP Units 
In March 2018, we issued approximately 6.2 million Class C Units in a private placement for aggregate gross proceeds of $265.0 million. We used the net proceeds from this offering to reduce the indebtedness outstanding under our $1.5 billion revolving Credit Facility with the SunTrust Bank (the “Credit Facility”), to partially fund growth capital expenditures and for general partnership purposes. 
The Class C Units represented a separate class of our limited partnership interests. The Class C Units were substantially similar in all respects to our existing LP units, except that Buckeye had the option to pay distributions on the Class C Units in cash or by issuing additional Class C Units.
The reduction in our quarterly distribution in November 2018 resulted in the conversion of all 6,714,963 Class C Units outstanding as of September 30, 2018 into LP Units on a one-for-one basis on November 5, 2018. Accordingly, the holders of these newly converted LP Units received a cash distribution of $0.75 per LP Unit, instead of an in-kind distribution of additional Class C Units. There were no Class C Units outstanding as of December 31, 2018. 
 Notes Issuance and Repayments
In January 2018, we issued $400.0 million of junior subordinated notes (“Junior Notes”) maturing on January 22, 2078, which are redeemable at Buckeye’s option, in whole or in part, on or after January 22, 2023. The Junior Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.375% per year up to, but not including, January 22, 2023. Beginning January 22, 2023, the Junior Notes will bear interest at a floating rate based on the Three-Month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 4.02%, reset quarterly. Total proceeds from this offering, after underwriting fees, expenses and debt issuance costs, were $394.9 million. We used the net proceeds from this offering for general partnership purposes and to reduce the indebtedness outstanding under our Credit Facility.

In January 2018, we repaid in full the $300.0 million of 6.050% notes due on January 15, 2018 and $9.1 million of related accrued interest, using funds available under our Credit Facility.
In November 2018, we repaid in full the $400.0 million of 2.65% notes due on November 15, 2018 and $5.3 million of related accrued interest, using funds available under our Credit Facility.
In January 2019, we repaid in full the $250.0 million variable-rate Term Loan due September 30, 2019 (the “Term Loan”). We expect to retire the $275.0 million of 5.50% notes due on August 15, 2019 in the first quarter of 2019. 
VTTI Divestiture 
In November 2018, we executed a definitive agreement to sell our 50% equity interest in VTTI for approximately $975.0 million, excluding transaction costs of approximately $8.0 million, plus a final earnings distribution of $22.6 million. The sale closed in January 2019. As a result, effective September 30, 2018, we recorded our investment in VTTI at its estimated fair value, as determined by the expected proceeds, resulting in a non-cash loss of $300.3 million, which was reported in (loss) earnings from equity investments in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. For additional information, see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Report. 

Business Activities

The following discussion describes the business activities of our business segments, which include Domestic Pipelines & Terminals, Global Marine Terminals and Merchant Services.

The Domestic Pipelines & Terminals, Global Marine Terminals and Merchant Services segments derive a nominal amount of their revenue from U.S. governmental agencies.  All of our operated assets are located in the continental United States, except for our terminals located in Puerto Rico, St. Lucia and The Bahamas and, from time to time, our Merchant Services segment buys and/or sells diesel fuel, butane, and distribution services to third parties at various locations in the Caribbean. The following table shows our consolidated revenue and each segment’s revenue and percentage of consolidated revenue for the periods indicated (revenue in thousands):

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 
 | Revenue | | Percent | | Revenue | | Percent | | Revenue | | Percent

 ____________________________________

(1) | The change in revenue year to year for Merchant Services is largely driven by fluctuations in refined petroleum products prices, as well as changes in sales volumes. See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion. 

Domestic Pipelines & Terminals Segment

The Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment owns a significant interest in and operates approximately 6,000 miles of pipeline located primarily in the northeastern and upper midwestern portions of the United States, and services over 100 delivery locations.  This segment transports primarily liquid petroleum products, including gasoline, jet fuel and a variety of distillates, from major supply sources to terminals and airports located within end-use markets.  The segment also includes 110 active terminals that provide bulk storage and throughput services with respect to liquid petroleum products and renewable fuels, including ethanol, and have an aggregate tank capacity of over 55 million barrels.  In addition, certain terminals provide rail loading/unloading services for a variety of petroleum products.  Over half of the terminals in the Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment are connected to our pipelines.  We generally own property on which the terminals are located. The segment’s geographical diversity, connections to multiple sources of supply, and extensive delivery system help create a stable base business.

Pipelines

The Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment’s pipelines conduct business without the benefit of exclusive franchises from government entities.  Our pipelines generally operate as a common carrier, providing transportation services at posted tariffs and without long-term contracts.  Additionally, we have secured long-term commitments to support our Michigan-Ohio pipeline expansion project and certain other pipeline expansion projects. Demand for the services provided by our pipelines derives from end-users’ demand for liquid petroleum products in the regions served and the ability and willingness of refiners and marketers to supply such demand by deliveries through our pipelines.  Factors affecting demand for liquid petroleum products include price and prevailing general economic conditions.  Many of the factors impacting demand for the services provided by our pipelines are, therefore, partially or entirely beyond our control. Typically, this segment receives liquid petroleum products from refineries, connecting pipelines, and bulk and marine terminals and transports those products to other locations for a fee.

The following table presents product volumes and percentage of products transported by the pipelines in the Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment for the periods indicated (barrels per day (“bpd”) in thousands):

We provide pipeline transportation services in the following states: Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.  The geographical location and description of these pipelines is as follows:

Pennsylvania—New York—New Jersey.  Our operating subsidiary Buckeye Pipe Line Company, L.P. (“BPLC”) serves major population centers in Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey through approximately 825 miles of pipeline.  Liquid petroleum products are received at Linden, New Jersey from 17 major source points and are then transported through two lines to Macungie, Pennsylvania.  From Macungie, the pipeline continues west through a connection with a pipeline owned by our operating subsidiary, Laurel Pipe Line Company, L.P. (“Laurel”), to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and north through eastern Pennsylvania into New York.  In addition, product can also be transported from southeast Pennsylvania to upstate New York. We lease capacity in one of the pipelines extending from Pennsylvania to upstate New York to a major public pipeline company.  Products received at Linden, New Jersey are also transported to commercial liquid petroleum products terminals at Long Island City and Inwood, New York and to Newark Airport, JFK Airport, and LaGuardia Airport. Buckeye Linden Pipe Line Company LLC (“Buckeye Linden”) provides transportation services within New York Harbor. 

A pipeline system owned by our operating subsidiary, Buckeye Pipe Line Transportation LLC (“BPL Transportation”), delivers liquid petroleum products from a refinery located in Paulsboro, New Jersey to destinations in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and upstate New York through approximately 420 miles of pipeline.  A portion of the pipeline system extends from Paulsboro, New Jersey to Malvern, Pennsylvania.  From Malvern, a pipeline segment delivers liquid petroleum products to locations in upstate New York.

The Laurel pipeline system transports liquid petroleum products through a 350-mile pipeline extending westward from three refineries, a marine terminal and a connection to the Colonial pipeline system in the Philadelphia area to locations across Pennsylvania.

Illinois—Indiana—Michigan—Missouri—Ohio.  BPLC, BPL Transportation and our operating subsidiary NORCO Pipe Line Company, LLC (“NORCO”), a subsidiary of Buckeye Pipe Line Holdings, L.P. (“BPH”), transport liquid petroleum products through approximately 1,800 miles of pipeline in northern Illinois, central Indiana, eastern Michigan, western and northern Ohio, and western Pennsylvania. A number of receiving lines and delivery lines connect to a central corridor which runs from Lima, Ohio through Toledo, Ohio to Detroit, Michigan.  Liquid petroleum products are received at refineries and other pipeline connection points near Toledo and Lima, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; and East Chicago, Indiana. Major market areas served include Huntington/Fort Wayne, Indianapolis and South Bend, Indiana; Bay City, Detroit and Flint, Michigan; Cleveland, Columbus, Lima, Warren and Toledo, Ohio; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Our operating subsidiary, Wood River Pipe Lines LLC (“Wood River”), owns liquid petroleum products pipelines with aggregate mileage of approximately 1,000 miles located in the Midwestern United States.  Liquid petroleum products are received from the Wood River refinery in the East St. Louis, Illinois area and transported to the Chicago area (the “Chicago Complex”), to our terminal in the St. Louis, Missouri area and to the Lambert-St. Louis Airport, to delivery points across Illinois and Indiana and to our pipeline in Lima, Ohio, and from the Chicago Complex to the Kankakee, Illinois area.

Other Liquid Petroleum Products Pipelines.  BPLC serves Connecticut and Massachusetts through an approximately 110-mile pipeline that carries liquid petroleum products from New Haven, Connecticut to Hartford, Connecticut and Springfield, Massachusetts.  This pipeline also serves Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Connecticut.  Also, BPL Transportation owns an approximately 650-mile refined product pipeline that originates in Dubuque, Iowa and runs southwest into Missouri and then northwest back into Iowa, serving the Sugar Creek, Missouri, and Council Bluffs and Des Moines, Iowa markets. BPL Transportation also has an approximately 125-mile pipeline that runs from Portland, Maine to Bangor, Maine
Additionally, BPH indirectly owns an approximate 63% interest in the Sabina crude butadiene pipeline (the “Sabina Pipeline”) and owns and operates approximately 25 miles of pipeline, which it leases to third parties, all located in Texas.
Terminals

The Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment’s terminals receive products from pipelines and, in certain cases, barges, ships or trains, and distribute them to third parties, who in turn deliver them to end-users and retail outlets.  This segment’s terminals play a key role in moving products to the end-user market by providing efficient product receipt, storage and distribution capabilities, inventory management, ethanol and biodiesel blending, and other ancillary services including additives injection.  Typically, the Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment’s terminalling facilities consist of multiple storage tanks and are equipped with automated truck loading equipment available 24 hours a day. 
The Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment’s terminals derive most of their revenues from various fees paid by customers.  A throughput fee is charged for receiving products into the terminal and delivering them to trucks, barges, ships or pipelines.  In addition to these throughput fees, revenues are generated by charging customers fees for blending with renewable fuels, injecting additives and providing storage capacity to customers on either a short-term or long-term basis.  Finally, the terminals derive service fees and blending margins from butane blending activities primarily during certain months (generally mid-September through mid-March), whereby butane is blended into various grades of gasoline.  Blending margins depend upon pricing spreads between gasoline and butane, and we use financial derivative instruments to manage the commodity price risk associated with gasoline-to-butane pricing spreads, as deemed necessary.  The fair value of such derivative instruments is recorded in our consolidated balance sheets, with the change in fair value recorded currently in earnings.  These derivative instruments consist primarily of futures contracts cleared on the New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) that are executed and managed by our Merchant Services segment.

The following table sets forth the total average daily throughput for terminals and storage caverns within the Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment for the periods indicated (volume of bpd in thousands):

Buckeye Texas owns storage, petroleum processing and marine terminalling facilities that sit on approximately 730 acres along the Corpus Christi Ship Channel in Corpus Christi, Texas.  The Buckeye Texas facilities have five vessel berths, including three deep-water docks, two 25,000 barrels per day condensate splitters and approximately 6.9 million barrels of liquid petroleum products storage capacity, including a refrigerated and pressurized LPG storage complex, along with rail and truck loading/unloading capabilities. The system also comprises three field gathering facilities with associated storage in the Eagle Ford play and pipeline connectivity that allows Buckeye Texas to receive Permian Basin and Eagle Ford shale crude oil and condensate production directly to the terminalling complex in Corpus Christi. These assets form an integrated system with connectivity from the production in the field to the marine terminal infrastructure and the processing complex in Corpus Christi.
In April 2018, we announced the formation of a joint venture to develop the STG Terminal, a marine terminal to be constructed in Ingleside, Texas and operated by us. Our current plan is to increase the scope of this project from 3.4 million barrels of storage to 6.8 million barrels, based on current contracted throughput and storage volumes. Our construction plan also includes connectivity to multiple pipelines delivering volumes into the Corpus Christi market from growing Permian Basin production and other sources. In addition, we plan to build two deep-water vessel docks capable of berthing VLCCs as part of the initial scope of construction. 
The STG Terminal is expected to commence and ramp up operations by mid-2020, and is supported by long-term minimum volume throughput commitments and storage contracts from credit-worthy customers, including our joint-venture partners. We own a 50% interest in the STG Terminal, and Phillips 66 Partners and Marathon each own a 25% interest. The total construction cost for the STG Terminal is estimated on a 100% basis at $480.9 million, or a net of $240.5 million to our interest. During 2018, we invested $42.2 million and committed to fund our proportionate share of the anticipated total construction costs. We account for our interest in STG Terminal, which is included in our Global Marine Terminals segment, using the equity method of accounting.
Merchant Services Segment

The Merchant Services segment is a wholesale distributor of refined petroleum products in the continental United States and in the Caribbean.  We increase the utilization of our existing pipeline and terminalling assets by marketing refined petroleum products in certain areas served by our pipelines and terminals.  The segment’s customers consist principally of product wholesalers and major commercial users of refined petroleum products including gasoline, natural gas liquids, ethanol, biodiesel and petroleum distillates such as heating oil, diesel fuel and kerosene.  The segment also provides fuel oil supply, butane, and distribution services to customers in the Caribbean.

The Merchant Services segment owns three terminals in Pennsylvania with aggregate storage capacity of approximately 1 million barrels, which are operated by the Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment.  Each terminal is equipped with multiple storage tanks and automated truck loading equipment that is available 24 hours a day.  We also own the property on which the terminals are located.

The following table sets forth the total gallons of refined petroleum products sold by the Merchant Services segment for the periods indicated (in millions of gallons):

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2018 | 2017 | | 2016
Sales volumes | 1,231.7 | | 1,214.8 | | 1,179.7

The Merchant Services segment’s operations are segregated into three categories based on the type of fuel delivered and the delivery method:


• | Wholesale — liquid fuels and propane gas are delivered to distributors and large commercial customers. These customers take delivery of the products using truck loading equipment at storage facilities; 


• | Wholesale Delivered — liquid fuels are delivered to commercial customers, construction companies, school districts and trucking companies through third-party carriers; or via vessel using our marine terminals.


• | Branded Gasoline — gasoline and on-highway diesel fuel are delivered through third-party trucking companies to independently owned retail gas stations under many leading gasoline brands.


The operations of the Merchant Services segment expose us to commodity price risk. The commodity price risk is managed by entering into financial derivative instruments to offset the effect of commodity price fluctuations on the segment’s inventory and fixed price contracts.  The fair value of our derivative instruments is recorded in our consolidated balance sheets, with the change in fair value recorded currently in earnings.  The derivative instruments the Merchant Services segment uses consist primarily of futures contracts traded on the NYMEX for the purposes of managing our market price risk from holding physical inventory and entering into physical fixed-price contracts.  A majority of the futures contracts executed are designated as fair value hedges of our refined petroleum inventory.  The changes in fair value of the hedging instruments and hedged items are both recognized in cost of product sales.  However, hedge accounting has not been elected for all of the Merchant Services segment’s derivative instruments.  Fixed-price purchase and sales contracts are generally economically hedged with financial instruments; however, these instruments are not designated in a hedge relationship.  In the cases in which hedge accounting has not been used for physical derivative contracts, changes in the fair values of the financial instruments, which are included in revenue and cost of product sales, generally are offset by changes in the values of the physical derivative contracts which are also derivative instruments whose changes in value are recognized in product sales or cost of product sales.  In addition, hedge accounting has not been elected for financial instruments that have been executed to economically hedge a portion of the Merchant Services segment’s refined petroleum products held in inventory.  The changes in value of the financial instruments that are economically hedging inventory are recognized in cost of product sales.
Competition and Customers

Competitive Strengths

We believe that we have the following competitive strengths:


• | We operate in a safe, regulatory compliant, and environmentally responsible manner;


• | We own and operate high quality assets that are strategically located;


• | We have stable, long-term relationships with our customers;


• | We own relatively predictable and stable fee-based businesses with opportunistic revenue generating capabilities that support distribution growth; and


• | We maintain a conservative financial position with an investment-grade credit rating.

Domestic Pipelines & Terminals Segment

Generally, pipelines are the lowest cost method for long-haul overland movement of liquid petroleum products.  Therefore, the Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment’s most significant competitors for large volume shipments are other pipelines, some of which are owned or controlled by major integrated oil and gas companies.  Although it is unlikely that a pipeline system comparable in size and scope to the Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment’s pipeline systems will be built in the foreseeable future, new pipelines (including pipeline segments that connect with existing pipeline systems) could be built to effectively compete with the Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment in particular locations.
In addition to competition from other pipelines, the Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment faces competition from trucks and rail in a number of areas that we serve. While their costs may not be competitive for longer hauls or large volume shipments, these sources of transportation compete effectively for smaller volumes in many local areas. The availability of truck or rail transportation places a competitive constraint on the ability of the Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment to increase its market-based and indexed tariff rates.
The Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment also faces competition from marine transportation in some areas. Tankers and barges account for some deliveries into areas that we serve near the East Coast, Great Lakes, Ohio River and Mississippi River. 

10

Privately arranged exchanges of liquid petroleum products between marketers in different locations are another form of competition.  Generally, such exchanges reduce both parties’ costs by eliminating or reducing transportation charges.  In addition, consolidation among refiners and marketers can alter distribution patterns, reducing demand for transportation services in some markets and increasing them in other markets.

The production and use of biofuels may be a competitive factor in that, to the extent the usage of biofuels increases, some alternative means of transport that compete with our pipelines may be able to provide transportation services for biofuels that our pipelines cannot because of safety or pipeline integrity issues.  However, most of our terminals have the necessary infrastructure to blend ethanol with gasoline, and to a lesser extent biodiesel with distillates, and we earn revenue for these services. Biofuel usage may also create opportunities for additional pipeline transportation and blending opportunities, if such biofuels can be transported through our pipelines, although that potential cannot be quantified at present.

The Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment also generally competes with other terminals in the same geographic market.  Many competitive terminals are owned by major integrated oil and gas companies.  These major oil and gas companies may have the opportunity for product exchanges that are not available to the Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment’s terminals.  While the Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment’s terminal throughput fees are not regulated, they are subject to price competition from competitive terminals and alternate modes of transporting liquid petroleum products to end-users such as retail gasoline stations.

Global Marine Terminals Segment

Our Global Marine Terminals segment competes on the basis of geographic location, breadth of services, and price with proprietary or third-party terminal operators as well as with major oil and gas companies and with major pipeline and terminal operators in the energy hubs in which we operate.  We believe that we are favorably positioned to compete in the industry on a global scale due to the quality and safety of our operations, the geographical locations of our facilities, deep drafts, storage capacity, and the variety of ancillary service capabilities of our facilities. The competitiveness of our service offerings, including the rates we charge for our services, is affected by the availability of storage relative to the overall demand for storage in a given market area and could be impacted by the entry of new competitors into the markets in which we operate. However, we believe that significant barriers to entry exist in the marine terminalling business. These barriers include capital costs, execution risk, a lengthy permitting and development cycle, financing challenges, shortage of personnel with the requisite expertise, and a finite number of sites suitable for development.
Our Corpus Christi facility, owned by Buckeye Texas, is fully contracted under long-term, take-or-pay arrangements. There is no current or near-term capacity available for new customers.
Merchant Services Segment

The Merchant Services segment competes with major energy companies, their marketing affiliates and independent gatherers, investment banks that have established trading platforms, master limited partnerships with marketing businesses, and brokers and marketers of widely varying sizes, financial resources and experience.  Some of these competitors have capital resources greater than the Merchant Services segment, and control greater supplies of refined petroleum products.
Customers

For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, no customer contributed 10% or more of our consolidated revenue.  Revenue from Buckeye Texas, which is almost fully contracted to one customer under long-term take-or-pay arrangements, accounted for approximately 47% of total revenue in the Global Marine Terminals segment for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
BBH’s revenue accounted for approximately 25% of total revenue in the Global Marine Terminals segment for the year ended December 31, 2018. Currently, BBH has a limited number of long-term storage customers, consisting of major oil companies, energy companies, physical traders and national oil companies.  For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 33% of BBH’s revenue was derived from its top customer.

Seasonality

The Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment’s mix and volume of products transported and stored tends to vary seasonally.  Declines in demand for heating oil during the summer months are, to a certain extent, offset by increased demand for gasoline and jet fuel.  Overall, this segment’s business has been only moderately seasonal, with somewhat lower than average volumes being transported and stored during March, April and May and somewhat higher than average volumes being transported and stored in November, December and January.

The Merchant Services segment’s mix and volume of product sales tend to vary seasonally, with the fourth and first quarters’ volumes generally being higher than the second and third quarters, primarily due to the increased demand for home heating oil in the winter months.

The Domestic Pipelines & Terminals and Merchant Services segments both benefit from increased sales of heating oil and butane blending activities at our terminals during the winter months.  Blending butane into various grades of gasoline generally increases in the mid-September through mid-March time frame.

The Global Marine Terminals segment’s mix and volume of products stored does not vary significantly by season; however, it can be affected by market structure.
Employees

Except as noted below, we are managed and operated by employees of Buckeye Pipe Line Services Company (“Services Company”).  We reimburse Services Company for the cost of providing employee services pursuant to a services agreement.  At December 31, 2018, Services Company had approximately 1,600 employees, approximately 280 of whom were represented by labor unions.  Additionally, at December 31, 2018, certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries had approximately 250 employees, approximately 150 of whom were employed at our BBH facility.  We have not experienced significant work stoppages or other labor problems. 
Regulation

General

The operation of pipelines, terminals, and associated facilities is subject to extensive laws and regulations, resulting in regulatory oversight by numerous federal, state and local departments and agencies, many of which are authorized by statute to issue binding rules and regulations. In some states, we are subject to the jurisdiction of public utility commissions and state corporation commissions, which have authority over, among other things, intrastate tariffs, the issuance of debt and equity securities, transfers of assets and safety.  The failure to comply with such laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties.  The regulatory burden on our operations increases our cost of doing business and, consequently, affects our profitability.  However, except for certain exemptions that apply to smaller companies, we do not believe that we are affected in a significantly different manner by these laws and regulations than are our competitors.

The following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations affecting us.  However, this discussion should not be relied upon as an exhaustive review of all regulatory considerations affecting our business and operations.

Rate Regulation

Overview.  BPLC, Wood River, BPL Transportation, Buckeye Linden and NORCO operate pipelines subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) under the Interstate Commerce Act, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and the Department of Energy Organization Act.  FERC regulations require that interstate oil pipeline rates be posted publicly and that these rates be “just and reasonable” and not unduly discriminatory.  FERC regulations also enforce common carrier obligations and specify a uniform system of accounts, among certain other obligations.

The generic oil pipeline regulations issued under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 rely primarily on an index methodology that allows a pipeline to change its rates in accordance with an index that the FERC believes reflects cost changes appropriate for application to pipeline rates.  In December 2015, the FERC amended its regulations to change the index to the Producer Price Index (“PPI”) - finished goods plus 1.23% effective July 1, 2016.  

12

The indexing methodology is used to establish rates on the pipelines owned by BPL Transportation and NORCO, and for certain rates charged by Wood River and BPLC, and such rates are therefore subject to change annually according to the index. If the index is negative in a future period, we could be required to reduce these rates if they exceed the new maximum allowable rate.  Shippers may file protests against the application of the index to the rates of an individual pipeline and may also file complaints against indexed rates as being unjust and unreasonable, subject to the FERC’s standards.

Under the FERC’s rules, as one alternative to indexed rates, a pipeline is allowed to charge market-based rates if the pipeline establishes that it does not possess significant market power in a particular market. BPLC charges market-based rates in its competitive markets and index-based rates in certain of its other markets. Buckeye Linden also charges market-based rates in its market. Wood River charges settlement rates in its market. 

Other types of rate regulation.  Laurel operates a pipeline in intrastate service across Pennsylvania, and its tariff rates are regulated by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission.  Wood River operates a pipeline providing some intrastate services in Illinois, and tariff rates related to this pipeline are regulated by the Illinois Commerce Commission.

Environmental Regulation
General

We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Although we believe that our operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations, risks of substantial environmental liabilities are inherent in pipeline, terminalling and processing operations, and we may incur material environmental liabilities in the future. It is possible that other developments, such as increasingly rigorous environmental laws, regulations and enforcement policies, and claims for damages to property or injuries to persons resulting from our operations, could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us. Furthermore, new projects may require approvals and environmental analysis under federal and state laws, including the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act. The resulting costs and delays could materially and negatively affect the viability of such projects. The following is a summary of the significant current environmental laws and regulations to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance may require material capital expenditures or have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position.
Water

The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) amended certain provisions of the federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, commonly referred to as the Clean Water Act (“CWA”), and other statutes, as they pertain to the prevention of and response to petroleum product spills into navigable waters.  The OPA subjects owners of facilities to strict joint and several liability for all containment and clean-up costs and certain other damages arising from a spill. The CWA provides penalties for the discharge of petroleum products in reportable quantities and imposes substantial liability for the costs of removing a spill. State laws for the control of water pollution also provide varying civil and criminal penalties and liabilities in the case of releases of petroleum or its derivatives into surface waters or into the ground.

Contamination resulting from spills or releases of liquid petroleum products sometimes occurs in the petroleum pipeline, terminalling and processing industry. Our pipelines cross, and certain facilities are located near, numerous navigable rivers and streams.  Although we believe that we comply in all material respects with the spill prevention, control and countermeasure and facility response plan requirements of federal laws, any spill or other release of petroleum products into navigable waters may result in material costs and liabilities to us.
Hazardous Substances and Wastes

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), as amended, establishes a comprehensive program of regulation of “hazardous wastes.”  Hazardous waste generators, transporters, and owners or operators of hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal facilities must comply with regulations designed to ensure detailed tracking, handling and monitoring of these wastes.  RCRA also regulates the disposal of certain non-hazardous wastes.  As a result of these regulations, certain wastes typically generated by pipeline, terminalling and processing operations are considered “hazardous wastes,” “special wastes” or regulated solid waste.  Hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements than are non-hazardous wastes.  Changes in any of the RCRA regulations to, for example, expand the universe of regulated wastes or impose more stringent management requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our maintenance capital expenditures and operating expenses. 
13

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), also known as “Superfund,” authorizes the federal and state governments to address the release or threat of release of a “hazardous substance.” Although CERCLA contains a “petroleum exclusion,” that provision generally applies only to unused product not contaminated by contact with other substances, and may exclude product recovered after a release, as well as contact water.  A release of a hazardous substance, whether on or off-site, may subject the generator of that substance or the owner of the property on which the release occurred to joint and several liability under CERCLA for the costs of clean-up and other remedial action.  Pipeline and facility maintenance and other activities in the ordinary course of our business generate “hazardous substances.”  As a result, to the extent a hazardous substance generated by us or our predecessors is released or was released or otherwise disposed of in the past, we may in the future be required to remediate the contaminated property. Governmental authorities such as the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), and in some instances third parties, are authorized under CERCLA to seek to recover remediation and other costs from responsible persons, without regard to fault or the legality of the original disposal.  In addition to our potential liability as a generator of “hazardous substances,” to the extent that our property or right-of-way is affected by a release of hazardous substances such that it becomes part of a Superfund or other hazardous waste site, we may be responsible under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up that site, which could be material.
Air Emissions

The Clean Air Act (“CAA”), amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the “Amendments”), imposes controls on the emission of pollutants into the air.  The Amendments required states to develop facility-wide permitting programs to comply with a wide range of federal air pollution regulatory programs.  States also have their own air pollution regulatory programs that impose permitting and control requirements in addition to the federal requirements. 
Due to differing EPA air quality standards in certain areas of the country, obtaining permits for constructing new emitting facilities or increasing emissions at existing facilities may be more complicated and may require more expensive emission controls than in other areas.
EPA has also promulgated greenhouse gas (“GHG”) regulations and is otherwise increasing its scrutiny of the oil and gas industry.  In addition, certain states and regions have adopted or are considering various GHG regulations which may require controls separate from or in conjunction with federal programs.
It is possible that new or more stringent controls will be imposed on us through these programs which could have a material adverse effect on our maintenance capital expenditures and operating expenses.
State, Local and Foreign Regulations

We are also subject to other environmental laws and regulations adopted by the various states, localities and territories in which we operate.  In certain instances, the regulatory standards adopted by the states and/or territories are more stringent than applicable federal laws.  In addition, our BBH terminal in The Bahamas and our St. Lucia terminal are subject to the environmental regulatory programs applicable in those countries.  While these regulatory programs are today less stringent than in the United States, they have the potential to impose material liabilities on us, particularly in the event of a spill or other release, and if they are made more stringent in the future, we could be required to make significant capital expenditures to meet the new standards.
Pipeline and Terminal Maintenance and Safety Regulation

The pipelines we operate are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”), its agency, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”), and state pipeline regulatory bodies as appropriate and consistent with the federal Pipeline Safety Act (“PSA”). The PSA and PHMSA implementing regulations govern the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of pipeline facilities and require any entity that owns or operates pipeline facilities to comply with applicable safety standards, to establish and maintain plans for inspection and maintenance and to comply with such plans and programs. Among others, these programs include: construction, operation and maintenance, integrity management for pipelines located in high consequence areas, operator qualification, control room management, public awareness, and drug and alcohol. Certain states in which we operate participate in oversight and inspection of intrastate and interstate pipeline facilities through certifications and agreements with PHMSA. For intrastate pipelines located in PHMSA certified states, the State may impose additional or more stringent pipeline safety regulations as long as they are not inconsistent with PHMSA standards. 
14

We believe that we currently comply in all material respects with the pipeline safety laws and regulations. However, the industry, including us, will likely incur additional pipeline and tank integrity expenditures in the future, and we are likely to incur increased operating costs based on the implementation of PHMSA and other government regulations.
The PSA was amended in 2011 and again in 2016. Combined, those statutory amendments have extended the jurisdictional reach of federal pipeline regulation, and mandated additional rulemaking by PHMSA. PHMSA issued two Interim Final Rules in 2016, including its new ability to issue ‘Emergency Orders’ without prior notice or hearing and to establish minimum standards for underground natural gas storage.
In 2017, PHMSA issued final rules to, among other things, address incident notification, which would impact both gas (49 CFR Part 192) and liquid regulations (49 CFR Part 195), and liquid pipeline integrity assessment, integrity management, and leak detection requirements. Rules regarding incident notification, among other things, were issued in January 2017 and became effective in March 2017. PHMSA issued a pre-publication copy of another final rule on liquid pipeline issues in January 2017.  Before that rule became effective, the new Administration issued an Executive Order on January 20, 2017, freezing all pending federal rules.  PHMSA subsequently withdrew the rule in light of the Administration’s Executive Orders on deregulation, but the agency plans to finalize a version of that rule in 2019. Because parts of the new PHMSA rule were directed by Congressional mandates which are to be exempt from the regulatory freeze, it is not yet clear whether and to what extent the final rule will continue to be subject to the regulatory freeze, or be allowed to become effective. The PSA is up for reauthorization again in 2019. Although no new statutory amendments have been proposed, Congress may add new obligations that could result in additional expenditures in the future. 
Safety

We are also subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes.  In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. At qualifying facilities, we are subject to OSHA Process Safety Management regulations that are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals. We believe that our operations comply in all material respects with applicable OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, record-keeping and the training and monitoring of occupational exposures.

We cannot predict whether or in what form any new legislation or regulatory requirements might be enacted or adopted or the costs of compliance. In general, any such new regulations could increase operating costs and impose additional capital expenditure requirements, but we do not presently expect that such costs or capital expenditure requirements would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

Environmental Hazards and Insurance

Our business involves a variety of risks, including the risk of natural disasters, adverse weather, fire, explosions, and equipment failures, any of which could lead to environmental hazards such as crude oil and petroleum product spills and other releases.  If any of these should occur, we could incur legal defense costs and environmental remediation costs, and could be required to pay amounts due to injury, loss of life, damage or destruction to property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations.

We are covered by site pollution legal liability insurance policies with per incident and aggregate limits of $100.0 million, subject to a maximum self-insured retention of $5.0 million.  The policies include coverage for sudden and accidental or gradual releases at our listed sites, and also include a contractor’s pollution coverage endorsement.  The policies insure: (i) claims, remediation costs, and associated legal defense expenses for pollution conditions at, or migrating from, a covered location, and (ii) the transportation risks associated with moving waste from a covered location to any location for unloading or disposal.  The site pollution legal liability policies contain exclusions, conditions, and limitations that could apply to a particular pollution claim, and may not cover all claims or liabilities we incur.  The insurance policies expire on May 1, 2019.

In addition to the site pollution legal liability insurance policies, we maintain excess liability insurance policies that provide coverage for claims involving sudden and accidental releases with aggregate and per occurrence limits of $375.0 million.  Coverage under the excess liability insurance policies is secondary to the site pollution legal liability policies for sudden and accidental releases.  The pollution coverage provided in the excess liability insurance policies contain exclusions, definitions, conditions and limitations that could apply to a particular pollution claim, and may not cover all claims or liabilities we incur.  The insurance policies expire on May 1, 2019.
15

We generally are not entitled to seek indemnification from our contractual counterparties for any environmental damage caused by the release of products we store, throughput or transport for such counterparties. As discussed above, we maintain insurance policies that are designed to mitigate the risk that we may incur in connection with any such release of products from our facilities, and we believe that the policy limits under site pollution legal liability and excess liability insurance policies are within the range that is customary for entities of our size that operate in our business segments and are appropriate for our business.

We attempt to reduce our exposure to third-party liability by requiring indemnification and access to third party insurance from our contractors or entities who require access to our facilities and our right-of-way. We have requirements for limits of insurance provided by third parties which we believe are in accordance with industry standards and proof of third-party insurance documentation is retained prior to commencement of work.

We have written plans for responding to emergencies along our pipeline systems and at our terminalling and processing facilities.  These plans, which describe the organization, responsibilities and actions for responding to emergencies, are reviewed annually and updated as necessary.  Our facilities are designed with product containment structures, and we maintain various additional crude oil containment and recovery equipment that would be deployed in the event of an emergency.  We are a member of oil spill cooperatives or mutual aid groups, and we maintain contract relationships with United States Coast Guard certified spill response organizations, spill response contractors and remediation management consultants.  We also contract with a third-party to provide enterprise-wide emergency spill response services for certain incidents, which includes the strategic staging of response equipment at our BBH, Yabucoa and St. Lucia terminals.  This service contract provides access to additional local United States Coast Guard certified spill response organizations.  This further ensures access to spill response equipment (including boom, recovery pumps, response vehicles, response vessels and response trailers), monitoring and sampling equipment, personal protective equipment and technical expertise needed to respond to an emergency event.  We also perform spill response drills to review and exercise the response capabilities of our personnel, contractors and emergency management agencies.  Additionally, we have a Crisis Management Team within our organization to provide strategic direction, ensure availability of company resources and manage communications in the event of an emergency situation.
