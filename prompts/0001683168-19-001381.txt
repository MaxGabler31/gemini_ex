Our Business
 
Dougherty’s Pharmacy, Inc. (“Dougherty’s,” which is also referred to in this Annual Report as “we,” “us,” or “the Company”) is a value oriented company focused on successfully acquiring, managing and growing community based pharmacies in the Southwest Region. Dougherty’s was incorporated as Ascendant Solutions, Inc. in Delaware on August 8, 2000. On May 10th, 2017, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation to change its name from “Ascendant Solutions, Inc.” to “Dougherty’s Pharmacy, Inc.” to reflect the current focus and operating structure from the previous focus on making equity investments in underperforming or distressed U.S. lower middle-market businesses in the manufacturing, distribution, service, healthcare, finance and retail industries. Since December 31, 2013, the Company investments included its wholly owned subsidiary Dougherty’s Holdings, Inc. (“DHI”), under which it operates its retail pharmacy business and its wholly owned subsidiary ASDS of Orange County, Inc. which operated as a holding company for the investment in CRESA Partners of Orange County, Inc., a tenant representation and real estate advisory services company that was liquidated on February 7, 2017.
 
Effective December 31, 2013, the Company changed its focus to acquire, manage, and grow community-based pharmacies in the Southwest Region of the United States, and since then has engaged in a number of acquisition transactions to expand our pharmacy business and to minimize and ultimately divest our other business interests.
 
On August 4, 2014, DHI acquired the patient prescription files of Family Pharmacy located in Lewisville, Texas.
 
On September 2, 2014, DHI acquired Northeast Compounding Pharmacy, LP (d/b/a Thrifty Health and Compounding Pharmacy), located in Humble, Texas. On May 6, 2017, the Company sold this pharmacy and received total cash proceeds of $274,000 related to this transaction. The revenues and earnings of the pharmacy are not significant to the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.
 
On January 5, 2015, DHI acquired McCrory’s Pharmacy located in El Paso, Texas.
 
On June 29, 2015, DHI acquired Medicine Shoppe Pharmacy, located in McAlester, Oklahoma.
 
On August 31, 2015, DHI acquired Springtown Drug Pharmacy located in Springtown, Texas.
 
On February 7, 2017, CRESA Partners of Orange County, L.P., an affiliate of Cresa Partners-West, Inc. was acquired by Savills Studley, Inc. liquidating the partnership interest held by ASDS of Orange County, Inc. in its entirety. As of December 31, 2016, the estimated value of this investment was recorded at $1,295,000, which represents the estimated future cash payments for this transaction. The Company received $367,500 at closing, recorded $320,000 as a short term other receivable, and recorded the remainder of the Closing Price as a long term receivable due in three increments over 49 months, contingent on certain milestones expected to be achieved.
 
On May 6, 2017, the Company sold its pharmacy in Humble, Texas, acquired in September 2014, and received total cash proceeds of $274,000 related to this transaction. The revenues and earnings of the pharmacy are not significant to the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.
 
On February 6, 2018, the Company opened a new retail pharmacy location at The Campus at Legacy West in Plano, Texas (“Legacy”). This new location will offer pharmacy services and retail products to approximately 3,000 JCPenney Home Office employees and will be open to all other future tenants and visitors of The Campus at Legacy West. Dougherty’s is initially filled prescriptions via concierge service from its pharmacy on Campbell Road until Legacy completed its third party contract enrollment process. First year revenues from the new Legacy location were $146,000. The location was closed on February 4, 2019.

Current Operations. Our wholly owned subsidiary, Dougherty’s Holdings, Inc., owns and operates multiple Dougherty’s Pharmacies, which we operate as a single segment in our financial reporting. The flagship store, Dougherty’s Pharmacy, is a turn-key multi-service pharmacy located in a highly prestigious area of Dallas, Texas. Centrally located, we believe that Dougherty’s Pharmacy continues to provide a level of service not typically provided by national pharmacy chain stores. We fulfill virtually any prescription need, from the simplest to the most complex compounding prescriptions. Most national pharmacy chains do not provide complex pharmacy prescription services. We specialize in providing solutions for our retail customers’ pharmacy needs and also for our customers residing in assisted living facilities. Dougherty’s long history began in 1929 and continues today as one of Dallas’s oldest, largest and best-known full-service pharmacies, which also includes durable medical equipment, home healthcare products services, and health and wellness supplements. We have a customer service oriented philosophy and typically do not attempt to compete solely based on price, as is the case with most of the national pharmacy chains.
 
Additional community pharmacies are located in Dallas, El Paso, and Springtown, Texas and in McAlester, Oklahoma.
 
Plans for Future Acquisitions.
 
Dougherty’s plans for its future growth through continued strategic acquisitions of independent pharmacies (a) that meet our acquisition criteria (“Pharmacy Acquisition Opportunities”), (b) for which we have or can obtain sufficient cash resources to acquire, and (c) for which we have obtained the prior written consent of the lender for the revolving credit facility, OSK VII, LLC.
Acquisition Criteria. We value and seek community-based Pharmacy Acquisition Opportunities that place high value in customer service and patient care. We believe that as we identify and evaluate Pharmacy Acquisition Opportunities, Dougherty’s can offer a unique exit strategy for independent pharmacy owners as they consider their options in selling their pharmacies and monetizing the time and resources that they have deployed in developing their businesses. We believe that our commitment to ensuring that customers of such Pharmacy Acquisition Opportunities continue to receive individualized, personal, and local customer service is a significant factor in independent pharmacy owners’ decision whether to sell, and to whom to sell, their existing businesses.
 
Our criteria when evaluating Pharmacy Acquisition Opportunities, may include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following criteria:
 

· | Annual revenues of $5-10 million;
--+----------------------------------


· | Stable history of profitability and positive cash flow;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


· | Strong management team committed to the business;
--+--------------------------------------------------


· | Established location and customer base;
--+----------------------------------------


· | Single and or multiple store operations; and
--+---------------------------------------------


· | Businesses, or situations, where we can most effectively deploy our net operating loss carryforwards.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We will continue to look for Pharmacy Acquisition Opportunities and to identify, negotiate, and consummate the purchase of Pharmacy Acquisition Opportunities that meet our acquisition criteria, present synergies with our prior acquisitions, and whose acquisition would reasonably be expected to increase stockholder value (each a “Pharmacy Acquisition”); however, our current cash resources are limited. Therefore, we will be required to expend significant executive time to close any purchase of a Pharmacy Acquisition and to handle the transition of ownership and the on-going management of any such Pharmacy Acquisition. We will continue seeking to (1) most effectively deploy our remaining cash and debt capacity (if any), (2) capitalize on the experience and contacts of our officers and directors, and (3) explore other Pharmacy Acquisition Opportunities.

Industry Overview
 
The pharmacy industry is highly competitive and has been experiencing consolidation in recent years. Prescription drugs play a significant role in healthcare and constitute a first line of treatment for many medical conditions. We believe the long-term outlook for prescription drug utilization is strong due, in part, to aging populations, increases in life expectancy, increases in the availability and utilization of generic drugs, the continued development of innovative drugs that improve quality of life and control healthcare costs, and increases in the number of persons with insurance coverage for prescription drugs, including, in the United States, the expansion of healthcare insurance coverage under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”) and “baby boomers” increasingly becoming eligible for the federally funded Medicare Part D prescription program. Pharmaceutical wholesalers act as a vital link between drug manufacturers and pharmacies and healthcare providers in supplying pharmaceuticals to patients.
 
The pharmacy industry relies significantly on private and governmental third party payors. Many private organizations throughout the healthcare industry, including pharmacy benefit management (“PBM”) companies and health insurance companies, have consolidated in recent years to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater bargaining power. Third party payors, including the Medicare Part D plans and the state-sponsored Medicaid and related managed care Medicaid agencies can change eligibility requirements or reduce certain reimbursement rates. Changes in law or regulation also can impact reimbursement rates and terms. For example, the ACA seeks to reduce federal spending by altering the Medicaid reimbursement formula (“AMP”) for multi-source drugs in the United States. These changes generally are expected to reduce Medicaid reimbursements. State Medicaid programs are also expected to continue to seek reductions in reimbursements independent of AMP. When third party payors or governmental authorities take actions that restrict eligibility or reduce prices or reimbursement rates, sales and margins in the pharmacy industry could be reduced, which would adversely affect industry profitability. In some cases, these possible adverse effects may be partially or entirely offset by controlling inventory costs and other expenses, dispensing more higher margin generics, finding new revenue streams through pharmacy services or other offerings and/or dispensing a greater volume of prescriptions.
 
Generic prescription drugs have continued to help lower overall costs for customers and third party payors. We expect the utilization of generic pharmaceuticals to continue to increase. In general, generic versions of drugs generate lower sales dollars per prescription, but higher gross profit dollars, as compared with patent-protected brand name drugs. The positive impact on pharmacy gross profit dollars can be significant in the first several months after a generic version of a drug is first allowed to compete with the branded version, which is generally referred to as a “generic conversion”. In any given year, the number of major brand name drugs that undergo a conversion from branded to generic status can vary and the timing of generic conversions can be difficult to predict, which can have a significant impact on retail pharmacy sales and gross profit dollars.
 
We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements and other pressures will continue to cause the industry in which we compete to evolve. Pharmacists are on the frontlines of the healthcare delivery system, and we believe rising healthcare costs and the limited supply of primary care physicians present new opportunities for pharmacists and retail pharmacies to play an even greater role in driving positive outcomes for patients and payors through expanded service offerings such as immunizations and other preventive care, healthcare clinics, pharmacist-led medication therapy management and chronic condition management.
 
Pharmacy Revenue 
 
Our sales, and gross profit are impacted by, among other things, both the percentage of prescriptions that we fill that are generic and the rate at which new generic drugs are introduced to the market. Because any number of factors outside of our control can affect timing for a generic conversion, we face substantial uncertainty in predicting when such conversions will occur and what effect they will have on particular future periods. The current environment of our pharmacy business also includes ongoing reimbursement pressure and a shift in pharmacy mix towards 90-day at retail (one prescription that is the equivalent of three 30-day prescriptions) and Medicare Part D prescriptions. Further consolidation among generic manufacturers coupled with changes in the number of major brand name drugs anticipated to undergo a conversion from branded to generic status may also result in gross margin pressures within the industry.

We continuously face reimbursement pressure from PBM companies, health maintenance organizations, managed care organizations and other commercial third party payors; our agreements with these payors are regularly subject to expiration, termination or renegotiation. In addition, plan changes with rate adjustments often occur in January and our reimbursement arrangements may provide for rate adjustments at prescribed intervals during their term. We experienced lower reimbursement rates in fiscal 2018 as compared to the same period in the prior year. Further, we accepted lower Medicare Part D reimbursement rates for calendar 2018 compared to calendar 2017 in order to secure preferred relationships with Medicare Part D plans serving senior patients with significant pharmacy needs. We expect this trend to continue.
 
Our 90-day at retail prescription drug offering is typically at a lower margin than comparable 30-day prescriptions, but provides us with the opportunity to increase business with patients with chronic prescription needs while offering increased convenience, helping facilitate improved prescription adherence and resulting in a lower cost to fill the 90-day prescription.
 
Seasonal variations in business
 
Our business is affected by a number of factors including, among others, our sales performance during holiday periods (including particularly the winter holiday season) and during the cough, cold and flu season (the timing and severity of which is difficult to predict), significant weather conditions, the timing of our own or competitor discount programs and pricing actions, and the timing of changes in levels of reimbursement from governmental agencies and other third party payors.
 
Sources and availability of materials
 
We source substantially all of our generic and branded pharmaceutical drugs to fill prescriptions from a single supplier, Cardinal Health 110, Inc. and Cardinal Health 411, Inc. (“Cardinal Health”). We purchase products from Cardinal Health under a long-term prime vendor agreement that was amended in November of 2016 and extends through April 30, 2019. The Company is currently in negotiations with Cardinal Health to extend or replace this Agreement prior to its expiration, but we can make no assurances that we will be able to do so or do so on terms that are as favorable or more favorable than those under the current agreement. The current agreement provides the Company with tiered reduced pricing based on purchase volume in the form of rebates. The minimum purchase commitment includes at least 90% of our pharmaceutical product requirements (if carried by Cardinal Health) and at least 90% of our generic pharmaceutical product be purchased from the Cardinal Health Generic Source Product Program. In 2017 and in 2018 we received, certain cash prepayments from Cardinal Health that we are obligated to repay if the agreement is terminated before we have accrued rebate credits in excess of such prepayments. We had no prepayment liabilities under the 2018 advance. Alternative sources for most generic and brand name pharmaceuticals we sell are readily available, and, if necessary, we believe that we could obtain and qualify for a comparative agreement with another national primary vendor for substantially all of the prescription drugs we sell; however, we can offer no assurances that losing Cardinal Health, as our majority supplier, would not result in supply disruptions as we focused on a transition to one or more substitute suppliers, or that such transition would not have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations. We purchase our non-pharmaceutical retail merchandise from numerous manufacturers and wholesalers.
 
Working capital practices
 
Effective inventory management is important to our operations. We use various inventory management techniques, including demand forecasting and planning and various forms of replenishment management. Our working capital needs typically are greater in the months leading up to the winter holiday season. We generally finance our inventory and expansion needs with internally generated funds and short-term borrowings. For additional information, see the Liquidity and Capital Resources section in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations below.
 
Customers
 
We sell primarily to retail customers. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s consolidated sales for any of the periods presented. No single payor accounted for more than 10% of retail prescription revenues in fiscal 2018.
