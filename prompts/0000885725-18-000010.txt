ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Company
Boston Scientific Corporation is a global developer, manufacturer and marketer of medical devices that are used in a broad range of interventional medical specialties. Our mission is to transform lives through innovative medical solutions that improve the health of patients around the world. As a medical technology leader for more than 35 years, we advance science for life by providing a broad range of high performance solutions to address unmet patient needs and reduce the cost of healthcare. When used in this report, the terms "we," "us," "our" and "the Company" mean Boston Scientific Corporation and its divisions and subsidiaries.
Our history began in the late 1960s when our co-founder, John Abele, acquired an equity interest in Medi-tech, Inc., a research and development company focused on developing alternatives to surgery. In 1969, Medi-tech introduced a family of steerable catheters used in some of the world's first less-invasive procedures. In 1979, John Abele joined with Pete Nicholas to form Boston Scientific Corporation, which indirectly acquired Medi-tech. This acquisition began a period of active and focused new product development, innovation, market development and organizational growth. Since then, we have advanced the practice of less-invasive medicine by helping physicians and other medical professionals diagnose and treat a wide range of diseases and medical conditions, and improve patients’ quality of life by providing alternatives to surgery and other medical procedures that are typically traumatic to the body.
Our net sales have increased substantially since our formation. Our growth has been fueled in part by strategic acquisitions designed to improve our ability to take advantage of growth opportunities in the medical device industry and to build depth of portfolio within our core businesses. These strategic acquisitions have helped us to add promising new technologies to our pipeline and to offer one of the broadest product portfolios in the world for use in less-invasive procedures in our core areas of Cardiovascular, Rhythm Management and Medical Surgical (MedSurg). We believe that the depth and breadth of our product portfolio has also enabled us to compete more effectively in the current healthcare environment that seeks to improve outcomes and lower costs. Our strategy of category leadership also enables us to compete in a changing, contracting landscape and position our products with physicians, managed care, large buying groups, governments and hospitals, while also expanding internationally and managing the complexities of the global healthcare market.
Business Strategy
We operate following five strategic imperatives: Strengthen Category Leadership, Expand into High Growth Adjacencies, Drive Global Expansion, Fund the Journey to Fuel Growth and Develop Key Capabilities. We believe that our execution of these strategic imperatives will drive innovation, accelerate profitable revenue growth and increase stockholder value while strengthening our leadership position in the medical device industry. 
We expect to continue to invest in our core franchises and also pursue opportunities to diversify and further expand our presence in strategic growth adjacencies and new global markets. Our approach to innovation combines internally-developed products and technologies with those we may obtain externally through strategic acquisitions, alliances and other investments. Our organic research and development efforts are focused largely on the development of next-generation and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and divisions. In the last several years, we have completed multiple acquisitions to execute this strategy and strengthened our core franchises and expanded into high growth adjacencies and global markets.
To support the achievement of our strategic and organizational objectives, our Enterprise Risk Management program analyzes the key risks inherent in achieving our strategic imperatives so we can anticipate and adapt to potential challenges to preserve and grow shareholder value. Our Board of Directors oversees risk management and focuses on the most significant risks facing the Company including strategic, operational, financial, legal and compliance risks.
Products
In 2017, our products were offered for sale by seven core businesses: Interventional Cardiology, Cardiac Rhythm Management, Endoscopy, Peripheral Interventions, Urology and Pelvic Health, Neuromodulation and Electrophysiology. In 2017, we derived 27 percent of our sales from our Interventional Cardiology business, 21 percent from our Cardiac Rhythm Management business, 18 percent from our Endoscopy business, 12 percent from our Peripheral Interventions business, 12 percent from our Urology and Pelvic Health business, seven percent from our Neuromodulation business and three percent from our Electrophysiology business. Our seven core businesses are organized into three reportable segments: Cardiovascular, Rhythm Management and MedSurg.

The following describes our principal product offerings by reportable segment. In addition, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report for further information on the financial results of our core businesses.
Cardiovascular
Interventional Cardiology
Our Interventional Cardiology business develops and manufactures technologies for diagnosing and treating coronary artery disease and other cardiovascular disorders including structural heart conditions. Our broad, innovative product offerings have enabled us to become a leader in the global interventional cardiology market.
Drug-Eluting Coronary Stent Systems 
Our drug-eluting coronary stent product offerings are an important element of our global Interventional Cardiology market leadership. We believe we have enhanced the outcomes associated with the use of coronary stents, particularly the processes that lead to restenosis (the growth of neointimal tissue within an artery after angioplasty and stenting), through our scientific research and product development of drug-eluting stent systems. Our coronary stent offerings include:

• | our SYNERGY™ Everolimus-Eluting Platinum Chromium Coronary Stent System, featuring an ultra-thin abluminal (outer) bioabsorbable polymer coating and


• | our Promus PREMIER™ and Promus™ Element™ Everolimus-Eluting Stents.

WATCHMAN is the first device to offer an alternative to warfarin that has been studied in a randomized clinical trial and is marketed globally. The WATCHMAN device has been commercially available internationally since 2009 and is the leading device 
 4

in percutaneous LAAC globally. In March 2015, the WATCHMAN device received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to treat patients who are at an elevated risk of stroke, deemed suitable for warfarin and have appropriate rationale to seek a non-pharmacologic alternative to warfarin. We believe that the WATCHMAN device will be the only LAAC technology commercially available in the U.S. for multiple years.
On May 16, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Symetis SA (Symetis), a privately-held Swiss structural heart company focused on minimally-invasive transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) devices. Through this acquisition, we began selling our ACURATE neo Aortic Valve throughout Europe and now offer both transfemoral and transapical delivery systems. The ACURATE neo Aortic Valve features a highly deliverable catheter and intuitive "top-down" implantation approach for a stable, predictable procedure. We are also developing the ACURATE neo2™ Aortic Valve System, which features an enhanced outer sealing skirt. We are in the process of integrating Symetis into our Interventional Cardiology business and expect the integration to be substantially complete by the end of 2018.
In addition, the Lotus™ Valve System and next generation Lotus EDGE™ Valve System are TAVR products based on a mechanically-expanded architecture and are investigational devices within our structural heart portfolio, which are not currently commercially available. If we are able to address certain technical and regulatory hurdles, our goal is to return the Lotus EDGE Valve System to market.

Research and Development
Our investment in research and development is critical to driving our future growth. We expended $997 million on research and development in 2017, $920 million in 2016 and $876 million in 2015. Our investment in research and development reflects the following:

• | internal research and development programs, regulatory design and clinical science, as well as other programs obtained through our strategic acquisitions and alliances and


• | engineering efforts that incorporate customer feedback into continuous improvement efforts for currently marketed and next-generation products.

We have directed our development efforts toward innovative technologies designed to expand current markets or enter adjacent markets. We are transforming how we conduct research and development and are scrutinizing our cost structure, which we believe will enable increased development activity and faster concept-to-market timelines.
 8

Focused, cross-functional teams take a formal approach to new product design and development, helping us to manufacture and offer innovative products in a consistently and efficiently. Involving cross-functional teams early in the process is the cornerstone of our product development cycle. We believe this collaboration allows our teams to concentrate resources on the most viable and clinically relevant new products and technologies and maximize cost and time savings as we bring them to market. 
In addition to internal development, we work with hundreds of leading research institutions, universities and clinicians around the world to develop, evaluate and clinically test our products. We are expanding our collaborations to include research and development teams in emerging markets; these teams will focus on both global and local market requirements at a lower cost of development. We believe that these efforts will play a significant role in our future success.
Marketing and Sales
In 2017, we marketed our products and solutions to approximately 36,000 hospitals, clinics, outpatient facilities and medical offices in the U.S. and in approximately125 countries worldwide. The majority of our net sales are derived from countries in which we have direct sales organizations. We also have a network of distributors and dealers who offer our products in certain countries and markets. We expect to continue to leverage our infrastructure in markets where commercially appropriate and use third party distributors in those markets where it is not economical or strategic to establish or maintain a direct presence. No single institution accounted for more than ten percent of our net sales in 2017, 2016 or 2015; however, large group purchasing organizations, hospital networks and other buying groups have become increasingly important to our business and represent a substantial portion of our net sales. We have a dedicated corporate accounts organization in the U.S. and Europe focused principally on selling to major buying groups and integrated healthcare networks. We consistently strive to understand and exceed the expectations of our customers. Each of our businesses maintains dedicated sales forces and marketing teams focused on physicians who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of different medical conditions, as well as on key hospital service line administrators, like the Cardiovascular Service Line Administrator. We believe that this dual focus on disease state management and hospital administrators enables us to develop highly knowledgeable and dedicated sales representatives and to foster collaborative relationships with both physicians and key service line administrators. We believe that our positive working relationships with physicians, service line administrators and others in the medical industry enable us to gain a detailed understanding of new therapeutic and diagnostic alternatives and to respond quickly to our customers' changing needs. 
International Operations
International net sales accounted for approximately 43 percent of our net sales in 2017, 2016 and 2015. Maintaining and expanding our international presence is an important component of our long-term growth strategy. Through our international presence, we seek to increase net sales and market share, leverage our relationships with leading physicians and their clinical research programs, accelerate the time to bring new products to market and gain access to worldwide technological developments that we can implement across our product lines. In addition, we are investing in infrastructure in emerging markets to strengthen our sales and service capabilities and maximize our opportunities in these countries.
As of December 31, 2017, we had six principal international manufacturing facilities, including three in Ireland, two in Costa Rica and one in Puerto Rico. Approximately 40 percent of our products manufactured in 2017 were produced at these facilities. In the second half of 2017, we opened our regional manufacturing facility in Penang, Malaysia. We also maintain research and development capabilities in Ireland, Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, Germany, India and China. We operate physician training centers in France, Japan, South Africa, Germany, Italy, South Korea, Poland, India and China.
Manufacturing and Raw Materials
We are focused on continuously improving our supply chain effectiveness, strengthening our manufacturing processes and increasing operational efficiencies within our organization. We strive to improve the efficiency of our sourcing operations and to leverage the technical expertise of the broader market by partnering with strategic suppliers. In doing so, we seek to focus our internal resources on the development and commercial launch of new products and the enhancement of existing products. We continue to implement new systems designed to provide improved quality, reliability, service, greater efficiency and lower supply chain costs. We also drive continuous improvement in product quality through process controls and validations, supplier and distribution controls and providing our operations teams with the necessary training and tools. In addition, we remain focused on examining our operations and general business activities to enhance our operational effectiveness by identifying cost-improvement opportunities. 
 9

We remain committed to maintaining prudent investments in supply chain resiliency on an ongoing basis. Our products are designed and manufactured in technology centers around the world, either by us or third parties. We consistently monitor our inventory levels, manufacturing and distribution capabilities and maintain recovery plans to address potential disruptions that we may encounter. Many components used in the manufacturing of our products are readily fabricated from commonly available raw materials or off-the-shelf items available from multiple supply sources; however, certain items are custom made to meet our specifications. We believe that in most cases, redundant capacity exists at our suppliers and that alternative sources of supply are available or could be developed within a reasonable period of time. We also have an on-going program to identify single-source components and to develop alternative back-up supplies and we regularly readdress the adequacy and abilities of our suppliers to meet our needs. As an example, our past investments in supply chain risk reduction led to minimal production impact in the wake of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in 2017. 
Quality Assurance
We are committed to providing high quality products to our customers. Our quality system starts with the initial product specification and continues through the design of the product, component specification process and the manufacturing, sale and servicing of the product. Our quality system is intended to build in quality and process control and to utilize continuous improvement concepts throughout the product life. These systems are designed to enable us to satisfy various international quality system regulations, including those of the FDA with respect to products sold in the U.S. All of our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers are certified under the ISO 13485 quality system standard, established by the International Standards Organization (ISO) for medical devices, which includes requirements for an implemented quality system that applies to component quality, supplier control, product design and manufacturing operations. This certification can be obtained only after a complete audit of a company’s quality system by an independent outside auditor. Maintenance of the certification requires that these facilities undergo periodic re-examination.
Environmental Regulation and Management
We are subject to various environmental laws, directives and regulations both in the U.S. and abroad. Our operations involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes. We believe that sound environmental, health and safety performance contributes to our competitive strength while benefiting our customers, stockholders and employees. We are focused on continuous improvement in these areas by reducing pollution, depletion of natural resources and our overall environmental footprint. Specifically, we are working to optimize energy and resource usage, ultimately reducing greenhouse gas emissions and waste. We are listed on the FTSE4Good Corporate Social Responsibility Index, managed by the Financial Times and the London Stock Exchange, which measures the performance of companies that meet globally recognized standards of corporate responsibility. This listing recognizes our dedication to those standards and it places us in a select group of companies with a demonstrated commitment to responsible business practices and sound environmental policies.
We have obtained ISO 14001:2015 certifications at our major manufacturing plants and Tier 1 distribution centers around the world, as well as our Corporate headquarters in Marlborough, Massachusetts. ISO 14001:2015 is a globally recognized standard for Environmental Management Systems, established by the International Standards Organization, which provides a voluntary framework to identify key environmental aspects associated with our business. Using this environmental management system and the specific attributes of our certified locations in the U.S., Ireland, Costa Rica and the Netherlands, we continue to improve our environmental performance and reduce our environmental footprint.
Competition
We encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which we sell our products and solutions, some from companies that may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do. Our primary competitors include Abbott Laboratories, Medtronic plc and Cook Medical, as well as a wide range of medical device companies that sell a single or limited number of competitive products or participate in only a specific market segment. We also face competition from non-medical device companies, such as pharmaceutical companies, which may offer alternative therapies for disease states that could also be treated using our products.
We believe that our products and solutions compete primarily on their ability to deliver both clinical and economic outcomes for our customers while also continuing to perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures safely and effectively in a less-invasive manner. We also compete on, ease of use, comparative effectiveness, reliability and physician familiarity. In the current environment of managed care, with economically-motivated buyers, consolidation among healthcare providers, increased competition and declining reimbursement rates, we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price, value, reliability and efficiency. We believe the current global economic conditions and healthcare reform measures could continue to put additional competitive 
 10

pressure on us, including on our average selling prices, overall procedure rates and addressable market sizes. We recognize that our continued competitive success will depend upon our ability to: 

• | offer products and solutions that provide differentiated clinical and economic outcomes,


• | create or acquire innovative, scientifically advanced technologies,


• | apply our technology and solutions cost-effectively and with superior quality across product lines and markets,


• | develop or acquire proprietary products and solutions,


• | attract and retain skilled personnel,


• | obtain patent or other protection for our products,


• | obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals,


• | continually enhance our quality systems,


• | manufacture and successfully market our products and solutions either directly or through outside parties and


• | supply sufficient inventory to meet customer demand.

Medical Device Regulatory Approvals
The medical devices that we manufacture and market are subject to regulation by numerous worldwide regulatory bodies, including the FDA and comparable international regulatory agencies. These agencies require manufacturers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution. Medical devices are also generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control based on risk level of the device. 
In the U.S., authorization to distribute a new device can generally be met in one of three ways. The first process requires that a premarket notification (510(k)) be made to the FDA to demonstrate that the device is as safe and effective as, or substantially equivalent to, a legally marketed device (the “predicate” device). Applicants must submit performance data to establish substantial equivalence. In some instances, data from human clinical trials must also be submitted in support of a 510(k) premarket notification. If so, these data must be collected in a manner that conforms to the applicable IDE regulations. The FDA must issue a decision finding substantial equivalence before commercial distribution can occur. Changes to cleared devices that could not significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device can generally be made without additional 510(k) premarket notifications; otherwise, a new 510(k) is required.
The second process requires the submission of a premarket approval (PMA) application to the FDA to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. This approval process applies to most Class III devices and generally requires clinical data to support the safety and effectiveness of the device, obtained in adherence with IDE requirements. The FDA will approve the PMA application if it finds that there is a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended purpose and that the proposed manufacturing is in compliance with the Quality System Regulation (QSR). For novel technologies, the FDA will generally seek input from an advisory panel of medical experts and seek their views on the safety, effectiveness and benefit-risk of the device. The PMA process is generally more detailed, lengthier and more expensive than the 510(k) process.
The third process requires that an application for a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) be made to the FDA for the use of a Humanitarian Use Device (HUD). An HUD is intended to benefit patients by treating or diagnosing a disease or condition that affects, or is manifested in, not more than 8,000 individuals in the U.S. per year. The application submitted to the FDA for an HDE is similar in both form and content to a PMA application, but is exempt from the effectiveness requirements of a PMA. The HUD provision of the regulation provides an incentive for the development of devices for use in the treatment or diagnosis of diseases affecting smaller patient populations.
In the European Economic Area (EEA), we are required to comply with applicable Medical Device Directives, specifically the Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Device Directive and affix a CE Mark on medical devices that will be placed on the market within the EEA. The CE Mark is affixed following conformity assessment and either approval from the appointed independent Notified Body or through self-certification. CE Marking indicates conformity to the applicable Essential Requirements of the relevant Medical Devices Directive. The European Union (EU) Commission published a new Medical Device Regulation in 2017, which repealed the existing Directives and provides a three year transition period. The Medical Device Regulation will change multiple aspects of the existing regulatory framework, such as clinical evidence requirements and introduce several new requirements, such as Unique Device Identification (UDI). Thus, the new Medical Device Regulation significantly modifies and intensifies the compliance burden for industry.
We are also required to comply with the regulations of every other country where we commercialize products before we can launch new products, such as the requirement that we obtain approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) and the China Food and Drug Administration. Many countries that previously did not have medical device regulations, 
 11

or minimal regulations, are now introducing them. For example, India is in the process of implementing new medical device regulations.
The FDA and other worldwide regulatory agencies and competent authorities actively monitor compliance to local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices, record keeping, reporting of adverse events, labeling and promotional practices. The FDA can ban certain medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order repair, replacement or refund of these devices and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Safe Medical Devices Act pertaining to medical devices or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations. Regulatory agencies and authorities in the countries where we do business can halt production in or distribution within their respective country or otherwise take action in accordance with local laws and regulations.
International sales of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. that are not approved by the FDA for use in the U.S., or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements. Exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported. Some countries do not have medical device regulations, but in most foreign countries, medical devices are regulated. Frequently, regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the U.S. due to differing regulatory requirements; however, other countries, such as China for example, require approval in the country of origin first. Most countries outside of the U.S. require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis, generally every five years. The recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and, where needed, conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance. Where recertification applications are required, they must be approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries.
Government Affairs
We maintain a global Government Affairs presence, headquartered in Washington, D.C., to actively monitor and advocate on a myriad legislation and policies impacting us, both on a domestic and an international front. The Government Affairs office works closely with members of Congress and committee staff, the White House and Administration offices, state legislatures and regulatory agencies, embassies and global governments on issues affecting our business. Our proactive approach and depth of political and policy expertise are aimed at having our positions heard by federal, state and global decision-makers, to advance our business objectives by educating policymakers on our positions, key priorities and the value of our technologies. The Government Affairs office also manages our political action committee and works closely with trade groups on issues affecting our industry and healthcare in general.
Healthcare Policies and Reimbursement
Political, economic and regulatory influences around the world continue to subject the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations. Government and private sector initiatives related to limiting the growth of healthcare costs (including price regulation), coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness reviews of therapies, technology assessments and health care delivery structure reforms, are continuing in many countries where we do business. We believe that these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of treatments that can reduce costs, improve efficiencies and/or increase patient access. Although we believe our less-invasive products and technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes, value and cost efficiency, the resources necessary to demonstrate value to our customers, patients, payers and other stakeholders may be significant and new therapies may take a longer period of time to gain widespread adoption.
The impact to our business of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's (ACA) provisions related to coverage expansion, payment reforms and delivery system has been immaterial. The ACA and Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act were enacted into law in the U.S. in 2010. The legislation imposed on medical device manufacturers a 2.3 percent excise tax on U.S. sales of Class I, II and III medical devices beginning in January 2013. In December 2015, the Promise for Antibiotics and Therapeutics for Health Act, or PATH Act, was passed, which included legislation which temporarily suspended the 2.3 percent excise tax until December 31, 2017. In January 2018 another temporary two year suspension of the 2.3 percent excise tax was passed, extending the suspension to December 31, 2019. We have substantially reinvested the amounts we would have expended on this tax into jobs, innovation, research and development, collaborations with universities and other initiatives that will help treat patients and drive revenue growth.
The U.S. Federal government, as part of the ACA and certain state governments have enacted laws aimed at increasing transparency, or "sunshine," in relationships between medical device, biologics and pharmaceutical companies and healthcare professionals 
 12

(HCPs). As a result, we are required by law to report many types of payments and transfers of value provided to HCPs. Certain foreign jurisdictions are currently acting to implement similar laws. Failure to comply with sunshine laws and/or implement and adhere to adequate policies and practices to address changes to legal and regulatory requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations.
As noted below, we expect certain trends to continue placing pressure on pricing in the U.S. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts (TCJA), enacted December 22, 2017 in the U.S., makes changes to the tax treatment of health care expenses and repealed the “individual mandate” to purchase private insurance. These tax law changes may result in changes to insurance coverage and financing of insurance coverage in individual markets. Additional legislation may result in changes to government programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and federal sunshine laws. In addition, the current U.S. Administration is considering a number of administrative policy changes that will likely result in additional changes to insurance coverage, financing of insurance coverage and benefits offered through private insurance in both the employer-sponsored and individual markets. At this point, the impact of potential legislative and administrative changes is unclear because specific changes have not been implemented. Additionally, while the implementation of the medical device tax has further been suspended until December 31, 2019, the status of the tax for sales after December 31, 2019 is not clear. The medical device tax may continue to be suspended, or may be reinstated at the same or at a different level effective January 1, 2020. 
We expect that pricing of medical devices will remain under pressure as alternative payment reform such as prospective payment systems for hospital care, preferential site of service payments, value-based purchasing and accountable care organizations (ACOs) continue to take shape globally. We also expect marketplace changes to place pressure on medical device pricing globally as hospitals consolidate and large group purchasing organizations, hospital networks and other groups continue to seek to aggregate purchasing power. Similarly, governments are increasing the use of tenders, placing pressure on medical device pricing. Some governments also seek to limit the growth of healthcare costs through price regulation. Implementation of cost containment initiatives and healthcare reforms in significant markets such as the U.S., Japan and Europe and other markets may limit the price of, or the level at which reimbursement is provided for, our products, which in turn may influence a hospital’s or physician's selection of products used to treat patients.
Our products are purchased principally by hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers around the world that typically bill various third-party payers, including government programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid in the U.S.) and private insurance payers, for the services provided to their patients. Third-party payers and governments may approve or deny coverage for certain technologies and associated procedures based on independently determined assessment criteria. Coverage decisions by payers for these technologies and associated procedures are based on a wide range of methodologies that may reflect the assessed resource costs, clinical outcomes and economic value of the technologies and associated procedures.
Proprietary Rights and Patent Litigation
We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets and non-disclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property. We generally file patent applications in the U.S. and foreign countries where patent protection for our technology is appropriate and available. As of December 31, 2017, we held more than 19,000 patents and had approximately 6,000 patent applications pending worldwide that cover various aspects of our technology. In addition, we hold exclusive and non-exclusive licenses to a variety of third-party technologies covered by patents and patent applications. In the aggregate, these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business; however, we believe that no single patent, technology, trademark, intellectual property asset or license, except for those relating to our drug-eluting coronary stent systems, is material in relation to our business as a whole.
We rely on non-disclosure and non-competition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary technology. There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry, particularly in the areas in which we compete. We continue to defend ourselves against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the patent rights of others. Additionally, we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights, to protect our trade secrets or know-how and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Accordingly, we may seek to settle some or all of our pending litigation, particularly to manage risk over time. Settlement may include cross licensing of the patents that are the subject of the litigation as well as our other intellectual property and may involve monetary payments to or from third parties. 
We maintain insurance policies providing limited coverage against securities claims and we are substantially self-insured with respect to product liability claims and fully self-insured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims. The absence of significant third-party insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions. See Note J – Commitments and Contingencies to our 2017 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a discussion of intellectual property, product liability and other litigation and proceedings in which we are involved.

Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 29,000 employees, including approximately 14,000 in operations, 9,000 in selling, marketing and distribution, 4,000 in clinical, regulatory and research and development and 4,000 in administration. Of these employees, we employed approximately 15,000 outside the U.S., approximately 8,000 of whom are in the manufacturing operations function.
Community Outreach
We envision what is possible for communities around the world by giving our time and resources to positively impact the lives of others. Guided by our core value of caring, we seek to improve access to healthcare, invest in educational programming for students with limited means and access to opportunities, and support and embrace the spirit of voluntarism within our global workforce, while adhering to strong ethical standards. We are also driven to minimize our impact on the environment, demonstrated by our new commitment to carbon neutrality. Our goal is to achieve a zero carbon footprint in manufacturing operations for all of our products by 2030.
In some parts of the world, access to health information, screening, care and services can be limited. In 2017, we partnered with Project HOPE (Health Opportunities for People Everywhere) and Partners in Health to increase the number of healthcare workers in South Africa, India and Mexico. By increasing the number and proficiency of community healthcare workers, we can impact health outcomes for people today and into the future. In 2017 for example, our global health grants enabled 10 new physicians to be recruited, trained and relocated to Mexico's Chiapas Region. In India, more than 600 community health workers were trained on how to screen and identify diabetes and hypertension, resulting in nearly 12,000 people screened across India. Additionally, more than 100 community health workers were trained on screening protocols for chronic diseases within two districts in South Africa.
We are also inspired by young learners who share our passion for innovation and problem solving. Our employees also work with students around the world and share their passion for Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) through participation in more than 200 STEM events and school programs. Beyond the classroom, our employees provided more than 42,000 hours of community service to make a positive impact at more than 530 global community events in 33 countries.
Supporting five communities where we have a significant business presence, the Boston Scientific Foundation mission is simple: to help expand access to quality health care and educational opportunities for underserved populations. The Boston Scientific Foundation awarded nearly a million dollars in grant awards to more than 67 nonprofit organizations across the U.S. in 2017. With more than 70 employee volunteers who evaluate proposals for the Boston Scientific Foundation Board review and approval, the Boston Scientific Foundation was able fuel innovative solutions to improve access to quality healthcare and create new opportunities for students to learn and achieve.
Seasonality
Our net sales are influenced by many factors, including product launches, acquisitions, regulatory and reimbursement approvals, patient, physician and employee holiday schedules and other macro-economic conditions. While, our net sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality, customer purchases have historically been lower in the first and third quarters of the year.
