Employees
 
Human Capital
 
Bridgeline is dedicated to creating the best digital presence for our customers, and our employees are critical to achieving this mission. In order to continue to design innovative experiences and products and compete and succeed in our highly competitive and rapidly evolving market, we continue to attract and retain experienced and talented employees. As part of these efforts, we strive to offer a competitive compensation and benefits program, foster a community of inclusion and empower individuals to do their best work.
 
As of September 30, 2022, we had approximately 60 full-time employees. Of our full-time employees, approximately 50 were in the United States and the remaining were based in our various international locations. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
 
Compensation and Benefits Program
 
Our compensation program is designed to attract and reward talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to support our business objectives, assist in the achievement of our strategic goals and create long-term value for our stockholders. We provide employees with compensation packages that include base salary, incentive bonuses, and long-term stock option awards tied to the value of our stock price. We believe that a compensation program with both short-term and long-term awards provides fair and competitive compensation and aligns employee and stockholder interests, including by incentivizing business and individual performance (pay for performance), motivating based on long-term company performance and integrating compensation with our business plans. In addition to cash and equity compensation, we also offer employees benefits such as life and health (medical, dental & vision) insurance, paid time off, paid parental leave, and a 401(k) plan.
Customers
 
We primarily serve the following vertical markets that we believe have a history of investing in information technology enhancements and initiatives:
 

● | Distributors and Wholesalers 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Multi-Unit Franchises & Enterprises 
● | Manufacturers 
● | eCommerce Retailers 
● | Industrial Distribution (Electrical, Plumbing, Building, Cleaning, Restaurant, Furniture Suppliers)
● | Health Services and Life Sciences 
● | High Technology (software and hardware)

● | Associations and Foundations

Competition
 
The markets for our products and services, including software for web content management, eCommerce platform software, eMarketing software, web analytics software and digital engagement services are highly competitive, fragmented, and rapidly changing. Barriers to entry in such markets remain relatively low. The markets are significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future.
 
We believe we compete adequately with others and we distinguish ourselves from our competitors in a number of ways, including:
 

● | We believe our competitors generally offer their web application software with an emphasis on a singular focus/function (such as content management only, or commerce only) as compared to the deeply integrated and multi-faceted approach provided by Bridgeline’s platforms.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We believe our competitors can generally only deploy their solutions in either a Cloud/SaaS environment or in a dedicated server environment. The architecture comprising Bridgeline’s platform’s are flexible and some are capable of being deployed in either a Cloud/SaaS or dedicated server environment.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | We believe the majority of our competitors do not provide interactive technology development services that complement their software products. Our ability to develop mission critical websites and online stores on our own deeply integrated platforms provides a quality end-to-end solution.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We believe the interface of the Bridgeline platforms have been designed for ease of use without requiring substantial technical skills from our customers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Finally, we believe the Bridgeline platforms offer a competitive price-to-functionality ratio when compared to our competitors.
