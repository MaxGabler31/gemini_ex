Market overview – The United States wine industry has seen a rapid increase in the number of wineries that are being established throughout the country. From 2009 to 2021, U.S. wineries grew in number from 6,357 to 11,053, according to Statista. and is one of the fastest growing segments in agriculture. U.S. wineries decreased production in 2020, the most recent year such data is available, by 9.7% compared to 2019 according to Statista. The total retail value of wine sales has increased from $26.3 billion in 2000 to $66.8 billion in 2020 according to Statista. According to the report, the U.S. value of Direct to consumer wine shipments grew by 14.9 percent in 2020. Total wine consumption in the United States has grown by 46 percent since 2005. In 2020, one billion gallons of wine were consumed, up from 687 million in 2005. Wine consumption has been increasing in the United States. Since 2005, the average annual consumption per resident has increased by 33 percent to a high of 3.09 gallons in 2020.
 
According to a Wine Analytics report at the end of 2021, the total U.S. wine market was worth $78.3 billion, a 17% increase from the previous year, which Wine Analytics believes were driven by the vaccinated and looser public health restrictions which gave consumers the confidence and opportunities to return to on-premise venues.
 
According to Wine Intelligence Ltd., the total wine drinking population in the U.S. increased to a record high of 118 million in 2019, an increase of 8 million people drinking wine at least once a year compared with 2015. However, the number of consumers drinking wine at least once a month declined by 11 million over that same time period. Wine Intelligence reports this trend is driven by 21-34 year olds who are moderating consumption and switching to other beverages yet Wine Intelligence found that Millennials who are remaining as regular wine drinkers say they are more highly involved, adventurous and higher spending wine drinkers than more mature consumers. According to the Wine Market Council, of U.S. wine consumers in 2019, 56% were female and 44% male with 33% of consumers drinking wine more than once a week. Domestic wine accounted for 66.9% of U.S. sales in 2019 according to Wines & Vines Analytics Report. The five most popular wines in 2019 were chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon, red blends, pinot gris and pinot noir, according to Nielsen.

In 2018, off-premise sales accounted for roughly 81% of the U.S. market with an average bottle price of $10 according to Nielsen. Although direct to consumer (DTC) sales continue to be a fast growing channel in the U.S. market, increasing by 12% in 2018 from 2017 according to Wines & Vines Analytics, DTC sales constituted only a small percentage of overall sales volume representing less than 2% of the total sales volume in the United States in 2018.
 
In a 2018 American Wine Consumer Preference Survey, by Sonoma State University and the Wine Business Institute, American wine consumers from all 50 states were sampled regarding their wine consumption. Of those sampled, 50% reported they consume wine daily or several times per week making them High Frequency Wine Drinkers with 17% reporting that they drink wine once per week and the remaining 33% drinking wine less frequently. Respondents demonstrated a preference for red wine, with 69% listing it as one of their favorites, 67% listing white wine as one of their favorites and 40% listing Rose. Price and brand topped the list of decision-making reasons when purchasing wine for home consumption at 80% and 69% respectively. Of those surveyed 32% listed the most common purchase price being $11 to $15 however 46% indicated that they had paid $50 to $99 a bottle for a special occasion.
 
Rob McMillan, EVP and founder of Silicon Valley Banks Wine Division, in his State of The Wine Industry Report 2020, explains that the wine consumers who fueled the growth of super premium wines, Baby Boomers, are moving into retirement, declining in numbers and per capita consumption. While younger generations represent a substantial opportunity for wine producers, winemakers must make dramatic adjustments in their strategies to reach and appeal to these younger consumer groups with different values or face declining sales and profits.
 
The Companys Board of Directors and Management believe the winerys focus on integrity in winemaking, small scale, storied estate vineyards, environmental stewardship, support for community needs and participatory wine experiences are reflective of the values of a number of prospective, developing wine enthusiasts.
 
The Oregon wine industry – Oregon is a relatively new wine-producing region in comparison to California and France. In 1966, there were only two commercial wineries licensed in Oregon. According to the Oregon Vineyard and Winery Report produced by University of Oregons Institute for Policy Research and Engagement (UOIPRE) in 2020, the most recent year such data is available, the overall number of wineries increased from 908 to 995 with the biggest increases coming from the Willamette Valley, which added 60. Planted acres of wine grape vineyards increased by 2,132 acres from 37,399 to 39,531, an increase of 5.7%, 33,320 acres of which were harvested. Oregon wine grapes produced a 2020 crop with a total value of $158 million, a decrease of 33.6% from 2019 primarily due to lower fruit set and wildfires preceding the 2020 harvest according to UOIPRE. Pinot Noir leads all varieties accounting for 60% of planted acreage and 49% of production. According to UOIPRE, Oregon case sales in 2020 were 4.7 million, which was similar to 2019. UOIPRE reported case sales in dollars for 2020 were approximately $700 million, a 3.8% increase from 2019.
 
Because of climate, soil and other growing conditions, we believe the Willamette Valley in western Oregon is ideally suited to growing superior quality Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, Pinot Gris and Riesling wine grapes. Some of Oregons Pinot Noir, Pinot Gris and Chardonnay wines have developed outstanding reputations, winning numerous national and international awards.
 
Oregon does have certain disadvantages as a wine-producing region. Oregons wines are lesser known to consumers worldwide and the total wine production of Oregon wineries is small relative to California and French competitors. Greater worldwide label recognition and larger production levels give Oregons competitors certain financial, marketing, distribution and unit cost advantages.
 
Furthermore, Oregons Willamette Valley has an unpredictable rainfall pattern in early autumn. If significantly above-average rains occur just prior to the autumn grape harvest, the quality of harvested grapes is often materially diminished, thereby affecting that years wine quality.
  6

 
Finally, phylloxera, an aphid-like insect that feeds on the roots of grapevines, has been found in several commercial vineyards in Oregon. Contrary to the California experience, most Oregon phylloxera infestations have expanded very slowly and done only minimal damage. Nevertheless, phylloxera does constitute a significant risk to Oregon vineyards. Prior to the discovery of phylloxera in Oregon, all vine plantings in the Companys Estate Vineyard, in Turner, Oregon, were with non-resistant rootstock. In 1997, the Company purchased Tualatin Vineyards at the Tualatin Winery, which has phylloxera at its site. All current plantings are with, and all future planting will be with, phylloxera-resistant rootstock at that location. The Company takes commercially reasonable precautions in an effort to prevent the spread of phylloxera to other vineyards.
 
As a result of these factors, subject to the risks and uncertainties identified in this Annual Report, the Company believes that long-term prospects for growth in the Oregon wine industry are excellent. The Company believes that over the next several years the Oregon wine industry will grow at a faster rate than the overall domestic wine industry, and that much of this growth will favor producers of premium, super premium and ultra-premium wines such as the Companys Estate, Elton, Pambrun, Maison Bleue and Griffin Creek brands.
 
2021 Oregon harvest – There is no official data available on the 2021 Oregon harvest as of the date of this report.
 
Company Strategy
 
The Company, one of the largest wine producers in Oregon by volume, believes its success is dependent upon its ability to: (1) grow and purchase high quality vinifera wine grapes; (2) vinify the grapes into premium, super premium and ultra-premium wine; (3) achieve significant brand recognition for its wines, first in Oregon and then nationally and internationally; (4) effectively distribute and sell its products nationally; and (5) continue to build on its base of direct to consumer sales. The Companys goal is to continue to build on a reputation for producing some of Oregons finest, most sought-after wines.
 
Based upon several highly regarded surveys of the U.S. wine industry, the Company believes that successful wineries exhibit the following four key attributes: (i) focus on production of high-quality premium, super premium and ultra-premium varietal wines; (ii) achieve brand positioning that supports high bottle prices for its high quality wines; (iii) build brand recognition by emphasizing restaurant sales; and (iv) develop strong marketing advantages (such as a highly visible winery location, successful support of distribution, and life-long customer service programs).
 
To successfully execute this strategy, the Company has assembled a team of accomplished winemaking professionals and has constructed and equipped the Estate Winery into a 12,784 square foot winery that includes a 12,500 square foot outdoor production area for the harvesting, pressing and fermentation of wine grapes.
 
The Companys marketing and selling strategy is to sell its premium, super premium and ultra-premium cork-finished-wine through a combination of direct sales at the Estate Winery, the McMinnville Tasting Room in McMinnville, Oregon, the Tualatin Estate Tasting Room in Forest Grove, Oregon, the Maison Bleue Tasting Room in Walla Walla, Washington, the Tasting Room in Folsom, California and sales through independent distributors and wine brokers who market the Companys wine in specific targeted areas.
 
The Company believes the location of the Estate Winery next to Interstate 5, Oregons major north-south freeway, significantly increases direct sales opportunities to consumers. The Company believes this location provides high visibility for the Winery to passing motorists, thus enhancing recognition of the Companys products in retail outlets and restaurants. The Company also believe the remodeled Hospitality Center, at the Estate Winery, has further increased the Companys direct sales and enhanced public recognition of its wines.

To remain competitive in the premium, super premium and ultra-premium market, the Company has embarked on a brand expansion project and is in the process of developing a brand and future winery in the Walla Walla AVA under the names Pambrun, Maison Bleue and Metis. This future winery is expected to produce small vintages of Cabernet Sauvignon and other Bordeaux-varietals, under the Pambrun brand, and Syrah and other Rhone-varietals, under the Maison Bleue brand, to compete in the ultra-premium wine market. The Company has released wines under the Pambrun label beginning with the 2015 vintage year and Maison Bleue label beginning with the 2016 vintage. Additionally, the Company has developed a single vineyard brand near Hopewell, Oregon adjacent to the current site of Elton Vineyards to produce wine under the Elton label. This brand produces primarily Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, also for sale in the ultra-premium space. The Company has released wines under the Elton label beginning with the 2015 vintage year. In January 2017, the Company purchased 17 acres, with 15 acres of Pinot Noir planted, south of Dundee, Oregon and alongside Highway 99W. The Company added 3 acres to that property through a lot line adjustment. The Company is in the process of constructing a new sparkling wine facility and tasting room, called Domaine Willamette, at the Bernau Estate Vineyard that will feature the Companys sparkling wines, as well as its other reserve wines, and its biodynamic farming practices.
 
In December 2016 the Company purchased approximately 40 acres in the Dundee, Oregon area for estate vineyard and winery expansion. In 2020 the Company opened a microwinery featuring wine tasting and a custom blending experience under the name Willamette Wineworks, in historic Folsom, California, and began selling wine under the brand name Natoma.
 
Vineyards
 
The Company owns and leases approximately 1,018 acres of land, of which 801 acres are currently planted as vineyards or is suitable for future vineyard planting. The vineyards the Company owns and leases are all certified sustainable by LIVE (Low Input Viticulture and Enology) and Salmon Safe. At full production, the Company anticipates these vineyards would enable the Company to grow approximately 72% of the grapes needed to meet the winerys current production capacity, of 615,000 gallons (258,620 cases), at its Estate Winery.

WVV Estate – Established in 1983, the Companys Estate Vineyard (the Estate Vineyard) is located at the Winery location south of Salem, near Turner, Oregon. The Estate Vineyard uses an elaborate trellis design known as the Geneva Double Curtain. The Company has incurred the additional expense of constructing this trellis because it doubles the number of canes upon which grape clusters grow and spreads these canes for additional solar exposure and air circulation. Research and practical applications of this trellis design indicate that it should improve grape quality through smaller clusters and berries over traditional designs.
 
Tualatin Estate Vineyard – Established in 1973 at the Tualatin Winery location near Forest Grove, Oregon, the Companys Tualatin Estate Vineyards is one of the oldest vineyards in Oregon. It was purchased by the Company in 1997. A series of sale-leaseback transactions split the property into two additional vineyards, and the Company continues to lease and manage the Peter Michael Vineyard and Meadowview Vineyard, located adjacent to the Tualatin Vineyard.
 
Ingram Estate and Elton Vineyard – In 2008, the Company purchased 86 acres near Hopewell, Oregon, for vineyard plantings. Adjacent to the purchased land is an additional 110 leased acres, also for vineyard development. The Company believes the site is ideally situated to grow premium Pinot Noir. The Ingram site is also adjacent to Elton Vineyards, where the Company leases 54 acres of established vineyards.
 
Pambrun Vineyards – In 2015, the Company purchased 42 acres in the Walla Walla AVA near the town of Milton-Freewater, Oregon. Additionally, the Company purchased an additional 45 adjoining acres in 2017. The Company believes this site is ideal to grow Cabernet Sauvignon and other Bordeaux-varietals. Wines produced from this vineyard are sold under the Pambrun label.
 
Loeza Vineyard – The Company purchased 62 acres near Gaston, Oregon in 2014, for vineyard plantings, and believes the site is ideally situated to grow premium Pinot Gris and Pinot Noir. The site is close to Tualatin Vineyards which allows the Company to leverage existing crews for vineyard development and operations.
 
Louisa Vineyard – The Company purchased 53 acres in the Ribbon Ridge sub-AVA in 2016 for vineyard plantings and believes the site is suitable for growing ultra-premium Pinot Noir.
 
Maison Bleue Vineyard – The Company purchased approximately 37 acres in the new Rocks District of Milton-Freewater appellation near Milton-Freewater, Oregon in 2016. Grapes from this vineyard go to the Maison Bleue label.
 
Bernau Estate – The Company purchased approximately 17 acres in Dundee, Oregon in January 2017 comprised of 15 acres of producing Pinot Noir. Additionally, the Company added 3 acres through a lot line adjustment to add to the parcel. The Company leases 17 adjoining acres.
 
Dayton Vineyard – The Company purchased 40 acres in Dayton, Oregon in December 2016. The Company intends to plant vineyards and construct a new winery at this location.
 
Lafayette Vineyard – The Company purchased 36 acres in January 2018.
 
Jory Claim Vineyard – The Company purchased 69 acres south of Salem, Oregon in 2019.
 
Grape Vines – Beginning in 1997, the Company embarked on a major effort to improve the quality of its flagship varietal by planting new Pinot Noir clones that originated directly from the cool climate growing region of Burgundy rather than the previous source, Napa, California, where winemakers believe the variety adapted to the warmer climate over the many years it was grown there.
 
These new French clones are called Dijon clones after the University of Dijon in Burgundy, which assisted in their selection and shipment to a U.S. government authorized quarantine site, and then two years later to Oregon winegrowers. The most desirable of these new Pinot Noir clones are numbered 113, 114, 115, 667, 777 and 943. In addition to certain flavor advantages, these clones ripen up to two weeks earlier, allowing growers to pick before heavy autumn rains. Heavy rains can dilute concentrated fruit flavors and promote bunch rot and spoilage. These Pinot Noir clones were planted at the Tualatin Vineyards with phylloxera-resistant rootstock and the 667 and 777 clones have been grafted onto seven acres of self-rooted, non-phylloxera-resistant vines at the Companys Estate Vineyard.

New clones of Chardonnay preceded Pinot Noir into Oregon and were planted at the Companys Estate Vineyard on phylloxera-resistant rootstock.
 
In 2021, crop yields were below the 7-year average but higher than in 2020 and the Companys producing acres in the Estate Vineyard and Tualatin Estate yielded approximately 242 tons and 184 tons of grapes, respectively. Leased vineyards produced an aggregate of 816 tons of grapes in 2021. Our Ingram Estate produced 172 tons of grapes in 2021. Bernau Estate produced 35 tons of grapes in 2020. Pambrun Vineyard produced 28 tons of grapes in 2021. Loeza Vineyard produced 43 tons of grapes in 2021. Maison Bleue Vineyard produced 30 tons of grapes in 2021.
 
The Company fulfills its remaining grape needs by purchasing grapes from other nearby vineyards at competitive prices. In 2021, the Company purchased an additional 1,522 tons of grapes from other growers. The Company cannot grow enough grapes to meet anticipated production needs, and therefore contracts grape purchases to make up the difference. Contracted grape purchases are considered an important component of the Companys long-term growth and risk-management plan. The Company believes high quality grapes will be available for purchase in sufficient quantity to meet the Companys requirements. Additionally, the Company will continue to evaluate opportunities to plant more acres and purchase properties for future vineyards.
 
Management believes that the grapes grown on the Companys vineyards establish a foundation of quality through the Companys farming practices, upon which the quality of the Companys wines is built. Wine produced from grapes grown in the Companys own vineyards may be labeled as Estate Bottled wines. These wines traditionally sell at a premium over non-estate bottled wines.
 
Viticultural conditions – Oregons Willamette Valley is recognized as a premier location for growing certain varieties of high-quality wine grapes, particularly Pinot Noir, Pinot Gris, Chardonnay and Riesling. The Company believes that the Estate Vineyards growing conditions, including its soil, elevation, slope, rainfall, evening marine breezes and solar orientation are among the most ideal conditions in the United States for growing certain varieties of high-quality wine grapes. The Estate Vineyards grape growing conditions compare favorably to those found in some of the famous Viticultural regions of France. Western Oregons latitude (42o–46o North) and relationship to the eastern edge of a major ocean is very similar to certain centuries-old wine grape growing regions of France.
 
The Estate Vineyards soil type is Jory/Nekia, a dark, reddish-brown, silky clay loam over basalt bedrock, noted for being well drained, acidic, of adequate depth, retentive of appropriate levels of moisture and particularly suited to growing high quality wine grapes.
 
The Estate Vineyards elevation ranges from 533 feet to 800 feet above sea level with slopes from 2% to 30% (predominately 12-20%). The Estate Vineyards slope is oriented to the south, southwest and west. Average annual precipitation at the Estate Vineyard is 41.3 inches; average annual air temperature is 52 to 54 degrees Fahrenheit, and the length of each years frost-free season averages from 190 to 210 days. These conditions compare favorably with conditions found throughout the Willamette Valley viticultural region and other domestic and foreign viticultural regions, which produce high quality wine grapes.
 
In the Willamette Valley, permanent vineyard irrigation generally is not required. The average annual rainfall provides sufficient moisture to avoid the need to irrigate the Estate Vineyard. However, if the need should arise, the Companys Estate property contains one water well which can sustain sufficient volume to meet the needs of the Winery and to provide auxiliary water to the Estate Vineyard for new plantings and unusual drought conditions. At the Tualatin Vineyard, the Company has water rights to a year-round spring that feeds an irrigation pond. The Company has water rights at the Pambrun Vineyard and Maison Bleue Vineyards and has no water rights at Dayton Vineyard, Lafayette Vineyard and Jory Claim Vineyard.
 
Susceptibility of vineyards to disease – The Tualatin Estate Vineyard and the adjacent leased vineyards are known to be infested with phylloxera, an aphid-like insect, which can destroy vines.
 
It is not possible to estimate any range of loss that may be incurred due to the phylloxera infestation of the Companys vineyards. The phylloxera at Tualatin Vineyard is believed to have been introduced on the roots of the vines first planted on the property in the southern most section Gewurztraminer in 1971 that the Company partially removed in 2004. The remaining vines, and all others infested, remain productive at low crop levels. The Company is in the process of gradually replacing infested areas with new, phylloxera-resistant vines.

Winery
 
Wine production facility – The Companys Estate Winery and production facilities are capable of efficiently producing up to 258,620 cases (615,000 gallons) of wine per year, depending on the type of wine produced. In 2021, the Winery produced approximately 206,954 cases (492,043 gallons) primarily from its 2019 and 2020 harvest.
 
The Winery is 12,784 square feet in size and contains areas for processing, fermenting, aging and bottling wine, as well as an underground wine cellar, and administrative offices. There is a 12,500 square foot outside production area for harvesting, pressing and fermenting wine grapes The Company also has a 23,000 square foot storage building to store its inventory of bottled product with a capacity of approximately 135,000 cases of wine. The production area is equipped with a settling tank and sprinkler system for disposing of wastewater from the production process in compliance with environmental regulations.
 
In addition to the production capacity discussed above, the Tualatin Winery has 20,000 square feet of production capacity. This adds approximately 28,000 cases (66,000 gallons) of wine production capacity to the Company. The capacity at the Tualatin Winery is available to the Company to meet any anticipated future production needs.
 
Hospitality facility – The Company has a renovated tasting and hospitality facility of 35,642 square feet (the Hospitality Center) at the Estate Winery. The main floor of the Hospitality Center includes retail sales space with the Estate Tasting Room, dining area and mezzanine, which altogether are designed to accommodate approximately 300 persons for tastings, wine and food pairing meals, public and private events and meetings. An iconic observation tower and tiered decks around the Hospitality Center enable visitors to enjoy the view of the Willamette Valley and the Companys Estate Vineyard. The tiered decks funnel into an outdoor courtyard that hosts many seasonal gatherings. To the south side of the tiered decks the Company has two hospitality suites for overnight accommodations. The Hospitality Center sits above the underground barrel cellar and tunnel that connects with the Winery. The facility includes a basement cellar, tunnel and barrel room of 11,090 square feet to store up to 1,800 barrels of wine for aging in the proper environment.
 
Just outside the Hospitality Center, the Company has a landscaped park setting consisting of terraced lawns for outdoor events. The area between the Winery and Hospitality Center form a 20,000 square foot quadrangle. As designed, a removable fabric top can cover the quadrangle, making it an all-weather outdoor facility to promote the sale of the Companys wines through festivals and social events. Above the Companys working Winery is the Pinot Room and Founders Room, which can accommodate 40 persons and 111 persons, respectively, for public and private events.
 
The Company believes the Hospitality Center and surrounding areas make the Winery an attractive recreational and social destination for tourists and residents, thereby enhancing the Companys ability to sell its wines.
 
Mortgages on properties – The Companys winery facilities at the Estate Winery are subject to two mortgages with an aggregate principal balance of $5,535,096 at December 31, 2021. The two outstanding loans require monthly principal and interest payments of $62,067 for the life of the loans, at annual fixed interest rates of 4.75% and 5.21%, and with maturity dates of 2028 and 2032.
 
Wine production – The Company operates on the principle that winemaking is a natural but highly technical process requiring the attention and dedication of the winemaking staff. The Companys Winery is equipped with current technical innovations and uses modern laboratory equipment and computers to monitor the progress of each wine through all stages of the winemaking process.

Cases produced per ton harvested often vary between years mainly due to the timing of when the cases are produced.
 
Sales and Distribution
 
Marketing strategy – The Company markets and sells its wines through a combination of direct sales at the Winery, directly through mailing lists, and through distributors and wine brokers. As the Company has increased production volumes and achieved greater brand recognition, sales to out of state markets have increased, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of total Company sales.
 
The Company uses a variety of marketing channels to generate interest in its wines. The Company has a highly functional website and maintains social media sites. The Company controls a database of customers for email and direct promotions. The Company continues to submit its wines to competitions and state, regional and national media for editorials and ratings.
 
Direct sales – The Companys Estate Winery is located on a visible hill adjacent to Oregons major north-south freeway (Interstate 5), approximately 2 miles south of the states second-largest metropolitan area (Salem), and 50 miles in either direction from the states first and third-largest metropolitan areas (Portland and Eugene). We believe the unique location along Interstate 5 has resulted in generally greater amount of wines sold at the Estate Winery as compared to the Oregon industry standard. Direct sales from the Winery are a vital sales channel and an effective means of product promotion. The Estate Winery Tasting Room is open daily and offers wine tasting and education by trained personnel. The Company offers by-appointment private tours offering a behind-the-scenes look at the production process of the wines. The Company has one of the largest wine club memberships in Oregon.
 
In 2014, the Company launched daily food pairings to accompany its wines. Led by the Winery Chef, the menu highlights Pacific Northwest inspired dishes paired with the Companys wines. The culinary offering has now expanded to include Pairings Wine Dinners, community-style wine dinners hosted regularly throughout each month. In 2019, the Company added a new experience offered throughout the week called Pairings Exploration that features four wines paired with four small bites to educate guests on food and wine pairing. In December 2021, the Company debuted a new Pinot Noir Clonal Blending experience giving guests the ability to be a winemaker for a day be crafting their own custom blends from barrel.

The Winery has developed a Winery Ambassador program, which connects its Ambassadors with customers throughout the United States and offers personalized wine recommendations and easy ordering by phone or email. The Company sells its wine through its own e-commerce website and direct ships were permissible.
 
The Company also operates four additional tasting rooms; one in historic downtown McMinnville, in the heart of Oregon Wine Country, one at its Tualatin Vineyard (located 30 minutes west of Portland) one in downtown Walla Walla, Washington, and one in Folsom, California.
 
The Company usually holds six major festivals at the Winery each year. In addition, open houses are held at the Winery during major holiday weekends such as Memorial Day and Thanksgiving. Numerous private events, charitable and political events are also held at the Winery.
 
Direct sales produce a higher profit margin because the Company can sell its wine directly to consumers at retail prices rather than to distributors at free-on-board or FOB prices. Sales made directly to consumers at retail prices result in an increased profit margin equal to the difference between retail prices and distributor prices. For 2021 and 2020, direct sales contributed approximately 41.8% and 38.6% of the Companys net sales, respectively.
 
Distributors and wine brokers – The Company uses both independent distributors and wine brokers primarily to market the Companys wines in specific targeted areas. Only those distributors and wine brokers who have demonstrated knowledge of and a proven ability to market premium, super premium, and ultra-premium wines are utilized. The Companys products are distributed in 49 states and the District of Columbia, and there are 3 non-domestic (export) customers. For 2021 and 2020, sales to distributors and wine brokers contributed approximately 58.2% and 61.4% of the Companys revenue from operations, respectively.
 
Tourists – Oregon wineries are a popular tourist destination with many bed & breakfasts, motels and fine dining restaurants available. The Willamette Valley, Oregons leading wine region has approximately 68% of the states wineries and vineyards, is home to approximately 736 wineries and was selected by Wine Enthusiast Magazine as its 2016 Wine Region of the Year. An additional advantage for Willamette Valley wine tourism is the proximity of the wineries to Portland (Oregons largest city and most popular destination). From Portland, tourists can visit the Willamette Valley winery of their choice in anywhere from a 45 minute to a two-hour drive.
 
The Company believes its convenient location, adjacent to Interstate 5, enables the Winery to attract a significant number of visitors. The Winery is approximately a 45-minute drive from Portland and less than one mile from The Enchanted Forest, an amusement park which operates from April through September each year.
 
Dependence on Major Customers
 
Historically, the Companys revenue has been derived from thousands of customers annually. In 2021, sales to one distributor represented approximately 18.1% of total Company revenue. In 2020, sales to one distributor represented approximately 24.0% of total Company revenue.
Competition
 
The wine industry is highly competitive. In a broad sense, wines may be considered to compete with all alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages. Within the wine industry, the Company believes that its principal competitors include wineries in Oregon, California and Washington, which, like the Company, produce premium, super premium, and ultra-premium wines. Wine production in the United States is dominated by large California wineries that have significantly greater financial, production, distribution and marketing resources than the Company. Currently, no Oregon winery dominates the Oregon wine market. Several Oregon wineries, however, are older and better established and have greater label recognition than that of the Company.

The Company believes that the principal competitive factors in the premium, super premium, and ultra-premium segment of the wine industry are product quality, price, label recognition, and product supply. The Company believes it competes favorably with respect to each of these factors. The Company has primarily received Excellent to Recommended reviews in tastings of its wines and believes its prices are competitive with other Oregon wineries. Larger scale production is necessary to satisfy retailers and restaurants demand and the Company believes that additional production capacity will be needed to meet estimated future demand. Furthermore, the Company believes that its estimated aggregate production capacity of 681,000 gallons (286,620 cases) per year at its Estate Vineyards and Tualatin Vineyard locations give it significant competitive advantages over most Oregon wineries in areas such as marketing, distribution arrangements, grape purchasing, and access to financing. The current production level of most Oregon wineries is generally much smaller than the estimated production capacity level of the Companys Wineries. With respect to label recognition, the Company believes that its unique structure as a publicly owned company will give it a significant advantage in gaining market share in Oregon, as well as penetrating other wine markets.
 
Governmental Regulation of the Wine Industry
 
The production and sale of wine is subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau and the Oregon Liquor Control Commission. The Company is licensed by and meets the bonding requirements of each of these governmental agencies. Sale of the Companys wine is subject to federal alcohol tax, payable at the time wine is removed from the bonded area of the Winery for shipment to customers or for sale in its tasting room.
 
In December 2017, the federal government passed comprehensive tax legislation which included the Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform Act. This legislation modified federal alcohol tax rates by expanding the lower $1.07 per gallon tax rate to wines up to 16.0% alcohol content with wines containing higher alcohol levels being taxed at $1.57 per gallon. Additionally, the legislation provides for a $1 credit per gallon for the first 30,000 gallons produced; $0.90 for the next 100,000 gallons; and then $0.535 for up to 750,000 gallons. These modifications were effective January 2020 and have since been made permanent.
 
The Company also pays the state of Oregon an excise tax of $0.67 per gallon for wines with alcohol content at or below 14.0% and $0.77 per gallon for wines with alcohol content above 14.0% on all wine sold in Oregon. In addition, most states in which the Companys wines are sold impose varying excise taxes on the sale of alcoholic beverages. As an agricultural processor, the Company is also regulated by the Oregon Department of Agriculture and, as a producer of wastewater, by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality. The Company has secured all necessary permits to operate its business.
 
Prompted by growing government budget shortfalls and public reaction against alcohol abuse, government entities often consider legislation that could potentially affect the taxation of alcoholic beverages. Excise tax rates being considered are often substantial. The ultimate effects of such legislation, if passed, cannot be assessed accurately. Any increase in the taxes imposed on table wines can be expected to have a potentially adverse impact on overall sales of such products. However, the impact may not be proportionate to that experienced by producers of other alcoholic beverages and may not be the same in every state.
 
Costs and Effects of Compliance with Local, State and Federal Environmental Laws
 
The Company management is strongly focused on environmental stewardship and maintains a variety of policies and processes designed to protect the environment, the public and consumers of its wine. Although much of the Companys expenses for protecting the environment are voluntary, the Company is regulated by various local, state and federal agencies regarding environmental laws. However, these regulatory costs and processes are effectively integrated into the Companys regular operations and consequently do not generally cause significant alternative processes or costs.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2021 the Company had approximately 177 full-time employees and 89 part-time, on call or seasonal employees. In addition, the Company hires additional employees for seasonal work as required. The Companys employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit. The Company believes it maintains positive relations with its employees.
