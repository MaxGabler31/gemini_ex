Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Overview
 We are, based on transaction volume, one of the leading providers of commercial real estate and capital markets services to both the consumers and providers of capital in the commercial real estate industry and one of the largest full-service commercial real estate financial intermediaries in the country. We operate out of 26 offices with approximately 1,074 associates including approximately 392 capital markets advisors. During 2018, we advised on approximately $99.7 billion of completed commercial real estate transactions, a 3.8% increase compared to the approximately $96.1 billion of completed transactions we advised on during 2017.
 Our fully-integrated national capital markets platform, coupled with our knowledge of the commercial real estate markets, allows us to effectively act as a “one-stop shop” for our clients, providing a broad array of capital markets services including:
  
• | Debt placement;
--+----------------


• | Investment advisory;
--+---------------------


• | Distressed debt and real estate owned advisory services;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | Equity placement;
--+------------------


• | Investment banking and advisory services;
--+------------------------------------------


• | Loan sales; and
--+----------------


• | Commercial loan servicing.
--+---------------------------

 Substantially all of our revenues are in the form of capital markets services fees collected from our clients, usually negotiated on a transaction-by-transaction basis. We also earn fees from commercial loan servicing activities. We believe that our multiple product offerings and platform services, diverse client mix, expertise in a wide range of property types and national platform have the potential to create a diversified revenue stream within the commercial real estate sector. Our revenues and net income were $662.0 million and $116.0 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to revenues and net income of $609.5 million and $95.0 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017.
 We have established strong relationships with our clients. Our clients are both consumers of capital, such as property owners, and providers of capital, such as lenders and equity investors. Many of our clients act as both consumers and providers of capital in different transactions, which enables us to leverage our existing relationships and execute multiple transactions across multiple platform services and product offerings with the same clients.
 We believe we have established a reputation for high ethical standards, dedicated teamwork and a strong focus on serving the interests of our clients. We take a long-term view of our business and client relationships, and our culture and philosophy are firmly centered on putting the clients’ interests first.
 
During 2018, we continued to grow our business through expanding our service offerings within our existing offices as well as strategic hires and investments. On July 2, 2018, we invested $25.0 million in mandatorily redeemable preferred stock of M&T Realty Capital Corporation (“M&T-RCC”) in connection with a risk transfer agreement entered into between HFF LP and M&T-RCC (the “Risk Transfer Agreement”), which is expected to enable us to increase our share of Fannie Mae’s Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (“DUS®”) business. Through the Risk Transfer Agreement, we source multifamily property loans to M&T-RCC, which funds the loans through its Fannie Mae DUS® loan platform. In connection with the Risk Transfer Agreement, we indemnify M&T-RCC for their credit recourse obligations associated with loans originated under the Risk Transfer Agreement. Additionally, on September 17, 2018, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, InvestCo, LLC, entered into a securities purchase agreement to facilitate the Company’s $5.5 million investment in Kensington CA, LLC, a third-party provider of service offerings related to derivative product transactions (the “Joint Venture”). Pursuant to the securities purchase agreement and the operating agreement of the Joint Venture, to which the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, HFF InvestCo LLC, is a party, the Company indirectly owns a 50% interest in the Joint Venture and is entitled to a 50% interest in the profits and losses of the Joint Venture.  
 
We operate in the commercial real estate market which is inherently cyclical. We have benefited from the current economic cycle which began after the downturn in late 2007 continuing through 2010. During the downturn, restrictions on the availability of both debt and equity capital created significant reductions of liquidity in, and flow of capital to, many global financial markets including the commercial real estate financial markets in the U.S. Although there is no way to predict the end of the current economic cycle, we currently maintain significant levels of cash in an effort to mitigate risks associated with an economic downturn. Further detail regarding the effect of cyclicality in the credit markets and the commercial real estate markets can be found under the headings “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 HFF, Inc. is a Delaware corporation with its principal executive offices located at 2323 Victory Avenue, One Victory Park, Suite 1200, Dallas, Texas, 75219, telephone number (214) 265-0880.

Reportable Segments
 We operate in one reportable segment, the commercial real estate financial intermediary segment. Our service offerings include debt placement, investment advisory, distressed debt and real estate owned advisory services, equity placement, investment banking and advisory services, loan sales and commercial loan servicing. See “Results of Operations” within Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a discussion of our results.
Our Competitive Strengths
 We attribute our success and distinctiveness to our ability to leverage a number of key competitive strengths, including:
 People, Expertise and Culture
 We and our predecessor companies have been in the commercial real estate business for over 35 years, and our capital markets advisors have significant experience and long-standing relationships with our clients. We employ approximately 392 capital markets advisors with an average of approximately 17 years of commercial real estate transaction experience. The transaction history accumulated among our capital markets advisors ensures a high degree of market knowledge on a macro level, knowledge of commercial real estate markets, long term relationships with the most active investors and a comprehensive understanding of commercial real estate capital markets products. Our employees come from a wide range of real estate related backgrounds, including investment advisors and managers, investment bankers, attorneys, brokers and mortgage bankers.
 Our culture is governed by our commitment to high ethical standards, putting the clients’ interests first and treating clients and our own associates fairly and with respect. These distinctive characteristics of our culture are highly evident in our ability to retain and attract employees. The average tenure for our senior capital markets advisors is approximately 16 years, and the average production tenure for the top 25 senior capital markets advisors compiled by initial leads during the last five years was approximately 17 years (including tenure with predecessor companies). Furthermore, several of our senior capital markets advisors have a personal economic interest in our firm, which further aligns their individual interests with those of the Company and its stockholders, as a whole, and our clients.
 Integrated Capital Markets Services Platform
 In the competitive commercial real estate and capital markets industry, we believe one of our key differentiators is our ability to analyze all commercial real estate product types and markets as well as our ability to provide clients with comprehensive analysis, advice and execution expertise on all types of debt and equity capital markets solutions. We believe that due to our broad range of execution capabilities, our clients rely on us not only to provide capital markets alternatives but, more importantly, to advise them on how to optimize value by uncovering inefficiencies in the non-public capital markets to maximize their commercial real estate investments. We believe our capabilities provide our clients with the flexibility to pursue multiple capital markets options simultaneously so that, upon conclusion of our efforts, they can choose the best risk-adjusted solution.
Independent Objective Advice
 Unlike many of our competitors, we do not currently offer services that compete with services provided by our clients such as leasing or property management, nor do we currently engage in principal capital investing activities which would compete with a number of our clients. We believe this allows us to offer independent objective advice to our clients. We believe our independence distinguishes us from our competitors, enhances our reputation in the market and allows us to retain and expand our client base.
Extensive Cross-Selling Opportunities
 As some participants in the commercial real estate market are frequently buyers, sellers, lenders and borrowers at various times, we believe our relationships with these participants across all aspects of their businesses provide us with multiple revenue opportunities throughout the life cycle of their commercial real estate investments. Our capital markets advisors may advise on an investment sale where we not only represent the seller of a commercial real estate investment but also represent the buyer in arranging acquisition financing. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, we executed numerous transactions across multiple platform services with 23, 23 and 22, respectively, of our top 25 clients.
Broad and Deep Network of Relationships
 We have developed broad and deep-standing relationships with the users and providers of capital in the industry and have completed multiple transactions for many of the top institutional commercial real estate investors in the U.S. as well as several global investors. Importantly, our capital markets advisors, analysts and closing specialists foster relationships with their respective counterparts within each client’s organization. This provides, in our opinion, a deeper relationship with our firm relative to our competitors. In 2018 and 2017, no one borrower or no one seller client, represented more than 3% of our total capital markets services revenues. The combined fees from our top 10 seller clients for the years 2018 and 2017, were less than 7% of our capital markets services revenues for each year, and the combined fees from our top 10 borrower clients were less than 5% of our capital markets services revenues for each year.
 2

Proprietary Transaction Database
 We believe that the extensive volume of commercial real estate transactions that we advise on throughout the U.S. and across multiple property types and capital markets service lines provides our capital markets advisors with valuable, real-time market information. We maintain a proprietary database of numerous current and potential capital sources and clients that tracks key terms and provisions of the majority of all closed and pending transactions in which we are involved. This proprietary database also includes historical and current flows and the pricing of debt, structured finance, investment advisory, loan sales and equity transactions. The database maintains real-time quotes and bids on pipeline transactions, status reports on all current transactions as well as historical information on clients, lenders and buyers. Furthermore, our internal databases maintain current and historical information on our loan servicing portfolio, which we believe enables us to track real-time property level performance and market trends. These internal databases are updated regularly and are available to our capital markets advisors, analysts and other internal support groups to share client contact information and real-time market information. We believe this information strengthens our competitive position by enhancing the advice we provide to clients and improving the probability of successfully closing a transaction. We believe our associates also understand the confidential nature of this information, and if it is misused, depending on the circumstances, such misuse can be cause for immediate dismissal from the Company.
Our Strategic Growth Plan
 We seek to improve our market position by focusing on the following strategic growth initiatives:
 Increase Market Share Across Each of our Capital Markets Services
 We believe that we have the opportunity to increase our market share in each of the various capital markets services we provide to our clients by penetrating deeper into our international, national, regional and local client relationships. We also intend to increase our market share by selectively hiring capital markets advisors in our existing offices and in new locations, predicated on finding the most experienced professionals in the market who have the highest integrity, work ethic and reputation, while fitting into our culture and sharing our business philosophy and business practices. Since 2011, we have opened offices in Phoenix, AZ, Tampa, FL, Austin, TX, Denver, CO, Orlando, FL, Philadelphia, PA, Charlotte, NC, London, UK, Seattle, WA, and Las Vegas, NV. We have also significantly added to the platform services and product specialty types in a majority of our offices.

• | Debt Placement. In 2018, our transaction volume in debt placements was approximately $54.5 billion, an increase of 5.3% from approximately $51.7 billion in 2017.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Investment Advisory. In 2018, we completed investment advisory services of approximately $37.4 billion, an increase of approximately 8.4% from the approximately $34.5 billion completed in 2017. According to Real Capital Analytics, commercial real estate sales volume for office, industrial, multifamily, retail, hotel properties and land in the U.S. in 2018 and 2017 were $562 billion and $489 billion, respectively. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Equity Placement and Advisory Services. In 2018, we completed approximately $7.5 billion of equity placement and advisory services transactions (which include amounts that we internally allocate to the equity placement reporting category, even though the transaction may have been funded through a single mortgage note) for our clients, representing a decrease of 19.6% from the $9.3 billion completed in 2017. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Loan Sales. We have consummated $0.4 billion and $0.6 billion in loan sales transactions in 2018 and 2017, respectively. This business is based on the desire of lenders seeking to diversify concentration risk (geographic, borrower or product type), manage potential problems in their loan portfolios or sell loans rejected from commercial-mortgage backed securities (CMBS) securitization pools. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Commercial Loan Servicing. The principal balance of HFF’s loan servicing portfolio increased 16.2% to approximately $81.2 billion at December 31, 2018 from approximately $69.8 billion at December 31, 2017. We currently have approximately 37 correspondent lender relationships with life insurers. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 While the volume increases relating to our debt placement, investment advisory and loan servicing services referenced above were principally the effect of improved market conditions and increased activity in the commercial real estate market, we believe that our efforts to open new offices and expand our platform services and product specialties have also aided us in our achievements.
 Continue to Capitalize on Cross-Selling Opportunities
 Participants in the commercial real estate market increasingly are buyers, sellers, lenders and borrowers at various times. We believe our relationships with these participants across all aspects of their businesses provide us with multiple revenue opportunities throughout the life cycle of their commercial real estate investments. Many of our clients are both consumers and providers of capital, and our goal is to attempt to work with our clients to execute transactions utilizing the wide spectrum of our services. By maintaining close relationships with these clients, we believe we will continue to generate significant repeat business across all of our business lines.
 Our debt capital markets advisors originated approximately $7.1 billion and $8.2 billion of debt for clients that purchased properties sold by our investment advisory capital markets advisors for their clients in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our investment advisory capital markets advisors also referred clients to our debt capital markets advisors who arranged debt financings totaling approximately $9.3 billion and $9.7 billion in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our debt capital markets advisors also referred clients to our investment advisory capital markets advisors who sold approximately $4.2 billion and $3.7 billion of properties in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Also, in 2018 and 2017, our Securities Subsidiaries originated debt volumes of approximately $0.7 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, in addition to its other equity placement activities.

Expand Our Geographic Footprint
 We believe that opportunities exist to strategically establish and increase our presence in several key domestic and international, markets. When strategic opportunities present themselves with high-quality capital markets advisors, it is our intention to capitalize on such opportunities as we did in Seattle, WA, London, UK and Las Vegas, NV in 2017, Phoenix, AZ in 2016 and Charlotte, NC in 2014. While our capital markets advisors, located in 26 offices (25 throughout the U.S. and one in the UK), advised clients on transactions in 45 states, the District of Columbia, Canada, and the United Kingdom and in more than 775 cities in 2018, there are a number of major metropolitan areas where we do not maintain an office. In addition to opening an office in London, UK, we do, on a periodic basis, send our capital markets advisors overseas to meet with capital sources and global clients. By comparison, a number of our large public competitors have in excess of 100 offices worldwide and some have nearly 100 in the U.S alone. We constantly review key demand drivers of commercial real estate by market, including growth in population, households, employment, commercial real estate inventory by product type, and new construction. By doing so, we can determine not only where future strategic growth should occur, but more importantly, we can also ensure our capital markets advisors are constantly calling on the most attractive markets where we do not have offices. Since 2011, we have opened nine new offices, and during this same period, we have significantly added to the platform services and product specialties in nearly all of our offices. See “Results of Operations” within Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a discussion of the results of our U.S. operations and “Risks Related to Our Business” within Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for a description of risks associated with our business, including with respect to operations in the United Kingdom.
 We expect to achieve future strategic geographic expansion through a combination of recruitment of key capital markets advisors, organic growth of analysts to capital markets advisors and possible acquisitions of smaller local and regional firms across all services in both new and existing markets as well as the possible expansion into other platform lines of business and product specialties. However, in all cases, our strategic growth will be focused on serving our clients’ interests and predicated on finding the most experienced professionals in the market who have the highest integrity, work ethic and reputation, while fitting into our culture and sharing our business philosophy and business practices.
 Align our Leadership and Compensation Structures with Our Long-term Growth
 We manage our operations through an executive committee (including ad-hoc members) and a leadership committee which includes approximately 80 of our senior capital markets advisors and managers. The executive committee consists of at least three, but no more than seven, individuals (in addition to ad-hoc members), one of whom is the managing member of the Operating Partnerships. The executive committee currently consists of our two inside directors, Mark Gibson, our chief executive officer, and Jody Thornton, our president and managing member of the Operating Partnerships, and five of our executive managing directors, Matthew D. Lawton, Gerard T. Sansosti, Manuel A. de Zarraga, Michael J. Tepedino, and effective January 1, 2018, Kevin MacKenzie. The executive committee is primarily responsible for the day-to-day oversight of the lines of business and property verticals. The leadership committee is composed of (i) the executive committee members, (ii) individual leaders chosen from each line of business and property vertical, (iii) the office heads from each office and (iv) individuals from other line and support functions at the discretion of the executive committee. The members of the leadership committee are responsible for either overseeing their respective lines of business, property verticals or their office as well as facilitating communication and educating all of our capital markets advisors within each office, line of business, property type and product specialties to better serve our clients.
 We also aim to ensure continued emphasis on annual production, maintain our partnership culture and continue the alignment of employee, management and stockholder interests through periodic omnibus awards to individuals and through our profit participation bonus plans. Under our HFF LP and HFF Securities profit participation bonus plans, (collectively, the “Office Profit Participation Plans”) with respect to each applicable office for each calendar year, if a 14.5% or greater profit margin is generated by such office, an amount equal to 15% of the adjusted operating income (as defined under such plan) generated by such office funds a cash bonus pool payable to selected employees of HFF LP or HFF Securities, as the case may be. These plans were adopted in 2007 in connection with our initial public offering. Effective January 1, 2015, we amended the Office Profit Participation Plans to provide that our board of directors, or any appropriate committee thereof, may elect to pay up to one-half of the profit participation bonuses payable under the plans in the form of equity-based awards. HFF, Inc. also maintains a firm profit participation bonus plan (the “Firm Profit Participation Plan”) utilized primarily to compensate our business line and property vertical leadership. Under this plan, for each calendar year, if we achieve a 17.5% or greater adjusted operating income margin (as defined under such plan), a bonus pool will be funded by a percentage, ranging from 15% to 25%, of our adjusted operating income (as defined under such plan) beyond predefined adjusted operating income margin thresholds. Our board of directors, or an appropriate committee thereof, may elect to pay up to two-thirds of the profit participation bonuses payable under this plan in the form of equity-based awards. Effective January 1, 2015, we amended the Office Profit Participation Plans and Firm Profit Participation Plan, which now provide for an overall increase in the allocation of share-based awards. The cash portion of the awards will not be subject to time-based vesting conditions and will be expensed during the performance year. The share-based portion of the awards is subject to a three-year time-based vesting schedule beginning on the first anniversary of the grant (which is made in the first calendar quarter of the subsequent year). As a result, the total expense for the share-based portion of the awards is recorded over the period from the beginning of the performance year through the vesting date, or 50 months. Therefore, under the new design, the expense recognized during the performance year will be less than the expense that would have been recognized under the previous design. We expect that difference will be recognized as an increase in expense over the subsequent three years, irrespective of our financial performance in the future periods.

Our Services
 Debt Placement Services
 We offer our clients access to a complete range of debt instruments, including construction and construction/mini-permanent loans, adjustable and fixed rate mortgages, bridge loans, entity level debt, mezzanine debt, forward delivery loans, tax exempt financing and sale/leaseback financing. Offerings from the Joint Venture include derivative products and structured financing solutions services. 
 Our clients are owners of various types of property including, but not limited to, office, medical office related products, retail, industrial, hotel, multi-housing, student housing, self-storage, senior living, independent living, assisted living, nursing homes, condominiums and condominium conversions, mixed-use properties and land. Our clients range in size from individual entrepreneurs who own a single property to the largest real estate funds and institutional property owners throughout the world who invest globally, especially in the United States. Debt is or has been placed with major capital funding sources, both domestic and foreign, including life insurance companies, CMBS conduits, investment banks, commercial banks, debt funds, agency lenders, pension funds, pension fund advisors, real estate investment trusts (REITs), credit companies, opportunity funds and individual investors.
 Investment Advisory Services
 We provide investment advisory services to commercial real estate owners who are seeking to sell one or more properties or property interests. We seek to maximize proceeds and certainty of closure for our clients through our knowledge of the commercial real estate and capital markets, our extensive database of potential buyers, many of whom we have deep and long-standing relationships, and our experienced capital markets advisors. We believe the real-time data on comparable transactions, recent financings of similar assets and market trends enable our capital markets advisors to better advise our clients on valuation and certainty of execution based on a prospective buyer’s proposed capital structure and track record for closing transactions.
Equity Placement, Mergers and Acquisitions and Corporate Advisory Services
 We offer our clients the ability to access the private equity markets for a variety of capital raises and transactions, including joint ventures, entity-level private placements, discretionary private equity funds and other structured finance transactions. Additionally, we offer our clients a range of financial advisory services:

• | Joint Ventures. Equity capital to establish joint ventures relating to either identified properties or properties to be acquired by a sponsor. These joint ventures typically can be asset-specific or programmatic and involve the acquisition, development, recapitalization or restructuring of commercial real estate assets and include a variety of property types and geographic areas. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Structured Finance. Placement of mezzanine debt and preferred equity at the project level. These placements involve the acquisition, development, recapitalization or restructuring of commercial real estate assets and include a variety of property types and geographic areas. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Private Equity Funds. Institutional marketing and fund-raising for public and private commercial real estate fund sponsors. In this capacity, we represent funds with strategies that range from core to opportunistic across a variety of property types and geographies. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advisory Services. Mergers and acquisitions and other corporate advisory services for various types of transactions including mergers and acquisitions, sales and divestitures, management buyouts, and recapitalizations and restructurings.

Loan Sales
 We assist our clients in their efforts to sell all or portions of their commercial real estate debt note portfolios, which can include performing, non-performing and distressed debt as well as real estate owned properties.

Commercial Loan Servicing and Loan Performance Fees
 We provide commercial loan servicing (primary and sub-servicing) for the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”), CMBS originators, life insurance companies, mortgage REITS and debt funds, groups that purchase performing and non-performing loans as well as owners who sell commercial real estate subject to a purchase money mortgage. We are not a master servicer and therefore we have no advancing obligations for principal and interest nor do we have any loss sharing obligations relative to our loan servicing portfolio. Additionally, we are a rated CMBS primary and special servicer by Fitch Ratings. The primary servicer rating reflects our experienced and tenured management and staff and our long history as a commercial mortgage primary servicer, including with respect to Freddie Mac and CMBS servicing. The special servicer rating is based on our ability to work out, manage and resolve commercial mortgage loans and real estate owned assets. We believe our servicing platform, experienced personnel and hands-on service allow us to maintain close contact with both borrowers and lenders, and as a result, we are often the first point of contact in connection with refinancing, restructuring or sale of commercial real estate assets. Revenue is earned primarily from servicing fees charged to the lender.
 In connection with the July 2, 2018 Risk Transfer Agreement with M&T Realty Capital Corporation, for each loan originated under the Risk Transfer Agreement, we indemnify M&T-RCC for their 33.33% share of loss sharing obligations with Fannie Mae. We receive loan performance fee payments for standing ready to fulfill such indemnification obligations. 
 To avoid potential conflicts, our capital markets advisors do not directly share in servicing or loan performance fee revenue, eliminating conflicts which can occur with serviced versus non-serviced lenders, but they can be compensated, in part for this as well as other activities, through the Office Profit Participation Plans, if available and applicable, at the discretion of the office heads in our respective offices. However, throughout the servicing life of a loan, the capital market advisor who originated the loan usually remains the main contact for both the borrower and lender, or the master and/or special servicer, as the case may be, to assist our servicing group with annual inspections, operating statement reviews and other major servicing issues affecting a property or properties and in some circumstances, may be compensated for services rendered.
 Competition
 The commercial real estate services industry, and all of the services that we provide, are highly competitive, and we expect them to remain so. We compete on an international, national, regional, and local basis on a number of critical factors including, but not limited to, the quality of our people and client service, historical track record and expertise and range of services and execution skills, absence of conflicts and business reputation. Depending on the product or service, we face competition from other international and domestic commercial real estate service providers, institutional lenders, banks and savings and loans, CMBS conduits, insurance companies, investment banking firms and investment managers, some of which may have greater financial resources than we do. Top competitors we face on international, national, regional and local levels include, but are not limited to, CBRE Capital Markets, Cushman & Wakefield, Eastdil Secured (owned by Wells Fargo), Jones Lang LaSalle, Colliers, Walker & Dunlop, Marcus & Millichap, Newmark Group, Inc., Northmarq Capital (Marquette), Meridian and Berkadia, among others. There are numerous other local and regional competitors in each of the local markets where we are located as well as the markets in which we do business.
 Competition to attract and retain qualified employees is also intense in each of the capital markets services we provide our clients. We compete by offering what we believe to be competitive compensation packages to our capital markets advisors and our other associates as well as equity-based incentives including, but not limited to, our Office and Firm Profit Participation Plans for key associates who lead our efforts in terms of running our offices or lead our efforts in each of our capital markets services and product specialties as well as through periodic omnibus awards to individuals. Our ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon our ability to retain, motivate and compensate appropriately our existing capital markets advisors and other key associates as well as our ability to attract new talent, all predicated on finding the most experienced professionals in the market who have the highest integrity, work ethic and reputation, while fitting into our culture and sharing our philosophy and business practices.
 Regulation
 Our Securities Subsidiaries are subject to regulation. HFF Securities is currently registered as a broker-dealer with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and HFF Securities Limited is subject to regulation by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK. The FCA is responsible for monitoring compliance with the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and administering related rules. Violation of applicable FINRA and FCA regulations can result in the revocation of broker-dealer licenses, the imposition of censures or fines and the suspension, expulsion or other disciplining of a firm, its officers or employees. HFF Securities is registered as a broker-dealer in 21 states. HFF Securities is subject to regulations governing effectively every aspect of the securities business, including the effecting of securities transactions, minimum capital requirements, record-keeping and reporting procedures, relationships with customers, experience and training requirements for certain employees and business procedures with firms that are not subject to regulatory controls.
 Our United States broker-dealer subsidiary is also subject to the SEC’s uniform net capital rule, Rule 15c3-1, which may limit our ability to make withdrawals of capital from our broker-dealer subsidiary. The uniform net capital rule sets the minimum level of net capital a broker-dealer must maintain and also requires that a portion of its assets be relatively liquid. FINRA may prohibit a member firm from expanding its business or paying cash dividends if resulting net capital falls below its requirements. In addition, our broker-dealer subsidiary is subject to certain notification requirements related to withdrawals of excess net capital. The USA Patriot Act of 2001 also imposes obligations regarding the prevention and detection of money-laundering activities, including the establishment of customer due diligence and other compliance policies and procedures, and procedures for customer verification. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in monetary, regulatory and, in the case of the USA Patriot Act, criminal penalties.

HFF LP is licensed (in some cases, through our employees or its general partner) as a mortgage broker and a real estate broker in multiple jurisdictions. Generally, we are licensed in each state where we have an office as well as where we frequently do business.
 Seasonality
 Historically, during normal economic and capital markets conditions, our capital markets services revenue is typically seasonal. This seasonality has caused our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flows from operating activities to be lower in the first six months of the year and higher in the second half of the year. We believe the concentration of earnings and cash flows in the last six months of the year has historically been due to an industry-wide focus of clients to complete transactions towards the end of the calendar year. However, this historical pattern of seasonality may or may not continue.
Employees
 Our total employment was 1,074 employees as of December 31, 2018, which represents a 9.4% increase from the December 31, 2017 total employment of 982 employees.
 Liquidity and Capital Resources
 Information concerning the Company’s liquidity and capital resources can be found in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”.
History
 We have grown through the combination of several prominent commercial real estate brokerage firms. Our namesake dates back to Holliday Fenoglio & Company, which was founded in Houston in 1982. Although our predecessor companies date back to the 1970s, our recent history began in 1994 when Holliday Fenoglio Dockerty & Gibson, Inc. was purchased by AMRESCO, Inc. to create Holliday Fenoglio Inc. In 1998, Holliday Fenoglio, Inc. acquired Fowler Goedecke Ellis & O’Connor to create Holliday Fenoglio Fowler, L.P. Later that year, Holliday Fenoglio Fowler, L.P. acquired PNS Realty Partners, LP and Vanguard Mortgage.
 In March 2000, AMRESCO sold select assets including portions of its commercial mortgage banking businesses, Holliday Fenoglio Fowler, L.P., to Lend Lease (US) Inc., the U.S. subsidiary of the Australian real estate services company. In June 2003, HFF Holdings completed an agreement for a management buyout from Lend Lease. In April 2004, we established HFF Securities L.P., a broker-dealer subsidiary.
 As previously discussed in “Special Note Regarding the Registrant,” in connection with our initial public offering of our Class A common stock in February 2007, we effected a reorganization of our business. In connection with the Reorganization Transactions, HFF, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in November 2006 and became, and continues to be, a holding company holding partnership units in the Operating Partnerships and all of the outstanding shares of Holliday GP. Following the Reorganization Transaction and prior to August, 31, 2012, HFF Holdings and HFF, Inc., through their wholly-owned subsidiaries, were the only limited partners of the Operating Partnerships. During the period between November 30, 2009 and August 31, 2012, HFF Holdings exchanged all of the remaining partnership units that it held in each of the Operating Partnerships for shares of Class A common stock of the Company. Following such exchanges and continuing through the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, HFF, Inc., through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, holds 100% of the partnership units in the Operating Partnerships.
