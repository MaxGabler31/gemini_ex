Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

General 
 We are a specialty finance company focused on lending to middle-market companies. We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on February 5, 2015 and on January 30, 2020, we changed our state of incorporation from the State of Delaware to the State of Maryland. We were listed and began trading on the NASDAQ stock exchange on February 3, 2020 concurrently with the completion of the acquisition of Alcentra Capital Corporation in a cash and stock transaction (the Alcentra Acquisition). We have elected to be treated as a business development company (BDC) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (1940 Act). In addition, we have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company (a RIC) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). As such, we are required to comply with various regulatory requirements, such as the requirement to invest at least 70% of our assets in qualifying assets, source of income limitations, asset diversification requirements, and the requirement to distribute annually at least 90% of our taxable income and tax-exempt interest. 
 Our investment objective is to maximize the total return to our stockholders in the form of current income and capital appreciation through debt and related equity investments. We invest primarily in secured debt (including first lien, unitranche first lien, and second-lien debt) and unsecured debt (including mezzanine and subordinated debt), as well as related equity securities of private U.S. middle-market companies. We may purchase interests in loans or make debt investments, either (i) directly from our target companies as primary market or private credit investments (i.e., private credit transactions), or (ii) primary or secondary market bank loan or high yield transactions in the broadly syndicated over-the-counter market (i.e., broadly syndicated loans and bonds). Although our focus is to invest in less liquid private credit transactions, we may from time to time invest in more liquid broadly syndicated loans to complement our private credit transactions. 
 Our investment objective is accomplished through: 
 

 | accessing the origination channels that have been developed and established by Crescent;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | originating investments in what we believe to be middle-market companies with strong business fundamentals, generally controlled by private equity investors that require capital for growth, acquisitions, recapitalizations, refinancings and leveraged buyouts;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | applying Crescents underwriting standards; and
--+------------------------------------------------


 | leveraging Crescents experience and resources to monitor our investments.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our investment philosophy emphasizes capital preservation through credit selection and risk mitigation. We expect our targeted portfolio to provide downside protection through conservative cash flow and asset coverage requirements, priority in the capital structure and information requirements. 
 As a BDC under the Act and a RIC under the Code, our portfolio is subject to diversification and other requirements. See Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences. 
 We are managed by Crescent Cap Advisors, LLC (the Adviser), an investment adviser that is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act), as amended. CCAP Administration LLC (the Administrator) provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate. Our management consists of investment and administrative professionals from the Adviser and Administrator, along with the Companys Board of Directors (the Board). The Adviser directs and executes our investment operations and capital raising activities subject to oversight from the Board, which sets our broad policies. The Board has delegated investment management of our investment assets to the Adviser. The Board consists of five directors, four of whom are independent. 
 From time to time we may form wholly owned subsidiaries to facilitate the normal course of business if the Adviser determines that for legal, tax, regulatory, accounting or other similar reasons it is in our best interest to do so. We have formed a wholly owned subsidiary that is structured as a tax blocker, to hold equity or equity-like investments in portfolio companies organized as limited liability companies or other forms of pass-through entities. This corporate subsidiary is not consolidated for income tax purposes and may incur income tax expense as a result of its ownership of portfolio companies. We have also formed a special purpose vehicle that holds certain debt investments in connection with a credit facility.

 We may borrow money from time to time within the levels permitted by the 1940 Act (up to 150% of asset coverage requirement). In determining whether to borrow money, we analyze the maturity, covenant package and rate structure of the proposed borrowings as well as the risks of such borrowings compared to our investment outlook. The use of borrowed funds or the proceeds of preferred stock offerings to make investments would have its own specific set of benefits and risks, and all of the costs of borrowing funds or issuing preferred stock would be borne by holders of our common stock. See Item 1A. Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Our Business and StructureWe are subject to risks associated with the current interest rate environment, and to the extent we use debt to finance our investments, changes in interest rates may affect our cost of capital and net investment income. Further, changes in LIBOR or its discontinuation may adversely affect the value of LIBOR-indexed securities, loans, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit in our portfolio. 
 The Investment Adviser 
 The Adviser, a Delaware limited liability company and an affiliate of Crescent, acts as our investment adviser. The Adviser is a registered investment adviser under the Advisers Act. Our investment activities are managed by the Adviser, which is responsible for originating prospective investments, conducting research and due diligence investigations on potential investments, analyzing investment opportunities, negotiating and structuring our investments and monitoring our investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. The Adviser has entered into a Resource Sharing Agreement (the Resource Sharing Agreement) with Crescent, pursuant to which Crescent provides the Adviser with experienced investment professionals (including the members of the Advisers investment committee) and access to Crescents resources so as to enable the Adviser to fulfill its obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement. Through the Resource Sharing Agreement, the Adviser capitalizes on the deal origination, credit underwriting, due diligence, investment structuring, execution, portfolio management and monitoring experience of Crescents investment professionals. 
About Crescent 
 Crescent is a global credit investment manager with over $38 billion of assets under management. Crescent Capital Corporation, a predecessor to the business of Crescent, was formed in 1991 by Mark Attanasio and Jean-Marc Chapus as an asset management firm specializing in below-investment grade debt securities. In 1995, Crescent Capital Corporation was acquired by The TCW Group, Inc. (TCW) and rebranded as TCWs Leveraged Finance Group. On January 1, 2011, Messrs. Attanasio and Chapus, along with the entire investment team, spun out of TCW and formed Crescent, an employee-owned, registered investment adviser. With its headquarters in Los Angeles, Crescent has over 200 employees based in four offices in the U.S. and Europe. Messrs. Attanasio and Chapus head Crescents management committee, which oversees all of Crescents operations. On January 5, 2021, Sun Life Financial Inc. (together with its subsidiaries and joint ventures, Sun Life) acquired a majority interest in Crescent (the Sun Life Transaction). There were no changes to our investment objective, strategies and process or to the Crescent team responsible for the investment operations as a result of the Sun Life Transaction. 
The Board of Directors 
 Our business and affairs are managed under the direction of our Board. Our Board consists of five members, four of whom are not interested persons of CCAP, the Adviser, the Administrator or their respective affiliates as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act. We refer to these individuals as our Independent Directors. The Independent Directors compose a majority of our Board. Our Board elects our officers, who serve at the discretion of our Board. The responsibilities of our Board include quarterly determinations of the fair value of our assets, corporate governance activities, oversight of our financing arrangements and oversight of our investment activities. 
Investment Strategy 
 We follow Crescents approach to investing, which is based upon fundamental credit research and risk analysis. This approach reflects Crescents view that the cornerstone of successful investing is fundamental credit analysis. 
 Specifically, we pursue an investment strategy targeting companies primarily in the middle-market. We believe that the middle-market is attractive as a result of the lack of available lending sources to smaller companies. We believe many financing providers have chosen to focus on large corporate clients and managing capital markets transactions rather than lending to middle-market businesses. Further, many financial institutions and traditional lenders are faced with constrained balance sheets. We also believe hedge funds and collateralized debt obligation/collateralized loan obligation managers are less likely to pursue investment opportunities in our target market as a result of reduced liquidity for new investments. Specifically, Crescents sourcing platform should enable it, on our behalf and through our Adviser, to identify and invest in creditworthy borrowers. In addition, to take advantage of investment opportunities in middle-market companies that are identified for us by Crescent, we may invest alongside other pools of capital, including bank debt, high-yield and mezzanine funds managed by Crescent. See Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence for a discussion of certain conflicts of interest of Crescent and certain limitations on our ability to co-invest with other accounts advised by Crescent.

 We target investments in companies that exhibit one or more of the following characteristics: 
 

 | businesses with strong franchises and sustainable competitive advantages;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | businesses operating in industries with barriers to entry;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


 | businesses in industries with positive long-term dynamics;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


 | businesses with cash flows that are dependable and predictable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


 | businesses with management teams with demonstrated track records and economic incentives; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | businesses controlled by private equity investors that require capital for growth, acquisitions, and leveraged buyouts.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We seek to create a diversified portfolio of investments across various industries as a method to manage risk and capitalize on specific sector trends, although our investments may be concentrated in a small number of industries. 
 Investment Focus 
 Generally, we focus on investing in secured debt (including first lien, unitranche first lien and second-lien debt) and unsecured debt (including senior unsecured, mezzanine and subordinated debt), as well as related equity securities of private U.S. middle-market companies. By middle-market companies, we mean companies that have annual EBITDA, which we believe is a useful proxy for cash flow, of $10 million to $250 million. We may on occasion invest in larger or smaller companies. 
 First lien investments are senior loans on a lien basis to other liabilities in the issuers capital structure that have the benefit of a first-priority security interest in assets of the issuer. The security interest ranks above the security interest of any second-lien lenders in those assets. 
 Unitranche first lien investments are loans that may extend deeper in a companys capital structure than traditional first lien debt and may provide for a waterfall of cash flow priority among different lenders in the unitranche loan. In certain instances, we may find another lender to provide the first out portion of such loan and retain the last out portion of such loan, in which case, the first out portion of the loan would generally receive priority with respect to payment of principal, interest and any other amounts due thereunder over the last out portion that we would continue to hold. In exchange for the greater risk of loss, the last out portion earns a higher interest rate. 
 Second lien investments are loans with a second priority lien on all existing and future assets of the portfolio company. The security interest ranks below the security interests of any first lien and unitranche first lien lenders in those assets. 
 Unsecured debt investments are loans that generally rank senior to a borrowers equity securities and junior in right of payment to such borrowers other senior indebtedness. 
 We generally invest in securities that are rated below investment grade (e.g., junk bonds) by rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. See Item 1A. Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Our Investments We may invest in high yield debt, or junk bonds, which has greater credit and liquidity risk than more highly rated debt obligations. Our investments may include non-cash income features, including PIK interest and OID. See Item 1A. Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Our Investments Our investments in OID and PIK interest income may expose us to risks associated with such income being required to be included in accounting income and taxable income prior to receipt of cash. 
 Our business model is focused on the direct origination of loans to middle-market companies. The companies in which we invest use our capital to support organic growth, acquisitions, market or product expansion and recapitalizations. We expect to generate revenues primarily in the form of interest income from debt investments, dividend income from direct equity investments, capital gains on the sales of debt and equity securities and various loan origination and other fees. 
 We may purchase interests in loans or make debt investments, either (i) directly from our target companies as primary market or private credit investments (i.e., private credit transactions), or (ii) primary or secondary market bank loan or high yield transactions in the broadly syndicated over-the-counter market (i.e., broadly syndicated loans and bonds). Although our focus is to invest in less liquid private credit transactions, we may from time to time invest in more liquid broadly syndicated loans and bonds to complement our private credit transactions. In addition, and because we often receive more attractive financing terms on broadly syndicated loans and bonds than we do on our less liquid assets, we are able to leverage the broadly syndicated portfolio in such a way that can maximize the levered return potential of our portfolio.

 Investment Decision Process 
 Through its affiliation with Crescent, the Adviser has access to origination capabilities and research resources, experienced investment professionals, internal information systems and a credit analysis framework and investment process. Over the years, Crescent has designed its investment process to seek investments which it believes have the most attractive risk/reward characteristics. The process involves multiple levels of review and is coordinated in an effort to identify risks in potential investments. Our Adviser applies Crescents expertise to screen our investment opportunities as described below. Depending on the type of investment and the borrower, the Adviser may apply all or some of these levels of review, in its discretion. Based upon a favorable outcome of the diligence process described below, our Advisers investment committee will make a final decision on such investment and such investment will only be funded after approval by the Advisers investment committee. 
 Private Credit Originations: New private credit investment opportunities are initially reviewed by a Crescent senior investment professional to determine whether additional consideration is warranted. Factors influencing this decision include fundamental business considerations, including borrower industry, borrower financial leverage and cash flows and quality of management as well as private equity sponsor involvement (if any). In the event of an initial positive review, potential investments are further reviewed with senior and junior investment professionals. If the team agrees on the fundamental attractiveness of the investment, the review phase proceeds with preliminary due diligence and financial analyses. At this point, Crescent utilizes its credit analysis methodology to outline credit and operating statistics and identify key business characteristics and risks through available diligence materials in addition to dialogue with company management and the proposed private equity sponsor (if any). Following this analysis, Crescent considers an initial structure and pricing proposal for the investment and preliminarily informs the broader investment team of such proposal. 
 After satisfactory preliminary analysis and review, further due diligence continues, including completion of credit analysis, on-site due diligence (if deemed necessary), visits and meetings with management, and could include consultation with third-party experts. The credit analysis is a detailed, bottom-up analysis on the proposed portfolio company that generally includes an assessment of its industry, market, competition, products, services, management and the equity sponsor or owner. Detailed financial analysis is also performed at this stage with a focus on historical financial results. Projected financial information developed by the proposed portfolio company is analyzed and sensitized based upon the portfolio companys historical results and assessment of the portfolio companys future prospects. The sensitivity analysis highlights the variability of revenues and earnings, worst case debt service coverage and available sources of liquidity. As part of the overall evaluation, comparisons are made to similar companies to help assess a portfolio companys asset and enterprise value coverage of debt, interest servicing capacity and competitive strength within its industry and market. Additionally during this stage, Crescent typically works with the management of the proposed portfolio company and its other capital providers to develop the structure of an investment, including negotiating among these parties on how the investment is expected to perform relative to the other forms of capital in its capital structure. 
 Syndicated Investments: For syndicated investments, Crescent seeks to pursue an investment process based upon evaluation of the credit fundamentals of issuers. The foundation of this process is the bottom-up credit research process that Crescent employs across multiple strategies. In selecting investments, Crescents investment professionals perform comprehensive analysis of credit worthiness, including an assessment of the business, an evaluation of management, an analysis of business strategy and industry trends, an examination of financial results and projections and a review of the securitys proposed terms. Credit research is a critical component of the investment process. In selecting investments, Crescents respective portfolio management teams analyze opportunities with an emphasis on principal preservation (i.e., an issuers ability to service its debt and maintain cash flow). 
Investment Funding 
 Upon completion of the investment decision process described above, the investment team working on an investment delivers a memorandum to the Advisers investment committee. Once an investment has been approved by the investment committee, the Adviser moves through a series of steps with the respective investment team towards negotiation of final documentation. 
Investment Monitoring 
 The Adviser monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. The Adviser monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if it is meeting its business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company. The Adviser has a number of methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following: 

 | assessment of success of the portfolio company in adhering to its business plan and compliance with covenants;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | comparisons to other companies in the industry; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


 | attendance and participation in board meetings.
--+------------------------------------------------

 As part of the monitoring process, the Adviser regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and, on a quarterly basis, grades each investment on a risk scale of 1 to 5. Risk assessment is not standardized in our industry and our risk assessment may not be comparable to ones used by our competitors. Our assessment is based on the following categories: 
 

1 | Involves the least amount of risk in our portfolio. The investment/borrower is performing above expectations since investment, and the trends and risk factors are generally favorable, which may include the financial performance of the borrower or a potential exit.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2 | Involves an acceptable level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of investment. The investment/borrower is generally performing as expected, and the risk factors are neutral to favorable.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3 | Involves an investment/borrower performing below expectations and indicates that the investments risk has increased somewhat since investment. The borrowers loan payments are generally not past due and more likely than not the borrower will remain in compliance with debt covenants. An investment rating of 3 requires closer monitoring.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4 | Involves an investment/borrower performing materially below expectations and indicates that the loans risk has increased materially since investment. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments may be past due (but generally not more than 180 days past due). Placing loans on non-accrual status should be considered for investments rated 4.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5 | Involves an investment/borrower performing substantially below expectations and indicates that the loans risk has substantially increased since investment. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. Loans rated 5 are not anticipated to be repaid in full and the fair market value of the loan are generally reduced to the anticipated recovery amount. Loans with an investment rating of 5 are generally placed on non-accrual status.

Investment Advisory Agreement 
 On June 2, 2015, we entered into an investment advisory agreement with the Adviser which was most recently amended and restated (the Investment Advisory Agreement) on January 5, 2021. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser provides investment advisory services to us and our portfolio investments. The Advisers services under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not exclusive, and the Adviser is free to furnish similar or other services to others so long as its services to us are not impaired. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser is entitled to receive a base management fee and may also receive incentive fees, as discussed below. 
Base Management Fee 
 Effective February 1, 2020, pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, the base management fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of 1.25% of our gross assets, including assets acquired through the incurrence of debt but excluding any cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. The base management fee is calculated based on the average value of gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current calendar quarter. For purposes of the Investment Advisory Agreement, cash equivalents means U.S. government securities and commercial paper maturing within one year of purchase. 
 Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser agreed to waive a portion of the management fee from February 1, 2020 through July 31, 2021 after the closing of the Alcentra Acquisition so that only 0.75% was charged for such time period. The Adviser has also voluntarily waived its right to receive management fees that would result from our investments in GACP II LP and WhiteHawk III Onshore Fund LP. 
 Prior to February 1, 2020, the base management fee was calculated and payable quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of 1.50% of our gross assets, including assets acquired through the incurrence of debt but excluding any cash and cash equivalents. The Adviser agreed to waive its right to receive management fees in excess of the sum of (i) 0.25% of the aggregate committed but undrawn capital and (ii) 0.75% of the aggregate gross assets excluding cash and cash equivalents during the period prior to February 3, 2020, the date of our qualified initial public offering. 
 Incentive Fee 
 Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the incentive fee consists of two parts: 
 The first part, the income incentive fee, is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears and (a) equals 100% of the excess of the pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter, over a preferred return of 1.75% (1.50% prior to February 1, 2020) per quarter (7.0% annualized or 6.0% annualized prior to February 1, 2020) (the Hurdle), and a catch-up feature until the Adviser has received 17.5% (15.0% prior to February 1, 2020), of the pre-incentive fee net investment income for the current quarter up to 2.1212% (1.7647% prior to February 1, 2020) (the Catch-up), and (b) 17.5% (15.0% prior to February 1, 2020) of all remaining pre-incentive fee net investment income above the Catch-up. 
 
8 


 The second part, the capital gains incentive fee, is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year at a rate of 17.5% (15.0% prior to February 1, 2020) of our realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from the inception through the end of the fiscal year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees. In the event that the Investment Advisory Agreement shall terminate as of a date that is not a fiscal year end, the termination date shall be treated as though it were a fiscal year end for purposes of calculating and paying a capital gains incentive fee. 
 Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser agreed to waive the income based portion of the incentive fee from February 1, 2020 through July 31, 2021. The income and capital gains incentive fees were previously waived from April 1, 2018 through February 1, 2020. Additionally, On February 22, 2021, the Adviser notified the Board of Directors of its intent to voluntarily waive income incentive fees to the extent net investment income falls short of the regular declared dividend on a full dollar basis. The waiver is effective from July 31, 2021 through December 31, 2022. The Adviser has also voluntarily waived its right to receive income incentive fees that would result from our investments in GACP II LP and WhiteHawk III Onshore Fund LP. 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during each calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for such quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement and any interest expense and distributions paid on any issued and outstanding debt or preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as market discount, original issue discount, debt instruments with PIK interest, preferred stock with PIK dividends and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Pre-incentive fee net investment income will be compared to a Hurdle Amount equal to the product of (i) the Hurdle rate of 1.75% per quarter, or 7.0% annualized (1.50% per quarter, or 6.0% annualized prior to February 1, 2020) and (ii) our net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness, before taking into account any incentive fees payable during the period), at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, subject to a catch-up provision incurred at the end of each calendar quarter.
