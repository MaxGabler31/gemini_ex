Item 1. Business
Overview 
 
Milestone Scientific was incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 1989. Milestone Scientific has developed a proprietary, computer-controlled anesthetic delivery device, using The Wand®, a single use disposable handpiece. The device is marketed in dentistry under the trademark CompuDent®, and STA Single Tooth Anesthesia System® and is suitable for all dental procedures that require local anesthetic. The dental devices are sold in the United States, Canada and in approximately 60 other countries. Certain medical devices have obtained CE mark approval and can be marketed and sold in most European countries. In June 2017, Milestone Scientific received 510(k) marketing clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the CompuFlo® Epidural Computer Controlled Anesthesia System.  
 
Milestone Scientific is a biomedical technology research and development company that patents, designs, develops and commercializes innovative diagnostic and therapeutic injection technologies and devices for medical, dental and cosmetic use. Since our inception, we have engaged in pioneering proprietary, innovative, computer-controlled injection technologies, and solutions for the medical and dental markets. We believe our technologies are proven and well established. Our common stock was initially listed on the NYSE American on June 1, 2015 and trades under the symbol “MLSS”. The Company is focused on building its intellectual; property portfolio across numerous indications.
 
In December 2016, we received notification from the FDA that based upon the 510(k) application submitted for intra-articular injections, we did not adequately document that the device met the equivalency standard required for 510(k) clearances. Following consultation with the FDA Office of Device Evaluation, we intended to file a new 510(k) application for the device in 2019. However, due to financial constraints, a new 510(k) application was not filed in 2019 or 2020. The Company has decided not to proceed with securing the FDA approval for the intra-articular instrument at this time. Our immediate focus is on marketing its epidural device throughout the United States, Europe and other countries.
 
In June 2017, the FDA approved our 510(k) applications for marketing clearance in the United States of our CompuFlo Epidural Computer Controlled Anesthesia System. We are in the process of meeting with medical facilities and device distributors within the United States, Middle East and Europe. To date there have been seventeen medical devices sold in the United States and limited amounts sold internationally. Certain of our medical instruments have obtained European CE mark approval and can be marketed and sold in most European countries.
 
Milestone Scientific remains focused on advancing efforts to achieve the following three primary objectives:
 
● | Establishing Milestone’s DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing technology platform as the standard-of-care in painless and precise drug delivery, providing for the first time, objective visual and audible in-tissue pressure feedback, and continuing to expand platform applications;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Following obtaining successful FDA clearance of our first medical device, Milestone Scientific is transitioning from a research and development organization to a commercially focused medical device company; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expanding our global footprint of our CompuFlo Epidural and CathCheck System by utilizing a direct field sales force and partnering with distribution companies worldwide.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We have focused our resources on redefining the worldwide standard of care for injection techniques by making the experience more comfortable for the patient by reducing the anxiety and stress of receiving injections from the healthcare provider. Our computer-controlled injection devices make injections precise, efficient, and virtually painless. Milestone’s proprietary DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing technology® is our technology platform that advances the development of next-generation devices. It regulates flow rate and monitoring pressure from the tip of the needle, through platform extensions for local anesthesia for subcutaneous drug delivery, used in various dental and medical injections. It has specific medical applications for cosmetic botulinum toxin injections, epidural space identification in regional anesthesia procedures and intra-articular joint injections.

In 2020 the Company received a Notice of Allowance from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) related to its new CompuPulse System, which combines the benefits of our CompuWave technology with a manual syringe. The new CompuPulse System allows one to identify a pulsatile pressure waveform in a variety of applications, thereby improving the reliability and safety of a drug delivery procedure. Importantly, not all procedures require the sophistication of our CompuFlo system, which precisely controls the administration and flow rate of medication as it is being administered. This new technology provides an efficient and low-cost alternative for procedures where a manual syringe may suffice, while still providing the ability to verify needle and subsequent catheter placement.
 
Given our experience and established brand awareness within the dental industry beginning with our first commercial product, the first computer-controlled local anesthesia delivery (C-CLAD) system marketed as the Wand® and re-branded as the CompuDent® System, we elected to focus our initial product development efforts on the integration of CompuFlo’s DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing Technology into our legacy dental injection device. In 2006, the FDA cleared the first system utilizing CompuFlo's DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing Technology— the STA (Single Tooth Anesthesia) System and handpiece for use in the dental market, providing continuous real-time visual and audible pressure feedback from the tip of the needle while also precisely regulating the flow rate. Because of combining the ability to regulate the flow rate and monitor pressure at the tip of the needle, Milestone Scientific developed the industry’s first solution for painlessly administering an intra-ligamentary injection, i.e., “single-tooth anesthesia” which could be used as the only injection necessary for achieving dental anesthesia, foregoing the need to administer traditional injections such as a nerve branch block. In addition to single-tooth anesthesia, the STA System can effectively perform all the traditional injections that dentists routinely give but can provide them virtually pain free and with numerous clinical advantages. This device, which also utilizes a disposable handpiece, is currently marketed by Milestone Scientific as the Wand STA® System. 
 
Milestone Scientific believes its dental devices have set a new standard of care for dental injections. Our dental devices have been used to administer tens of millions of injections worldwide. Each of our devices has a related single use disposable handpiece, leading to a continuing revenue stream following sale of the device. At present, we sell disposable handpieces unique to our legacy product (the Wand and CompuDent) to users who have not upgraded to our current dental product, the Wand STA System. 
 
Building on the success of our proprietary, core technology platform for dental injections, and desiring to pursue other growth opportunities, we have recently begun to expand the uses and applications of our proprietary, patented technologies to achieve greater operational efficiencies, enhanced patient safety and therapeutic adherence, patient satisfaction, and improved quality of care across a broad range of medical specialties. In June 2017, we received FDA regulatory clearance to sell the CompuFlo Epidural Computer Controlled Anesthesia System in the United States for certain medical applications. We intend to continue to expand the uses and applications of our DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing technology.
 
We believe that we and our technology solutions are widely recognized by key opinion leaders (i.e., academics, anesthesiologists and practicing dentists whose opinions are widely respected), industry experts and medical and dental practitioners as a leader in the emerging, computer-controlled injection industry.
DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing Technology; Our Proprietary Core Technology Platform
 
Our next significant intellectual property advancement was a quantum improvement over our CompuDent® System – the development of our proprietary CompuFlo® Computer-Controlled Drug Delivery System with DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing Technology, an advanced and FDA-approved technology for the painless and accurate delivery of drugs, anesthetics, and other medicaments into all tissue types, as well as for the aspiration of bodily fluids or previously injected substances. Its regulation and control of the flow rate continues to provide painless delivery benefits, while its innovative dynamic pressure sensing capability provides visual and audible in-tissue pressure feedback, identifying tissue types to the healthcare provider. This pressure feedback extends the benefit of painlessness from anesthetics with known viscosities to a wide range of liquid drugs and other medicaments with varying viscosities and flow rates. Such pressure feedback, part of our DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing Technology, also allows the healthcare provider to know when certain types of tissues have been penetrated and permits the healthcare provider to inject medicaments precisely at the desired location. Thus, real-time continuous pressure feedback can prevent the injection to tissue outside the intended target area, an important characteristic in the injection of chemotherapeutics and other toxic substances.
 
In addition to the ability to determine exit pressure in-situ (in the injection site tissue) at the tip of the needle, minimizing tissue damage (and eliminating the pain of the injection) because the flow rate and pressure of the injection are precisely controlled, CompuFlo® computer-controlled Drug Delivery Systems features a proprietary algorithm, which allow for the measurement of the exit pressure. These algorithms contain the critical components of specific drugs, parameters of needles, tubing and syringes and all other pertinent components for the safe and efficacious delivery of medications for all procedures. CompuFlo® technology also enables devices to provide a digital record of the time and volume of anesthetic or medicament injected.

Each CompuDent® and  Wand/STA System also includes a disposable injection handpiece that is extremely comfortable, light, and easy to use, providing for precise tactile control during the injection, an electro-mechanical (computer-controlled) fluid delivery instrument and the ability to record data from the injection event. The pencil grip used with the handpieces provides the practitioner with enhanced tactile sense and accurate control and allows bi-directional rotation, eliminating needle deflection, resulting in a greater accuracy and success. The handpiece is vibration-free because it does not have a motor or electrical component in it and, since the handpiece does not look like a typical syringe, we believe it also reduces patient anxiety and offers the possibility of curing dental phobia of which an estimated 40 million Americans suffer.
 
As confirmed by numerous noted medical and dental experts within academia and the clinical practice arenas, CompuFlo Systems using DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing technology have the potential to greatly increase the safety and efficacy of many drug delivery procedures that currently rely upon the over 150-year-old hypodermic syringe technology and the tactile senses and delivery expertise of the administrator.
 
Devices using DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing Technology such as the CompuFlo System can be used to inject a wide variety of liquid medicaments as well as anesthetics. We believe our CompuFlo System avoids the negative side effects from the use of traditional hypodermic drug delivery injection devices, which are well documented in dental and medical literature and include risk of death, transient or permanent paralysis, pain, tissue damage and post-operative complications. Pain and tissue damage often result from uncontrolled flow rates and pressure created during the administration of drug solutions into human tissue. While several technologies have can control the flow rate, we believe our patented DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing technology and CompuFlo Systems provide the control of pressure during the injection as well accurately and precisely delivery the drug.
 
CompuFlo Epidural Computer Controlled Anesthesia System
 
The CompuFlo Epidural Computer Controlled Anesthesia System (or the CompuFlo Epidural System) is one such platform extension of our DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing Technology platform, providing anesthesiologists and other healthcare providers the ability, for the first time, to quantitatively determine and document the pressure at the needle tip in real-time for proper needle placement in epidural procedures used for labor/delivery and back pain management. Our proprietary DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing Technology allows the CompuFlo Epidural System to provide objective visual and audible in-tissue pressure feedback that allows anesthesiologists to identify and confirm placement in the epidural space.
 
Our CompuFlo Epidural System provides an objective tool that we believe consistently and accurately identifies the epidural space by detecting the difference in pressure between the ligamentum flavum and the intrafilamentary tissue. In studies, the CompuFlo Epidural System with DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing Technology has been shown to be effective in correctly identifying the epidural space. Knowing the precise location of a needle tip during an epidural injection procedure provides a measure of safety not presently available to doctors using conventional syringes. In the absence of fluoroscopy, identifying the epidural space by relying on the subjective perception of loss of resistance to saline requires a very long education period and learning curve and could result in morbidity and lack of efficacy. During back pain management epidural procedures, where fluoroscopy is commonly used, the CompuFlo Epidural System allows the clinician to locate the epidural space, without using fluoroscopy, thereby protecting the patient and clinician from unnecessary exposure to radiation along with significantly reducing capital and operating costs.
 
Wand/STA Dental Market
 
Since its market introduction in early 2007, the Wand/STA Instrument and prior C-CLAD devices have been used to deliver over 80 million safe, effective, and comfortable injections. The instrument has also been favorably evaluated in numerous peer-reviewed, published clinical studies and associated articles. Moreover, there appears to be a growing consensus among users that the STA Instrument is proving to be a valuable and beneficial instrument that is positively impacting the practice of dentistry worldwide.
 
Beginning January 1, 2016, Milestone Scientific entered into a non-exclusive distribution agreement with Henry Schein, Inc. (“Henry Schein”). In June 2016, that agreement was replaced with an exclusive distribution arrangement for our dental products for the United States and Canada with Henry Schein. In December 2020, the exclusive distribution arrangement with Henry Schein was replaced with a non-exclusive distribution arrangement, for distribution in the United States and Canada.
 
In January 2021, the Company began a process of signing non-exclusive dental distribution arrangements with dental distributors in specific geographical locations in the United States and Canada. To date, we have nine (9) new non-exclusive dental distributors engaged in the USA and Canada. The goal is to add additional non-exclusive distributors in the USA, but also to explore other co-operation opportunities with Dental Service Organizations, education institutions, dental schools and entities in specific dental market segments.
 
  6 



The goal of changing our marketing plan from a sole exclusive distributor in the USA and Canada, to a large number of non-exclusive distributors is to increase placement of our Wand/STA instrument and thus the expansion of our dental disposables.
 
On the global front, we have granted exclusive marketing and distribution rights for the Wand/STA Instrument to select dental suppliers in various international regions in Asia, Africa, South America, and Europe. They include FM Produkty Dla Stomatologii in Poland and Unident AB in the countries of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland. Additionally, the Company is in the process of evaluating current international distributors and adding new distributors, globally as required based on the economics of the region. 
 
Medical Market
 
During 2016, Milestone Scientific filed for 510(k) marketing clearance with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for both intra-articular and epidural injections with the CompuFlo Epidural System.  In June 2017, the FDA approved the CompuFlo Epidural System for epidural injections. During the end of the second quarter 2021, Milestone Scientific invested in sales force expansion, thus building up a stronger direct sales force aiming at increasing the adoption and penetration of its technology. At the beginning of the year Milestone Scientific had three sales managers and by July 31, 2021 had established a direct sales force consisting of eleven full time employees covering the US North and Southeast regions along with California. Milestone Scientific continues to partner with distributors for the international markets, and has begun to partner with regional distributors in the United States as well.
 
In December 2016, we received notification from the FDA that based upon the 510(k) application submitted for intra-articular injections, we did not adequately document that the device met the equivalency standard required for 510(k) clearances. Following consultation with the FDA Office of Device Evaluation, we intended to file a new 510(k) application for the device in 2019. However, due to financial constraints, a new 510(k) application was not filed. The Company has decided not to proceed with securing FDA approval for the intra-articular instrument at the present time.
 
In January 2020, the Company received a Notice of Allowance for a key patent from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on its CompuWave technology, which is being integrated into the CompuFlo® Epidural System. The Company is constantly evolving and innovating the technology. This patent represents a significant achievement for the Company since it extends the intellectual property protection around the CompuFlo instrument for another 20 years and provides not only additional confirmation of placement, but also verification during the procedure that the catheter has not been displaced. 
 
In February 2020, the Company announced an abstract entitled "Confirmation of epidural catheter location by epidural pressure waveform recordings by the CompuFlo® Epidural Instrument (CompuFlo)," was accepted for presentation at the prestigious Euroanaesthesia 2020 Congress, which was to take place May 30 - June 1, 2020 in Barcelona, Spain. Euroanaesthesia is Europe’s largest annual event showcasing the latest news and innovations in the field of anesthesia, perioperative medicine, intensive care, emergency medicine and pain treatment. This international event gathers upwards of six thousand delegates from around the world. The abstract was to be presented during scientific poster sessions highlighting how CompuWave technology integrated with the CompuFlo Epidural System combines both objective in-line pressure measurements and the detection of a pulsatile pressure waveform in a single system. However due to the continual spread of COVID-19, the Company presented at the prestigious Euroanaesthesia 2020 Congress virtually, which was held in Barcelona in August 2020.
 
Moreover, also in February 2020, the Company introduced the new pre-assembled disposable kit for the CompuFlo® Epidural System that has received CE Mark approval in Europe through the Company’s supplier. The Board of Directors of the Company believes that this CE Mark approval overcomes an important hurdle to commercialization in Europe. Based on market feedback, it was evident that anesthesiologists using the epidural instrument preferred to have the disposable kit pre-assembled before packaging to save valuable minutes in the operatory.
 
On April 21, 2020, Milestone Scientific announced that it had validated and integrated the new CathCheck™ feature into the CompuFlo® Epidural System. Using CathCheck™. Physicians and nurses can monitor the placement of a catheter to determine the presence or absence of a pulsatile waveform (heartbeat) providing new information that can be used to determine if the catheter is in place or has become dislodged from the epidural space.
 
On May 13, 2020, the Company announced a study was published in the Open Journal of Anesthesiology validating the efficacy of the CompuFlo® CathCheck™ System to confirm the correct placement and positioning of an epidural catheter for use during and after an epidural procedure. This is another validation that the CathCheck™ feature will help to significantly reduce time and cost for the institution by providing a more reliable way to re-check the catheter throughout the day to ensure that the catheter has not been displaced.

On October 13, 2020, Milestone Medical announced a Group Purchasing Agreement with Premier, a leading U.S. healthcare improvement company, utilizing an alliance of approximately 4,100 U.S. hospitals and 200,000 other providers to transform healthcare. Such Agreement, which was effective November 1, 2020, allows Premier members, at their discretion, to utilize pricing and terms pre-negotiated by Premier for the CompuFlo® Epidural System and CathCheck™. The Agreement expires on February 28, 2022. On November 24, 2021, a new Group Purchase Agreement was signed with Premier, becoming effective as of March 1, 2022, This agreement expires on February 28, 2025.
 
On January 20, 2021, the Company received a Notice of Allowance for a key patent from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office related to CompuFlo disposables. This patent covers the interactions of the disposable assembly and a micro-chip security verification feature embedded in the disposables, which provides clinical and safety benefits for the patient and practitioner. This patent also covers the use of an embedded security chip, preventing improper reuse of the disposables, as well as ensuring the instrument can only be used with authenticated disposables for the current and future systems.
 
On February 24, 2021, the Company received a Notice of Allowance for a key patent from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on its breakthrough CompuPulse System which combines the benefits of the CompuWave technology with a manual syringe. Our new CompuPulse System allows one to identification of a pulsatile pressure waveform in a variety of applications, thereby improving the reliability and safety of a drug delivery procedure.
 
On March 10, 2021, the Company received a Notice of Allowance from the European Patent Office on the combination of Nerve Stimulation and DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing Technology, to optimize needle tip location in Ultrasound-Guided Peripheral Nerve Block (PNB) procedures. This  Notice of Allowance clears an important hurdle to potentially develop a device specifically for PNB procedures, which would incorporate the CompuFlo® with Dynamic Pressure Sensing Technology® capabilities of precisely measuring, displaying, controlling, warning and recording needle tip pressure in real time. By combining CompuFlo with ultrasound guidance it is believed to be able to achieve multimodal PNB monitoring, safety and greater accuracy to identify needle tip location during PNB procedures.
 
Cosmetic Botulinum Market
 
Milestone Advanced Cosmetic Systems, Inc. (“Advanced Cosmetic Systems”), was originally owned 50% by us and 50% by Milestone China Company Limited (“Milestone China”), a company organized under the laws of Hong Kong and owned 40% by Milestone Scientific. Milestone China contributed $900,000 of cash to the joint venture, and we have provided a royalty-free license to utilize our technology to the joint venture to develop a botulinum toxin injection device.
 
In November 2017, we announced plans for the commercial launch of our proprietary cosmetic injection device using our DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing technology platform and our CompuFlo Cosmetic System for delivery of botulinum toxin. Our proprietary cosmetic injection device features improved needle placement with a comfortable stylus grip, precise dosing, the same technology platform that has made dental and epidural injections painless, and a new, intuitive touch-screen interface. Although the Company received positive outcomes of multi-state human factor studies with targeted customers, the Company did not have the necessary capital to move forward with the commercial launch of our cosmetic device and applying for marketing clearance in Europe (CE clearance), and United States (FDA clearance). 
 
In May 2020, Milestone Scientific finalized an agreement for the purchase of Milestone China’s 50% interest in Advanced Cosmetic Systems Inc., for the forgiveness of $900,000 in accounts receivable owed by Milestone China to Milestone Scientific (and previously fully reserved for), resulting in a noncash transaction. As a result of the purchase, Milestone Scientific owned 100% of Advanced Cosmetic Systems Inc.  Milestone China had the option to repurchase the 50% interest in Advanced Cosmetic Systems within one year from the sale date for $900,000 in cash.  On May 18, 2021, Milestone China’s repurchase option expired. Advanced Cosmetic Systems has been dissolved.
 
Other Possible Products
 
The Company is reviewing using CompuFlo’s DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing Technology for less painful injections for use in rhinoplasty, colorectal surgery, podiatry, and other disciplines. In the self-injectable market, there are many injectable drugs routinely self-administered in a home or office setting using spring loaded automatic injection devices by people who suffer from long-term chronic conditions such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other diseases of the auto immune system. We believe CompuFlo’s DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing Technology, using pressure sensing capabilities, can serve as a less painless subcutaneous injection method for these self-administered drugs.
 
However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop any such products, or that if developed, that we will be able to obtain FDA approval to market any such products, or even if we do obtain such FDA approval, that any such products will generate any revenue for us or be a commercial success.

COVID-19 Pandemic
 
The COVID-19 pandemic materially adversely affected the Company’s financial results and business operations. Demand for the Company’s products decreased, notably in our dental division, during the 2020 fiscal year. During the year 2021, the demand increased and first signs of recovery of the dental business were seen. However it is unclear what the effect of the Omicron and other variants might have on the business during the remainder of 2022. Therefore, such increased demand may or may not continue and/or demand may or may not increase from historical levels depending on the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the transmissibility and severity of variants, the effectiveness of the on-going vaccination process, the length of time it takes for normal economic and operating conditions to resume, additional governmental actions that may be taken and/or extensions of time for restrictions that have been imposed to date, and numerous other uncertainties. Such events may result in business and manufacturing disruption, inventory shortages, delivery delays, and reduced sales and operations, any of which could materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 
The Company’s employees have been and are being affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of our office and management personnel are working remotely. The health of the Company’s workforce is of primary concern and the Company may need to enact further precautionary measures to help minimize the risk of our employees being exposed to the coronavirus. Further, our management team is focused on mitigating the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has required and will continue to require a large investment of time and resources across the entire Company, thereby diverting their attention from other priorities that existed prior to the outbreak of the pandemic. If these conditions worsen, or last for an extended period of time, the Company’s ability to manage its business may be impaired, and operational risks, cybersecurity risks and other risks facing the Company prior to the pandemic may be elevated. The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the Company’s customers, suppliers, vendors, and other business partners, but the Company is not able to predict the ultimate consequences that will result therefrom.
 
We are experiencing supply delays and shortages due to the disruptions the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is having on the global supply chain, especially with respect to goods from China. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant disruption to the operations of certain suppliers in China and the related transportation of their goods to the United States that are parts of our global supply chain. We have been able to make alternative delivery arrangements for limited quantities of goods, at increased cost. While we have not yet experienced material shortages in supply because of these disruptions and our alternative delivery arrangements, if they were to be prolonged or expanded in scope, there could be resulting supply shortages which could impact our ability to have manufactured and delivered our products to the United States and, ultimately to our customers. Accordingly, such supply shortages and delivery limitations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.  All of these factors may have far reaching impacts on the Company’s business, operations, and financial results and conditions, directly and indirectly, including without limitation impacts on the health of the Company’s management.
 
Patents and Intellectual Property
 
Milestone Scientific and its subsidiaries currently hold approximately 216 U.S. and foreign patents, and many patent applications. The Company’s patents and patent applications relate to drug delivery methodologies, drug flow rate measurement, pressure/force computer-controlled drug delivery with exit pressure, dynamic pressure sensing, automated rate control, automated charging, drug profiles, audible and visual pressure/force feedback, tissue identification, drug delivery injection unit, drug drive unit for anesthetic, handpiece, and injection device. Milestone Scientific and its subsidiaries also currently hold approximately 36 registered U.S. and foreign trademarks, including CompuDent®, CompuFlo®, DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing technology®, Safety Wand®, STA Single Tooth Anesthesia System®, and The Wand®
 
Milestone Scientific relies on a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws and employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements to protect its intellectual property rights. Despite the precautions taken by Milestone Scientific to protect its IP rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to reverse engineer, copy, or obtain and use products and information that Milestone Scientific regards as proprietary, or may design products serving similar purposes that do not infringe on Milestone Scientific’s patents. Milestone Scientific’s failure to protect its proprietary information and the expenses of doing so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 
If Milestone Scientific’s products infringe upon patent or proprietary rights of others, we may be required to modify processes or to obtain licenses. There can be no assurance that Milestone Scientific would be able to do so in a timely manner, upon acceptable terms and conditions, or at all. The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Manufacturing
 
Milestone Scientific has informal arrangements with an US manufacturer of the Wand/STA System, epidural and intra-articular devices. Pursuant to these informal arrangements, our third-party manufacturer manufactures the Wand/STA System under specific purchase orders without minimum purchase commitments, and at prices to be agreed upon in each such purchase order.
 
Our agreement with the principal manufacturer of dental handpieces includes pricing terms. Milestone Scientific has been supplied by the manufacturer of the Wand/STA System and its predecessor, the CompuDent System, since the commencement of production in 1998, and by the manufacturer of its dental handpieces since 2003. The manufacturer of our dental handpieces is in the People’s Republic of China and the manufacturer of the Wand/STA System is in the United States. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Changes to pricing of the Wand/STA System by the manufacturer could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business, and results of operations. Termination of the manufacturing relationship with any of these third-party manufacturers could significantly and adversely affect our ability to produce and sell the products. Though other alternate sources of supply for dental handpieces exist, Milestone Scientific would need to establish relationships with new suppliers, and with respect to the Wand/STA System recover its existing tools or have new tools produced and “burn in” and other manufacturing and quality control software re-produced. Establishing new manufacturing relationships could involve significant expense and delay. Any curtailment or interruptions of supply, whether as a result of the inability of a supplier to meet our product delivery needs or termination of the relationship, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business, and results of operations.
 
Competition
 
As of this filing, there is no subcutaneous drug delivery platform or device on the market regulating the flow rate and pressure of an injection capable of delivering a painless injection at the desired location like Milestone Scientific’s proprietary, patented devices having our DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing technology.
 
Milestone Scientific’s devices compete based on their performance characteristics and the benefits provided to the patient, practitioner, and their business operations. Clinical studies have shown that our devices reduce fear, pain and anxiety for many patients, and Milestone Scientific believes that they can reduce practitioner stress levels, as well. Other computer-controlled local anesthesia delivery (C-CLAD) options are the Quicksleeper and SleeperOne, from Dental Hi Tec, Dentapen from Septodant, the Calajet from Aseptico, and the Comfort Control Syringe by Dentsply.
 
The Quicksleeper was invented in France by Dr. Alain Villette in 1991. It is marketed as the only local anesthetic delivery device in France that allows the ability to perform all intraoral local anesthetic injection techniques, including osteocentral anesthesia, quickly and without failure. The extra feature that gives the Quicksleeper this ability is a built-in motor in the syringe/handpiece that renders the syringe both an injector and a perforator of bone. That is, the handpiece of the Quicksleeper can perform an intraosseous injection via a motor driven perforation of the cortical plate of bone. A standard dental needle that attaches to the syringe spins as the motor rotates the handpiece thus acting as a perforator. However, the handpiece is relatively heavy, weighing 240 g. as compared to a standard syringe that weighs 80 g. Injection speed increases during the injection, but the operator cannot control when the injection speed increases.
 
The Calajet instrument, manufactured in Europe, has been very slow to grow market acceptance. It recently began marketing in the United States with similar slow acceptance. The instrument is a higher price than the Wand STA and does not provide dynamic pressure sensing technology. Although a competitor, we believe that without a substantial distribution network this instrument will have a difficult time to be successful in the USA.
 
The Dentapen from Septodent is the newest competitor in the market. This device is manufactured in Europe and began marketing in the USA in 2018. This device is priced similar to the Wand/STA device, but at this time, to our knowledge, it is slow to attract viable distribution in the USA.
 
Milestone Scientific’s proprietary, patented devices with its DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing Technology platform also compete with disposable and reusable syringes that generally sell at lower prices and that use established and well-understood methodologies in both the dental and medical marketplaces.

Rapid technological change and research may affect our products. Current or new competitors could, at any time, introduce new or enhanced products with features that render our products less marketable or even obsolete. Therefore, Milestone Scientific must devote substantial efforts and financial resources to improve existing products, bring products to market quickly, and develop new products for related markets. In addition, the ability to compete successfully requires that Milestone Scientific maintain an effective distribution network with a strong marketing plan. Any new products must comply with applicable regulatory authorities before they may be marketed. Milestone Scientific cannot assure that it can compete successfully, that competitors will not develop technologies or products that render our products less marketable or obsolete, or, that Milestone Scientific will succeed in improving its existing products, effectively develop new products, or obtain required regulatory approval for those products.
 
Government Regulation
 
The manufacture and sale of medical devices and other medical products are subject to extensive regulation by the Food and Drug Administration  ("FDA") pursuant to the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”), and by other federal, state, and foreign authorities. Under the FD&C Act, medical devices must receive FDA clearance before they can be marketed commercially in the United States. Some medical products must undergo rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing and an extensive FDA approval process before they can be marketed. 
 
These processes can take many years and require the expenditure of substantial resources. The time required for completing such testing and obtaining such approvals is uncertain, and FDA clearance may never be obtained. Delays or rejections may be encountered based upon changes in FDA policy during the period of product development and FDA regulatory review of each product submitted. Similar delays also may be encountered in other countries. Following the enactment of the Medical Device Amendments to the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act in May 1976, the FDA classified medical devices in commercial distribution into one of three classes. This classification is based on the controls necessary to reasonably ensure the safety and effectiveness of the medical devices. Class I devices are those devices whose safety and effectiveness can reasonably be ensured through general controls, such as adequate labeling, pre-market notification, and adherence to the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”), also referred to as “Good Manufacturing Practices” (“GMP”) regulations. Some Class I devices are further exempted from some of the general controls. Class II devices are those devices whose safety and effectiveness reasonably can be ensured using special controls, such as performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries, and FDA guidelines. Class III devices are those which must receive pre-market approval by the FDA to ensure their safety and effectiveness. Generally, Class III devices are limited to life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices.
 
Prior to Pre-market Notification clearance, the manufacturer or distributor may not place the device into commercial distribution until an order is issued by the FDA. By regulation, the FDA has no specific time limit by which it must respond to a 510(k) Pre-market Notification. Currently, the FDA typically responds to the submission of a 510(k) Pre-market Notification within 180 days. The FDA response may declare that the device is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed device and allow the proposed device to be marketed in the United States. However, the FDA may determine that the proposed device is not substantially equivalent or may require further information, such as additional test data, before the FDA is able to decide regarding substantial equivalence. Such determination or request for additional information could delay market introduction of products. If a device that has obtained 510(k) Pre-market Notification clearance is changed or modified in design, components, method of manufacture, or intended use, such that the safety or effectiveness of the device could be significantly affected, separate 510(k) Pre-market notification clearance must be obtained before the modified device can be marketed in the United States. If a manufacturer or distributor cannot establish that a proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device, the manufacturer or distributor will have to seek pre-market approval of the proposed device, a more difficult procedure requiring extensive data, including pre-clinical and human clinical trial data, as well as extensive literature to prove the safety and efficacy of the device.
 
The FDA cleared the Wand, our CompuDent System, and its disposable handpieces, for marketing in the United States for dental applications in July 1996; the CompuMed® System for marketing in the United States for medical applications in May 2001; the Safety Wand® for marketing in the United States for dental applications in September 2003; the Wand/STA System for dental applications in August 2006; and our CompuFlo Epidural System in June 2017. For us to commercialize other products in the United States, Milestone Scientific would have to submit and have cleared additional 510(k) applications to the FDA.
 
In 2017, the FDA reduced the barrier to marketing clearance for certain dental devices. As a result, other manufacturers of injection devices could more easily enter the dental market. However, we believe that any new device will be very limited in sales volume without a significant distributor in the dental market.

Though certain dental and medical devices have received FDA marketing clearance, there can be no assurance that any of the other medical devices under development will obtain the required regulatory clearance in a timely manner, or at all. If regulatory clearance of a product is granted, such clearance may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed. In addition, modifications may be made to the products to incorporate and enhance their functionality and performance based upon new data and design review. There can be no assurance that the FDA will not request additional information relating to product improvements; that any such improvements would not require further regulatory review, thereby delaying the testing, approval, and commercialization of product improvements; or that ultimately any such improvements will receive FDA clearance.
 
Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is monitored through periodic inspections by the FDA. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions on such product or manufacturer, including fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions, and criminal prosecution.
 
Milestone Scientific is subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, whose regulations require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain QSR requirements as defined by the FD&C Act. QSR compliance requires testing, quality control and documentation procedures. Failure to comply with QSR requirements can result in the suspension or termination of production, product recall or fines and penalties. Products also must be manufactured in registered establishments. In addition, labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission. The export of devices is also subject to regulation in certain instances
 
The Medical Device Reporting (“MDR”) regulation obligates us to provide information to the FDA on product malfunctions or injuries alleged to have been associated with the use of the product or in connection with certain product failures that could cause serious injury. If, because of FDA inspections, MDR reports or other information, the FDA believes that Milestone Scientific is not in compliance with the law, the FDA can institute proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations, or assess civil and/or criminal penalties against us, our officers, or employees. Any action by the FDA could result in disruption of operations for an undetermined amount of time.
 
Human Capital
 
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had a total 26 full-time employees  including one executive officer of Milestone Scientific. Milestone Scientific also has a consultant who serves as a Director of Clinical Affairs. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we believe our employee relations are good. The Company currently does not have any official training programs or performance evaluations for its employees.
