Overview
We are a full service, non-clinical contract research organization (CRO). We have built upon our original core competency of laboratory animal medicine and science (research model technologies) to develop a diverse portfolio of discovery and safety assessment services, both Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and non-GLP, which is able to support our clients from target identification through non-clinical development. We also provide a suite of products and services to support our clients’ manufacturing activities, including our newly acquired contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) business. Utilizing our broad portfolio of products and services enables our clients to create a more flexible drug development model, which reduces their costs, enhances their productivity and effectiveness, and increases speed to market.
The development of new drugs requires a steadily increasing investment of time and money. Various studies and reports estimate that it takes between 10 to 15 years, up to $2.5 billion excluding time costs and exploration of between 10,000 and 15,000 drug molecules to produce a single Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug. 
Discovery represents the earliest stages of research in the life sciences, directed at the identification, screening, and selection of a lead molecule for future drug development. Discovery activities typically extend anywhere from 4 to 6 years in conventional pharmaceutical research and development (R&D) timelines.
Development activities, which follow, and which can take up to 7 to 10 years, are directed at demonstrating the safety, tolerability and clinical efficacy of the selected drug candidates. During the non-clinical stage of the development process, a drug candidate is tested in vitro (non-animal, typically on a cellular or sub-cellular level in a test tube or multi-well petri plate) and in vivo (in research models) to establish drug safety prior to and in support of human clinical trials.
For 75 years, we have been in the business of providing the research models required in the research and development of new drugs, devices and therapies. Over this time, we have built upon our core competency of in vivo biology to develop a diverse and expanding portfolio of products and services, which now encompasses the broader non-clinical drug research process. We are positioned to leverage our leading portfolio in non-clinical drug research in an efficient and cost-effective way to aid our clients in bringing their drugs to market faster.
Our client base includes global pharmaceutical companies, a broad range of biotechnology companies, and many government agencies, hospitals and academic institutions around the world. In recent years, we have focused our efforts on improving the efficiency of our global operations to enhance our ability to support our clients. Our pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients are increasingly seeking full service, “one-stop” global partners to whom they can outsource more of their drug discovery and development efforts. It is estimated that the market for regulated safety assessment services is 60% outsourced or more, while emerging growth areas such as discovery and certain research model services are currently believed to be less outsourced.
We currently operate in over 110 locations and in over 20 countries worldwide (excluding our Insourcing Solutions sites). Our products and services, supported by our global infrastructure and deep scientific expertise, enable our clients to overcome many of the challenges of non-clinical life sciences research. In 2021, our total revenue was $3.5 billion and our income before income taxes, was $480.7 million.
We have three reporting segments: Research Models and Services (RMS), Discovery and Safety Assessment (DSA) and Manufacturing Solutions (Manufacturing).
Through our RMS segment, we have supplied research models to the drug development industry since 1947. With over 160 different stocks and strains, we continue to maintain our position as a global leader in the production and sale of the most widely used rodent research model strains and purpose-bred rats and mice. We also provide a variety of related services that are designed to support our clients in the use of research models in drug discovery and development. We maintain multiple production centers, including barrier rooms and isolator facilities, on three continents (North America, Europe, and Asia). In 2021, RMS accounted for 19.5% of our total revenue and approximately 3,900 of our employees, including approximately 190 science professionals with advanced degrees.
Our DSA business segment provides services that enable our clients to outsource their innovative drug discovery research, their related drug development activities, and their regulatory-required safety testing of potential new drugs, vaccines, industrial and agricultural chemicals, consumer products, veterinary medicines and medical devices. The demand for these services is driven by the needs of large global pharmaceutical companies that continue to transition to an outsourced drug development model, as well as by the needs of mid-size and emerging biotechnology companies, industrial and agrochemical companies and non-governmental organizations that rely on outsourcing. These entities may choose to outsource their discovery, development and safety activities to reduce fixed costs and to gain access to additional scientific expertise and capabilities. In fiscal 2021, we

Additionally, we offer ion channel and drug transporter testing for both discovery and non-clinical purposes, as well as genome editing services.
We also provide these services at our clients’ laboratories with Charles River scientists as part of an insourcing service model. Through strategic partnerships, we also offer an artificial intelligence drug design platform, 3D in vitro oncology models, implantable micro device in animal tumor models to investigate pharmacological effects of multiple substances simultaneously and a human stem cell model platform.
In Vivo and In Vitro Discovery Services. In vivo Discovery Services are essential in early stage, non-clinical discovery research, and are directed at the identification, screening, optimization and selection of effective therapeutic agents in pharmacology models. These in vivo activities typically extend anywhere from 1 to 3 years in conventional pharmaceutical R&D timelines. Our offerings include businesses that provide critical data to advance novel therapeutics, as well as drug transporter assays and kits. We offer R&D expertise, capabilities and services globally to accelerate our clients’ drug discovery pipelines from lead generation to candidate selection. We complement and extend clients’ capabilities and expertise to improve their decision-making, increase their flexibility, and reduce their internal costs and product development timelines. In addition, we provide a growing portfolio of in vitro assays in support of lead optimization to candidate selection activities. Examples of this include early pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies and in vitro assays to assess mechanism, bioavailability, metabolism, efficacy, pharmacology and safety.
Through strategic technology partnerships, we also offer artificial intelligence-enabled drug design and multiple advanced biology analytics platforms, both in vivo and in vitro, that address human and disease translatability.
Safety Assessment. We offer a full range of safety assessment studies required for regulatory submission on a global basis in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, industrial chemical, agrochemicals, consumer products, veterinary medicines and medical devices industries. Our safety assessment business also provides expertise in a variety of therapeutic areas, as well as the development of surgically implanted medical devices.
Toxicology. We offer a broad offering of in vitro and in vivo capabilities and study types designed to identify possible safety risks as well as a broad offering of in vitro and in vivo studies in support of general toxicology (acute, sub-acute and chronic studies), genetic toxicology, safety pharmacology, reproductive and developmental toxicology, juvenile toxicology, and carcinogenicity bioassays that are required for regulatory submissions supporting “first-in-human” to “first-to-the-market” strategies for potential human therapeutics. Additionally, we can support safety studies in numerous specialty areas including abuse and seizure liability, ecotoxicology, environmental risk, musculoskeletal toxicology, neurotoxicology, ocular toxicology, phototoxicology and radiation biology. We have expertise in the design and execution of development programs in support of a broad diversity of therapeutic modalities in numerous laboratory species and test systems. We also support safety studies to test industrial chemical, agrochemicals, consumer products, veterinary medicines and medical devices. For human pharmaceutical candidates, once a lead candidate is selected, toxicology studies are required to support clinical trials in humans and for regulatory approval. These toxicology studies focus on assessing the safety of the potential therapeutic to determine if administration to humans might cause any unintended harmful effects. For new chemicals, industrial chemicals, agrochemicals, veterinary medicines, consumer products and medical devices, safety studies are performed to identify potential hazards to humans and the environment and are required for regulatory registration. Toxicology studies performed for any of these compounds are typically performed using in vitro and in vivo research models to identify any potential adverse effects that a compound has on an organism over a variety of doses and over various time periods of exposure.
CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.

Pathology Services. The ability to identify and characterize clinical and anatomic pathologic changes is critical in determining the safety and efficacy of potential new therapeutics, industrial and agricultural chemicals, veterinary medicines, and medical devices. Key “go/no-go” decisions regarding continued product development are typically dependent on the identification, characterization and evaluation of fluid, tissue and cellular changes that our experts identify and interpret for our clients. We employ many highly trained veterinary anatomic and clinical pathologists and other scientists who use state-of-the-art techniques to identify potential test item-related changes. In addition to all standard anatomic and clinical pathology techniques, we provide specialized evaluations such as cytology, platelet function, assay development, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, electron microscopy, image analysis, tissue morphometry and stereology services.
Safety Pharmacology. Our clients are also required to conduct an assessment of Safety Pharmacology. This suite of studies is used to determine any effects on the vital organ systems of the body - cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous system (CNS). Along with heart rate and blood pressure measurements, the cardiovascular assessment will also assess if the test article has the potential to alter cardiac ion channel currents and prolong the cardiac QT interval of the electrocardiogram. Additionally, effects on the CNS and respiratory systems are assessed to complete the battery of studies to evaluate the vital organ systems of the body. Supplemental studies can also be performed to assess the renal, gastrointestinal and autonomic nervous systems, as well as, dependency potential. We have in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo assays and perform the screening prior to the commencement of first-in-human clinical trials. Our capabilities can also be used to investigate the mode of action behind an adverse effect found in a safety assessment study.
Bioanalysis, Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics. In support of non-clinical drug safety testing and new chemical development, our clients are required to demonstrate appropriate stability in the collected biological sample, pharmacokinetics of their drug or compound in circulation, the presence of metabolites and, in the case of biologics, the presence or absence of anti-drug antibodies. We have scientific expertise in the sophisticated bioanalytical techniques required to satisfy these requirements for many drugs and chemicals. Once analysis is complete, our scientists evaluate the data to provide information on the pharmacokinetics and/or toxicokinetics of the drug or chemical and complete an evaluation of the biologic disposition of the drug or chemical and its potential metabolites. Pharmacokinetics refers to the understanding of what the body does to a drug or compound administered at therapeutic dose levels, including the process by which the drug is absorbed, distributed in the body, metabolized and excreted. Toxicokinetics refers to the same understanding as applied at higher doses that may result in adverse effects. These studies are routinely required for the full non-clinical assessment of the disposition of the drug or chemical and the results are used in the safety evaluation of the compound. After performing sample analysis in support of non-clinical studies, we also support the clinical bioanalysis required in clinical trials for drug development.
Our safety assessment facilities comply with GLP to the extent required by the FDA, Environmental Protection Agency, USDA, European Medicines Agency, European Chemicals Agency and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), as well as other international regulatory agencies. Furthermore, our early-stage discovery work, which is not subject to GLP standards, is typically carried out under a quality management system. Our facilities are regularly inspected by U.S. and other regulatory compliance monitoring authorities, our clients’ quality assurance departments and our own internal quality assessment program.
Manufacturing Solutions
Our Manufacturing Solutions segment is comprised of three businesses: Microbial Solutions, Biologics Solutions and Avian Vaccine Services.

Endotoxin testing is an in vitro process that uses a processed extract from horseshoe crabs, known as limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL). The LAL test is the first and most successful FDA-validated alternative to an in vivo test to date. Generally, the extraction of the raw materials for LAL does not harm the crabs, which are subsequently returned to their natural ocean 
CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.

environment. We have worked closely with the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources to protect the horseshoe crab and, in the regions where those protections are in place, the horseshoe crab population is growing. 
One of the primary growth drivers in our Microbial Solutions business is our FDA-approved line of next-generation endotoxin testing products. This line is based on the Endosafe Portable Testing System (Endosafe® -PTS™) technology, which allows rapid endotoxin testing in the central laboratory or manufacturing environment. In recent years, we expanded the PTS product portfolio to include a multiple sample testing system known as the Endosafe®-MCS™ (multi-cartridge system) and the first fully automated robotic system developed specifically for high-volume endotoxin testing, Endosafe®-Nexus, to satisfy the demand of our clients who require higher sample throughput. We have seen expanded use of this rapid endotoxin testing technology as clients transition from traditional methods to our rapid cartridge technology and are seeking to meet data integrity requirements with our automated systems and software solutions.
Celsis®. The Celsis® reagents and instrument systems are used for in-process and product-release testing to help ensure the safe and efficient manufacture of pharmaceutical and consumer products. Celsis® products utilize bioluminescence technology for the rapid detection of microbial contamination delivering definitive results for some applications as fast as 24 hours. The product range includes reagent kits, instruments, software and services. The Celsis Advance II™ and Celsis Accel™ instruments and software automate the for rapid microbial detection. We recently launched a suite of products focused on sterility testing. Sterility testing is required prior to the release of sterile injectable products. The legacy method required a 14-day sample incubation period and was subjective. Using the Celsis® protocol and instrumentation, clients can detect contamination within 6 days and make definitive product release decisions. In 2020, we launched the Celsis Complete™ and Celsis Advantage™ services. The Celsis Complete™ services supply both the documentation and testing required as part of a client sterility technology validation process. This assists customers to complete their validation process very quickly without utilizing their own personnel resources. The Celsis Advantage product supplies the required documentation needed for the clients to conduct their own internal validation.

In 2021, we acquired Cognate BioServices, Inc., a cell and gene therapy contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) offering comprehensive manufacturing solutions for cell and gene therapies, as well as for the production of plasmid DNA and other inputs in the CDMO value chain, and Vigene, a gene therapy CDMO, providing plasmid DNA and viral vector-based gene delivery solutions. These acquisitions expanded our Biologics Solutions business, into the high-growth advanced therapy CDMO market and into each of the three major platforms: cell therapy, viral vector, and plasmid DNA production. Our CDMO services establish us as a premier scientific partner for cell and gene therapy development, testing, and manufacturing; enable us to provide clients with an integrated solution from basic research and discovery through cGMP production; enable us to drive efficiency and accelerate clients’ speed-to-market by integrating manufacturing and the required testing; and enable our clients to seamlessly conduct analytical testing, process development, and manufacturing for advanced modalities with the same scientific partner. 
Avian Vaccine Services. We are the global leader for the supply of SPF fertile chicken eggs and chickens. SPF chicken embryos are used by vaccine producers as self-contained “bioreactors” for the manufacture of live viruses. These viruses are used as a raw material for human and veterinary vaccine applications. The production of SPF eggs is performed under biosecure conditions, similar in many ways to our research model production. We have a worldwide presence, with several SPF egg production facilities in the U.S., and contracted production capabilities in Hungary. We also operate a specialized avian laboratory in the U.S., which provides quality control test reagents for our SPF flocks, offers testing services to vaccine companies and commercial poultry operations and manufactures poultry diagnostics and bulk antigens for poultry vaccines.
Our Strategy
Our objective is to be the preferred strategic global partner for our clients. Our strategy is to deliver a comprehensive and integrated portfolio of drug discovery and non-clinical development products, services and solutions to support our clients’ discovery and early-stage drug research, process development, scale up and manufacturing efforts, and enable them to bring new and improved therapies to market faster and more cost effectively. Separately, through our various Manufacturing segment businesses, we aim to be the premier provider of products and services that ensure our clients produce and release their products safely.
We believe we have certain competitive advantages in executing this strategy because of our continuing focus on the following:
Integrated Early-Stage Portfolio. We are the only large, global CRO with a portfolio of products, services and solutions that focuses on drug discovery and early-stage development. We provide research models and associated services, discovery research studies and services and comprehensive safety assessment studies in both regulated and non-regulated environments. As such, we can collaborate with clients from target discovery through candidate selection. When critical decisions are made regarding which therapeutics will progress from discovery to development, we continue to work alongside our clients as the drug candidates move downstream. Our recognized expertise in early-stage drug research and pharmacology provides us with a competitive advantage and enables our clients to make critical drug development decisions more quickly. We understand our clients’ therapies and the challenges they face during the discovery and development process, including mechanism of action, efficacy, drug metabolism, safety assessment and toxicological testing, which are all critical for making “go/no-go” decisions.
Comprehensive Biopharmaceutical Manufacturing Portfolio. We also offer a portfolio of products, services and solutions that supports the process development, scale up, quality control and production efforts of the biopharmaceutical industry. We provide products and services that support the development and release of clinical stage and commercialized biologics products, including CDMO services to manufacture advanced therapeutics for our clients. In particular, we are an industry leader in the areas of microbial detection and microbial identification to support process development and ongoing commercial production. Our portfolio spans a broad range of traditional and rapid methods, which provide the highest testing quality, enhance productivity and reduce cycle time. To connect with our therapeutic design and testing capabilities in Discovery we can also manufacture cell and gene therapies for clinical and commercial use. 
Deep Scientific Expertise. We provide a breadth and depth of scientific expertise across a broad range of therapeutic areas which may be too costly for our clients to build and/or maintain in-house. We provide essential capabilities, including biomarkers, antibody engineering, medicinal chemistry, in vitro screening, in vivo pharmacology, immunology, pathology, advanced modalities manufacturing, biologics process development testing, microbial detection and identification and other specialty service areas that have high infrastructure costs or are cost-prohibitive for clients to maintain independently. We continue to expand our portfolio in key therapeutic and pharmacology areas to align with our clients’ internal drug discovery and development areas of focus. We also continue to enhance our small molecule and biologics portfolio in areas of greatest industry need, where outsourcing provides major benefits 
CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.

for our clients and where we could provide significant benefits given our unique early-stage development portfolio and global footprint.
Commitment to Animal Welfare. We are committed to being the worldwide leader in the humane care of research animals and implementation of the “3Rs” initiative (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement). As researchers, we are responsible to our clients, our animals and the public for the health and well-being of the animals in our care. We work closely with the scientific community to understand how living conditions, handling procedures and reduction of stress play an important role in the quality and efficiency of research.
Superior Quality and Client Support. We maintain scientific rigor and high-quality standards through management of key performance indicators and an intense focus on biosecurity and quality. These standards allow clients to access our global portfolio of products and services with the confidence that they will obtain consistent results no matter where they choose to obtain their products or conduct their research.
Flexible and Customized Environment to Provide the Right Solutions. Each of our clients is different, with unique needs and specific requirements. We understand the importance of flexibility, and leverage the expertise embedded in our integrated, non-clinical portfolio to provide customized solutions tailored to the specific need or therapeutic area for a particular client. By utilizing our streamlined and efficient facilities, we help clients create a flexible and integrated infrastructure in order to improve their workload and staffing requirements. This allows our clients to reduce internal capacity and/or staff while ensuring the conduct of effective quality research for their projects. We provide enhanced value to clients who use us as a full-service integrated partner over a longer period of time.
Large, Global Partner. We believe there is an important advantage in being a full service, high-quality provider of research models and associated services, discovery and non-clinical in vivo and in vitro services and manufacturing solutions on a global scale. Many of our clients, especially large biopharmaceutical companies, have decided to limit the number of suppliers with which they work. They frequently chose to partner with large Tier 1 CROs like Charles River, who can offer clients support across the non-clinical drug research process as a result of broader portfolios and experience in project management. This includes extensive scientific, technical and therapeutic area expertise, real-time access to data through secure portals, provision of data in sponsor-specific formats for data warehousing needs, accelerated reporting, reduced standard reporting timelines and industry-leading Standard Exchange of Non-Clinical Data (SEND) capabilities, a global footprint, streamlined and simplified processes and communications, including professional project and relationship management. We are focused on leveraging our competitive advantages to ensure we are recognized as the premier preferred provider, thereby enabling us to build broader and deeper long-term strategic relationships with our clients.
Our clients’ R&D needs continue to evolve. These clients are increasingly emphasizing studies that have greater translation to the clinic so that they can make appropriate decisions regarding the progression of potential therapeutic entities earlier in the development process. The result is a greater focus on discovery services, including in vivo pharmacology studies consisting of efficacy and non-GLP DMPK (drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics) studies. Second, these clients are choosing to outsource additional discovery and safety assessment services to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their drug selection processes.
We believe that this changing environment will provide enhanced outsourcing opportunities for us in the future. We remain optimistic that our clients are increasingly receptive to partnering with CROs as a means of meeting their discovery and non-clinical support needs. We believe that the successful development of new therapies and outsourcing by the pharmaceutical industry will continue to be positive drivers of demand for our products and services.
Global biopharmaceutical companies are continuing to make the decision to outsource more significant tranches of their drug discovery, development and manufacturing processes. The success of our business model is underscored by the fact that we have entered into strategic commercial relationships with leading global biopharmaceutical companies and expanded existing preferred provider agreements with other leading global biopharmaceutical companies. We also continue to broaden and extend our relationships with other research institutions across the portfolio. 
We believe that larger biopharmaceutical companies will increasingly focus on efficiencies and execution. They will continue to reassess their core differentiators from R&D to commercialization, and which aspects of their drug discovery, development and manufacturing processes they will choose to outsource. We expect they will also continue to be conservative in re-building infrastructure and expertise. This should lead to more opportunities for strategic outsourcing as larger pharmaceutical clients choose to utilize external resources rather than invest in internal infrastructure. By partnering with a CRO like Charles River, they can take advantage of efficiencies in their early-stage research activities that can result in months or years saved in getting a drug to market. In the aggregate, we believe that the evolving large biopharmaceutical R&D business model will make our essential products and services even more relevant to our clients, and allow them to leverage our integrated offerings and expertise to drive their research, non-clinical development and manufacturing efficiency and cost effectiveness.
CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.

We believe it is critical to participate in the strategic commercial partnering process because these relationships are likely to extend for multiple years and drive pull-through across our portfolio. Furthermore, both the client and the CRO invest heavily in the initial phases of the relationship to successfully transfer work streams and establish governance processes. Given this investment, clients are less likely to change CROs at the conclusion of the initial relationship. Because of this strategy, we have been successfully renewing the majority of our strategic commercial partnerships.
The evolving biopharmaceutical R&D business model, coupled with a robust funding environment, have also led to the emergence of a significant number of new biotechnology companies in recent years that are discovering innovative new therapies. We believe that our portfolio provides flexible solutions that meet the customized needs for virtual and small biotechnology companies, which have limited or no infrastructure. These clients also value our ability to provide a broad range of services where we work hand in hand with our clients to design, plan and manage integrated projects and programs. This includes classically outsourced services, “insourced” services and hybrid offerings blending resources from both our clients and our staff.
Our strategic imperatives are centered around our intense focus on initiatives designed to allow us to drive profitable growth, enhance our operating efficiency and better position ourselves to operate successfully in the current and future business environment, which we believe will collectively enable us to maximize value for our shareholders. 
In recent years, we have expanded our Biologics Solutions services into the established high-growth market of cell and gene therapy. Our goal is to deliver the fastest and highest quality end-to-end integrated solution to accelerate cell and gene therapy development and manufacturing globally by leveraging our comprehensive portfolio with a consistent, easy-to-use, and customizable, high-science approach, while offering the flexibility to adapt and innovate to meet our client’s changing needs. In the cell and gene therapy market, we aim to accelerate our clients’ path to market, to expand capabilities and geographic reach to complement our leading non-clinical portfolio, and to collaborate with our clients and partners to enable and commercialize the next generation of cell and gene therapy innovations. The acquisitions of Cognate and Vigene, combined with our comprehensive portfolio, most notably our Biologics Testing Solutions business, industry experience, and established infrastructure, helped solidify the Company as a premier scientific partner for cell and gene therapy development, testing, and manufacturing.
We intend to continue to broaden the scope of the products and services that we provide across the drug discovery and non-clinical development continuum primarily through internal development, and, as needed, through focused acquisitions and alliances. Acquisitions, such as our acquisitions of Citoxlab in fiscal 2019, HemaCare and Cellero in fiscal 2020, and Distributed Bio, Retrogenix, Cognate, and Vigene in fiscal 2021, are an integral part of our growth strategy, both to expand our portfolio and broaden our geographic footprint. We are committed to a disciplined approach that seeks to target businesses that are a sound strategic fit and that offer the prospect of enhancing shareholder value, typically including the achievement of a hurdle rate for return on invested capital above our weighted average cost of capital.
In addition to conventional mergers and acquisitions, our long-term strategy includes growth through establishing relationships and exploring other opportunities and areas that have the potential to strengthen our broad-based portfolio of products and services. In particular, our focus has been to drive differentiation through technologies that enhance the speed to develop a clinical candidate and allow biopharmaceutical companies to make earlier go/no-go decisions. Among other arrangements, these relationships may include entering into license agreements, strategic technology partnerships or joint ventures that will allow us to access cutting-edge or nascent technologies with a modest investment component. Our ability to thoroughly assess these technologies and market opportunities may later result in an acquisition. 
We also partner with a diverse set of leading venture capital firms around the world primarily investing in life sciences, health care and therapeutics with an emphasis on early-stage companies. Through these partnerships and close relationships, we gain insight into their company and asset portfolios and are thus able to promote our contract research services for discovery, safety assessment and biologics testing. Thus, we have the opportunity to establish ourselves as a provider of choice for a unique client group that has emerged as biopharmaceutical companies rationalize and prioritize their development pipelines.
Clients
Our clients consist primarily of major biopharmaceutical companies; many biotechnology, agricultural and industrial chemical, life science, veterinary medicine, medical device, diagnostic and consumer product companies; contract research and contract manufacturing organizations; and other commercial entities, as well as leading hospitals, academic institutions and government agencies. We have stable, long-term relationships with many of our clients. During 2021, no single commercial client accounted for more than 4% of our total revenue and no single client accounted for more than 8% of the revenue of any of our three business segments.
We continue to pursue a goal of expanding our relationships with our large biopharmaceutical clients, and with many of our larger mid-market clients. These relationships take different forms, from preferred provider arrangements to strategic partnerships. The structure of these relationships incentivizes clients to purchase more products and services across our non-
CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.

clinical portfolio. Because of the strength of these relationships, we have better insight into our clients’ planning processes and, therefore, better visibility than in the past. For information regarding revenue attributable to each of our business segments for the last three fiscal years, please see Note 4, “Segment and Geographic Information” included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. For information regarding revenue and long-lived assets attributable to operations in the United States, Europe, Canada, Asia Pacific and other countries for each of the last three fiscal years, please review Note 4, “Segment and Geographic Information” included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
Sales, Marketing and Customer Support
Our marketing efforts are focused on stimulating demand for further outsourcing across our entire services portfolio. We believe that our ability to provide solutions that address all aspects of early-stage drug research are increasingly attractive to our clients, and we continue to design and market our commercial activities to deliver flexible, customized programs designed by segment to meet our clients’ global and site-specific needs.
Our go-to-market approach employs a number of sales and marketing strategies, including dedicated sales teams for each of our major lines of business. We also maintain several sales specialists that either have specific technical expertise (often degreed scientists) or cover unique markets.
In addition to our field sales teams and related specialists, we also have a team of alliance managers who are organized by key client within our market segments (global biopharmaceutical, small and mid-sized pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and academic and government institutions). This enhances our ability to meet client needs by offering customized, tailored solutions across our entire portfolio. In addition, our clients benefit by additional support from a combination of technical specialists with specific scientific and therapeutic area expertise. We also apply the use of dedicated sales specialists for certain technical product lines, such as in our Manufacturing businesses.
We sell our products and services principally through our direct sales and business development teams who work in North America, Europe and Asia. In addition to interactions with our direct sales force, our primary promotional activities include organizing scientific symposia, publishing scientific papers and newsletters, hosting webinars and seminars and making presentations at, and participating in, scientific conferences and trade shows in North America, Europe and Asia. We supplement these scientifically based marketing activities with digital marketing, advertising and direct mail. In certain areas, our direct sales force is supplemented by international distributors and agents.
Our internal strategic marketing and marketing operations teams support the field sales and business development teams while developing and implementing programs to build awareness about products and services and create opportunities for interaction with our clients in the biomedical research industry. We maintain client engagement, lead development support, digital experience, and event management departments, which address both our clients’ routine and more specialized needs and purposely serve as a scientific support and information resource for them. We frequently assist our clients in solving problems related to resourcing products and services, research support, non-clinical study design, regulatory consulting, protocol development and other areas in which our expertise is widely recognized as a valuable resource by our clients.
Competition
Our goal is to be a leader in each of the markets in which we participate. We compete in the marketplace on the basis of our therapeutic and scientific expertise in early-stage drug research, quality, reputation, flexibility, responsiveness, pricing, innovation and global capabilities. We are able to offer a unique portfolio of early-stage products and services to support drug discovery and development.
We encounter a broad range of competitors of different sizes and capabilities in each of our three businesses segments. We also face competition from the internal discovery and development resources of our clients.
•For RMS, we have four main competitors of which one is a government funded, not-for-profit entity; one is a public company in the U.S.; one is privately held in Europe; and one is privately held in the U.S. 
•For DSA, both our Discovery Services and Safety Assessment businesses have numerous competitors. Discovery Services has hundreds of competitors, but two main competitors: one is a public company in China and one is a public company in Europe. Antibody discovery services has tens of competitors in the U.S., Europe and China. Safety Assessment has dozens of competitors of varying size, but one main competitor that is a division of a large public company in the U.S. Our DSA segment also competes with in-house departments of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities and teaching hospitals.
•For Manufacturing, each of our underlying businesses has several competitors. Microbial Solutions has four main competitors, of which three are public companies in Europe and one is a private company in the U.S. In addition to many smaller competitors, Biologics Solutions has five main competitors, of which three are public companies in the 
CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.

U.S., one is a public company in Europe, and one is a public company in China. Avian has one main competitor to its SPF eggs business, which is a private company in Europe, and numerous competitors for specialized avian laboratory services. 
Industry Support and Animal Welfare
One of our core values is a concern for, and commitment to, animal welfare. Research animals are an important resource that further our knowledge of living systems and contribute to the discovery of life-saving drugs and procedures. We work hand-in-hand with the scientific community to understand how living conditions, handling procedures and stress play a role in the quality and efficiency of research. As researchers, we are responsible to our clients and the public for the health and well-being of the animals in our care. 
We have been in the forefront of animal welfare improvements in our industry, and continue to show our commitment with special recognition programs for employees who demonstrate an extraordinary commitment in this critical aspect of our business. We created our own Humane Care Imperative (HCI), which is overseen by our Global Animal Welfare and Training corporate group. The goal of HCI is to ensure that we continue as a worldwide leader in the humane care of research animals and implementation of the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement). 
We are firmly committed to the 3Rs and to reducing the number of animals used by emphasizing health, research animal behavioral management programs and genetic integrity to decrease study data variability. Whenever possible, we use technological advances such as new diagnostic tests for screening pathogens in laboratory rodents, microsampling and in vitro assays. We support a wide variety of organizations and individuals working to further animal welfare and the 3Rs, as well as the interests of the biomedical research community. We also partner with clients to develop study designs decreasing the number of animals needed and suggesting pilot studies where appropriate. We maintain a quarterly award program that recognizes our employees’ efforts to continually implement the 3Rs at our sites globally.
We provide for scholarships for training in laboratory animal science, provide financial support to non-profit organizations that educate the public about the benefits of animal research and provide awards and prizes to outstanding leaders in the laboratory animal science field and the supporters of 3Rs.
Human Capital Resources
Employees
As of December 25, 2021, we had approximately 20,000 employees (including approximately 2,000 science professionals with advanced degrees, including Ph.D.s, D.V.M.s and M.D.s). Approximately 18,600 of our employees are considered full-time employees, while approximately 1,400 are considered part-time employees. Our workforce was distributed geographically approximately as follows: 63% in North America, 32% in Europe, and 5% in Asia, and less than 1% in any other region.
Our employees are not unionized in the U.S. Employees at some of our European facilities are represented by works councils, employee representative groups and/or unions, which is consistent with local customs for our industry. We collaborate with the works councils and believe we have good relationships with our employees.
Values
At Charles River, our values of Care, Lead, Own, and Collaborate guide our decisions and actions; they are standards we hold ourselves to each and every day and are critical to success in fulfilling our goals. 
Talent Management and Engagement
Sustaining our corporate culture is a vital part our strategy. Our corporate culture is built on trust, inclusion, accountability, respect, and well-being. Our objective is to enable colleagues to connect with their work in a way that supports each other, our clients, and our communities. We strive to maintain an environment wherein every person has the ability to deliver on business commitments, while having purpose, being energized, continuously learning, and delivering quality outcomes that make a difference. We pride ourselves on supporting our people both professionally and personally throughout their employee experience with us.
In order to support, attract and retain such great talent, we provide our employees with opportunities for skill building and career advancement. Our talent management approach is structured to be highly collaborative, encourages ownership, and provides the opportunity to contribute and develop through regular performance conversations, annual goal setting, and ongoing feedback. Furthermore, we have created a global learning strategy that includes technical training, mentoring and coaching approaches, tuition reimbursement, rotational programs, leadership development programs, and on-the-job training. In fiscal 2021, we hired over 5,300 people and our voluntary turnover for all employees was approximately 13%, a portion of which percentage we attribute to the national trend of increased attrition in the workplace. Additionally, we conduct regular talent reviews to identify and develop diverse leadership and key talent pipelines to delivery on short-term and long-term business strategy. 
CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.

We have also recently evolved our engagement surveys to be more frequent, shorter engagement “Pulse” surveys. These Pulse surveys were issued three times during 2021 and serve as a foundation for more meaningful conversations and actions between our people and people leaders to continue making Charles River a best place to work, learn, and grow.
In addition to growth opportunities, we strive to attract, motivate, and retain top talent by providing competitive compensation programs while rewarding outcomes and behaviors that align with our performance, culture, and values. While we perform pay equity audits in countries where they are legally required, we also performed a larger pay equity analysis on a global scale and took corrective action where appropriate as part of our continuing efforts to be competitive in the marketplace. Furthermore, our global job architecture generally allows for aligning pay by job role with market rates and serves as a career path tool to encourage a culture of advancement. 
Health and Safety
We also promote a healthy and safe workplace for our employees. We maintain a Global Policy on Safety & Sustainability and, as part of our efforts to promote our goals of working safely and sustainably, in early 2020 we implemented a management systems approach to improve our safety performance, which involves both employee and management engagement in and ownership of our site-level environment, health, safety, and sustainability programs globally. At every Charles River site globally, we have health and safety leaders that promote employee health and safety and keep site management engaged in their health and safety programs.
The COVID-19 pandemic has further underscored for us the importance of keeping our employees safe and healthy. In response to the pandemic, we have taken actions to protect our workforce so they can more safely and effectively perform their work. Charles River established a global crisis management team, which includes a team of internal and external experts who have been closely monitoring the COVID-19 outbreak and its impact on employee safety and our business operations. As we navigate the pandemic and focus on keeping people safe, we continue to establish stringent safety protocols at our operating sites. As always, our goal is to provide a safe work environment for our employees, while still meeting our client’s needs for their research solutions. Our global and site business continuity plans are comprehensive, active, and continuously updated as we continue to meet requirements for planned and new projects, including work supporting COVID-19 research efforts. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We are also committed to cultivating a welcoming and inclusive environment where every employee can succeed and thrive. Operating in over 110 locations and in over 20 countries worldwide (excluding our Insourcing Solutions sites), we believe in treating our employees and prospective talent with dignity, decency, and respect. We recognize that employee diversity contributes to a more innovative workforce and see diversity and inclusivity as a strength for our business. Our commitment to equity spans across our employment-related decisions, from hiring and promotions, to transfers and compensation and career development programs. Our aim is to continue to build a talented workforce reflective of the global communities in which we live and work, and it is critical that our people feel like valued members of our Company. We believe that we have taken positive steps to promote a sense of belonging for our employees in the workplace by building a Diversity, Equity & Inclusion team and Chief Executive Officer-chaired Diversity, Equity and Inclusion council; expanding diverse representation at our Board level; launching employee resource groups; facilitating training on mitigating unconscious bias and creating inclusion for our people leaders and talent acquisition teams; and rolling out a Diverse Interview Panel initiative. This year, we have also set goals to increase engagement in diversity, equity and inclusion; increase participation in our employee resource groups; and maintain strong engagement and belonging scores on our employee engagement surveys. In addition to our internally focused efforts, we also actively engage with our clients and suppliers to share best practices. As of December 25, 2021, women made up approximately 60% of our global workforce, 59% of our U.S. workforce and 36% of our global leadership positions, defined as positions carrying the title of Vice President or higher. From our U.S. workforce, 29% identified as racial and ethnic minorities.
Backlog
Our backlog for our RMS, DSA and Manufacturing reportable segments was approximately $266 million, $2.4 billion and $136 million, respectively, as of December 25, 2021, as compared to $168 million, $1.4 billion and $79 million, respectively, as of December 26, 2020. Related services are performed over varying durations, from short to extended periods of time, which may be as long as several years. We maintain an order backlog to track anticipated revenue from studies and projects that either have not started, but are anticipated to begin in the near future, or are in process and have not been completed. We only recognize a study or project in backlog after we have received written evidence of a client’s intention to proceed. Canceled studies or projects are removed from backlog.
We believe our aggregate backlog as of any date is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of our future results for a variety of reasons. First, studies vary in duration (i.e., some studies or projects that are included in December 25, 2021 backlog may be completed in 2022, while others may be completed in later years). Second, the scope of studies or projects may change, which may either increase or decrease their value. Third, studies or projects included in backlog may be subject to bonus or penalty 
CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.

payments. Fourth, studies or projects may be terminated or delayed at any time by the client or regulatory authorities for a number of reasons, including the failure of a drug to satisfy safety and efficacy requirements, or a sponsor making a strategic decision that a study or service is no longer necessary. Delayed contracts remain in our backlog until a determination of whether to continue, modify or cancel the study has been made. We may not be able to realize all or most of the net revenues included in backlog or estimate the portion to be filled in the current year.
Regulatory Matters
As our business operates in many distinct regional environments and in a variety of locations worldwide, we are subject to numerous, and sometimes overlapping, regulatory environments.
The Animal Welfare Act (AWA) governs the care and use of certain species of animals used for research in the U.S. other than laboratory rats, mice and chickens bred for use in research. As a result, most of our U.S. small animal research models activities and our avian vaccine services operations are not subject to regulation under the AWA. For regulated species, the AWA and the associated Animal Care regulations require producers and users of regulated species to provide veterinary care and to utilize specific husbandry practices such as cage size, shipping conditions, sanitation and environmental enrichment to ensure the welfare of these animals. Separately, facilities using live vertebrate animals in research funded by the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) must also adhere to the PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and follow the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals produced by the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research.
We comply with licensing and registration requirement standards set by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and similar agencies in other countries such as Europe, China and Japan for the care, handling and use of regulated species and birds bred for research. With the exception of one facility acquired as part of the Cellero acquisition that does not utilize animal research models, our DSA and RMS facilities in North America and Europe are either accredited or in the process of initiating accreditation by Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International, a private, nonprofit, international organization that promotes the humane treatment of animals in science through voluntary accreditation and assessment programs.
Our import and export of animals and our operations in foreign countries are subject to international agreements and conventions, as well as a variety of national, regional and local laws and regulations, which establish the standards for the humane treatment, care, handling and transport of animals by dealers and research facilities.
We conduct non-clinical safety assessment studies to support the submissions for approval or licensing of our clients’ products throughout the world. Many of these studies must comply with national statutory or regulatory requirements for GLP. GLP regulations describe a quality system for the scientific, operational and quality process and the conditions under which non-clinical studies are planned, performed, monitored, recorded, reported and archived. GLP compliance is required by such regulatory agencies as the FDA, European Medicines Agency, Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency in the United Kingdom (U.K.), Health Products Regulatory Authority in Ireland, Health Canada and other similar monitoring authorities in the countries where we operate. GLP requirements are significantly harmonized throughout the world and our laboratories are capable of conducting studies in compliance with all necessary requirements.
Regulatory monitoring authorities such as the FDA, Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency and OECD countries have indicated an increased emphasis on the management of electronic records generated by computerized systems to ensure data integrity under newly issued guidance. We have established a formal program to manage regulatory and client expectations regarding data integrity within our regulated businesses. Although each business has a different impact on patient safety, all are expected to generate data with integrity. We recognize the importance of generating quality, reliable, sustainable data and have instituted several processes and established a global governance team with oversight responsibilities for our Data Integrity Compliance Plans to ensure we are consistent in our approach. To ensure that we have proper regulatory oversight over our electronic records, a dedicated quality function reviews our computerized system practices to ensure that appropriate record controls are in place and that a robust audit strategy confirms requirements for compliance.
At a global level, retention of data and controls for electronic systems, proprietary data and quality standards are covered by global policies. We also have controls in place such as quality manuals, policies and procedures, work instructions, document control processes, training, quality assurance and quality control processes and personnel, validated computerized systems and archiving requirements. Within businesses, procedures govern performance of activities to ensure data integrity throughout its life cycle.
Our Manufacturing businesses produce endotoxin test kits, reagents, cell banks used in research and biopharmaceutical production, clinical trial vaccines and vaccine support products. Additionally, several of our laboratories conduct biosafety and analytical testing such as identity, stability, sterility and potency testing in support of our clients’ manufacturing programs and to fulfill their validation requirements, as applicable. Furthermore, our comprehensive cell and gene therapy manufacturing services include GMP production of cells from pre-clinical to commercial applications from a variety of starting materials. These activities are subject to regulation and consequently require these businesses to be inspected by the FDA and other national regulatory agencies under their respective cGMP regulations. These regulations require that we manufacture our 
CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.

products or perform testing in a prescribed manner with respect to cGMP compliance, and maintain records of our manufacturing, testing and control activities. In addition, the specific activities of some of our businesses require us to hold specialized licenses for the manufacture, distribution and/or marketing of particular products.
All of our sites are subject to licensing and regulation, as appropriate under international treaties and conventions, including national, regional and local laws relating to:
•the surface and air transportation of chemicals, biological reagents and laboratory specimens;
•the handling, use, storage and disposal of chemicals (including narcotics and psychotropic drugs), biological reagents, laboratory specimens, hazardous waste and radioactive materials;
•the procurement, handling, use, storage and disposal of human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products for research purposes;
•the safety and health of employees and visitors to our facilities; and
•protection of the environment and general public.
Global regulatory compliance programs are managed by a dedicated group responsible for regulatory affairs and compliance. Our compliance programs are also managed by global quality systems, such as vendor supplier programs, quality management systems and global computer system validation. Within each regulated business, we have established Quality Assurance Units (QAUs) responsible for risk based internal audit programs to manage regulatory requirements and client expectations. The QAUs operate independently from those individuals that direct and conduct studies, manufacturing or analytical testing. Our Data Integrity Compliance Program ensures that management has proper oversight with QAUs of our electronic records, inclusive of quality function reviews of our computerized system practices to ensure that appropriate record controls are in place and that a robust audit strategy confirms requirements for compliance.
While we expect that capital expenditures will be necessary to ensure that our existing sites remain in compliance with government regulations, at this point we do not expect these expenditures to materially differ than our historical experience.
Intellectual Property
We develop and implement computer software and scientifically-driven products and procedures to maximize the quality and effectiveness of our offerings. Intellectual property rights, in the form of know-how, trade secrets, patents, trademarks, copyrights, and others are important to us and are valuable to our ability to provide significant benefits to our clients. Steps are taken to protect our intellectual property rights and include the execution of confidentiality agreements and securing registrations in relevant jurisdictions. In addition, we in-license technology from other companies when it enhances our product and services businesses. In-licensing has recently become a larger company-wide initiative, particularly as we increase our focus on innovative technologies that further diversify and enhance our portfolio. 
Corporate Governance
We are committed to operating our business with integrity and accountability. We strive to meet or exceed all of the corporate governance standards established by the NYSE, the SEC and the U.S. Federal government as implemented by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and other applicable laws, rules and regulations. Nine of the eleven members of our Board of Directors are independent and have no significant financial, business or personal ties to us or management. Our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of our Board of Directors are each composed entirely of independent directors. The Board adheres to our Corporate Governance Guidelines and a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that has been communicated to employees and posted on our website. We are diligent in complying with established accounting principles and are committed to providing financial information that is transparent, timely and accurate. We have a Related Person Transactions Policy designed to promote the timely identification of such transactions and to ensure we give appropriate consideration to any real or perceived conflicts in our commercial arrangements. We have established global process through which employees, either directly or anonymously, can notify management (and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors) of alleged accounting and auditing concerns or violations including fraud. Our internal Disclosure Committee meets regularly and operates pursuant to formal disclosure procedures and guidelines to help ensure that our public disclosures, including our periodic reports filed with the SEC, earnings releases and other written information that we disclose to the investment community are complete, accurate and timely. We continually monitor developments in the law and stock exchange regulations, as well as overall corporate governance trends and intend to adopt new procedures consistent with such developments to the extent applicable to and appropriate for our Company.
