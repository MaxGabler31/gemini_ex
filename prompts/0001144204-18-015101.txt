OVERVIEW
 
We are a clinical-stage, immuno-oncology biopharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of novel treatments for patients with solid tumor cancers. Our lead product candidate is a fully-human monoclonal antibody licensed from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (“Dana-Farber”) that targets programmed death-ligand 1 (“PD-L1”). We commenced a Phase 1 clinical study for our anti-PD-L1 antibody, CK-301, in October 2017, evaluating the safety and tolerability of CK-301 in checkpoint therapy-naïve patients with selected recurrent or metastatic cancers, and plan to develop CK-301 as a treatment for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) and other solid tumors. In addition, we are developing a small-molecule, targeted anti-cancer agent, CK-101, for the treatment of patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (“EGFR”) mutation-positive NSCLC. In September 2016 we commenced the Phase 1 portion of a Phase 1/2 clinical study for CK-101. Our pipeline also includes antibodies that target glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related protein (“GITR”) and carbonic anhydrase IX (“CAIX”), in addition to oral, small-molecule, targeted anti-cancer agents that inhibit bromodomain and extra-terminal (“BET”) proteins and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (“PARP”).
 
We have also entered into various collaboration agreements with TG Therapeutics, Inc. (“TGTX”), a related party, to develop and commercialize certain assets in connection with our licenses in the field of hematological malignancies, while we retain the right to develop and commercialize these assets in solid tumors.
 
To date, we have not received approval for the sale of any product candidate in any market and, therefore, have not generated any product sales from any product candidates. In addition, we have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception, and expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable. As of December 31, 2017, we have an accumulated deficit of $59.0 million.
 
We are a majority controlled subsidiary of Fortress Biotech, Inc. (“Fortress”).

PRODUCTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT
 
Immuno-Oncology Agents
 
CK-301 (Anti-PD-L1) Program
 
Our anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, CK-301, is a fully human antagonistic antibody designed to bind to PD-L1 and block its interaction with programmed cell death protein 1 (“PD-1”). Scientific literature indicates that PD-1 and its ligand PD-L1 are checkpoints of immune activation and play a very important role in negative regulation of T-cell effector function and proliferation. Physiological interaction between these molecules inhibits immune activation to prevent autoimmunity and to induce self-tolerance. Many different cancers take advantage of this pathway by expressing PD-L1 and triggering negative signaling in PD-1 expressing tumor reactive T-cells thus blocking an anti-tumor T-cell immune response.
 
Numerous preclinical and clinical studies of third party products have demonstrated that antibodies that block the interaction of PD-1 with its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, or those that block only the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 can augment anti-tumor T-cell responses and lead to complete and lasting tumor eradication in a certain proportion of patients. Confirmed overall response rate (“ORR”) in the labels for the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved PD-1 and PD-L1 blocking antibodies was cited in the 20-45% range based on clinical trials in patients with metastatic melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”). Potent therapeutic anti-tumor responses due to blocking of PD-1/PD-L1 interaction has been demonstrated by these approved products in patients with various solid tumors including, but not limited to, NSCLC, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”), head and neck cancer, and urothelial carcinoma.

We are developing our anti-PD-L1 antibody for the treatment of patients with NSCLC, as well as other solid tumor oncology indications where studies of other PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies have shown to be effective. We licensed the exclusive worldwide rights to certain anti-PD-L1 antibodies from Dana-Farber in March 2015. Also in March 2015, we entered into a Global Collaboration Agreement with TGTX, a related party, to develop and commercialize anti-PD-L1 antibodies in the field of hematological malignancies. We retain the right to develop and commercialize our anti-PD-L1 antibodies in solid tumors. We believe that CK-301 has the potential to be effective in many oncological indications as a monotherapy or in combination with other anti-tumor immune response potentiating compounds and targeted therapies.
 
We commenced a Phase 1 clinical study for CK-301 in October 2017. The study is evaluating the safety and tolerability of CK-301 in checkpoint therapy-naïve patients with selected recurrent or metastatic cancers.
 
CK-302 (Anti-GITR) Program
 
Our anti-GITR monoclonal antibody, CK-302, is a fully human agonistic antibody that is designed to bind and trigger signaling in GITR expressing cells. Scientific literature indicates that GITR is a co-stimulatory molecule of the TNF receptor family and is expressed on activated T cells, B cells, natural killer (“NK”) and regulatory T-cells (“Treg”). As a co-stimulatory molecule, GITR engagement increases proliferation, activation, and cytokine production of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. We believe our anti-GITR monoclonal antibody abrogates immunosuppressive activity of natural Treg on expansion of T-effector cells. GITR-specific agonistic monoclonal antibodies under development by third parties have been shown to induce tumor regression in vivo through the activation of CD4+ T-cells, CD8+ T-cells and NK cells in a number of tumor models.
 
We are developing CK-302 for oncology indications where scientific literature supports the potential for an anti-GITR to be effective. We licensed the exclusive worldwide rights to anti-GITR antibodies from Dana-Farber in March 2015. Also in March 2015, we entered into a Global Collaboration Agreement with TGTX to develop and commercialize anti-GITR antibodies in the field of hematological malignancies. We retain the right to develop and commercialize anti-GITR antibodies in solid tumors. We believe that an anti-GITR antibody has the potential to be effective in many oncological indications as a monotherapy or in combination with an anti-PD-L1 or anti-CAIX antibody as well as other anti-tumor immune response potentiating compounds and targeted therapies.
 
Currently, we are in preclinical development for this program. In late 2016, we commenced CMC development activities, which include the construction and testing of a production cell line, the development of a manufacturing process for production of the antibody, as well as the development of suitable analytical methods to characterize the antibody. We plan to develop control mechanisms to satisfy GMP requirements and scale-up manufacturing in order to conduct the required pharmacology and toxicology studies to support a potential IND application.
 
Targeted Anti-Cancer Agents
 
CK-101 (also known as RX518) EGFR Inhibitor Program
 
We are developing CK-101 as an oral, third-generation, irreversible kinase inhibitor against selective mutations of EGFR. Activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR such as L858R and exon 19 deletion are found in approximately 20% of patients with advanced NSCLC. Compared to chemotherapy, first-generation EGFR inhibitors significantly improved ORR and progression-free survival in previously untreated NSCLC patients carrying EGFR mutations. However, tumor progression could develop due to resistance mutations, often within months of treatment with first-generation EGFR inhibitors. 
 
The EGFR T790M “gatekeeper” mutation is the most common resistance mutation found in patients treated with first-generation EGFR inhibitors. The mutation decreases the affinity of first-generation inhibitors to EGFR kinase domain, rendering the drugs ineffective. Second-generation EGFR inhibitors have improved in vitro potency against the T790M mutation, but have not provided meaningful benefits in NSCLC patients due to toxicity from also inhibiting wild-type EGFR. 
 
Third-generation EGFR inhibitors are designed to be highly selective against the EGFR T790M mutation while sparing wild-type EGFR, thereby improving tolerability and safety profiles. In November 2015, Tagrisso® (osimertinib), a third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ("TKI") developed by AstraZeneca that specifically targets the EGFR activating and T790M resistance mutations, received accelerated FDA approval for the treatment of patients with metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC who have progressed on or after EGFR TKI therapy. Tagrisso received full approval from the FDA in 2017 based on data from a randomized, Phase 3 trial, in which Tagrisso significantly improved progression-free survival (“PFS”) versus platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, providing 10.1 months of median PFS compared to 4.4 months from chemotherapy. 
 
We are developing CK-101 for the treatment of NSCLC patients carrying the susceptible EGFR mutations. These include the EGFR T790M mutation in second-line NSCLC patients as well as the EGFR L858R and exon 19 deletion mutations in first-line NSCLC patients. We believe that CK-101 has the potential to be effective in these oncological indications as a monotherapy or in combination with other anti-tumor immune response potentiating compounds. Existing preclinical data from other programs support the combination of third-generation EGFR inhibitors with checkpoint inhibitors (PD-1 or PD-L1).

In March 2015, Fortress entered into an exclusive license agreement with NeuPharma, Inc. (“NeuPharma”), which agreement was assigned to us by Fortress on the same date, to develop and commercialize novel covalent third-generation EGFR inhibitors on a worldwide basis outside of certain Asian countries. In August 2016, the FDA accepted our IND application and we initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical study in September 2016. The Phase 1 portion of the study is evaluating the safety and tolerability of ascending doses of CK-101 in patients with advanced solid tumors to determine the maximum tolerated dose and / or recommended dose for the Phase 2 portion of the study. The Phase 2 portion is expected to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CK-101 in patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC.
 
CK-102 (formerly CEP-9722) PARP Inhibitor Program
 
In December 2015, Fortress obtained the exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize CK-102 (formerly CEP-9722) from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., through its subsidiary, Cephalon, Inc., which license was assigned to us by Fortress on the same date. CK-102 is an oral, small molecule selective inhibitor of PARP-1 and PARP-2 enzymes in early clinical development for solid tumors.
 
PARP enzymes are involved in normal cellular homeostasis, such as DNA transcription, cell cycle regulation, and DNA repair. DNA repair enzymes such as PARP, whose activity and expression are up-regulated in tumor cells, are believed to contribute to resistance and dampen the effects of chemotherapy and radiation. By inhibiting PARP, certain cancer cells may be rendered unable to repair single strand DNA breaks, which in turn causes double strand DNA breaks and can lead to cancer cell death. Across multiple tumor types, including breast, ovarian and prostate cancer, PARP inhibitors have shown activity as a monotherapy against tumors with existing DNA repair defects, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, and potential activity as a combination therapy when administered together with anti-cancer agents that induce DNA damage.
 
In November 2010, the licensor of CK-102 submitted an IND application to the FDA for CK-102 for the treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Between 2009 and 2013, the licensor of CK-102 conducted three Phase 1 studies to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of CK-102, as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumor cancers. Details of the studies are as follows: 
 

· | Study 1065, a first-in-human study of CK-102, was an open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalating Phase 1 study to identify the maximum tolerated dose of CK-102 and to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of the combination treatment of CK-102 and temozolomide, administered at 150 mg/m 2 /day, in patients with advanced solid tumors. The study enrolled and dosed 26 patients at two sites in France and the United Kingdom. In the study, the combination of oral CK-102 and oral temozolomide given on days 1 to 5 of 28-day cycles was determined to be adequately tolerated with no indication of potentiation of the known toxicities of temozolomide. One patient with melanoma treated with CK-102 at 1000 mg/day demonstrated a confirmed partial response that lasted up to 5.8 months. The patient did not progress on the study. In addition, four patients treated with CK-102 at 300 to 750 mg/day experienced stable disease for at least two months. A dose of CK-102 of 750 mg/day in combination with the standard dose of temozolomide of 150 mg/m 2 /day was recommended as the regimen for further study.

· | Study 1092 was a dose-escalation, open-label, phase 1 study to identify the maximum tolerated dose of CK-102 and to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of CK-102 in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with advanced solid tumors. In the study, conducted at three sites in France and Belgium, 18 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of CK-102. Gemcitabine was administered at 1250 mg/m 2 intravenously on day 1 and day 8 of each 21-day cycle. Cisplatin was administered at 75 mg/m 2 intravenously on day 1 of each cycle, after the infusion of gemcitabine. The study was stopped before reaching its objective of determining the maximum tolerated dose of CK-102 when given in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine due to the limited tolerability of the cisplatin and gemcitabine regimen and the variable exposure to the active moiety of CK-102 during the study.

· | Study 2051 was a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label study to determine the maximum tolerated dose of CK-102 when administered as a single-agent in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. In the study, conducted at four sites in the United States, 44 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of CK-102. Though twelve patients had stable disease in the study, the variable systemic exposure to the active moiety of CK-102 within each cohort precluded any definitive efficacy conclusions. A dose of 750 mg administered twice daily was determined to be the maximum tolerated dose for CK-102 administered as a single agent.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We plan to develop CK-102 as both a monotherapy and in combination with other anti-cancer agents, including our immuno-oncology and checkpoint inhibitor antibodies currently in development. Due to the variable systemic exposure of the active moiety of CK-102 in the prior Phase 1 studies, we are currently evaluating a reformulation of the CK-102 drug product to improve its bioavailability prior to commencing a Phase 1b clinical study in advanced or metastatic solid tumors with existing DNA repair defects, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2. The commencement of a clinical study for CK-102 is contingent on a successful reformulation of the drug product.

CK-103 BET Inhibitor Program
 
We are developing CK-103, a novel, selective and potent small molecule inhibitor of BET bromodomains. TG-1601 binds to the first and second bromodomains (BD1, BD2) of the BET protein family, BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and BRDT. A bromodomain is an amino acid protein domain that recognizes acetylated-lysine. The binding of the drug prevents interaction between BET proteins and both acetylated histones and transcription factors. Therefore, BET proteins, such as BRD4, are considered potential therapeutic targets in cancer, as they may play a pivotal role in regulating the transcription of key regulators of cancer cell growth and survival, including the c-Myc oncogene. BRD4 is often required for expression of c-Myc. Scientific literature has shown that small molecule inhibition of BET bromodomains may lead to selective killing of tumor cells across a broad range of hematologic malignancies and certain targeted solid tumors. We plan to develop CK-103 for the treatment of various advanced and metastatic solid tumor cancers, including, but not limited to, those associated with elevated c-Myc expression.
 
In May 2016, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Jubilant Biosys Limited (“Jubilant”) to develop and commercialize novel compounds that inhibit BET bromodomains on a worldwide basis. Also in May 2016, we entered into a Sublicense Agreement with TGTX to develop and commercialize CK-103 in the field of hematological malignancies. We retain the right to develop and commercialize CK-103 in solid tumors. In 2017, we substantially completed the required CMC, pharmacology and toxicology activities to support a potential IND application filing in 2018.
 
Anti-CAIX Research Program
 
Our anti-CAIX is a fully human preclinical antibody designed to recognize CAIX expressing cells and kill them via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (“ADCC”) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (“CDC”). Scientific literature indicates that CAIX is a well characterized tumor associated antigen with expression almost exclusively limited to the cells of RCC. More than 85% of RCC cases have been demonstrated to express high levels of CAIX expression. There is very limited expression of this antigen on healthy tissue which we believe will limit reactivity of this antibody against healthy tissues.
 
In 2015, preclinical data were published in the peer-reviewed journal, Molecular Cancer, that demonstrated that our anti-CAIX antibodies could trigger killing of CAIX-positive human RCC cell lines in tissue culture via ADCC and CDC. The killing activity correlated positively with the level of CAIX expression on RCC tumor cell lines. In addition, the study demonstrated that our anti-CAIX antibodies inhibited growth of CAIX-positive tumors in a mouse xenograft model as well as led to the activation of T-cells and NK cells. 
 
We plan to develop an anti-CAIX antibody for the treatment of patients with RCC in combination with an anti-PD-L1 and/or anti-GITR antibody as well as potentially other anti-tumor immune response potentiating compounds and/or targeted therapies.
 
We licensed the exclusive worldwide rights to certain anti-CAIX antibodies from Dana-Farber in March 2015. Currently, we are in preclinical development for this program. We will need to identify and optimize a lead anti-CAIX antibody to select as a clinical candidate, following which we plan to commence CMC development, pharmacology and toxicology activities in order to potentially submit an IND application in the future.
 
COSTS AND TIME TO COMPLETE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
 
The information below provides estimates regarding the costs associated with the completion of the current development phase and our current estimated range of the time that will be necessary to complete that development phase for our product candidates. For a description of the risk factors that could significantly affect our ability to meet these cost and time estimates, see Item 1A of this report.

Completion dates and costs in the above table are estimates due to the uncertainties associated with preclinical testing and clinical trials and the related requirements of development. In the cases where the requirements for preclinical testing and clinical trials and development programs have not been fully defined, or are dependent on the success of other trials, we cannot estimate trial completion or cost with any certainty. The actual spending on each trial during the year is also dependent on funding.
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PATENTS
 
General
 
Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products, formulations, processes, methods and other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broad intellectual property protection for our product candidates, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world.
 
We also depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors (“know-how”). To help protect our proprietary know-how which is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we require all employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements which prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.
 
Patents and other proprietary rights are crucial to the development of our business. We will be able to protect our proprietary technologies from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents, supported by regulatory exclusivity or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. We cannot guarantee the scope of protection of the issued patents, or that such patents will survive a validity or enforceability challenge, or that any of the pending patent applications will issue as patents.
 
Generally, patent applications in the U.S. are maintained in secrecy for a period of 18 months or more. The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Therefore, we cannot predict the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents, the continued patent eligibility of certain subject matter, or their enforceability. To date, there has been no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents. Third parties or competitors may challenge or circumvent our patents or patent applications, if issued. If our competitors prepare and file patent applications in the U.S. that claim technology also claimed by us, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention or inventorship, which could result in substantial cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that before we commercialize any of our products, any related patent may expire or remain in existence for only a short period following commercialization, thus reducing any advantage of the patent. However, the life of a patent covering a product that has been subject to regulatory approval may have the ability to be extended through the patent restoration program, although any such extension could still be minimal and, in any case, is limited to a maximum of five additional years of patent term.
 
If a patent is issued, or has previously been issued, to a third party containing one or more preclusive or conflicting claims, and those claims are ultimately determined to be valid and enforceable, we may be required to obtain a license under such patent or to develop or obtain alternative technology. In the event of litigation involving a third-party claim, an adverse outcome in the litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to such third party, require us to seek a license for the disputed rights from such third party, and/or require us to cease use of the technology. Further, our breach of an existing license or failure to obtain a license to technology required to commercialize our products may seriously harm our business. We also may need to commence litigation to enforce any patents issued to us or to determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights. Litigation would involve substantial costs.
 
In March 2015, we licensed intellectual property related to certain antibodies from Dana-Farber. The intellectual property includes issued patents in a number of countries, including the United States and Europe, as well as pending patent applications in several countries elsewhere. The issued patents and pending patent applications relate generally to compositions and methods of treatment involving antibodies against CAIX, PD-L1 and GITR. Regarding CAIX antibodies, the in-licensed IP portfolio includes two granted US patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 8,466,263 and 9,676,867). The ‘263 patent is directed to isolated human monoclonal antibodies and scFv antibodies that bind to CAIX (G250) protein, and compositions and kits comprising such antibodies. The ‘867 patent is directed to chimeric T cell receptors comprising an intracellular signaling domain, a transmembrane domain, and an extracellular domain comprising a humanized CAIX antibody or fragment thereof. The term of the ‘263 patent runs to July 9, 2029 and the term of the ‘867 patent runs to June 18, 2029. Both patents may be entitled to any patent term restorations that might become available under the provisions of US patent laws, based on regulatory delays associated with obtaining marketing approval. A continuation application remains pending before the US Patent and Trademark Office. The European counterpart is in force in Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Germany, France and the United Kingdom. A Canadian counterpart patent has also been issued. Both the European and Canadian counterpart patents, as well as any pending applications outside the United States, are scheduled to expire no sooner than December 2026. The PD-L1 segment of the portfolio includes a granted US patent (US Patent No. 9,828,434) directed to antibodies that bind to PD-L1. This patent is scheduled to expire October 4, 2033, not including any patent term restorations, which might become available under the provisions of US patent laws, based on regulatory delays associated with obtaining marketing approval. A continuation application remains pending before the US Patent and Trademark Office, and counterpart applications are pending in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Korea, and Mexico. Any patents maturing from these pending applications will expire no sooner than October 2033. The GITR segment of the portfolio includes an International Application No. PCT/US2015/054010, filed in October 2015. Any national stage applications, which are pursued off of this international application (including U.S. Application No. 15/516,272), would expire no earlier than October 2035.

In June 2016, we filed a US provisional application (US 62/356,105) directed to antibodies and functional fragments thereof that bind to human PD-L1, and methods of inhibiting tumor cell proliferation in patients using such antibodies or functional fragments. The provisional application was converted into a PCT application (PCT/US2017/039810), and a US non-provisional application US 15/636,610. Any patents maturing from these pending applications will expire no sooner than June 2037.
 
In March 2015, Fortress in-licensed intellectual property from NeuPharma, assigned to us by Fortress on the same date, which is directed to technology involving small molecules that are inhibitors of EGFR and kinase mutants, including the compound CK-101. EGFR is a receptor tyrosine kinase of the ErbB family and is also known as “Her1” and “ErbB1.” The in-licensed patent estate includes two granted US patents. US Patent No. 9,559,770 is directed to a generic formula of small molecules, as well as a specific claim directed to the compound, CK-101. The granted claims also cover pharmaceutically acceptable salts, pharmaceutical compositions, particular dosage forms and packaged goods. US Patent No. 9,849,139 is directed to methods of inhibiting EGFR or an EGFR mutant in a subject in need thereof, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of the compounds of the ‘770 patent, including the compound, CK-101. The term of both granted patents runs to August 22, 2034, not including any patent term restorations, which might become available under the provisions of US patent laws, based on regulatory delays associated with obtaining marketing approval. A continuation application remains pending before the US Patent and Trademark Office, and counterpart applications exist in selected jurisdictions around the world, including, but not limited to, Canada and Europe. Any patents maturing from these pending applications would be scheduled to expire no sooner than August 2034.
 
In December 2015, Fortress in-licensed intellectual property from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., through its subsidiary, Cephalon, which Fortress assigned to us on the same date. Under the terms of the license agreement, Cephalon granted us exclusive, worldwide rights under Cephalon’s patents and know-how covering small molecule inhibitors of PARP, an enzyme important to a cell’s ability to repair DNA. Cephalon’s patents include five patent families covering certain compounds and pharmaceutical compositions, including claims to the compound, certain salts, and crystalline polymorphs of the pro-drug, CK-102, processes for preparing same, pharmaceutical compositions of same and certain methods of inhibition or prevention associated with certain indications. Cephalon’s patents include three granted United States patents, which are scheduled to expire as early as January 2023 and as late as September 2030. Foreign counterparts included in each patent family exist in numerous jurisdictions around the world having expected expiration dates ranging from May 2021 to June 2027 (November 2027 for certain methods of sensitizing tumors), August 2030 for claims directed to novel polymorphs and November 2035 for certain salts of CK-102.
 
In May 2016, we in-licensed intellectual property from Jubilant. Under the terms of the license agreement, Jubilant granted us exclusive, worldwide rights under Jubilant’s patents and know-how covering small molecule inhibitors of BET, specifically targeting BRD4, a member of the BET family which is often required for the expression of c-Myc. The in-licensed patent estate includes two international (PCT) applications filed in March 2016 (PCT/IN2016/050098) and September 2016 (PCT/IN2016/050300), respectively, claiming the benefit of two earlier-filed Indian provisional applications. Any patents maturing from this patent estate are expected to expire no sooner than March 2036.

These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed in connection with their relationship with us. These agreements may not, however, provide protection for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized disclosure of such information.
 
In addition to patent protection, we may utilize orphan drug regulations or other provisions of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938, as amended, or FDCA, to provide market exclusivity for certain of our product candidates. Orphan drug regulations provide incentives to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to develop and manufacture drugs for the treatment of rare diseases, currently defined as diseases that exist in fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or, diseases that affect more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. but that the sponsor does not realistically anticipate will generate a net profit. Under these provisions, a manufacturer of a designated orphan-drug can seek tax benefits, and the holder of the first FDA approval of a designated orphan product will be granted a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity for such FDA-approved orphan product. In September 2017, we received FDA Orphan Drug Designation for CK-101 for the treatment of EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC.

LICENSING AGREEMENTS AND COLLABORATIONS
 
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Inc.
 
In March 2015, we entered into a license agreement with Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Inc., which license was amended effective on October 5, 2015, April 12, 2016, and October 24, 2016, whereby we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to Dana-Farber’s patents for a portfolio of fully human immuno-oncology targeted antibodies. The field of use license includes all prophylactic, therapeutic or diagnostic uses in humans or animals excluding use in chimeric antigen receptor technology. The Dana-Farber antibodies were generated in the laboratory of Dr. Wayne Marasco, MD, PhD, a Professor in the Department of Cancer Immunology and AIDS at Dana-Farber. Under the terms of the agreement, we paid Dana-Farber an up-front licensing fee of $1.0 million and granted Dana-Farber five percent of our common stock on a fully-diluted basis, equal to 500,000 shares valued at $32,500. The agreement included an anti-dilution clause that maintained Dana-Farber’s ownership at 5% until such time that we raised $10 million in cash in exchange for common shares. Pursuant to this provision, on September 30, 2015, we granted to Dana-Farber an additional 136,830 shares of common stock valued at approximately $0.6 million and the anti-dilution clause thereafter expired. Dana-Farber is eligible to receive payments of up to an aggregate of approximately $21.5 million for each licensed product upon our successful achievement of certain clinical development, regulatory and first commercial sale milestones. In addition, Dana-Farber is eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $60.0 million upon our successful achievement of certain sales milestones based on aggregate net sales, in addition to royalty payments based on a tiered low to mid-single digit percentage of net sales. Following the second anniversary of the effective date of the agreement, Dana-Farber receives an annual license maintenance fee, which is creditable against milestone payments or royalties due Dana-Farber. The license will terminate on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the royalty term in such country with respect to such product expires, at which time this Agreement shall expire in its entirety with respect to such Licensed Product in such country. The royalty term, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, is the later of (i) ten years after first commercial sale of a given product in such country, or (ii) the expiration of the last-to-expire Dana-Farber patent containing a valid claim to the product in such country. To date, we have incurred $1.2 million of upfront licensing and milestone payments under this license agreement.
 
In connection with the license agreement with Dana-Farber, we entered into a Global Collaboration Agreement with TGTX to develop and commercialize the anti-PD-L1 and anti-GITR antibody research programs in the field of hematological malignancies. We retain the right to develop and commercialize these antibodies in solid tumors. Under the terms of the Global Collaboration Agreement, TGTX paid us $500,000, representing an upfront licensing fee, and we are eligible to receive substantive potential milestone payments up to an aggregate of approximately $21.5 million for each product upon TGTX’s successful achievement of certain clinical development, regulatory and first commercial sale milestones. This is comprised of up to approximately $7.0 million upon TGTX’s successful completion of clinical development milestones, and up to approximately $14.5 million upon first commercial sales in specified territories. In addition, we are eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $60.0 million upon TGTX’s successful achievement of certain sales milestones based on aggregate net sales, in addition to royalty payments based on a tiered high single digit percentage of net sales. Following the second anniversary of the effective date of the agreement, we receive an annual license maintenance fee, which is creditable against milestone payments or royalties due to us. The Global Collaboration Agreement will terminate on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis upon the expiration of the last licensed patent right, unless the agreement is earlier terminated.
 
NeuPharma, Inc.
 
In March 2015, Fortress entered into an exclusive license agreement with NeuPharma, which agreement was assigned to us by Fortress on the same date, and amended on February 21, 2017, whereby we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license, other than certain Asian countries, to NeuPharma’s patents to a library of EGFR inhibitors, including CK-101. Under the terms of the agreement, we paid NeuPharma an up-front licensing fee of $1.0 million, and NeuPharma is eligible to receive payments of up to an aggregate of approximately $40.0 million upon our successful achievement of certain clinical development and regulatory milestones in up to three indications, of which $22.5 million are due upon various regulatory approvals to commercialize the products. In addition, NeuPharma is eligible to receive payments of up to an aggregate of $40.0 million upon our successful achievement of certain sales milestones based on aggregate net sales, in addition to royalty payments based on a tiered mid to high-single digit percentage of net sales. The license will terminate on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the royalty term in such country with respect to such product expires, at which time this Agreement shall expire in its entirety with respect to such Licensed Product in such country. Royalty term means, on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis, the period from the first commercial sale of a given licensed product in such country until the later of (a) expiry of the last-to-expire licensor patent containing a valid claim to the compound in such country; or (b) the 10th anniversary of the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. In a country where no licensor patent containing a valid claim with respect to the compound has ever existed nor ever exists, the royalty term means on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, the period from the first commercial sale of such product in such country until the 10th anniversary of such first commercial sale of such product in such country. To date, we have incurred $2.0 million of upfront licensing and milestone payments under the license agreement.

In connection with the license agreement with NeuPharma, in March 2015, Fortress entered into an Option Agreement with TGTX, which was assigned to us on the same date, granting TGTX the right, but not the obligation to enter into a global collaboration to develop and commercialize NeuPharma’s patents to a library of EGFR inhibitors in the field of hematological malignancies. We would retain the right to develop and commercialize the EGFR inhibitors in solid tumors. Under the terms of the Option Agreement, TGTX paid us $25,000, representing consideration for granting the option. If the option is exercised, we are eligible to receive up to an aggregate of approximately $14.5 million upon TGTX’s successful achievement of certain clinical development and regulatory milestones under a collaboration agreement. In addition, we are eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $40.0 million upon TGTX’s successful achievement of certain sales milestones based on aggregate net sales by TGTX, in addition to royalty payments based on a tiered mid to high-single digit percentage of net sales by TGTX. The Option Agreement will expire on December 31, 2018, unless both parties agree to extend the option period.
 
Also in connection with the license agreement with NeuPharma, we entered into a Sponsored Research Agreement with NeuPharma for certain research and development activities. Effective January 11, 2016, TGTX agreed to assume all costs associated with this Sponsored Research Agreement and paid us for all amounts we paid NeuPharma previously. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recognized approximately $0.6 million and $1.0 million, respectively, in revenue related to the Sponsored Research Agreement in the Statements of Operations. There was no related revenue recognized during 2015.
 
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (through its subsidiary, Cephalon, Inc.)
 
In December 2015, Fortress entered into a license agreement with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. through its subsidiary, Cephalon, Inc. (“Cephalon”), which agreement was assigned to us by Fortress on the same date, whereby we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to Cephalon’s patents relating to CEP-8983 and its small molecule prodrug, CEP-9722, a PARP inhibitor, which we now refer to as CK-102. Under the terms of the agreement, we paid Cephalon an up-front licensing fee of $0.5 million, and Cephalon is eligible to receive milestone payments of up to an aggregate of approximately $220.0 million upon our successful achievement of certain clinical development, regulatory approval and product sales milestones, of which approximately $206.5 million are due on or following regulatory approvals to commercialize the product. In addition, Cephalon is eligible to receive royalty payments based on a tiered low double-digit percentage of net sales. The license will terminate on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis upon the later of (i) expiration of the last licensed patent right, (ii) the end of any regulatory exclusivity period, or (iii) a specified number of years after first commercial sale of a product; in each case unless the agreement is earlier terminated. To date, we have incurred $0.5 million of upfront licensing and milestone payments under the license agreement.
Jubilant Biosys Limited
 
In May 2016, we entered into a license agreement with Jubilant, whereby we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to Jubilant’s family of patents covering compounds that inhibit BET proteins such as BRD4, including CK-103. Under the terms of the agreement, we paid Jubilant an up-front licensing fee of $2.0 million, and Jubilant is eligible to receive payments up to an aggregate of approximately $89.0 million upon our successful achievement of certain preclinical, clinical development, and regulatory milestones, of which $59.5 million are due upon various regulatory approvals to commercialize the products. In addition, Jubilant is eligible to receive payments up to an aggregate of $89.0 million upon our successful achievement of certain sales milestones based on aggregate net sales, in addition to royalty payments based on a tiered low to mid-single digit percentage of net sales. The license will terminate on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the royalty term in such country with respect to such product expires, at which time this agreement shall expire in its entirety with respect to such licensed product in such country. The royalty term, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, begins on the first commercial sale of a product in a country and ends on the expiration of the last-to-expire Jubilant patent containing a valid claim to the product in such country. To date, we have incurred $2.4 million of upfront licensing and milestone payments under the license agreement.
 
In connection with the license agreement with Jubilant, we entered into a sublicense agreement with TGTX to develop and commercialize the compounds licensed in the field of hematological malignancies, while we retain the right to develop and commercialize these compounds in the field of solid tumors. Under the terms of the sublicense agreement, TGTX paid us $1.0 million, representing an upfront licensing fee, and we are eligible to receive substantive potential milestone payments up to an aggregate of approximately $87.5 million upon TGTX’s successful achievement of preclinical, clinical development, and regulatory milestones. This is comprised of up to approximately $0.3 million upon TGTX’s successful achievement of one preclinical milestone, up to approximately $25.5 million upon TGTX’s successful completion of three clinical development milestones for two licensed products, and up to approximately $61.7 million upon the achievement of five regulatory approvals and first commercial sales in specified territories for two licensed products. In addition, we are eligible to receive potential milestone payments up to an aggregate of $89.0 million upon TGTX’s successful achievement of three sales milestones based on aggregate net sales by TGTX, for two licensed products, in addition to royalty payments based on a mid-single digit percentage of net sales by TGTX. TGTX also pays us for 50% of IND enabling costs and patent expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recognized approximately $1.0 million and $1.5 million, respectively, in revenue related to the sublicense agreement in the Statements of Operations. There was no related revenue recognized during 2015.
  
COMPETITION
 
Competition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is intense. Our competitors include pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies, as well as universities and public and private research institutions. In addition, companies that are active in different but related fields represent substantial competition for us. Many of our competitors have significantly greater capital resources, larger research and development staffs and facilities and greater experience in drug development, regulation, manufacturing and marketing than we do. These organizations also compete with us to recruit qualified personnel, attract partners for joint ventures or other collaborations, and license technologies that are competitive with ours. To compete successfully in this industry, we must identify novel and unique drugs or methods of treatment and then complete the development of those drugs as treatments.

11
--

 

The drugs that we are attempting to develop will have to compete with existing therapies. In addition, a large number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals that target the same conditions that we are targeting. Other companies have products or product candidates in various stages of pre-clinical or clinical development, or with marketing approvals, to treat conditions for which we are also seeking to discover and develop product candidates. Some of these potential competing drugs are further advanced in development than our product candidates and may be commercialized earlier.
 
In the Immuno-Oncology area, almost every major pharmaceutical company has a PD-1 and/or PD-L1 antibody in clinical development or on the market, including, without limitation, Merck & Co. (approved drug PD-1 with the brand name Keytruda®), Bristol-Myers Squibb (approved PD-1 with the brand name Opdivo®), Roche (approved PD-L1 with the brand name Tecentriq®), AstraZeneca (approved PD-L1 with the brand name Imfinzi®) and Pfizer/Merck KGA (approved PD-L1 with the brand name Bavencio®). We are aware of several anti-GITR antibody development programs in preclinical or early clinical studies, including, without limitation, by Merck & Co. and Leap Therapeutics, Inc., and an anti-CAIX antibody in past clinical studies by Heidelberg Pharma AG.
 
In the targeted anti-cancer agent area, there are several companies with marketing approvals or in late stage development with EGFR and PARP inhibitors that are targeting mutations similar to our programs. There are also a number of early stage programs developing BET inhibitors which could overlap with our upcoming programs.
 
In the EGFR inhibitor space, Tarceva®, Iressa® and Gilotrif® are currently approved drugs for the treatment of first-line EGFR-mutant NSCLC. In November 2015, AstraZeneca’s Tagrisso® (formerly AZD9291) was approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC who have progressed on or after EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. In October 2017, Tagrisso® was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA for the 1st-line treatment of patients with metastatic EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC and has submitted a new drug application for FDA approval in this 1st-line indication. In addition, we are aware of a number of products in development targeting cancer-causing mutant forms of EGFR for the treatment of NSCLC patients, including, Pfizer’s PF-299804 (dacomitinib), Astellas Pharma’s ASP8273, Novartis’ EGF816, Hanmi Pharmaceutical’s HM61713 and HM781-36B (Poziotinib), and Acea Bio (Hangzhou)’s avitinib.
 
In the PARP inhibitor space, in late 2014, AstraZeneca’s Lynparza® (olaparib) was approved in the U.S. as monotherapy in patients with germline BRCA mutated advanced ovarian cancer who have been treated with three or more prior lines of chemotherapy and in the EU for the maintenance treatment of BRCA mutated platinum-sensitive relapsed serous ovarian cancer. In late 2016, Clovis Oncology’s Rubraca® (rucaparib) was approved in the U.S. as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic) associated advanced ovarian cancer who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies. In early 2017, Zejula® (niraparib) was approved in the U.S. as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy. There are a number of other PARP inhibitors in late-stage clinical development, or with a new drug application pending filing or under review by the FDA, including, but not limited to, AbbVie’s ABT-888 (veliparib), Eisai’s E-7016, and Pfizer’s talazoparib.
 
In the BET inhibitor space, there are a number of companies which have advanced to early stage clinical trials, including Merck & Co’s MK-8628, Roche’s TEN-010, Constellation Pharmaceuticals’ CPI-0610, Bristol-Myers Squibb’s BMS-986158, GlaxoSmithKline’s GSK525762, Abbvie’s ABBV-075, Incyte’s INCB54329, Forma Therapeutics’ FT-1101 and Gilead Sciences’ GS-5829.
 
Additional information can be found under Item 1A - Risk Factors - Other Risks Related to Our Business.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had six full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we consider our employee relations to be good.
SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURING
 
We have limited experience in manufacturing products for clinical or commercial purposes. We currently do not have any manufacturing capabilities. We have established, or intend to establish, contract manufacturing relationships for the supplies of our product candidates, in each case with a single manufacturer. As with any supply program, obtaining raw materials of the correct quality cannot be guaranteed and we cannot ensure that we will be successful in this endeavor.
 
At the time of commercial sale, if not prior, and to the extent possible and commercially practicable, we would seek to engage a back-up supplier for each of our product candidates. Until such time, we expect that we will rely on a single contract manufacturer to produce each of our product candidates under current GMP (“cGMP”) regulations. Our third-party manufacturers have a limited number of facilities in which our product candidates can be produced and will have limited experience in manufacturing our product candidates in quantities sufficient for commercialization. Our third-party manufacturers will have other clients and may have other priorities that could affect their ability to perform the work satisfactorily and/or on a timely basis. Both of these occurrences would be beyond our control. 
 

12
--

 

We expect to similarly rely on contract manufacturing relationships for any products that we may in-license or acquire in the future. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully contract with such manufacturers on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
 
Contract manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic and unannounced inspections by the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP and other state and federal regulations. Our contractors, if any, in Europe face similar challenges from the numerous European Union and member state regulatory agencies and authorized bodies. We do not have control over third-party manufacturers’ compliance with these regulations and standards, other than through contractual obligations. If they are deemed out of compliance with cGMPs, product recalls could result, inventory could be destroyed, production could be stopped and supplies could be delayed or otherwise disrupted.
 
If we need to change manufacturers after commercialization, the FDA and corresponding foreign regulatory agencies must approve these new manufacturers in advance, which will involve testing and additional inspections to ensure compliance with FDA regulations and standards and may require significant lead times and delay. Furthermore, switching manufacturers may be difficult because the number of potential manufacturers is limited. It may be difficult or impossible for us to find a replacement manufacturer quickly or on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
 
GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY REGULATIONS
 
Numerous governmental authorities, principally the FDA and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies, impose substantial regulations upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of our product candidates, as well as our ongoing research and development activities. None of our product candidates have been approved for sale in any market in which we have marketing rights. Before marketing in the U.S., any drug that we develop must undergo rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory approval process implemented by the FDA under the FDCA. The FDA regulates, among other things, the pre-clinical and clinical testing, safety, efficacy, approval, manufacturing, record keeping, adverse event reporting, packaging, labeling, storage, advertising, promotion, export, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products.
 
The regulatory review and approval process is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. We are required to submit extensive pre-clinical and clinical data and supporting information to the FDA for each indication or use to establish a product candidate’s safety and efficacy before we can secure FDA approval to market or sell a product in the U.S. The approval process takes many years, requires the expenditure of substantial resources and may involve ongoing requirements for post-marketing studies or surveillance. Before commencing clinical trials in humans, we must submit an IND to the FDA, or comparable filing outside the U.S., containing, among other things, pre-clinical data, chemistry, manufacturing and control information, and an investigative plan. Our submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial.
 
The FDA may permit expedited development, evaluation, and marketing of new therapies intended to treat persons with serious or life-threatening conditions for which there is an unmet medical need under its fast track drug development programs. A sponsor can apply for fast track designation at the time of submission of an IND, or at any time prior to receiving marketing approval of the new drug application (“NDA”). To receive fast track designation, an applicant must demonstrate:
 

· | that the drug is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | that the drug is intended to treat a serious aspect of the condition; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs, and this potential is being evaluated in the planned drug development program.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The FDA must respond to a request for fast track designation within 60 calendar days of receipt of the request. Over the course of drug development, a product in a fast track development program must continue to meet the criteria for fast track designation. Sponsors of products in fast track drug development programs must be in regular contact with the reviewing division of the FDA to ensure that the evidence necessary to support marketing approval will be developed and presented in a format conducive to an efficient review. Sponsors of products in fast track drug development programs ordinarily are eligible for priority review of a completed application in six months or less and also may be permitted to submit portions of an NDA to the FDA for review before the complete application is submitted.
 

13
--

 

Sponsors of drugs designated as fast track also may seek approval under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations. Under this authority, the FDA may grant marketing approval for a new drug product on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely, based on epidemiologic, therapeutic, pathophysiologic, or other evidence, to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. Approval will be subject to the requirement that the applicant study the drug further to verify and describe its clinical benefit where there is uncertainty as to the relation of the surrogate endpoint to clinical benefit or uncertainty as to the relation of the observed clinical benefit to ultimate outcome.  Post-marketing studies are usually underway at the time an applicant files the NDA.  When required to be conducted, such post-marketing studies must also be adequate and well-controlled.  The applicant must carry out any such post-marketing studies with due diligence. Many companies who have been granted the right to utilize an accelerated approval approach have failed to obtain approval. Moreover, negative or inconclusive results from the clinical trials we hope to conduct or adverse medical events could cause us to have to repeat or terminate the clinical trials. Accordingly, we may not be able to complete the clinical trials within an acceptable time frame, if at all, and, therefore, could not submit the NDA to the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for marketing approval.
 
Clinical testing must meet requirements for institutional review board oversight, informed consent and good clinical practices, and must be conducted pursuant to an IND, unless exempted.
 
For purposes of NDA approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases:
 

· | Phase 1: The drug is administered to a small group of humans, either healthy volunteers or patients, to test for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, excretion and clinical pharmacology.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2: Studies are conducted on a larger number of patients to assess the efficacy of the product, to ascertain dose tolerance and the optimal dose range, and to gather additional data relating to safety and potential adverse events.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 3: Studies establish safety and efficacy in an expanded patient population.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 4: The FDA may require Phase 4 post-marketing studies to find out more about the drug’s long-term risks, benefits, and optimal use, or to test the drug in different populations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The length of time necessary to complete clinical trials varies significantly and may be difficult to predict. Clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals. Additional factors that can cause delay or termination of our clinical trials, or that may increase the costs of these trials, include:
 

· | slow patient enrollment due to the nature of the clinical trial plan, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for participation in the study or other factors;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | inadequately trained or insufficient personnel at the study site to assist in overseeing and monitoring clinical trials or delays in approvals from a study site’s review board;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | longer treatment time required to demonstrate efficacy or determine the appropriate product dose;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | insufficient supply of the product candidates;
--+-----------------------------------------------


· | adverse medical events or side effects in treated patients; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


· | ineffectiveness of the product candidates.
--+-------------------------------------------

 
In addition, the FDA, equivalent foreign regulatory authority, or a data safety monitoring committee for a trial may place a clinical trial on hold or terminate it if it concludes that subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, or for futility. Any drug is likely to produce some toxicity or undesirable side effects in animals and in humans when administered at sufficiently high doses and/or for a sufficiently long period of time. Unacceptable toxicity or side effects may occur at any dose level at any time in the course of studies in animals designed to identify unacceptable effects of a product candidate, known as toxicological studies, or clinical trials of product candidates. The appearance of any unacceptable toxicity or side effect could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, limit, delay or abort the development of any of our product candidates and could ultimately prevent approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications.
 
Sponsors of drugs may apply for a special protocol assessment (“SPA”) from the FDA. The SPA process is a procedure by which the FDA provides official evaluation and written guidance on the design and size of proposed protocols that are intended to form the basis for a new drug application. However, final marketing approval depends on the results of efficacy, the adverse event profile and an evaluation of the benefit/risk of treatment demonstrated in the Phase 3 trial. The SPA agreement may only be changed through a written agreement between the sponsor and the FDA, or if the FDA becomes aware of a substantial scientific issue essential to product safety or efficacy.
 
Before receiving FDA approval to market a product, we must demonstrate that the product is safe and effective for its intended use by submitting to the FDA an NDA containing the pre-clinical and clinical data that have been accumulated, together with chemistry and manufacturing and controls specifications and information, and proposed labeling, among other things. The FDA may refuse to accept an NDA for filing if certain content criteria are not met and, even after accepting an NDA, the FDA may often require additional information, including clinical data, before approval of marketing a product.
 

14
--

 

It is also becoming more common for the FDA to request a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, as part of a NDA. The REMS plan contains post-market obligations of the sponsor to train prescribing physicians, monitor off-label drug use, and conduct sufficient Phase 4 follow-up studies and registries to ensure the continued safe use of the drug.
 
As part of the approval process, the FDA must inspect and approve each manufacturing facility. Among the conditions of approval is the requirement that a manufacturer’s quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP. Manufacturers must expend significant time, money and effort to ensure continued compliance, and the FDA conducts periodic inspections to certify compliance. It may be difficult for our manufacturers or us to comply with the applicable cGMP, as interpreted by the FDA, and other FDA regulatory requirements. If we, or our contract manufacturers, fail to comply, then the FDA may not allow us to market products that have been affected by the failure.
 
If the FDA grants approval, the approval will be limited to those conditions and patient populations for which the product is safe and effective, as demonstrated through clinical studies. Further, a product may be marketed only in those dosage forms and for those indications approved in the NDA. Certain changes to an approved NDA, including, with certain exceptions, any significant changes to labeling, require approval of a supplemental application before the drug may be marketed as changed. Any products that we manufacture or distribute pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing monitoring and regulation by the FDA, including compliance with cGMP and the reporting of adverse experiences with the drugs. The nature of marketing claims that the FDA will permit us to make in the labeling and advertising of our products will generally be limited to those specified in FDA approved labeling, and the advertising of our products will be subject to comprehensive monitoring and regulation by the FDA. Drugs whose review was accelerated may carry additional restrictions on marketing activities, including the requirement that all promotional materials are pre-submitted to the FDA. Claims exceeding those contained in approved labeling will constitute a violation of the FDCA. Violations of the FDCA or regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or marketing and sale following approval may result in agency enforcement actions, including withdrawal of approval, recall, seizure of products, warning letters, injunctions, fines and/or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Failure to comply with applicable federal, state and foreign laws and regulations would likely have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, federal, state and foreign laws and regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of new drugs are subject to future changes.
 
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (formerly the Health Care Financing Administration), other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 
In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors, including government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payors are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy, and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available for our products to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development. We are unable to predict the future course of federal or state health care legislation and regulations, including regulations that will be issued to implement provisions of the health care reform legislation enacted in 2010, known as the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act and further changes in the law or regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on our business.
International Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, there are a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of any product candidates. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
