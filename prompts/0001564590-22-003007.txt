 Overview
 We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of small molecule therapies designed to modulate cellular protein levels as a novel treatment approach for cancer and other challenging diseases. Leveraging our extensive expertise in E3 ligases together with our proprietary DNA-encoded libraries, we have built DELigase, an integrated discovery platform to identify and advance novel drug candidates targeting E3 ligases, a broad class of enzymes that can modulate proteins within the cell. Our drug discovery approach is to either harness or inhibit the natural function of E3 ligases within the ubiquitin-proteasome system to selectively decrease or increase cellular protein levels. Our wholly owned pipeline comprises four clinical stage drug candidates including targeted protein degraders of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK), a B-cell signaling protein, and inhibitors of Casitas B-lineage lymphoma proto-oncogene B (CBL-B), an E3 ligase that regulates T-cell activation. Our lead drug candidate from our protein degradation portfolio, NX-2127, is an orally bioavailable BTK degrader for the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies. We are currently enrolling patients in the Phase 1a portion of a Phase 1a/1b dose-escalation and cohort expansion study in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies. Our second drug candidate from our protein degradation portfolio, NX-5948, is also an orally bioavailable BTK degrader for the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies and potentially autoimmune diseases. We anticipate enrolling our first patient in the first half of 2022 in the Phase 1a portion of a Phase 1a/1b dose-escalation and cohort expansion study in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies. Our lead drug candidate from our E3 ligase inhibitor portfolio, NX-1607, is an orally bioavailable CBL-B inhibitor for immuno-oncology indications. We are currently enrolling patients in the Phase 1a portion of a Phase 1a/1b dose-escalation and cohort expansion study in patients with solid tumors and lymphomas. We are also advancing the development of a CBL-B inhibitor, NX-0255, for ex vivo use to enhance adoptive T-cell therapy. We are currently recruiting patients in a Phase 1 clinical trial for our first cell therapy candidate, DeTIL‑0255, in patients with gynecologic cancers including ovarian, endometrial, and cervical cancer. Beyond these clinical candidates, we are advancing additional wholly owned, preclinical programs that may expand our therapeutic areas beyond oncology and autoimmune disease to viral diseases, including COVID-19. Our therapeutic areas may be further expanded through our established strategic collaborations with Sanofi S.A. (Sanofi) and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead).
 In disease settings where currently available treatments are limited by suboptimal efficacy or safety, or where relevant protein targets are not druggable by conventional means, we believe targeted protein modulation represents a novel treatment paradigm with the potential to improve upon or become the standard of care. Recent advances in the field have highlighted the significant therapeutic potential of E3 ligases in promoting targeted protein degradation. In addition, we believe the largely unexplored area of inhibiting E3 ligases directly to increase protein levels represents an equally promising approach. Using our powerful DELigase platform, we have the ability to discover small molecule drug candidates to decrease or increase protein levels by either harnessing or inhibiting the activity of the appropriate E3 ligase, depending on the desired therapeutic effect. We have carefully selected and are progressing over 30 E3 ligases to expand the universe of E3 ligases that can be modulated beyond cereblon and von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), the two predominantly used in the field today. Our DNA-encoded library (DEL) collection consists of billions of small molecule compounds used to identify potential binders to ligases and protein targets as critical starting points in our drug discovery process. The differentiation of our protein modulation platform is in its breadth and versatility, enabling us to alter protein levels either upward or downward for both clinically validated targets, such as BTK, and for targets previously thought to be “undruggable”; that is, proteins that could not be addressed by conventional pharmacological means such as CBL-B.

Our protein degradation portfolio includes two clinical-stage chimeric targeting molecules (CTMs) that catalyze potent and specific degradation of BTK, a well validated target for B-cell malignancies. Our two BTK degrader drug candidates, NX-2127 and NX-5948, are orally available CTMs for the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies including non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In addition, we plan to develop NX-5948 in certain autoimmune indications. In preclinical studies, we have demonstrated the ability of both NX-2127 and NX-5948 to degrade BTK in tumor cell lines harboring either wild type BTK and the C481S mutation in BTK that confers resistance to currently marketed BTK inhibitors. In these models, BTK degradation correlates with anti-tumor activity. In addition to degrading BTK, NX-2127 was also designed to have IMiD activity. Based on our preclinical data, we believe NX-2127 and NX-5948 has the potential to demonstrate improved clinical benefit over current standard-of-care in multiple oncology indications. We are currently enrolling Phase 1 trials for NX-2127 and we anticipate enrolling our first patient in the first half of 2022 for NX-5948 in patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell malignancies. Initial findings from the first six patients treated at the two lowest doses in the Phase 1 trial of NX-2127 confirmed oral bioavailability and BTK degradation in circulating B cells, including a clinical response observed in patient number one, providing the first proof-of-mechanism data for a CTM in hematologic malignancies. 
 Our E3 ligase inhibitor portfolio includes two clinical-stage small molecule inhibitors of CBL-B, which functions as an intracellular checkpoint regulating activation of T cells, B cells and NK cells. In preclinical studies, primary human T cells exposed to our lead oral CBL-B ligase inhibitor drug candidate NX-1607 demonstrated increased T-cell activation in the absence of co-stimulation with CD3 and CD28, a potential advantage in a suppressive tumor microenvironment. In addition, NX-1607 has been shown in preclinical models to increase T‑cell proliferation and result in increased secretion of interleukin-2 (IL-2) a key cytokine involved in immune activation. We believe that oral delivery of CBL-B inhibitors has the potential to drive immune cell activation and stimulation of localized IL-2 secretion, leading to enhanced anti-tumor response. As an intracellular immune checkpoint inhibitor, we believe NX-1607 has potential utility across a wide range of oncology indications. We are currently enrolling patients in the Phase 1a portion of a Phase 1a/1b dose-escalation and cohort expansion study in patients with a variety of solid tumors and lymphoma. We are also developing a second CBL-B ligase inhibitor, NX‑0255, for ex vivo use. We believe incorporating NX-0255 into adoptive cell therapy (ACT) has the potential to enhance T‑cell proliferation and phenotype to improve anti-tumor activity. Our lead cellular therapy drug candidate incorporates NX-0255 into the manufacturing process for the production of therapeutic drug-enhanced tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), which we call drug-enhanced tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (DeTIL). We are currently recruiting patients in a Phase 1 trial of DeTIL-0255 in patients with gynecologic malignancies including ovarian, endometrial, and cervical cancer.
 Beyond our current programs, we are extending our degrader and inhibitor portfolios both on our own and with partners by developing new CTM degraders and ligase inhibitors for a number of targets for which we believe the protein modulation modality can be clinically advantageous over existing therapies. These programs and future programs may have the potential to address diseases with significant unmet need, including autoimmune disease, viral diseases, cancer and neurodegeneration. We have entered into several revenue generating collaborations with large biopharmaceutical companies to leverage our DELigase platform for drug discovery. In December 2019, we entered into a global strategic collaboration with Sanofi, which was subsequently expanded and amended in January 2021, to discover, develop and commercialize a pipeline of innovative targeted protein degradation drugs for patients with challenging diseases in multiple therapeutic areas. In June 2019, we entered into a global strategic collaboration with Gilead to discover, develop and commercialize innovative targeted protein degradation drugs for a wide range of diseases including cancer. Both collaborations allow us to further advance our future pipeline with ten currently identified targets included in these collaborations. In aggregate, we have received $300.5 million in non-dilutive financing from our collaborators to date, and as of November 30, 2021, we are eligible to receive up to $4.8 billion in potential future fees and milestone payments, as well as royalties on future product sales. We retain options for co-development and co-commercialization rights in the United States for up to four drug candidates discovered under these collaborations.

Corporate Strategy
 Our strategy is to leverage our DELigase platform to discover breakthrough therapies to improve upon existing drugs and address targets that are thought to be undruggable with current modalities. The key elements of our strategy are to:

• | Advance our lead programs through clinical development. We have four targeted cancer therapy and immune modulating drug candidates in Phase 1 clinical development that we are advancing in 2022. We expect to identify our Phase 1b expansion dose for NX-2127 and commence enrollment in disease-specific expansion cohorts in mid-2022. We also anticipate providing a clinical update on the patients enrolled in the Phase 1a dose escalation study in the second half of 2022. During 2022, we will be enrolling patients across our other three proprietary programs and anticipate reporting initial findings in mid-2022 for NX-1607 and in the second half of 2022 for NX-5948 and DeTIL-0255, including pharmacokinetic and biomarker data for NX-1607 and NX-5948 and initial clinical response assessments for DeTIL-0255.

 Role of proteins in disease and ubiquitin-proteasome system biology
 Proteins as targets in treating disease
 Each cell type within the body is comprised of proteins that define its biochemistry and biological function. When proteins are expressed and regulated correctly, the health of each individual cell as well as the body as a whole is maintained. However, disease can occur when normal cellular processes are dysregulated as a result of changes in protein structure, function, expression levels, or pathway regulation. Factors such as genetic mutations, infection, exposure to toxins, diet and behavior can lead to dysregulation of cellular processes and, if unchecked, a disease process.

The traditional approach to discovering treatments for disease has involved the development of small molecule drugs that bind to a protein’s surface and modulate its activity. These “druggable” proteins contain distinct structural features that mediate protein function called active sites which can be exploited when identifying and optimizing compounds that disrupt protein activity. However, the vast majority of the body’s proteins do not have distinct active sites that can be targeted using traditional discovery methods. Because dysregulation and disease are not restricted to these “druggable” proteins, a significant number of therapeutically relevant proteins have not been addressed by traditional small molecule drugs. Other modalities including antibody and protein-based therapies, genetic medicines and cell therapies have emerged to address these issues but are still limited by their modes of delivery, scalability and their therapeutic applications.
 Leveraging E3 ligases and the ubiquitin proteasome system as a new treatment modality
 Normal cellular physiology requires highly orchestrated and regulated processes that operate at the level of individual proteins. The ability of proteins to respond to stimuli quickly and in a coordinated fashion requires protein function to be readily controllable. One of the most exquisitely ordered cellular systems governing cellular proteins is the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS).
 

As depicted above, the UPS is responsible for regulating and maintaining normal protein levels in the cell. An important class of enzymes called E3 ligases mediate this process with a high degree of specificity by recognizing individual proteins and catalyzing the attachment of ubiquitin protein tags to their surface. Proteins marked with chains of ubiquitin are then shuttled to the proteasome for degradation and removal from the cell. In addition to protein degradation, E3 ligases also mediate other functions such as protein localization, receptor internalization, protein signaling and protein quality control. There are over 600 E3 ligases encoded within the human genome, representing more than 5% of genes. The prevalence of the E3 ligase class of enzymes reflects the diversity of their physiological roles and biological significance and may allow for the creation of a wide spectrum of ligase-targeted therapeutics.
 Modulating protein levels through small molecule therapeutics targeting E3 ligases
 Advances in our understanding of the UPS suggest broad potential for development of new therapies that modulate E3 ligases in context of diseases such as cancer and autoimmune disorders. An example are the IMiDs, which include the approved cancer drugs Revlimid (lenalidomide) and Pomalyst (pomalidomide). IMiDs exert their therapeutic effects by targeting the E3 ligase cereblon and redirecting its activity toward proteins it would not normally degrade such as Aiolos, a transcription factor regulating immune cell function. Elucidation of this mechanism led to the recognition that pharmacological control of E3 ligase activity could more generally represent a promising new paradigm for small molecule drug action. This idea has since translated into the development of targeted protein degraders, which we believe have significant therapeutic potential. In addition, the largely unexplored area of inhibiting E3 ligases directly to increase cellular protein levels may represent an equally promising approach.

• | Harnessing E3 ligases. Targeted protein degradation harnesses the natural activity of ligases to remove specific proteins from the cell. Targeted protein degradation is accomplished by using bifunctional small molecules, which are composed of an E3 ligase binding element, or harness, linked to a target protein binding element. Unlike traditional small molecule inhibition, targeted protein degradation is catalytic whereby one molecule can induce the degradation of multiple copies of the protein target, enabling the efficient elimination of cellular proteins. In addition, since the effect is mediated through the binding of a small molecule drug rather than through functional inhibition, proteins lacking active sites are potentially targetable, greatly expanding the spectrum of both proteins and diseases amenable to small molecule therapeutic intervention.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Inhibiting E3 ligases. By inhibiting the function of E3 ligases, it is possible to rapidly increase specific proteins levels to control biological pathways. Increasing the levels of distinct sets of proteins could be a powerful approach to blocking pathological processes and restoring normal physiology. While there is enthusiasm in the scientific community around the therapeutic potential of E3 ligase inhibition, the discovery of such inhibitors has been impeded by the limited understanding of this biochemically and structurally complex class of enzymes.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that targeting E3 ligases to modulate protein levels represents a new therapeutic frontier that retains the favorable attributes of small molecule treatment modalities while addressing some major limitations. In addition to the points above, we believe other key differentiating attributes of our treatment modality include:
  
• | Expansive therapeutic potential. The UPS and its associated E3 ligases function across the majority of cell types and organ systems, making it possible to modulate virtually any protein of interest for a wide range of diseases.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Deliverable and Tunable. Oral delivery of small molecule compounds lends itself to broad medical applicability in a range of patient populations with delivery that may be readily calibrated through dosing schedule and quantity.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ease of manufacturing. Development and manufacturing of small molecules utilizes established, cost-efficient processes that are readily scalable.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Approach
 Our approach leverages the specificity of E3 ligases and the natural function of the UPS to regulate the cellular proteome for therapeutic effect. Development of therapies that modulate E3 ligases has been historically limited by the inherent difficulties in building biochemical and cellular assays relevant for measuring E3 ligase function, as well as by the relative lack of mechanistic understanding of this critical class of proteins. Through our focused efforts and investment over the past several years, we have developed proprietary tools, in-depth knowledge and expertise relating to E3 ligases as targets for drug discovery. In addition, we have assembled a team that has extensive experience applying DEL discovery technologies to a wide variety of proteins including targets previously considered undruggable. Together, these capabilities and insights have allowed us to develop a powerful platform technology called DELigase to identify and advance novel drug candidates that either selectively increase or decrease protein levels within the cell.
 Our DELigase platform combines our proprietary DELs and E3 ligase expertise to empower efficient drug discovery. DEL technology is well suited to finding new binders for targets thought to be undruggable, which include the vast majority of proteins encoded in the human genome including E3 ligases.

Our DELigase platform


DEL technology taps enormous chemical space to overcome “druggability” limits
 Our DEL collection comprises several billion compounds whereas typical screening collections contain less than a few million. This increased scale provides the necessary chemical diversity to identify chemical starting points for more challenging protein targets that have been considered undruggable by other approaches. DEL technology evaluates each library compound simultaneously in a single experiment, enabling a more accurate assessment of compound function. In addition, because DEL drug discovery is performed by measuring compound binding rather than biochemical activity it allows inclusion of proteins for which biochemical assays are lacking or not feasible. Further, the relative ease with which binding screens can be performed and interpreted provides sufficient flexibility to allow evaluation of structurally complicated proteins like E3 ligases, which display distinct conformations and activity states and are often part of large multi-protein complexes. Lastly, a chemical linker attaches each DEL compound to a strand of DNA, which functions as a structure barcode allowing screening hits to be easily identified. DEL’s built in chemical linker is also an advantage in the context of identifying bifunctional degraders, as it allows the discovery of compounds that can effectively bind proteins when linked to a partner molecule.
 Our DELigase platform was designed for E3 ligase discovery
 Our integrated DELigase platform relies on proprietary DELs we have specifically engineered to identify and select binders against a diverse group of target protein classes, including some considered to be undruggable, as well as binders to E3 ligases. Key features of our DELigase platform include:
  
• | Custom-synthesized scaffold-based DELs. Our custom-synthesized chemical scaffolds impart desirable, drug-like chemical properties, like solubility, into each library compound in a manner that cannot be achieved when building DEL collections solely from commercial inputs. In addition, these scaffolds are ideally suited for binding to the shallow binding pockets on the surfaces of proteins like E3 ligases.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Covalent small molecule discovery using DELs. Our expertise in aqueous synthetic chemistry and affinity screening technology has allowed us to integrate covalent drug discovery into our DELigase platform through the introduction of covalent DELs. The formation of a covalent bond enables more efficient identification of binders to transient or cryptic binding pockets on a protein’s surface, making covalent DELs an ideal discovery tool for challenging protein targets like E3 ligases. In addition, covalent and reversible covalent compounds have begun to show promise in augmenting performance of targeted protein degraders, suggesting that our covalent DELs may have additional utility.

• | Proprietary data analysis and hit confirmation technologies. We have built a suite of custom analytical tools including machine learning for interpretation and prioritization of our DEL binder outputs, which routinely contain thousands of productive hits. We have also developed high throughput methods for nanoscale hit resynthesis and affinity selection mass spectroscopy that allow a more comprehensive and industrialized process for identifying the best chemical starting points for future pipeline programs.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Many screens, one protein target. E3 ligases can exist in multiple potential conformation states. Our approach uses comprehensive parallel screening campaigns to interrogate numerous states and surfaces of the target protein. An illustration of how we probe the surface of an E3 ligase by DEL screening is depicted in the graphic below.

Our DELigase discovery platform enables us to address multiple therapeutic applications
 We have expanded the universe of E3 ligases available for therapeutic manipulation from the two predominantly used in the field, cereblon and VHL, by screening over 30 additional E3 ligases to date. We have carefully selected these E3 ligases for use in drug discovery across our four core areas of therapeutic expertise: oncology, immuno-oncology, adoptive cell therapy and immune disorders. We consider the unique biological function of each ligase and the therapeutic requirements of the disease state for inhibitor programs. For ligases that direct targeted protein degradation, we take into account the biochemical specificity of the E3 ligase as well as tissue specificity of action and cellular localization of the target protein. E3 ligases that are required for cancer cell survival are also of high interest for cancer indications to reduce the risk of intrinsic resistance to degrader action. We are growing our set of E3 ligases for use in our DELigase platform tailored to our core therapeutic areas.
 DELigase for E3 ligase harnesses
 We apply our platform to utilize the ubiquitination function of E3 ligases for targeted protein degradation. Our DELigase platform enables us to identify binders to E3 ligases, which we refer to as harnesses, as well as binders to degradation targets. We use these molecular starting points to design compounds using a modular approach that connects an E3 ligase harness to a target protein binder with a linker. We refer to these bifunctional molecules as CTMs, which function by bringing the E3 ligase into proximity of the target protein to catalyzing its ubiquitination and degradation. The process of designing CTMs and their activity is shown in the graphic below.

DELigase for E3 ligase inhibitors
 By inhibiting the function of E3 ligases, it is possible to rapidly increase specific protein levels to control biological pathways. Increasing the levels of distinct sets of proteins could be a powerful approach to blocking pathological processes and restoring normal physiology. Our DELigase platform enables the identification of inhibitors through parallel screening of distinct E3 ligase activity states using chemical matter tailored specifically for binding to E3 ligases. Our substantial expertise in E3 ligase biochemistry and biology has allowed us to identify and develop potent inhibitors of E3 ligases that play pivotal roles in T-cell signaling and immune cell function.
 DELs allow access to a spectrum of binders across the protein surface, some of which inhibit protein function.

Drug candidate identification and selection process
 We employ a series of processes and studies from target validation to preclinical development for selection of the appropriate candidate for further development. We have invested in an integrated drug development infrastructure that enables us to perform every step of the drug discovery and early preclinical development process within our research facility. Each of our primary areas of core expertise and technology are highlighted in the below illustration.

Our Drug Candidates
 Our pipeline consists of a protein degradation portfolio of CTM drug candidates that degrade target proteins and our ligase inhibitor portfolio of drug candidates that raise substrate protein levels. These two portfolios demonstrate our ability to both increase and decrease protein levels in cells through the modulation of E3 ligases.

In addition to our CBL-B and BTK portfolios, our wholly owned drug discovery pipeline includes several CTM programs that are at DEL discovery, cell-based screening and lead optimization stages. Our CTM drug discovery programs include targets for autoimmunity, hematology, oncology and antivirals. We believe targeted protein degradation may offer an advantage over existing anti-viral agents, which largely focus on a limited set of viral targets that can be inhibited by small molecules. The fundamentally different pharmaco-kinetic and pharmaco-dynamic action of CTMs, due to the catalytic nature of ligase-mediated degradation, may allow for the rapid removal of viral proteins and successful interruption of the viral life cycle. In addition, we have over 30 ligase programs at various stages of DEL discovery, cell-based screening and lead optimization. 
 Although we believe our drug candidates have the potential to improve upon existing drugs and address targets that are thought to be undruggable with current modalities, we will need to complete additional preclinical studies and clinical trials to determine the safety and efficacy of our drug candidates. The results of these future studies and trials may be different than the results of our earlier studies and trials. We have not received regulatory approval for any of our drug candidates, and in order to obtain regulatory approval and commercialize our drug candidates, the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies will need to determine that our drug candidates are safe and effective.
 Protein degradation portfolio: Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase degraders
 We have developed two CTMs that are potent degraders of the BTK protein, a genetically validated signaling factor that drives B-cell activation and proliferation. Our BTK degraders use the E3 ligase cereblon and may be engineered to include IMiD activity, a well validated mechanism to treat hematologic malignancies. Our lead BTK CTM development candidate, NX-2127, is a dual degrader of both BTK and Aiolos, a protein target of IMiD drugs. In certain B-cell malignancy indications, we believe dual activity may provide therapeutic advantages that could result in improved outcomes. Our second BTK CTM development candidate, NX-5948, degrades BTK without degrading Aiolos. NX-5948 is further differentiated from NX-2127 because it has demonstrated the ability to cross the blood brain barrier in animal models and degrade BTK in both brain-resident tumor cells and normal microglia in the brain. We are currently enrolling Phase 1 trials for NX-2127 and we are anticipate enrolling our first patient in the first half of 2022 for NX-5948 in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies.

BTK’s role in B-cell malignancy
 BTK is a key component of the B-cell receptor signaling pathway and has been clinically validated as a target in the treatment of B-cell malignancies. It is estimated that over 81 thousand people in the United States will be diagnosed with NHLs in 2021. Approximately 85% of NHLs are a result of B-cell malignancies. The natural progression of NHL varies widely and takes multiple forms, ranging from aggressive subtypes such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), to more indolent forms such as follicular lymphoma (FL), which account for approximately 30% and 22% of all NHL cases respectively.
 Background on BTK inhibitors and IMiDs for B-cell malignancies
 BTK inhibitor Imbruvica (ibrutinib) is approved for the treatment of CLL and various forms of NHLs, including mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia (WM), and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL). Calquence, or acalabrutinib, is approved for use in CLL and MCL, and Brukinsa, or zanubrutinib, is approved for use in MCL, WM, and MZL. In 2020, global sales of BTK inhibitors were approximately $7.2 billion. These BTK inhibitors bind covalently to cysteine C481 of the BTK protein and irreversibly inhibit BTK; however, all have some off-target binding to other kinases, which leads to unwanted side effects. In addition, acquired resistance, most commonly through mutations in C481, may limit long term efficacy of these first generation BTK inhibitors. A number of noncovalent BTK inhibitors are currently being investigated in clinical trials as potential therapies for patients with relapsed and refractory disease. We believe targeted protein degradation of BTK may be a superior approach to existing covalent or noncovalent BTK inhibitors that only inhibit enzyme activity, particularly in the relapsed and refractory setting, and in the setting of resistance mutations including at C481.
 IMiDs are analogs of Thalomid, or thalidomide, including Revlimid, or lenalidomide, and Pomalyst, or pomalidomide, which possess several anti-tumor properties, including anti-angiogenic and anti-proliferative effects. IMiDs also have multiple effects on the immune system, including enhancement of T-cell mediated and NK-cell mediated immunity. Revlimid, the market leading IMiD by global sales, was first approved in 2006 for the treatment of multiple myeloma. In May of 2019, Revlimid in combination with Rituxan received a supplemental indication approval for previously treated FL, MZL and MCL, and in August of 2020, Revlimid in combination with Monjuvi received a supplemental indication in DLBCL, thus validating the importance of the IMiD activity in these indications. In 2020, global sales of Revlimid were approximately $12 billion. Subsequent to their approval and successful commercialization, studies demonstrated that IMiDs exert their therapeutic effect by triggering the degradation of specific proteins including Aiolos through the E3 ligase activity of cereblon and hence were identified retrospectively as the first approved drugs to target an E3 ligase.
 Published studies have recently reported early clinical data showing that combining a BTK inhibitor with an IMiD may have the potential to augment clinical activity of certain standard of care agents in some hematologic malignancies such as non-GCB DLBCL. Further, scientific publications have previously described synthetic lethality in a DLBCL cell line treated with both ibrutinib and lenalidomide. By targeting both BTK and IMiD pathways simultaneously, it is believed that the survival mechanisms driven by accumulated mutations within certain cancers can be overcome, thereby preventing escape and disease relapse. This may be especially effective if each pathway has not only different functions but also if they share certain critical components. One possible intersection pathway is the suppression of interferon regulatory factor 4, a member of a family of transcription factors leading to a cell lethal increase in interferon production. The early clinical study cited above was particularly noteworthy since few combinations have previously produced promising results in DLBCL. This may suggest that simultaneous degradation of BTK combined with IMiD activity by a single agent could produce an additive or synergistic effect in certain B-cell malignancies.
 BTK in autoimmune disease and related disorders
 B-cell responses to foreign antigens are mediated through BTK interaction with B-cell receptors, initiating a signaling cascade central in the production of antibodies, proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. BTK is also expressed at high levels in certain myeloid cells, such as macrophages and granulocytes, in which receptor activation by immune complexes promotes BTK mediated expression of proinflammatory cytokines and cell adhesion molecules. Collectively, these actions contribute to the selective elimination of foreign antigens by the immune system. However, the immune system can mistakenly identify self-proteins as foreign antigens leading to autoimmunity, and the role of BTK in promoting the inflammatory process has been implicated in a number of autoimmune disorders.

Preclinical development of BTK degraders
 We have conducted extensive preclinical studies of our two clinical-stage BTK CTMs. We have demonstrated that both NX-2127 and NX-5948 can induce BTK degradation and inhibit tumor growth with oral administration in xenograft mouse models implanted with both wild type and ibrutinib-resistant lymphoma cell lines. We have specifically designed NX-2127 as a dual degrader of BTK and Aiolos, a target protein of IMiDs, and we have designed NX-5948 to degrade BTK with limited or no IMiD activity for potential applications in indications where sparing IMiD activity may be beneficial. We have also demonstrated the ability of both NX-2127 and NX-5948 to degrade BTK in circulating B-cells of non-human primates following once daily oral dosing. 
 We have optimized NX-2127 and NX-5948 to be able to degrade both wild type BTK and the C481S variant of BTK that has been identified as the most common mutation in patients who have become resistant to ibrutinib therapy over time. In the figure below, we show the concentration dependent degradation of both wild-type BTK (top left) and C481S mutant BTK (top right) in a lymphoma cell line (TMD8) for our clinical candidate NX-5948. We have also demonstrated that NX-5948 induces rapid BTK degradation over time in a lymphoma cell line (Ramos) as compared to a control protein, with nearly complete loss of BTK within one hour of administration as shown in the figure below at the bottom.

13



Using a human lymphoma cell line (TMD8), we have demonstrated that both NX-2127 and NX-5948 have an ability to degrade BTK and inhibit growth of tumor cell lines that are resistant to ibrutinib. As shown in the charts below, our BTK CTM NX-5948 can inhibit both wild type and ibrutinib-resistant tumor cell line growth, where approved BTK inhibitors ibrutinib and acalabrutinib lose activity against the C481S mutation.
 
Potent tumor growth inhibition was achieved at varying doses of orally administered NX-2127 in mouse xenograft tumor models with a wild type BTK protein, as shown in the figure below on the top right. In this same model, NX-2127 demonstrated potent degradation of BTK in both circulating B cells (below on the top left) and in lymphoma tumors (below top middle). In this model system 80% BTK degradation in circulating B cells correlated with 74% tumor growth inhibition, and 90% BTK degradation in circulating B cells correlated with 100% tumor growth inhibition. These target levels of inhibition suggest a potential therapeutic range correlating BTK degradation to tumor growth inhibition.

14



In addition to BTK degradation, we have also demonstrated the ability of NX-2127 to degrade Aiolos, a protein target of IMiD drugs in preclinical studies, as shown in the figure below on the left. Studies in human T cells comparing NX-2127 to the IMiD drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide have shown comparable Aiolos degradation and resultant T-cell activation, as shown in the figure below on the right. Based on the clinical data of both ibrutinib and the IMiDs in B-cell malignancies, we believe that this strategy of targeting both BTK and Aiolos in a single oral treatment may improve anti-tumor activity. 

We anticipate that the ability of NX-2127 to degrade both BTK and Aiolos will confer unique anti-tumor activity. One example is in the preclinical mantle cell lymphoma model (REC-1). BTK inhibitors and IMiD drugs have both demonstrated single agent clinical activity in mantle cell lymphoma. In the REC-1 model shown in the figure below, covalent BTK inhibitors such as ibrutinib demonstrate potent but incomplete activity (left). The same is true for non-covalent inhibitors such as pirtobrutinib (below, right). IMiDs, such as pomalidomide, demonstrate a more complete cell killing but at higher drug concentrations (below, left). NX-2127 outperforms all of these drugs in this model, demonstrating both potent activity and complete cell killing.

NX-2127, a development candidate for the treatment of B-cell malignancies
 Despite the increasing number of approved treatments for B-cell malignancies, significant unmet need remains for patients with relapsed, refractory disease. We believe that NX-2127, a novel agent with a dual BTK and Aiolos degradation mechanism of action, could address such patient populations. We have conducted a preclinical program to characterize NX-2127 as our lead development candidate. NX-2127 has demonstrated promising activity in multiple in vitro and in vivo models using human cancer cell lines. Oral administration of NX-2127 demonstrated dose proportional degradation of BTK proteins in mouse models and showed potent anti-tumor activity against C481S ibrutinib-resistant lymphoma in a xenograft mouse tumor model. NX-2127 demonstrated favorable drug-like characteristics in our in vitro and in vivo studies performed through our preclinical development candidate selection process. Taken together, these data suggest that NX-2127 could have a favorable efficacy profile against both wild type and ibrutinib-resistant BTK alleles in CLL as well as in other indications including DLBCL and FL where ibrutinib or IMiDs alone do not provide sufficient clinical benefit. However, the FDA has not yet approved NX-2127 and we will need to complete clinical trials to determine whether it is safe and effective. A Phase 1 clinical trial for NX-2127 in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies is ongoing.
 

Clinical development plans for NX-2127
 We plan to study the pharmacology of NX-2127 in multiple subtypes of relapsed and refractory B‑cell malignancies, including those in which ibrutinib has shown only modest effects or is ineffective, as in the case of CLL patients with the C481 mutation. Furthermore, indications in which IMiD activity could augment responses are of high interest. These indications include DLBCL, MCL, MZL and FL. We anticipate testing NX-2127 in additional B-cell malignancies, such as CLL and WM, where IMiDs are not approved but may have shown modest responses, including in patients who have acquired ibrutinib-resistance or are ibrutinib intolerant. We plan to expedite development in indications where NX-2127 shows evidence of compelling clinical activity and where there is high unmet need.
 As illustrated in the diagram below, we are enrolling patients in the Phase 1a portion of a Phase 1a/1b dose-escalation and cohort expansion study of NX-2127 in patients with relapsed or refractory NHL and CLL. The Phase 1a portion is designed as a monotherapy dose escalation trial to investigate the safety and tolerability of NX‑2127 and to identify a maximum tolerated dose for further evaluation. The Phase 1b portion of the trial is designed as a monotherapy expansion trial in five potential cohorts of up to 20 patients each. The five potential cohorts include CLL patients, CLL patients with the C481 mutation, patients with MCL, MZL or WM, patients with FL and patients with DLBCL. More information on this ongoing trial can be found on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04830137).

NX-5948, a development candidate for the treatment of B-cell malignancies and certain autoimmune indications
 NX-5948 is an orally bioavailable, potent degrader of BTK that is differentiated from NX-2127 in possessing limited or no IMiD activity and in its ability to cross the blood brain barrier in animal models. NX-5948 has demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity in mouse xenograft models of B-cell malignancies including in models of CNS lymphoma. NX-5948 has demonstrated degradation of BTK after oral dosing of NHPs as determined by flow cytometry measuring BTK protein levels in the blood and has demonstrated BTK degradation in the CNS of mice in both intracranial lymphoma cells and in microglia (figure below). NX-5948 has potential utility for certain B-cell malignancies where IMiD activity may be less important in achieving a therapeutic benefit and also in autoimmune diseases, especially those that involve the CNS. 

Clinical development plans for NX-5948
 We plan to study the pharmacology of NX-5948 in multiple subtypes of relapsed and refractory B-cell malignancies, including those in which ibrutinib has shown only modest effects or is ineffective, as in the case of CLL patients with the C481 mutation. Furthermore, we plan to study NX-5948 in autoimmune indications. 
 As illustrated in the diagram below, we anticipate enrolling our first patient in the first half of 2022 in the Phase 1a portion of a Phase 1a/1b dose-escalation and cohort expansion study of NX-5948 in patients with relapsed or refractory NHL and CLL. The Phase 1a portion is designed as a monotherapy dose escalation trial to investigate the safety and tolerability of NX-5948 and to identify a maximum tolerated dose for further evaluation. The Phase 1b portion of the trial is designed as a monotherapy expansion trial in five potential cohorts, including CLL patients, CLL patients with the C481 mutation, patients with MCL or DLBCL, patients with FL, MZL or WM, and patients with primary CNS lymphoma. More information on this ongoing trial can be found on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05131022).

Ligase inhibitor portfolio: CBL-B ligase inhibitors
 Background on CBL-B
 T cells play a key role in cell-mediated adaptive immune response. Activation, expansion and function of antigen-specific T cells is a multistep process and its outcome depends on the balance of positive and negative feedback mechanisms controlling each step. Many factors can hamper the development of an efficient anti-tumor immune response, such as insufficient expression of tumor antigens, defective antigen presentation, inhibitory molecular interactions including those effected by immune checkpoints, immune suppressive factors or suppressor cells and T-cell exhaustion.
 

18



CBL-B, an E3 ligase expressed in immune cell lineages, functions as an intracellular immune checkpoint that negatively regulates T-cell activation and immune response, as illustrated above. CBL-B also limits function and survival of NK cells, B cells, and dendritic cells as well as promotes T-cell exhaustion, anergy, and cell death. As such CBL-B represents a pivotal pathway negatively regulating immunity. CBL-B deficient animal models demonstrate enhanced signal dependent T-cell activation and robust T-cell dependent anti-tumor immunity. We believe that our oral, small molecule CBL-B inhibitors have several potential immunotherapy applications through enhancing T-cell mediated anti-tumor activity by lowering the activation threshold of T cells in a suppressive tumor microenvironment where CBL-B plays a key role in the downregulation of T cells. We are planning to develop our lead oral CBL-B inhibitor, NX-1607, in multiple solid tumors as monotherapy or in combination with other mechanistically complementary therapies. Solid tumors represent approximately 90% of adult human cancers, with estimated new cases in 2021 ranging from approximately 14,500 for cervix uteri cancer to 284,200 for breast cancer. Various immunotherapy strategies have been developed in order to increase the efficiency of anti-tumor immune response, including the use of antibody checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, and anti-CTLA-4, which block the “brakes” of immune response. These immune-stimulating antibodies have a more favorable clinical outcome than traditional treatment modalities on a growing list of tumor types. However, most patients fail to respond or experience only transient responses.
 CBL-B is highly expressed in human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with expression tightly regulated by CD28 and CTLA-4 and other co-stimulatory and inhibitory signals. T cells typically require two signals for activation, the first provided by interaction of the T-cell receptor (TCR), with a peptide presented by an MHC molecule, and the second through co-stimulatory molecules on antigen-presenting cells. CBL-B plays an essential role in the negative regulation of T-cell activation by regulating the activity of the TCR through substrate proteins that require a costimulatory signal to mount a productive immune response upon TCR engagement. Studies have found that CBL-B deficient T cells display lower thresholds for activation by antigen recognition receptors and co-stimulatory molecules such as CD28. For example, loss of CBL-B in T cells results in T cells that can be activated upon TCR engagement without co-stimulation by CD28, although to a lesser extent than with co-stimulation. Importantly, our CBL-B inhibitors do not appear to activate T cells in the absence of TCR engagement. Such CBL-B deficient T cells are resistant to T-cell anergy, a tolerance mechanism in which T cells are functionally inactivated and T-cell proliferation is greatly impaired. Notably, CBL-B deficient T cells show increased rates of proliferation as well as elevated cytokine secretion including IL-2. The increased secretion of IL-2 is of particular importance in the optimization and development of our CBL-B inhibitors, serves as a key cellular biomarker for measuring successful T-cell activation and is a known therapeutic cytokine in oncology.
 Pre-clinical development of CBL-B inhibitors
 We have developed a series of potent small molecule inhibitors of CBL-B activity that have demonstrated biochemical activity and effects in vitro on human immune cells as well as in mouse tumor models. Consistent with studies cited above, CBL-B inhibitors enhanced ex vivo T-cell activation as measured by induction of IL-2, a key cytokine required for immune cell activation and proliferation. Induction of IL-2 secretion occurs at low nanomolar concentrations in primary human and mouse T cells stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibodies or anti-CD3 antibodies alone. As illustrated below, we demonstrated several fold increases in IL-2 production in tandem with increasing biochemical activity of our CBL-B inhibitors. In addition, certain of our CBL-B inhibitors reduced anergy and exhaustion in an ex vivo model of T-cell exhaustion using human donor T cells and further, this effect was additive to that achieved with an anti-PD-1 antibody. Based on our findings to date, we believe that CBL-B inhibitors may induce an immune cell localized IL-2 secretion that in combination with other immune activation effects will enhance anti-tumor responses. The precursor compounds shown in the graphs below led to the optimization and selection of NX-1607 and NX-0255 as development candidates in our CBL-B portfolio.
 19




Development strategy of CBL-B inhibitors
 We are focused on three major immunotherapy applications for our CBL-B inhibitors in oncology. In these applications, our overall strategy is to maximize an anti-tumor effect and clinical benefit of our CBL-B inhibitors by enhancing T cells in vivo or ex vivo. In the first application, NX-1607, an oral small molecule immunotherapy drug candidate, is intended to be used as a single agent or in combination with other mechanistically complementary oncology therapies. The second application is the ex vivo use of NX-0255 to create drug-enhanced ACT products. DeTIL-0255 is a drug-enhanced investigational ACT product that uses NX-0255 ex vivo to enhance TIL propagation and phenotypic characteristics. We have entered into agreements with contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) for the development of DeTIL-0255. The third application is the use of orally dosed NX-1607 in combination with potentially any ACT, such as DeTIL-0255, to promote engraftment and anti-tumor activity of the transplanted cells.
 NX-1607, an oral CBL-B inhibitor for immuno-oncology
 NX-1607 is an investigational, orally bioavailable, potent inhibitor of CBL-B. In vitro, NX-1607 has been demonstrated to increase T-cell activation in primary human T cells in the absence of co-stimulation with CD3 and CD28, a potential advantage in a suppressive tumor microenvironment. In vivo, oral administration of NX-1607 in mice has demonstrated notable tumor growth inhibition in a tumor model as illustrated in the figure below on the left. The tumor growth inhibition with oral administration of NX-1607 recapitulates the genetic experiment in mice with a ligase-inactive version of CBL-B which also shows tumor growth inhibition as illustrated in the figure below on the right.

20



The in vivo effects of orally administered NX-1607 were further evaluated as a single agent in an animal mouse model of triple-negative breast cancer. In this experiment shown in the figure below, tumors were implanted in a mouse and removed 15 days later. Without further treatment, all mice in the vehicle group (black line) died by day 60 as a result of tumor metastases in the lung, liver, and brain. By contrast, animals treated with NX-1607 (red line) administered as a daily oral dose starting at day 7 and continuing through day 46 demonstrated a highly significant prolongation of survival.

The in vivo effects of orally administered NX-1607 were evaluated in combination with an antibody to PD-1 as shown in the figure below. In this model, tumor-bearing mice were treated with NX-1607 (red line), anti-PD-1 (blue line), or the combination (purple line) and compared to animals who received no treatment. Either single agent alone showed only modest inhibition of tumor growth (figure below on the left) and prolongation of survival (figure below on the right). However, the combination of NX-1607 with the anti-PD-1 antibody demonstrated enhanced activity for both tumor growth inhibition and overall survival.

Clinical development of NX-1607
 We plan to study the pharmacology of single-agent NX-1607 in multiple solid tumor indications and in DLBCL with Richter Transformation (DLBCL-RT). The solid tumors selected for this initial assessment include three different immune phenotypes: checkpoint-resistant tumors, tumors with an immunosuppressive microenvironment, and tumors that are poorly immunogenic. We believe that there is a scientific rationale for the role of CBL-B inhibition in each of these immune phenotypes.
 21


As illustrated in the diagram below, we are currently enrolling patients in the Phase 1a portion of a Phase 1a/1b dose-escalation and cohort expansion study of NX-1607 in patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors and DLBCL-RT. The Phase 1a portion is designed as a monotherapy dose escalation trial to investigate the safety and tolerability of NX-1607 and to identify a maximum tolerated dose for further evaluation. The Phase 1b portion of the trial is designed as a monotherapy expansion trial in eight potential cohorts, including melanoma, platinum resistant epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), gastric cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), mixed solid tumors, and DLBCL-RT. More information on this ongoing trial can be found on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05107674).

CBL-B inhibitors for Adoptive Cell Therapies
 Background on Adoptive Cell Therapies
 ACTs represent another class of immunotherapy in which T cells are isolated directly from patient tumors, as with TIL, or from patient blood with subsequent genetic modification to recognize specific antigens present on cancer cells, as with CAR-T therapies. Tumor-reactive T cells are then expanded and infused back into the patient. Currently, the only FDA-approved ACTs are anti-CD19 CAR-T therapies that are approved for treatment of acute B-cell leukemia and acute B-cell lymphoma and anti-BCMA CAR-T therapies that are approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma. CAR-T therapies have not yet proven to be effective in solid tumors. This is due to a number of factors within the tumor microenvironment unique to solid tumors such as the presence of immune checkpoint molecules and suppressive cytokines, and the heterogeneous nature of tumor cells themselves, preventing the identification of uniformly expressed targets for CAR design. Another ACT is TIL therapy. TIL is an expanded collection of lymphocytes that have penetrated the stroma of a tumor and contain host T cells that have recognized a variety of tumor antigens. Ex vivo expanded TIL can be infused into the patient as a therapeutic to amplify the patient’s own immune response to the tumor. Although existing ACT have delivered encouraging results in certain hematologic malignancies and some solid tumors, most patients fail to respond due to three main issues: (i) failure to obtain sufficient quantity and/or quality of T cells from the tumor samples or from the blood for a successful production process, (ii) poor engraftment of T cells upon reinfusion to the patient and (iii) lack of a persistent anti-tumor response or relapse.
 22


CBL-B Inhibitors for Adoptive Cell Therapies
 The opportunities to address the above limitations are substantial, and our results to date support the concept that CBL-B inhibitors may address some or all of the current limitations of ACT. We are advancing several lines of experimentation to refine our understanding of the clinical and commercial opportunities in this area. We have consolidated these efforts under an initiative we call the Nurix Adoptive Cell Therapy program (NxACT) as illustrated in the figure below. Our NxACT initiative includes a drug-enhanced TIL program known as DeTIL, and a drug-enhanced CAR-T therapy known as DeCART. The broader conceptual framework for NxACT is convergence of targeted protein modulation with ACT. In addition to CBL-B, we expect to explore additional targets for protein modulation that may be useful in the NxACT program. We expect to develop NxACT product opportunities through CMOs.
 

Based on our preclinical findings to date, we believe CBL-B inhibition using NX-0255 ex vivo during the isolation and expansion of TIL can address some of the issues that have limited the success of existing ACT. We believe the use of NX-0255 ex vivo can address these limitations by producing not only more T cells, but also T cells with favorable characteristics including greater numbers of CD8+ T cells with an enhanced central memory phenotype, a profile that has been associated with better clinical outcomes. In our preclinical ACT research program, we expanded TIL from human tumor samples ex vivo and measured the effects of drug enhancement by NX-0255 on TIL production. Compared to TIL isolated and expanded in the presence of IL-2, TIL isolated and expanded with NX-0255 and IL-2 (DeTIL-0255) demonstrated greater proliferation, less exhaustion, increased cytotoxicity, and increased central memory T-cell population.
 The DeTIL-0255 investigational product under development is an autologous cell therapy consisting of T cells derived from a patient’s tumor expanded in culture with IL-2 + NX-0255. Although NX-0255 has limited oral bioavailability, we have demonstrated inhibition of CBL-B both biochemically and in ex vivo T-cell culture, making it well suited for the ex vivo creation of new ACT products. DeTIL-0255 is designed to be a single administration autologous TIL therapy infused following non-myeloablative chemotherapy. We believe DeTIL-0255 could allow a broader application of TIL therapy, potentially providing long term benefit to patients with multiple types of cancer.
 23


Preclinical development of DeTIL-0255
 We have tested NX-0255 in a mouse model of ACT shown below to determine if culture of tumor specific T cells ex vivo in the presence of a potent CBL-B inhibitor can confer a superior anti-tumor effect as compared to standard culture conditions using IL-2 alone. We have demonstrated that even a short, 3-day ex vivo exposure of T cells to NX-0255, either alone or in combination with IL-2, conferred a lasting anti-tumor phenotype upon transfer of the cells into a tumor-bearing animal as compared to controls. We have also demonstrated that those cells cultured under standard conditions with IL-2 alone resulted in superior conditional survival of the mice relative to controls, but not as good as either group treated with NX-0255 as shown in the figure below.
 
Clinical development plans for DeTIL-0255
 We are currently recruiting patients with relapsed and refractory gynecologic cancers in a Phase 1 trial of DeTIL-0255 in the United States. We are currently working with CMOs with experience in TIL product development for the development of the DeTIL-0255 process and manufacturing. The trial will include patients with ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, and endometrial cancer. The primary objective of the study will be to evaluate safety and tolerability of DeTIL-0255 autologous cell therapy. Secondary objectives include an exploratory evaluation of efficacy. Other exploratory objectives include characterization of DeTIL-0255 phenotypes utilizing a variety of T-cell markers, identification of potential mechanisms of response or resistance to DeTIL-0255 including repertoire analysis and persistence of the autologous cell therapy in the patient. More information on this ongoing trial can be found on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05107739).
 24


Oral CBL-B inhibitors combined with ex vivo CBL-B inhibition in a mouse model of ACT
 We have further explored ACT by including an oral dosing regimen of NX-1607 in combination with NX‑0255 ex vivo treated T cells. Preliminary results shown below illustrate that the combination with NX‑1607 yields more substantial anti-tumor effect and subsequent conditional survival than with ex vivo NX‑0255 ACT alone. Pending trial results using each therapy alone, we also intend to evaluate the combination of oral NX‑1607 and ex vivo NX-0255 ACT in a future clinical trial. 

Collaborations and License Agreements 
 Sanofi Collaboration and License Agreement

 Gilead Collaboration, Option and License Agreement
 In June 2019, we entered into a global strategic collaboration agreement with Gilead, which was amended in August 2019 (the Gilead Agreement), to discover, develop and commercialize a pipeline of targeted protein degradation drugs for patients with cancer and other challenging diseases using our DELigase platform to identify novel agents that utilize E3 ligases to induce degradation of five specified drug targets. 
 Under the Gilead Agreement, Gilead has the option to license drug candidates directed to up to five targets resulting from the collaboration and is responsible for the clinical development and commercialization of drug candidates resulting from the collaboration. We retain the option to co-develop and co-promote, under a profit share structure, up to two drug candidates in the United States under certain conditions.

 Manufacturing and Supply
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any facilities for product manufacturing, packaging, storage and distribution, or testing. We rely on and expect to continue to rely on CMOs for both drug substance and finished drug product, and ACT product. We have personnel or engaged consultants with extensive technical, manufacturing, analytical and quality experience and good project management to oversee contract manufacturing and testing activities. We have engaged third-party manufacturers to supply the drug substance for NX-2127, NX-5948 and NX-1607 and to develop and manufacture finished drug product for use in our Phase 1 clinical trials. We have also engaged a third-party manufacturer to supply the drug substance for NX-0255 and to develop and manufacture the cell therapy product DeTIL-0255. We currently obtain our supplies from these manufacturers on a purchase order basis and do not have long-term supply arrangements in place. Because TIL and CAR-T therapies are manufactured on a patient-by-patient basis, they involve complex manufacturing and we anticipate that we will have to rely on third-party manufacturers to manufacture our ACT products for pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. Should any of these manufacturers become unavailable to us for any reason, we believe that there are a number of potential replacements, although we may incur some delay in identifying and qualifying such replacements.
 All of our drug candidates are organic compounds of low molecular weight, generally called small molecules, but which are larger than traditional small molecule therapeutics. We have selected these compounds not only on the basis that they could have potentially favorable efficacy and safety profiles, but also for their ease of synthesis and reasonable cost of their starting materials. In particular, our lead drug candidates are manufactured using reliable and reproducible synthetic processes from readily available starting materials. The chemistry is amenable to scale up and does not require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process. We expect to continue to develop drug candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities.
 Competition
 The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property and proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, development experience, scientific knowledge and intellectual property portfolio provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing, and commercialization. Not only must we compete with other companies that are focused on protein modulation, but any drug candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Moreover, our industry is characterized by the existence of large numbers of patents and frequent allegations of patent infringement.
 27


Our platform and product focus is the discovery and development of protein modulation therapies using our chimeric small molecules and ligase inhibitors. Other companies researching chimeric small molecules for protein degradation include Arvinas, Inc., BioTheryX, Inc., C4 Therapeutics, Inc., Cullgen Inc., Foghorn Therapeutics Inc., Kymera Therapeutics, Inc., and Monte Rosa Therapeutics. Further, several large pharmaceutical companies have disclosed preclinical investments in this field, including Amgen Inc., AstraZeneca plc, Bayer AG, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Genentech, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc and Novartis International AG. Furthermore, we are aware of several biotech companies focused on developing tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapies for the treatment of cancer, including Instil Bio, Inc. and Iovance Biotherapeutics, Inc. Moreover, we also compete with current and future therapeutics developed at universities and other research institutions. In addition to competition from other protein modulation therapies, any products that we develop may also face competition from other types of therapies, such as small molecule, antibody, vaccine or gene therapies.
 Our lead drug candidates target hematologic cancers and immune-mediated diseases including immuno-oncology and cell-based therapeutics for cancer. The most common methods of treating patients in oncologic indications are surgery, radiation and drug therapy, including chemotherapy, hormone therapy and targeted drug therapy. A new class of therapies for treatment of oncology patients are ACTs including CAR-T cell therapies and TIL cell therapies. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer, including hematologic cancers. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. Some of the currently approved drug therapies are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Many of these approved drugs are well established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payors. In general, although there has been considerable progress over the past few decades in the treatment of cancer and the currently marketed therapies provide benefits to many patients, these therapies all are limited to some extent in their efficacy and frequency of adverse events, and none of them are successful in treating all patients. As a result, the level of morbidity and mortality from cancer remains high.
 In addition to currently marketed drugs, there are also several drug candidates in late-stage clinical development for the treatment of oncologic indications and immune-mediated diseases. These products in development may provide efficacy, safety, convenience and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies. As a result, they may provide significant competition for any of our drug candidates for which we obtain market approval.
 If any of our drug candidates are approved for the indications for which we currently are conducting clinical trials or for which we expect to conduct clinical trials, they will compete with the foregoing therapies and the currently marketed drugs and potentially any drugs in development. It is also possible that we will face competition from other biologic or pharmaceutical approaches as well as from other types of therapies.
 Many of our current or potential competitors, either alone or with strategic partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. There are generic products currently on the market for certain of the indications that we are pursuing, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If our drug candidates are approved, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products.
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of all our programs, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, level of generic competition and availability of reimbursement.

Intellectual Property
 We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, platforms, drug candidates and improvements thereof that are commercially important to our business, including obtaining, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among, other methods, pursuing patent protection in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, platforms and drug candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. Our patent portfolio, including pending priority applications and Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications, is intended to cover, but is not limited to, our technology platforms, drug candidates and components thereof and their methods of use, and any other inventions that are commercially important to our business. However, the portfolio covering our drug candidates is at an early stage and is currently comprised of only applications and we do not currently own or license any issued patents. 
 We also rely on trade secret protection of our confidential information and know-how relating to our proprietary technology, platforms and drug candidates and continuing innovation to develop, strengthen, and maintain our position in our DELigase platform and drug candidates. Trade secrets are difficult to protect and provide us with only limited protection. Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology, inventions and improvements; to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; to maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned or controlled by third parties; to defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including our patent applications; to defend against challenges and assertions by third parties of their purported intellectual property rights; and to operate without infringement of valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. For risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 We believe that we have a strong global intellectual property position and substantial know how and trade secrets relating to our DELigase platform and drug candidates. We believe that we have a strong global intellectual property position and substantial know how and trade secrets relating to our DELigase platform and drug candidates. As of December 31, 2021, we have 20 U.S. patent applications and 51 foreign applications that we own, and four pending U.S. patent applications and three foreign patent applications that we co-own with Gilead. Should patents issue covering our clinical candidates, the expected expirations are 2039-2041 for patents covering NX-2127 and NX-5948; 2040-2042 for patents covering NX-1607; and 2040 for patents covering DeTIL-0255.
 The term of individual patents depends upon the laws of the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. However, the patent term of United States patents may, in certain cases, be adjusted for administrative delays by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in examining and granting a patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. In addition, the term of a patent may be extended as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. For example, for drugs that are regulated by the FDA under the Hatch-Waxman Act, it is permitted to extend the term of a patent that covers such drug for up to five years beyond the normal expiration date of the patent. For more information on patent term extensions, see “Business—Government Regulation: The Hatch-Waxman Act—Patent term extension.” In the future, if and when our pharmaceutical drug candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents, if issued, covering those drug candidates. We intend to seek patent term extensions to any of our patents, if issued, in any jurisdiction where these are available; however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the USPTO and FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions.
 The actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
 29


We also rely on trade secret protection for our know-how, confidential and proprietary information and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. Although we take steps to protect our confidential and proprietary information as trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors, competitors or other third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements under the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. Despite these efforts, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed, and any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Although we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. To the extent that our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators and advisors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in relation to the resulting know-how or inventions. For more information, please see the sections titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory Approval and Marketing of Our Drug candidates.”
 Government Regulation
 FDA approval process
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The processes for obtaining approval in the United States, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion, advertising and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, tracking and tracing and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending new drug applications (NDAs), withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice (DOJ) or other governmental entities.
 Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as in vitro and animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLPs. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 30


An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved new drug to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer an investigational drug to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any new drug that is not the subject of an approved NDA. In support of a request for an IND, a sponsor must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. The sponsor may be a company seeking to develop the drug or, as in the case of an investigator-initiated trial, the sponsor may be an investigator who is conducting the trial. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND.
 A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. This waiting period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine whether human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30-day period, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice (GCP), which is an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, as a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a specific protocol, or part of a protocol, is not allowed to proceed, while other protocols may do so. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed.
 A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all IND requirements must be met unless waived. When the foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with certain FDA regulatory requirements in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Specifically, the FDA has promulgated regulations governing the acceptance of data from foreign clinical trials not conducted under an IND, establishing that such data from studies will be accepted as support for an IND or application for marketing approval if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee and use of proper procedures for obtaining informed consent from subjects, and the FDA is able to validate the data from the study through an onsite inspection if the FDA deems such inspection necessary. The GCP requirements encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical studies. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical trials, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies. If a marketing application is based solely on foreign clinical data, the FDA requires that the foreign data be applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice; the studies must have been performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence; and the FDA must be able to validate the data through an onsite inspection or other appropriate means, if the FDA deems such an inspection to be necessary.
 31


The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board (IRB) representing each institution participating in the clinical trial. The IRB must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
 Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the study. Suspension or termination of development during any phase of clinical trials can occur if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Other reasons for suspension or termination may be made by us based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
 Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial.
 Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the drug is introduced into healthy human subjects or in certain indications such as cancer, into patients with the target disease or condition. The drug is tested in Phase 1 to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are conducted. In a Phase 3 trial, the drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
 In most cases the FDA requires at least two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances, such as where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible. Post-approval studies, or Phase 4 trials, are often required following initial approval and are intended to gain additional experience and data from treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials conducted under an IND must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse effects occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies often complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 32


After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently set for fiscal year 2022 at $3,117,218 for applications requiring clinical data, and $1,558,609 for applications not requiring clinical data, and the manufacturer and sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual program fees, currently set for fiscal year 2022 at $369,413 for each prescription product. These fees are typically increased annually. Sponsors of applications for drugs granted Orphan Drug Designation are exempt from these user fees.
 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs to encourage timeliness. The FDA intends to review applications for standard review drug products within ten months of the 60-day filing date; and applications for priority review drugs within six months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines treat a serious condition, and if approved, would offer a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
 The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. An advisory committee is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts—for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMPs is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and accompanying information and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA intends to review such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals and elements to assure safe use (ETASU). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 33


If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product; require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling; require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety after approval; require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization; or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
 Approval of medicines in the EU
 In the EU, companies can apply for marketing authorizations under the centralized procedure to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or they can submit their application to the competent authorities in the EEA Member States via the decentralized procedure, the national procedure, or the mutual recognition procedure. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain medicines, such as those produced by biotechnology, orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products and those containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions, viral diseases, or diabetes. The centralized procedure remains optional for medicines containing a new active substance, or which are a significant therapeutic, scientific, or technical innovation or whose authorization would be in the interest of public health. 
 The marketing authorization granted under the centralized procedure by the EMA will be valid in all EEA Member States. The maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application, by the EMA is 210 days but can go be extended should additional information be required by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). The European Commission makes the final decision to grant a marketing authorization, which is issued within 67 days of receipt of the EMA’s recommendation. An accelerated assessment procedure of 150 days may be implemented for dugs considered to be of major public health interest.
 Under the mutual recognition procedure, the national marketing authorization holder may submit an application to other EEA Member States. The Member States involved must decide whether to recognize the approval within 90 days of receiving the application. If a Member State does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding.
 Since the UK has left the EU, Great Britain is no longer covered by centralized marketing authorizations. This is not the case for Northern Ireland as under the Northern Ireland Protocol, centralized marketing authorizations continue to be recognized in Northern Ireland. Medicines with centralized marketing authorizations were automatically converted to Great Britain marketing authorizations on January 1, 2021. For a period of two years from January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the UK medicines regulator, can rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new marketing authorization in the centralized procedure, in order to more quickly grant a new Great Britain marketing authorization. A separate application is, however, still required. The MHRA has launched the Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway (ILAP), a new accelerated assessment procedure for marketing authorization applications that enables companies to enter the UK market faster. 
 Clinical trials regulation in the EU
 In the EU, a Clinical Trial Application (CTA) must be submitted for each clinical trial to each Member State’s national competent authority (NCA) and an independent Ethics Committee. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a particular Member State’s requirements, the clinical trial may proceed. Under the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the drug being trialed occurring during the clinical trial must be reported to the NCA and the Ethics Committee of the Member State where they occurred.
 34


The EU has adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 that will amend the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the EU by simplifying and streamlining the application procedure via a single-entry point with the implementation of strictly defined deadlines for assessment. The new Regulation will come into effect in each Member State on January 31, 2022.
 In the EU, Transparency Regulation No 1049/ 2001, EMA Policy 0043, EMA Policy 0070, as well as the Clinical Trials Regulation No 536/2014 set out the obligation for sponsors to make publicly available certain information stemming from clinical studies. Interested parties based in the EU may submit a request to the EMA to access information included in the marketing authorization application for authorized medicinal products. Commercially confidential information and protected personal data may however not be accessed.
 Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom following Brexit
 The UK officially left the EU on January 31, 2020. A transition period during which EU law remained applicable to the UK began on February 1, 2020 and ended on December 31, 2020. The EU regulatory framework for medicinal products in place before the end of the transition period has been preserved in UK domestic legislation as “retained EU law” but the UK may diverge from EU law in the future should it wish to do so. Pursuant to the Northern Ireland Protocol, the EU pharmaceutical legal framework acquis continues to apply in Northern Ireland and medicines can only be placed in the Northern Ireland market if they comply with EU law. The UK government is however currently trying to renegotiate the Northern Ireland Protocol. 
 Expedited approval pathways
 The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs are referred to as Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation and Priority Review designation. In addition, accelerated approval offers the potential for approval based on a surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint. In May 2014, the FDA published a final Guidance for Industry titled “Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions Drugs and Biologics,” which provides guidance on the FDA programs that are intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drug candidates as well as threshold criteria generally applicable to concluding that a drug candidate is a candidate for these expedited development and review programs.
 The FDA may designate a product for Fast Track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life threatening disease or condition, and nonclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a Fast Track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s review clock for a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 A product may be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing available therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to Breakthrough Therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross disciplinary project lead for the review team; rolling review; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner.

Accelerated approval pathway
 The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a drug for a serious or life threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over available treatments based upon a determination that the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such drug for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality (IMM) and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Drugs granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.
 For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a drug.
 The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of drugs for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit.
 The accelerated approval pathway is contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drug’s clinical benefit. As a result, a drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. In addition, all promotional materials for drugs approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
 The EU and UK operate accelerated evaluation schemes, which may be granted in exceptional cases, often when there is unmet medical need for a life-threatening or serious debilitating condition and existing data show a positive benefit/risk balance that means the medicinal product is of a major public health interest. The CHMP of the EMA or the MHRA (or other national competent authority) will make this determination on a case-by-case basis and subject to meeting eligibility criteria. Accelerated assessment takes place within 150 days.
 Orphan drugs
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant Orphan Drug Designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition—generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan Drug Designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants Orphan Drug Designation, the name of the drug and its potential orphan-designated use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan Drug Designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
 The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular drug to treat a particular disease with FDA Orphan Drug Designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of Orphan Drug Designation are tax credits for certain research and an exemption from the NDA application user fee.
 36


A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is licensed for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be rescinded if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
 In the EU and UK, under Regulation (EC)141/2000 and the UK Human Medicines Regulation 2012 (as amended), respectively, medicinal products may be granted an orphan drug designation if they are used to treat or prevent life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions that affect no more than five in 10,000 people in the EU/ UK and for which there is no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment when the application is made, or when the medicinal product is of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. In addition, orphan drug designation can be granted to drugs used to treat or prevent life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions which, for economic reasons, would be unlikely to be developed without incentives.
 The application for orphan designation must be submitted to and approved by the EMA in respect of the EU or to the MHRA for Great Britain before an application is made for marketing authorization for the product. Medicinal products which benefit from orphan status, which they successfully maintain post-grant of the marketing authorization, can benefit from up to ten years of market exclusivity in respect of the approved indication. This prevents regulatory authorities in the EU or Great Britain, as the case may be, from granting marketing authorizations for similar medicinal products for the same therapeutic indication, unless another applicant can show that the similar medicinal product in question is safer, more effective or clinically superior to the orphan-designated product or if the marketing authorization holder consents to the second orphan medicinal product application, or where the marketing authorization holder cannot supply the needs of the market.
 The ten-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify the maintenance of market exclusivity. Conversely, the 10-year exclusivity period can be further extended by 2 years, when pediatric studies are conducted in accordance with an agreed pediatric investigation plan (PIP) and in completion of all the legal requirements.
 Pediatric studies and exclusivity
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 (FDASIA), sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data.
 Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time.
 The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in FDASIA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation.
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application.
 37


Under the European Pediatric Regulation (Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006), which has also been reflected in and retained by UK law, applicants must submit to the national competent authority or the EMA data from pediatric studies in compliance with an agreed PIP for the validation or acceptance of a marketing authorization application, unless the medicine is exempt because of a deferral or waiver.
 Post-approval requirements
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review, through the applicant’s submission of a supplemental application, and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | Restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, including total or partial suspension of production, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fines, untitled or warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and consistently with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 In addition, the distribution of prescription drug products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA) which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription drug product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
 Many jurisdictions, including the EU and the UK, require each marketing authorization holder, national competent authority and the EMA to operate a pharmacovigilance system to ensure that the safety of all medicines is monitored throughout their use. The overall EU pharmacovigilance system operates through cooperation between the EU Member States, EMA and the European Commission.

Abbreviated New Drug Applications for generic drugs
 In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress established an abbreviated regulatory scheme allowing the FDA to approve generic drugs that are shown to contain the same active ingredients as, and to be bioequivalent to, drugs previously approved by the FDA pursuant to NDAs. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) to the agency. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, bioequivalence, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. ANDAs are “abbreviated” because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, in support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug (RLD).
 Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form and the strength of the drug. An applicant may submit an ANDA suitability petition to request the FDA’s prior permission to submit an abbreviated application for a drug that differs from the RLD in route of administration, dosage form, or strength, or for a drug that has one different active ingredient in a fixed combination drug product (i.e., a drug product with multiple active ingredients). At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if “the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug.” Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is “therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD in its publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book.” Physicians and pharmacists may consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA’s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient.
 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications
 As an alternative path to FDA approval for modifications to formulations or uses of products previously approved by the FDA pursuant to an NDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant, and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness is scientifically and legally appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical studies or clinical trials of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional bridging studies or measurements, including clinical trials, to support the change from the previously approved reference drug. The FDA may then approve the new drug candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the reference drug has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant.
 Hatch-Waxman patent certification and the 30-month stay
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Orange Book.
 39


When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that would be required of an ANDA applicant. Specifically, the applicant must certify that (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carve out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent, known as a Section VIII statement. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 Patent term extension
 After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory process. The allowable patent term extension is typically calculated as one-half the time between the effective date of an IND application and the submission date of a NDA, plus the time between NDA submission date and the NDA approval date up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for extension and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. However, we may not be granted an extension because of, for example, failing to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements.
 Exclusivity under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments
 In addition, under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a particular drug until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity (NCE). For the purposes of this provision, an NCE is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may not be submitted to the FDA until the expiration of five years from the date the NDA is approved, unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval.
 40


The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. Three-year exclusivity would be available for a drug product that contains a previously approved active moiety, provided the statutory requirement for a new clinical investigation is satisfied. Unlike five-year NCE exclusivity, an award of three-year exclusivity does not block the FDA from accepting ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs seeking approval for generic versions of the drug as of the date of approval of the original drug product; it does, however, block the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs during the period of exclusivity. The FDA typically makes decisions about awards of data exclusivity shortly before a product is approved.
 Foreign regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our drug candidates to the extent we choose to sell any products outside of the United States. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. As in the United States, post-approval regulatory requirements, such as those regarding product manufacture, marketing, or distribution would apply to any product that is approved outside the United States.
 We will also be subject to certain ex-U.S. privacy laws in connection with our clinical trial activities outside the United States such as, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR) – non-compliance with which could result in administrative fines of up to the greater of €20.0 million or 4% of global annual revenues. The EU GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the EU GDPR.
 The EU GDPR grants individuals various data protection rights (e.g., the right to erasure of personal data) and imposes stringent data protection requirements on U.S.-based companies, such as ours, which fall within its scope, including inter alia: (i) accountability, data treatment and transparency requirements; and (ii) obligations to report certain personal data breaches to the supervisory authority without undue delay (and no later than 72 hours where feasible). In addition, the EU GDPR prohibits the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the United States and other jurisdictions that the European Commission does not recognize as having “adequate” data protection laws unless a data transfer mechanism has been put in place. In July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union limited how organizations could lawfully transfer personal data from the EEA to the United States by invalidating the EU-US Privacy Shield for purposes of international transfers and imposed further restrictions on use of standard contractual clauses (SCCs) (i.e., EU-style data transfer agreements) including, a requirement for companies to carry out a transfer privacy impact assessment, which among other things, assesses laws governing access to personal data in the recipient country and considers whether supplementary measures that provide privacy protections additional to those provided under SCCs will need to be implemented to ensure an essentially equivalent level of data protection to that afforded in the EEA. Moreover, new versions of the SCCs (new EU SCCs) have recently been published requiring additional compliance and implementation efforts. 
 41


Relatedly, following the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU (Brexit), the EU GDPR has been implemented in the United Kingdom (as the UK GDPR). The UK GDPR site alongside the UK Data Protection Act 2018 which implements certain derogations in the EU GDPR into UK law. The requirements of the UK GDPR are (at this time) largely aligned with those under the EU GDPR and as such, may lead to similar compliance and operational costs with potential fines for non-compliance of up to £17.5 million or 4% of annual worldwide turnover. As a result, we are potentially exposed to two parallel data protection regimes, each of which authorizes fines and the potential for divergent enforcement actions. It should also be noted that the new EU SCCs do not automatically apply in the UK since Brexit, and the UK Government has not yet formally acknowledged the new EU SCCs, i.e., as a valid data transfer mechanism under the UK GDPR. Indeed, on 11 August 2021, the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) launched a public consultation on its draft international data transfer agreement and guidance. This included the publication of a draft UK addendum that can be used with the new EU SCCs – however, this is not (at this time) finalized and as such, for the time being transfers from the UK to a third country should continue to be made in reliance on the ‘old’ SCCs.
 Reimbursement of medicines in Europe
 In the EU, pricing and reimbursement methods can differ in each Member State. Some Member States and the UK may require that health technology assessments (HTA) be completed to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. The outcome of HTA assessments is decided on a national basis and some Member States may decide not to reimburse the use of medicines or may reduce the rate of reimbursement. In December 2021, the EU adopted a new Regulation on Health Technology Assessment which allows Member States to carry out joint clinical assessments and operate joint clinical consultations. It is expected that the new Regulation will come into effect in 2025. In the UK, NICE is the body which conducts HTAs and issues guidance on whether a product is considered to be “cost-effective.”
 Other healthcare laws
 Although we do not currently have any products on the market, in addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, we are also subject to healthcare statutory and regulatory requirements and enforcement by the U.S. federal and state governments. Even though we are not in a position to make patient referrals and do not bill Medicare, Medicaid, or other government or commercial third-party payers, our relationships with healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors will subject us to healthcare statutory and regulatory requirements and enforcement by federal and state governments. These laws include anti-kickback statutes, false claims statutes and other healthcare laws and regulations.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for, referring, or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal health care program. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the ACA) amended the intent element of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute to clarify that a person or entity need not have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation. Among others, this statute applies to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other, including, for example, consulting/speaking arrangements, discount and rebate offers, grants, charitable contributions and patient support offerings. A conviction for violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute can result in criminal fines and/or imprisonment and requires mandatory exclusion from participation in federal health care programs. Exclusion from the federal healthcare programs may also be imposed if the government determines that an entity has committed acts that are prohibited by the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions under the law, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbors are the subject of possible regulatory reforms. Any changes to the safe harbors may impact our future contractual and other arrangements with pharmacy benefit managers, group purchasing organizations, third party payors, wholesalers and distributors, healthcare providers and prescribers, and other entities, as well as our future pricing strategies.
 42


The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false record or statement material to a false claim. The False Claims Act, which covers claims made to programs where the federal government reimburses (directly or indirectly) individuals and entities, such as under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, as well as programs where the federal government is a direct purchaser, such as when it purchases off the Federal Supply Schedule. The law also prohibits avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The government can bring claims directly or through a civil whistleblower or qui tam action, and potential liability includes mandatory treble damages and significant per claim penalties, currently set at $11,665 up to $23,331 per false claim or statement for penalties assessed after June 19, 2020, with respect to violations occurring after November 2, 2015. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Additionally, the ACA amended the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a violation of that statute can serve as a basis for liability under the federal False Claims Act. Most states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. There is also the Federal Criminal False Claims Act, which is similar to the Federal Civil False Claims Act and imposes criminal liability on those that make or present a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government.
 Other federal statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse include the civil monetary penalties statute, which prohibits, among other things, the offer or payment of remuneration to a Medicaid or Medicare beneficiary that the offeror or payor knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order or receive a reimbursable item or service from a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier (although pharmaceutical manufacturers are not considered suppliers for purposes of this law), and contracting with an individual or entity that the person knows or should know is excluded from participation in a federal health care program. In addition, federal criminal statutes created by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises any money or property owned by or under the control of any healthcare benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published on January 25, 2013, impose obligations on certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving the storage, use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, requirements to facilitate certain patient rights, requirements to safeguard the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and requirements to provide notice to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of individually identifiable health information. HITECH increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. On December 10, 2020, the Office of Civil Rights within the Department of Health and Human Services issued proposed revisions to the HIPAA Privacy Rule aimed at reducing regulatory burdens that may exist in discouraging coordination of care and patient access to their health information, among other changes. While a final rule has not yet been issued, if adopted, these proposed changes may require us to update our policies and procedures to comply with the new requirements. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information and other personal information in certain circumstances (such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) and the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (CPRA), and similar new state privacy laws), and these state laws may differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect. These laws are rapidly evolving and may impose additional regulatory compliance burden and legal risks on our operations.

Further, pursuant to the ACA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has promulgated regulations to implement what is commonly known as the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which, among other things, requires manufacturers of prescription drugs, among others, to collect and report information on certain payments or transfers of value they make to U.S.-licensed physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The reports must be submitted on an annual basis, and the reported data is made available in searchable form on a public website. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties. Effective January 1, 2022, reporting on transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners or clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, anesthesiologist assistants, and certified nurse-midwives is also required.
 In addition, several states require prescription drug companies to report certain expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and to report gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners in these states. Other states prohibit various marketing-related activities, such as the provision of certain kinds of gifts or meals. Still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. Some states require the reporting of certain pricing information, including information pertaining to and justifying price increases, or prohibit prescription drug price gouging. In addition, states such as California, Connecticut, Nevada and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes. Several additional states are considering similar proposals. Certain states and local jurisdictions also require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties.
 Efforts to ensure that business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations involve substantial costs. If a drug company’s operations are found to be in violation of any such requirements, it may be subject to significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of its operations, loss of eligibility to obtain approvals from the FDA, exclusion from participation in government contracting, healthcare reimbursement or other federal or state government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, imprisonment and reputational harm. Although effective compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action for an alleged or suspected violation can cause a drug company to incur significant legal expenses and divert management’s attention from the operation of the business, even if such action is successfully defended.
 In the EU and the UK companies must comply with national general anti-bribery legislation as well as medicines legislation which prohibits the supply, offer or promise of certain gifts, and benefits in connection with the promotion of medicinal products to any person qualified to prescribe or supply them. Companies that breach these laws may incur substantial fines and imprisonment. 
 In the EU, payments made to healthcare professionals must be publicly disclosed and agreements with healthcare professionals must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the healthcare professional’s employer. Such requirements are set out in national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the EU Member States and in the UK. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.

U.S. healthcare reform
 In the United States there have been, and continue to be, proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payors to control or manage the costs of health care and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system. The pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which was intended to substantially change the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things, (i) proscribed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs and therapeutic biologics that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, (ii) increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, (iii) established annual nondeductible fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs and therapeutic biologics, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs (iv) established a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer what are now 70% point of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs and therapeutic biologics to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs and therapeutic biologics to be covered under Medicare Part D, (v) expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 138% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability, (vi) expanded the entities eligible for discounts under the 340B Public Health program, (vii) required annual reporting of certain information regarding drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to licensed practitioners, (viii) created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research, and (ix) established a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
 The ACA and certain of its provisions have been subject to judicial challenges as well as legislative and regulatory efforts to repeal or replace them or to alter their interpretation or implementation. From January 2017 through January 2021, the Trump administration issued three executive orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. For example, on January 22, 2018, the Trump administration signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high-cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Concurrently, Congress considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) among other things, included a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment, or penalty, imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” In December 2018, a federal district court in Texas ruled that the ACA’s individual mandate, without the penalty that was repealed effective January 1, 2019, was unconstitutional and could not be severed from the ACA. As a result, the court ruled the remaining provisions of the ACA were also invalid. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court’s ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional, but it remanded the case back to the district court for further analysis of whether the mandate could be severed from the ACA (i.e., whether the entire ACA was therefore also unconstitutional). The Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari on March 2, 2020 and heard oral argument on November 10, 2020. On June 17, 2021, the Supreme Court dismissed the lawsuit without ruling on the merits of the constitutionality arguments.

Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50% to 70% the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” More recently, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The Executive Order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, policies that create barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplaces. On March 11, 2021, Congress enacted the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which included among its provisions a sunset of the ACA’s cap on pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Under the ACA, manufacturers’ rebate liability was capped at 100% of the average manufacturer price for a covered outpatient drug. Effective January 1, 2024, manufacturers’ MDRP rebate liability will no longer be capped, potentially resulting in a manufacturer paying more in MDRP rebates than it receives on the sale of certain covered outpatient drugs. The American Rescue Plan Act also temporarily increased premium tax credit assistance for individuals eligible for subsidies under the ACA for 2021 and 2022 and removed the 400% federal poverty level limit that otherwise applies for purposes of eligibility to receive premium tax credits. In the future, there may be additional challenges and/or amendments to the ACA. It remains to be seen precisely what any new legislation will provide, when or if it will be enacted, and what impact it will have on the availability and cost of healthcare items and services, including drug products.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted to reduce healthcare expenditures. These changes include the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, led to aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year that started in 2013 and, due to subsequent statutory amendments, will remain in effect into 2031 unless additional Congressional action is taken, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) temporarily suspended the 2% cut in Medicare payments from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, and it extended the cut through fiscal year 2030 to offset the cost of such temporary suspension. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 made other changes, including the reduction of Medicare payments to several types of providers and an increase in the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. If federal spending is further reduced, anticipated budgetary shortfalls may also impact the ability of relevant agencies, such as the FDA or the NIH to continue to function at current levels. Amounts allocated to federal grants and contracts may be reduced or eliminated. These reductions may also impact the ability of relevant agencies to timely review and approve research and development, manufacturing, and marketing activities which may delay our ability to develop, market and sell any products we may develop.
 More recently the cost of prescription pharmaceuticals has been the subject of considerable discussion in the United States. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient support programs, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. While several proposed reform measures will require Congress to pass legislation to become effective, Congress and the Biden administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to address prescription drug costs, as discussed in greater detail in the section titled “Risk Factors.” 
 At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize any product that is ultimately approved, if approved.

Additionally, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017 was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA authorization under an FDA expanded access program; however, manufacturers are not obligated to provide investigational new drug products under the current federal right to try law.
 Human Capital
 As of November 30, 2021, we had 242 full-time employees, of which 212 are engaged in research and development. From time to time, we also retain independent contractors to support our organization. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good.
 We consider the intellectual capital of our employees to be an essential driver of our business. Our workforce expanded during fiscal year 2021; new employees were hired to support our clinical and preclinical pipeline, with additions in our research, clinical development, operations and general and administrative functions. We expect to continue to add additional employees in 2022 with a focus on increasing expertise in clinical and preclinical research and development.
 We continually evaluate our business needs and opportunities and strive to balance in house expertise and capacity with outsourced expertise and capacity. Currently, we outsource substantially all clinical trial work to clinical research organizations and drug substance and finished drug product manufacturing to contract manufacturers. 
 Competitive pay and benefits
 Drug development is a complex endeavor which requires deep expertise and experience across a broad array of disciplines. Biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies both large and small compete for a limited number of qualified applicants to fill specialized positions. We monitor our compensation programs closely and provide what we consider to be a very competitive mix of compensation, insurance and wellness benefits for all our employees, as well as participation in our equity and enhanced maternity and paternity programs. To attract qualified applicants, we offer a total rewards package consisting of base salary and cash target bonus, a comprehensive benefits package and equity compensation for all full-time employees. Bonus opportunity and equity compensation increase as a percentage of total compensation based on level of responsibility. Actual bonus payout is based on Company and individual performance.
 Diversity and inclusion
 We are committed to creating and maintaining a workplace free from discrimination or harassment on the basis of color, race, sex, national origin, ethnicity, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identification or expression or any other status protected by applicable law. Our management team and employees are expected to exhibit and promote honest, ethical and respectful conduct in the workplace. All of our employees must adhere to a code of conduct that sets standards for appropriate behavior and are required to attend biennial training to help prevent, identify, report and stop any type of discrimination and harassment. Our recruitment, hiring, development, training, compensation and advancement at our company is based on qualifications, performance, skills and experience without regard to gender, race and ethnicity.
 Employee development and training
 We focus on attracting, retaining and cultivating talented individuals. We emphasize employee development and training by providing access to a wide range of online and instructor led development and continual learning programs. Employees are encouraged to attend scientific, clinical and technological meetings and conferences and have access to broad resources they need to be successful.

Safety
 The safety and health of our employees is a top priority. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented safety protocols including clear policies to address actual and suspected COVID-19 cases and potential exposure, weekly COVID-19 testing, shift work scheduling to reduce the number of people in our facilities at a given time, requirements for the wearing of masks and for social distancing, and increased cleaning procedures. These protocols are designed to comply with health and safety standards as required by federal, state and local government agencies, taking into consideration guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health authorities. In addition, we have provided work-at-home arrangements for employees who are able to do so.
 Board of Directors oversight
 Our Board of Directors recognizes the critical importance of our team and the necessity to ensure a diverse, inclusive, and innovative work environment that is centered around a values-based culture. Our Board meets regularly with management to discuss issues impacting our employees, and to focus on ways to support our workforce. Our focus on culture comes from our board of directors and flows throughout our company. In evaluating our Chief Executive Officer and management team, significant emphasis is place on their contributions to our overall culture.
