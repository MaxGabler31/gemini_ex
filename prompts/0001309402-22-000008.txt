Overview

Green Plains is an Iowa corporation founded in June 2004 as a producer of low carbon fuels and has grown to be one of the leading corn processors in the world. We continue the transition from a commodity-processing business to a value-add agricultural technology company focusing on creating diverse, non-cyclical, higher margin products. In addition, we are currently undergoing a number of project initiatives to improve margins. Through our Total Transformation Plan discussed below to a value-add agricultural technology company, we believe we can further increase margin per gallon by producing additional value-added ingredients, such as Ultra-High Protein, while expanding corn oil yields. 

In December 2020, we completed the purchase of a majority interest in FQT. The acquisition capitalizes on the core strengths of each company to develop and implement proven, value-added agriculture, food and industrial biotechnology systems and rapidly expand installation and production across Green Plains facilities, as well as offer these technologies to the biofuels industry.

 Additionally, we have taken advantage of opportunities to divest certain assets in recent years to reallocate capital toward our current growth initiatives. We are focused on generating stable operating margins through our business segments and risk management strategy. We own and operate assets throughout the ethanol value chain: upstream, with grain handling and storage; through our ethanol production facilities; and downstream, with marketing and distribution services to mitigate commodity price volatility. Our other businesses leverage our supply chain, production platform and expertise.

We formed Green Plains Partners LP, a master limited partnership, to be our primary downstream storage and logistics provider since its assets are the principal method of storing and delivering the ethanol we produce. The partnership completed its initial public offering on July 1, 2015. As of December 31, 2021, we own a 48.9% limited partner interest, a 2.0% general partner interest and all of the partnership’s incentive distribution rights. The public owns the remaining 49.1% limited partner interest. The partnership is consolidated in our financial statements. 

We group our business activities into the following three operating segments to manage performance: 

Ethanol Production. Our ethanol production segment includes the production of ethanol, including industrial-grade alcohol, distillers grains, Ultra-High Protein and corn oil at 11 ethanol plants in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska and Tennessee. At capacity, our facilities are capable of processing approximately 330 million bushels of corn per year and producing approximately 1.0 billion gallons of ethanol, 2.5 million tons of distillers grains and Ultra-High Protein and 290 million pounds of industrial grade corn oil, making us one of the largest ethanol producers in North America.

Agribusiness and Energy Services. Our agribusiness and energy services segment includes grain procurement, with approximately 27.0 million bushels of grain storage capacity, and our commodity marketing business, which markets, sells and distributes ethanol, distillers grains, Ultra-High Protein and corn oil produced at our ethanol plants. We also market ethanol for a third-party producer as well as buy and sell ethanol, including industrial-grade alcohol, distillers grains, Ultra-High Protein, corn oil, grain, natural gas and other commodities in various markets.

Partnership. Our master limited partnership provides fuel storage and transportation services by owning, operating, developing and acquiring ethanol and fuel storage tanks, terminals, transportation assets and other related assets and businesses. The partnership’s assets include 29 ethanol storage facilities, four fuel terminal facilities and approximately 2,300 leased railcars. 

Results for our previously reported food and ingredients segment are now included in the agribusiness and energy services segment. The food and ingredients segment had no activity in either 2021 or 2020 and minimal activity in 2019.

Risk Management and Hedging Activities

Our margins are highly dependent on commodity prices, particularly for ethanol, corn, distillers grains, Ultra-High Protein, corn oil and natural gas. Since market price fluctuations among these commodities are not always correlated, ethanol production has been and may continue to be unprofitable at times. We use a variety of risk management tools and hedging 

 

strategies to monitor real-time operating price risk exposure at each of our operations to obtain favorable margins, when available.

We use forward contracts to sell a portion of our ethanol, distillers grains, Ultra-High Protein and corn oil production or buy some of the corn, natural gas, or ethanol we need to partially offset commodity price volatility. We also engage in other hedging transactions involving exchange-traded futures contracts for corn, natural gas, ethanol, soybean meal, soybean oil and other agricultural commodities. The financial impact of these activities depends on the price of the commodities involved and our ability to physically receive or deliver those commodities.

Hedging arrangements expose us to risk of financial loss when the counterparty defaults on its contract or, in the case of exchange-traded contracts, when the expected differential between the price of the underlying commodity and physical commodity changes. Hedging activities can result in losses when a position is purchased in a declining market or sold in a rising market. Hedging losses may be offset by a decreased cash price for corn and natural gas and an increased cash price for ethanol, distillers grains, Ultra-High Protein and corn oil. Depending on the circumstance, we vary the amount of hedging or other risk mitigation strategies we undertake and sometimes choose not to engage in hedging transactions at all.

Competitive Strengths

We are focused on managing commodity price risks, improving operational efficiencies and optimizing market opportunities to create an efficient platform with diversified income streams. Our competitive strengths include: 

Disciplined Risk Management. Risk management is a core competency and we use a variety of risk management tools and hedging strategies in an effort to maintain a disciplined approach. Our internally developed operating margin management system allows us to monitor commodity price risk exposure at each of our operations and seeks to lock in favorable margins, when available, or if appropriate, temporarily reduce production levels during periods of compressed margins. 

Technology Integration. Over our history, we have incorporated new technologies like corn oil extraction and Selective Milling Technology™ into our manufacturing processes that have enabled us to run more efficiently and improve our financial results. We are currently undergoing a number of project initiatives to improve margins. Through our Project 24 initiative, we have seen reductions in natural gas, electricity and water usage, decreasing our carbon footprint. 

We are executing on our Total Transformation Plan by utilizing FQT’s MSC™ protein technology. As this technology is deployed across our platform, we expand our ability to produce value-added ingredients, such as Ultra-High Protein, while expanding corn oil yields.

The acquisition of a majority interest in FQT secures additional intellectual property rights, including those aimed at developing and implementing proven, value-added agriculture, food and industrial biotechnology systems, such as Clean Sugar Technology™ to produce low carbon dextrose for the biochemical and synthetic biology industry. In addition, we have partnered with Novozymes in an exclusive venture to produce higher purity protein and protein meals with nutritional and other feed benefits through non-mechanical methods. We also have an exclusive partnership with Hayashikane Sangyo of Japan, one of the oldest and most successful integrated aquafeed companies in the world, that broadens our access to innovative feed solutions. We continue to evaluate additional technological opportunities to expand our capabilities and product offerings in the coming years. 

Proven Management Team. Our senior management team averages approximately 28 years of commodity risk management and related industry experience. We have specific expertise across all of our businesses, including plant operations and management, commodity markets and risk management, quality assurance, quality control, ingredient nutrition, marketing and innovation and ethanol marketing and distribution. Our management team’s level of operational and financial expertise is essential to successfully executing our business strategies.

Operational Excellence. Our facilities are staffed with experienced personnel who are encouraged to share operational knowledge and expertise. We continue to focus on making incremental operational improvements to enhance performance using real-time production data and systems to monitor our operations and optimize performance. 

Business Strategy

We believe that the world will continue to increase its demand for protein for human consumption, driving the need to produce larger amounts of high protein feed for animals and aquaculture. With new technologies introduced in the ethanol industry, we believe that ethanol production facilities can increasingly become high-protein feed producers. We began 

 

operations to produce Ultra-High Protein in 2020 and have begun to deploy this technology at additional locations in an effort to capture higher co-product returns. We are striving to deploy the FQT MSC™ Ultra-High Protein process technology across our platform to take advantage of the world’s growing demand for protein feed ingredients. 

As part of our transformation to a value-add agricultural technology company, we completed our first FQT MSC™ Ultra-High Protein installation at our Shenandoah biorefinery during the first quarter of 2020. Our Wood River plant began operations in October 2021. Three additional locations are under construction and expect to be operational by the middle to last half of 2022, and installation at our remaining biorefineries is expected over the course of the next several years. Through our value-added ingredients initiative, we expect to produce more Ultra-High Protein, a feed ingredient with protein concentrations of 50% or greater, further increase production of corn oil and produce other higher value products, such as post-MSC distillers grains. 

We have also upgraded our York facility to include USP grade alcohol capabilities. We began pilot scale batch operations at the CST production facility at our York Innovation Center in the second quarter of 2021, which may allow for the production of both food and industrial grade dextrose to target applications in food production, renewable chemicals and synthetic biology. We anticipate modifying one or more biorefineries to include CST production capabilities to meet anticipated future customer demands. 

We continue to believe ethanol could become an increasingly larger portion of the global fuel supply driven by heightened environmental concerns and energy independence goals, supported by government policies and regulations. In the 1990’s, federal law required the use of oxygenates in reformulated gasoline to reduce vehicle emissions in cities with unhealthy levels of air pollution. Today, ethanol is the primary oxygenate used by the U.S. refining industry to meet various federal and state air emission standards. The high octane value of ethanol has also made it the primary additive used by refiners to increase octane value, which improves engine performance. Accordingly, ethanol has become a valuable blend component that comprises approximately 10% of the domestic gasoline supply with the potential to grow with higher blends and increased gasoline demand. Ethanol usage is further supported by federal government mandates under the RFS, which assigns individual refiners, blenders and importers the volume of renewable fuels they are obligated to use based on their percentage of total fuel sales. Advances in domestic corn yields have helped the U.S. ethanol industry become the lowest-cost producer of ethanol, surpassing Brazil, creating demand for U.S. ethanol worldwide.

In light of the ethanol industry’s competitive environment, we are focused on continued improvement of our low-cost ethanol production platform, reducing costs, and maximizing the value achievable from a kernel of corn by deploying new technology to diversify our product mix. Owning grain storage at or near our ethanol plants allows us to develop relationships with local producers and originate corn more effectively at a lower average cost. We purchase approximately 60% of our corn volume directly from farmers and have approximately 28 production days of storage capacity at or near our ethanol plants. We use our performance data to develop strategies that can be applied across our platform and embrace technological advances to improve operational efficiencies and yields, such as Selective Milling Technology™ and Enogen® corn enzyme technology, to lower our processing cost per gallon and increase production volumes. During 2021, we executed on our Project 24 initiative at our non-ICM plants, except our York and Atkinson plants, to reduce energy consumption and increase operational reliability at these plants.

We believe there is untapped value across our businesses and we intend to further develop and strengthen our business by identifying projects that maximize our production capabilities and lower existing costs at our production facilities. We also seek to leverage our core competencies in adjacent businesses such as aquafeeds, high protein animal feed and other commodity processing operations that maximize our operational and risk management expertise.

In August 2021, we announced a turnkey solution for the installation of FQT’s MSC™ protein technology for third party plants and our inaugural project partner, Tharaldson Ethanol, a 175 million-gallon facility in North Dakota. 

In February and April 2021, as part of our carbon reduction strategy, we have committed our Nebraska, Iowa and Minnesota plants to the Summit Carbon Solutions Midwest Carbon Express project to capture and store carbon dioxide produced through the fermentation process. In total, eight of our biorefineries have entered into long-term carbon offtake agreements, which will lower greenhouse gas emissions through the capturing and storing of carbon dioxide at each of the biorefineries, significantly lowering their carbon intensity. This project is anticipated to be completed in 2024.

Operating Segments

Ethanol Production Segment

Industry Overview. Ethanol, also known as ethyl alcohol or grain alcohol, is a colorless liquid produced by fermenting carbohydrates found in a number of different types of grains, such as corn, wheat and sorghum, and other cellulosic matter found in plants. Most of the ethanol produced in the United States is made from corn, which can be handled efficiently and is in greater supply than other grains. Corn contains large quantities of carbohydrates that convert into glucose more easily than most other kinds of biomass. According to the USDA, on average, a 56 pound bushel of corn produces approximately 2.9 gallons of ethanol, 15 pounds of distillers grains and 0.7 pounds of corn oil. Outside of the United States, sugarcane is the primary feedstock used to produce ethanol.

Ethanol is a significant component of the biofuels industry, which includes all transportation fuels derived from renewable biological materials. Biofuels are an excellent oxygenate and source of octane. When added to petroleum-based transportation fuels, oxygenates reduce vehicle emissions. Ethanol is the most economical oxygenate and source of octane available on the market and its production costs are competitive with gasoline.

Ethanol Plants. We operate 11 dry mill ethanol production plants, located in six states, that produce ethanol, including industrial-grade alcohol, distillers grains, and corn oil.

(1)We constructed these three plants; all other ethanol plants were acquired.
(2)Also produce Ultra-High Protein.

Our business is directly affected by the supply and demand for ethanol and other fuels in the markets served by our assets. Miles driven typically increase during the spring and summer months related to vacation travel, followed closely by the fall season due to holiday travel. 




Industrial-Grade Alcohol. Industrial-grade alcohol is produced by further distillation processing of the 200-proof alcohol. Further distillation removes impurities from fuel-grade ethanol to allow for production of industrial-grade alcohol which can be used as an ingredient for sanitation products. Industrial-grade alcohol is currently produced at our Wood River and York facilities, with our Wood River biorefinery producing food chemical codex (FCC) grade industrial alcohol with a portion of its capacity and our York biorefinery capable of producing USP.

Corn Feedstock and Ethanol Production. Our plants use corn as feedstock in a dry mill ethanol production process. Each of our plants requires approximately 17 million to 42 million bushels of corn annually, depending on its production capacity. The price and availability of corn are subject to significant fluctuations driven by a number of factors that affect commodity prices in general, including crop conditions, weather, governmental programs, freight costs and global demand. Ethanol producers are generally unable to pass increased corn costs to customers.

Our corn supply is obtained primarily from local markets. We use cash and forward purchase contracts with grain producers and elevators to buy corn. We maintain direct relationships with local farmers, grain elevators and cooperatives, which serve as our primary sources of grain feedstock, at 9 of our ethanol plants. This allows us to purchase much of the corn we need directly from farmers throughout the year. At two of our ethanol plants, we contract with a third-party grain originator to supply the corn necessary for ethanol production. These contracts terminate in November 2023. Each of our plants is also situated on rail lines or has other logistical solutions to access corn supplies from other regions of the country should local supplies become insufficient.

Corn is received at the plant by truck or rail then weighed and unloaded into a receiving building. Grain storage facilities are used to inventory grain that is passed through a scalper to remove rocks and debris prior to processing. The corn is then transported to a hammer mill where it is ground into flour and conveyed into a slurry tank for enzymatic processing. Water, heat and enzymes are added to convert the complex starch molecules into simpler carbohydrates. The slurry is heated to reduce the potential of microbial contamination and pumped into a liquefaction tank where additional enzymes are added. Next, the grain slurry is pumped into fermenters, where yeast, enzymes, and nutrients are added and the fermentation process is started. A beer column, within the distillation system, separates the alcohol from the spent grain mash. The alcohol is dehydrated to 200-proof alcohol and either pumped into a holding tank and blended with approximately 2% denaturant as it is pumped into finished product storage tanks, or marketed as industrial or undenatured ethanol.

Distillers Grains. The spent grain mash is pumped from the beer column into a decanter-type centrifuge for dewatering. The water, or thin stillage, is pumped from the centrifuge into an evaporator, where it is concentrated into a thick syrup. The solids, or wet cake, that exit the centrifuge are conveyed to the dryer system and dried at varying temperatures to produce distillers grains. Syrup is reapplied to the wet cake prior to drying to provide additional nutrients. Distillers grains, the principal co-product of the ethanol production process, are used as mid-protein, high-energy animal feed and marketed to the dairy, beef, swine and poultry industries. 

We can produce three forms of distillers grains, depending on the number of times the solids are passed through the dryer system:
wet distillers grains, which contain approximately 65% to 70% moisture, have a shelf life of approximately three days and is therefore sold to dairies or feedlots within the immediate vicinity;
modified wet distillers grains, which is dried further to approximately 50% to 55% moisture, have a shelf life of approximately three weeks and are marketed to regional dairies and feedlots; and
dried distillers grains, which have been dried more extensively to approximately 10% to 12% moisture, have an almost indefinite shelf life and may be stored, sold and shipped to any market.

Corn Oil. Corn oil systems extract non-edible corn oil from the thin stillage evaporation process immediately before the production of distillers grains. Corn oil is produced by processing the syrup through a decanter-style, or disk-stack, centrifuge. The centrifuges separate the relatively light corn oil from the heavier components of the syrup. We extract approximately 0.8 pounds of corn oil per bushel of corn used to produce ethanol. For our locations that have deployed FQT’s MSC™ technology, we have achieved corn oil yields in excess of 1.2 pounds of corn oil per bushel and anticipate similar yields as we deploy FQT’s MSC™ Ultra-High Protein process technology across our platform. Industrial uses for corn oil include feedstock for renewable diesel, biodiesel and livestock feed additives. The syrup is blended into wet, modified wet or dried distillers grains.

Ultra-High Protein. Ultra-High Protein is fermented corn protein produced by further processing of the spent grain mash from the beer column. The spent grain is processed by the FQT MSCTM system, which contains a series of screening equipment to remove fiber from the spent grain which is sent to the distillers grain dryer. The remaining product is washed 

 

and clarified into a wet protein stream which is dried in a ring dryer to produce Ultra-High Protein meal. The product typically has protein concentration of 50% or greater and yields of approximately 3.5 pounds per bushel have been achieved.

Natural Gas. Depending on production parameters, our ethanol plants use approximately 20,000 to 45,000 BTUs of natural gas per gallon of production. We have service agreements to acquire the natural gas we need and transport the gas through pipelines to our plants.

Electricity. Our plants require between 0.5 and 1.1 kilowatt hours of electricity per gallon of production. Local utilities supply the necessary electricity to all of our ethanol plants. 

Water. While some of our plants satisfy a majority of their water requirements from wells located on their respective properties, each plant also obtains drinkable water from local municipal water sources. Each facility either uses city water or operates a filtration system to purify the well water that is used for its operations. Local municipalities supply all of the necessary water for our plants that do not have onsite wells. Most of the water used in an ethanol plant is recycled in the production process.

Agribusiness and Energy Services Segment

Our agribusiness and energy services segment includes grain storage at our ethanol plants of approximately 25.8 million bushels, and one grain elevator with grain storage capacity of approximately 1.2 million bushels, detailed in the following table:

Facility Location | On-Site Grain Storage Capacity ‎(thousands of bushels)
Grain Elevators | 
Archer, Nebraska | 1,246 
Ethanol Plants | 
Atkinson, Nebraska | 5,109 
Central City, Nebraska | 1,400

Shenandoah, Iowa | 886 
Superior, Iowa | 2,230 
Wood River, Nebraska | 3,293 
York, Nebraska | 347 
Total | 26,967 


We buy bulk grain, primarily corn and soybeans, from area producers, and provide grain drying and storage services to those producers. The grain is used as feedstock for our ethanol plants or sold to grain processing companies and area livestock producers. Bulk grain commodities are traded on commodity exchanges. Inventory values are affected by changes in these markets and spreads. To mitigate risks related to market fluctuations from purchase and sale commitments of grain, as well as grain held in inventory, we enter into exchange-traded futures and options contracts that function as economic and designated accounting hedges at times.

Seasonality is present within our agribusiness operations. The fall harvest period typically results in higher handling margins and stronger financial results during the fourth quarter of each year.

Through Green Plains Trade, we market the ethanol we and a third party produce to local, regional, national and international customers. We also purchase ethanol from independent producers for pricing arbitrage. We sell to various markets under sales agreements with integrated energy companies; retailers, traders and resellers in the United States and buyers for export to Brazil, Canada, India, Europe and other international markets. Under these agreements, ethanol is priced under both fixed and indexed pricing arrangements. 

Also through Green Plains Trade, we market distillers grains to local, national and international markets. The bulk of our demand is delivered to geographic regions that do not have significant local corn or distillers grains production. We sell to international markets indirectly through exporters. Access to diversified markets allows us to sell product to customers offering the highest net price.

 



Our corn oil is sold primarily to renewable diesel and biodiesel plants and, to a lesser extent, feedlot and poultry markets. We transport our corn oil by truck to locations in a close proximity to our ethanol plants primarily in the southeastern and midwestern regions of the United States. We also transport corn oil by rail and barges to national markets as well as to exporters for shipment on vessels to international markets.

Through Green Plains Trade, we provide marketing services of natural gas to our ethanol plants and to other third parties including the procurement of both the pipeline capacity and natural gas. We also enhance the value by aggregating volumes at various storage facilities which can be sold to either the plants or various intermediary markets and end markets.

Our railcar fleet for the agribusiness and energy services segment consists of approximately 450 leased hopper cars to transport distillers grains, 70 leased hopper cars to transport corn and approximately 100 leased tank cars to transport corn oil. The initial terms of the lease contracts are for periods up to eight years and the weighted average remaining lease terms on these cars was approximately 3 years as of December 31, 2021.

Partnership Segment

Our partnership segment provides fuel storage and transportation services through (i) 29 ethanol storage facilities located at or near our 11 operational ethanol production plants and one near the prior Hopewell, VA non-operational ethanol production plant, (ii) four fuel terminal facilities located near major rail lines, and (iii) a leased railcar fleet and other transportation assets. 

Transportation and Delivery. Most of our ethanol plants are situated near major highways or rail lines to ensure efficient movement. We are able to move product from our ethanol plants to bulk terminals via truck, railcar or barge. We also manage the logistics and transportation requirements of our customers to improve our fleet’s efficiency and reduce operating costs. 

Deliveries within 150 miles of our plants and the partnership’s fuel terminal facilities are generally transported by truck. Deliveries to distant markets are shipped using major U.S. rail carriers that can switch cars to other major railroads, allowing our plants to ship product throughout the United States.

To meet the challenge of marketing ethanol and distillers grains to diverse market segments, several of our plants are capable of simultaneously handling more than 150 railcars. Some of our locations have large loop tracks with unit train loading capabilities for both ethanol and dried distillers grains and spurs to connect the loop to the mainline or allow the movement and storage of railcars on site. 

As of December 31, 2021, the partnership’s leased railcar fleet consisted of approximately 2,300 railcars with an aggregate capacity of 69.0 mmg. We expect the partnership’s railcar volumetric capacity to fluctuate over the normal course of business as the existing railcar leases expire and we enter into or acquire new railcar leases.

To optimize the partnership’s railcar assets, we transport products other than ethanol depending on market opportunities and have used a portion of our railcar fleet to transport crude oil for third parties and to lease railcars to other users.

Terminal and Distribution Services. Ethanol is transported from the partnership’s terminals to third-party terminal racks where it is blended with gasoline and transferred to the loading rack for delivery by truck to retail gas stations. The partnership owns and operates fuel holding tanks and terminals, and provides terminal services and logistics solutions to markets that do not have efficient access to renewable fuels. The partnership owns and operates fuel terminals at four locations in four states with combined storage capacity of approximately 6.9 mmg and throughput capacity of approximately 564 mmgy. We also have 29 ethanol storage facilities located at or near our 11 operational ethanol production plants and one non-operational ethanol production plant with a combined storage capacity of approximately 25.8 mmg to support current ethanol production capacity of approximately 1.0 bgy.

Our Competition 

Domestic Ethanol Competitors

We are one of the largest consolidated owners of ethanol plants in the United States. We compete with other domestic ethanol producers in a highly fragmented industry. Our competitors also include plants owned by farmers, cooperatives, oil refiners and retail fuel operators. These competitors may continue to operate their plants even when market conditions are not favorable due to the benefits realized from their other operations.

As of December 31, 2021, the top four producers accounted for approximately 41% of the domestic production capacity with production capacities ranging from 958 mmgy to 2,867 mmgy. Demand for corn from ethanol plants and other corn consumers exists in all areas and regions in which we operate. According to the Renewable Fuels Association, there were 120 operational plants in the states where we have production facilities, including Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Tennessee, as of December 31, 2021. The largest concentration of operational plants is located in Iowa, Nebraska and Illinois, where 50% of all operational production capacity is located.

Foreign Ethanol Competitors

We also compete globally with production from other countries. Brazil is the second largest ethanol producer in the world after the United States. Brazil primarily produces ethanol made from sugarcane, which may be less expensive to produce than ethanol made from corn depending on feedstock prices. Under the RFS, certain parties are obligated to meet an advanced biofuel standard. In recent years, sugarcane ethanol imported from Brazil has been one of the most economical means for obligated parties to meet this standard. Any significant additional ethanol production capacity could create excess supply in world markets, resulting in lower ethanol prices throughout the world, including the United States. 
Other Competition

Alternative fuels, gasoline oxygenates and ethanol production methods are continually under development. Ethanol production technologies also continue to evolve. We expect changes to occur primarily in the area of cellulosic ethanol, which is made from biomass such as switch grass or fast-growing poplar trees. Since all of our plants are designed as single-feedstock facilities, adapting our plants for a different feedstock or process system would require additional capital investments and retooling which could be cost prohibitive.

Regulatory Matters 

Government Ethanol Programs and Policies

We are sensitive to government programs and policies that affect the supply and demand for ethanol and other fuels, which in turn may impact the volume of ethanol and other fuels we handle. Over the years, various bills and amendments have been proposed in the House and Senate, which would eliminate the RFS entirely, eliminate the corn based ethanol portion of the mandate, and make it more difficult to sell fuel blends with higher levels of ethanol. We believe it is unlikely that any of these bills will become law in the current Congress. In addition, the manner in which the EPA administers the RFS and related regulations can have a significant impact on the actual amount of ethanol blended into the domestic fuel supply. 

Federal mandates and state-level clean fuel programs supporting the use of renewable fuels are a significant driver of ethanol demand in the U.S. Ethanol policies are influenced by concerns for the environment, diversifying the fuel supply, and reducing the country’s dependence on foreign oil. Consumer acceptance of FFVs and higher ethanol blends in non-FFVs may be necessary before ethanol can achieve further growth in U.S. market share. In addition, expansion of clean fuel programs in other states, or a national low carbon fuel standard could increase the demand for ethanol, depending on how it is structured.

The RFS sets a floor for biofuels use in the United States. When the RFS was established in 2010, the required volume of “conventional”, or corn-based, ethanol to be blended with gasoline was to increase each year until it reached 15.0 billion gallons in 2015, which left the EPA to address existing limitations in both supply and demand. As of this filing, the EPA has proposed reducing the conventional ethanol RVOs for 2020 and 2021 to reflect lower fuel demand during the pandemic, and proposed the statutory 15 billion gallons for 2022.

According to the RFS, if mandatory renewable fuel volumes are reduced by at least 20% for two consecutive years, the EPA is required to modify, or reset, statutory volumes through 2022 – the year through which the statutorily prescribed volumes run. While conventional ethanol maintained 15 billion gallons, 2019 was the second consecutive year that the total RVO was more than 20% below the statutory volumes levels. Thus, the EPA was expected to initiate a reset rulemaking, and modify statutory volumes through 2022, and do so based on the same factors they are to use in setting the RVOs post 2022. These factors include environmental impact, domestic energy security, expected production, infrastructure impact, consumer costs, job creation, price of agricultural commodities, food prices, and rural economic development. However, in late 2019, the EPA announced it would not be moving forward with a reset rulemaking in 2020. It is unclear when or if the current EPA will propose a reset rulemaking, though they have stated an intention to propose a post 2022 set rulemaking as required by law.

Under the RFS, RINs and SREs are important tools impacting supply and demand. The EPA assigns individual refiners, blenders, and importers the volume of renewable fuels they are obligated to use in each annual RVO based on their percentage of total domestic transportation fuel sales. Obligated parties use RINs to show compliance with the RFS mandated volumes. Ethanol producers assign RINs to renewable fuels and the RINs are detached when the renewable fuel is blended with transportation fuel domestically. Market participants can trade the detached RINs in the open market. The market price of detached RINs can affect the price of ethanol in certain markets and can influence purchasing decisions by obligated parties. As it relates to SREs, a small refinery is defined as one that processes fewer than 75,000 barrels of petroleum per day. Small refineries can petition the EPA for a SRE which, if approved, waives their portion of the annual RVO requirements. The EPA, through consultation with the DOE and the USDA, can grant them a full or partial waiver, or deny it outright within 90 days of submittal. The EPA granted significantly more of these waivers for 2016, 2017 and 2018 than they had in the past, totaling 790 mmg of waived requirements for the 2016 compliance year, 1.82 billion gallons for 2017 and 1.43 billion gallons for 2018. In doing so, the EPA effectively reduced the RFS mandated volumes for those compliance years by those amounts respectively, and as a result, RIN values declined significantly. In the waning days of the Trump administration, the EPA approved three additional SREs, reversing one denial from 2018 and granting two from 2019. A total of 88 SREs were granted under the Trump Administration, totaling 4.3 billion gallons of potential blending demand erased. The EPA, under the current administration, reversed the three SREs issued in the final weeks of the previous administration, and in the RVO rulemaking they proposed denying all pending SREs. There are multiple legal challenges to how the EPA has handled SREs and RFS rulemakings.

The One-Pound Waiver that was extended in May 2019 to allow E15 to be sold year-round to all vehicles model year 2001 and newer was challenged in an action filed in Federal District Court for the D.C. Circuit. On July 2, 2021, the Circuit Court vacated the EPA’s rule so the future of summertime, defined as June 1 to September 15, sales of E15 to non-FFVs is uncertain. The Supreme Court declined to hear a challenge to this ruling. As of this filing E15 is sold year-round in approximately 30 states.




In October 2019, the White House directed the USDA and EPA to move forward with rulemaking to expand access to higher blends of biofuels. This includes funding for infrastructure, labeling changes and allowing E15 to be sold through E10 infrastructure. The USDA rolled out the Higher Blend Infrastructure Incentive Program in the summer of 2020, providing competitive grants to fuel terminals and retailers for installing equipment for dispensing higher blends of ethanol and biodiesel. In December 2021, the USDA announced it would administer another infrastructure grant program. Congress is considering legislation that would provide for an additional $1 billion in USDA grants for biofuel infrastructure from 2022 to 2031. 

To respond to the COVID-19 health crisis and attempt to offset the subsequent economic damage, Congress passed multiple relief measures, most notably the CARES Act in March 2020, which created and funded multiple programs that have impacted our industry. The USDA was given additional resources for the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) and they are using those funds to provide direct payments to farmers, including corn farmers from whom we purchase most of our feedstock for ethanol production. Similar to the trade aid payments made by the USDA over the past two years, this cash injection for farmers could cause them to delay marketing decisions and increase the price we have to pay to purchase corn. The CARES Act also allowed for certain net operating loss carrybacks, which has allowed us to receive certain tax refunds. In December 2020, Congress passed and then President Trump signed into law an annual spending package coupled with another COVID relief bill which included additional funds for the Secretary of Agriculture to distribute to those impacted by the pandemic. The language of the bill specifically includes biofuels producers as eligible for some of this aid, and in March of 2021, the USDA indicated that biofuels would be able to apply for a portion of these funds in a forthcoming rulemaking. On June 15, 2021, the USDA indicated that $700 million would be made available to biofuels producers, and in December 2021, they released details for the program, specifying that domestic biofuel producers must apply for market losses due to COVID by February 11, 2022, with payments announced by March 12, 2022. It is not possible to predict the amount we would receive, if any, from this program.

The CARES Act provided a tax exclusion on the shipment of undenatured ethanol for use in manufacturing hand sanitizer, a key ingredient of which is undenatured ethanol of specific grades. The FDA announced that it is ending, effective December 31, 2021, the expanded guidance, which allowed for more denaturants to be used in ethanol intended for hand sanitizer production, and expanded the grades of ethanol for the duration of the public health crisis.

Environmental and Other Regulation

Our ethanol production, agribusiness and energy services, and partnership segment activities are subject to various and extensive environmental and other regulations. We obtain and maintain various environmental permits to operate our plants and other facilities. Ethanol production involves the emission of various airborne pollutants, including particulate, carbon dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, hazardous air pollutants and volatile organic compounds. In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court classified carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act in a case seeking to require the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide in vehicle emissions, which the EPA later addressed in the RFS. While some of our plants operate as grandfathered at their current authorized capacity under the RFS mandate, expansion above these capacities at grandfathered plants will require a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from a 2005 baseline measurement. 

In addition, various states and countries are adopting regulatory schemes similar to what California has adopted. Specifically, CARB adopted LCFS requiring a 10% reduction in average carbon intensity of gasoline and diesel transportation fuels in California from 2010 to 2020.

We employ maintenance and operations personnel at each of our plants. In addition to the attention we place on the health and safety of our employees, the operations of our facilities are regulated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
