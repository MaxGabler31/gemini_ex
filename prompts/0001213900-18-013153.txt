Overview
 
Sino-Global Shipping America, Ltd. (“Sino,” the “Company,” or “we”), a Virginia corporation, was founded in the United States (the “U.S.”) in 2001. Sino is a non-asset based global shipping and freight logistics integrated solution provider. Sino provides tailored solutions and value-added services to its customers to drive effectiveness and control in related aspects throughout the entire shipping and freight logistics chain. We operate in four segments including (1) inland transportation management services which are operated by its subsidiaries in the PRC, Hong Kong and the U.S. (2) freight logistics services which are operated by its subsidiaries in the PRC and the U.S. (3) container trucking services which are operated by its subsidiaries in the PRC and through a joint venture in the U.S. from January to December 2017 and (4) bulk cargo container services which are currently operated by its subsidiary in the U.S. We also operated in shipping agency business prior to fiscal year 2017 and have re-positioned ourselves to further operate in this segment in fiscal year 2019.
 
We conduct our business primarily through our wholly-owned subsidiaries in the U.S. (New York and Los Angeles), the People’s Republic of China including Hong Kong (the “PRC” or “China”), Australia and Canada. Currently, a significant portion of our business is generated from the clients located in the PRC.
 
Company Structure 
 
The Company conducts its business primarily through its wholly-owned subsidiaries in the U.S. (New York and Los Angeles), China (including Hong Kong), Australia, and Canada. The corporate structure diagram as of the date of this report is as below:
 

Our subsidiary in China, Trans Pacific Shipping Limited (“Trans Pacific Beijing”), a wholly owned foreign enterprise, invested in one 90%-owned subsidiary, Trans Pacific Logistics Shanghai Limited (“Trans Pacific Shanghai”. Trans Pacific Beijing and Trans Pacific Shanghai are referred to collectively as “Trans Pacific”). As PRC laws and regulations restrict foreign ownership of local shipping agency service businesses, we provided our shipping agency services in the PRC through Sino-Global Shipping Agency Ltd. (“Sino-China” or “VIE”), a Chinese legal entity, which holds the licenses and permits necessary to operate local shipping agency services in the PRC. Trans Pacific Beijing and Sino-China do not have a parent-subsidiary relationship. Trans Pacific Beijing has contractual arrangements with Sino-China and its shareholders that enable us to substantially control Sino-China. Through Sino-China, we were able to provide local shipping agency services in all commercial ports in the PRC. Sino-China is one of the committee members of China Association of Shipping Agencies & Non-Vessel-Operating Common Carriers (“CASA”). CASA was approved to form by China Ministry of Communications. Sino-China is also our only entity that is qualified to do shipping agency business in China. We keep the VIE to prepare ourselves for the market to turn around.

Corporate History and Our Business Segments
 
Since inception in 2001 and through our fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, our sole business was providing shipping agency services. In general, we provided two types of shipping agency services: loading/discharging services and protective agency services, in which we acted as a general agent to provide value added solutions to our customers. For loading/discharging agency services, we received the total payment from our customers in U.S. dollars and paid the port charges on behalf of our customers in RMB. For protective agency services, we charged a fixed amount as agent fee while customers are responsible for the payment of port costs and expenses. Under these circumstances, we generally required a portion of a customer’s payment in advance and billed the remaining balance within 30 days after the transaction were completed. We believe the most significant factors that directly or indirectly affected our shipping agency service revenues were:

● | the number of ship-times to which we provide port loading/discharging services;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the size and types of ships we serve; 
● | the type of services we provide; 
● | the rate of service fees we charge; 
● | the number of ports at which we provide services; and 
● | the number of customers we serve. 

 
In June 2013, we entered into global logistics service agreement with TEWOO Chemical & Light Industry Zhiyuan Trade Co., Ltd, which is controlled by Tianjin Zhiyuan Investment Group Co., Ltd (“Zhiyuan”). Zhiyuan is controlled by Mr. Zhong Zhang. who is our largest shareholder. Leveraging our business relationship with Zhiyuan, we expanded our service offerings to include shipping and chartering services and inland transportation management services to diversify our business. Leveraging our in-depth knowledge of the shipping industry, inland transportation management services are our tailored value-added solution developed for Zhiyuan to prevent high-priced bulk from damages or losses during its inland transportation from warehouses to factories. Given the industry norm of 12% of loss rate during transportation, our integrated inland transportation solution significantly reduces bulk losses and effectively addresses issues in the freight logistics chain. Furthermore, after we have conducted an effective trial for Zhiyuan to reduce their bulk losses at the end of September 2014, Tengda Northwest Ferroalloy Co., Ltd. (“Tengda Northwest”) signed a contract with us to mitigate their bulk losses through our inland transportation management services.

In January 2016, we expanded our business to freight logistics service to provide import security filing services with U.S. Customs and Department of Homeland Security, on behalf of importers who ship goods into the U.S. and also providing inland transportation services to these importers in the U.S.
 
In fiscal year 2017, we also expanded into container trucking services as new business sectors to provide related transportation logistics services to customers in the U.S. and in China. We have signed cooperation agreements with COSCO China and Sinotrans, two state-owned enterprises of China, to provide freight logistics services and container trucking services to them in the U.S. To ensure effective and high-quality services provided to our customers in the U.S., we established a joint venture, ACH Trucking Center Corp., in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 with a U.S. local freight forwarder, Jetta Global Logistics Inc. The joint venture ended in December 2017 and we continue to operate trucking business through our other subsidiaries. Since ACH Center’s operating revenue was less than 1% of the Company’s consolidated revenue and the termination did not constitute a strategic shift that would have a major effect on the Company’s operations and financial results, the results of operations for ACH Center was not reported as discontinued operations in the financial statements.
 
As an effort to further diversify our business, in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we have developed bulk cargo container services segment. Bulk cargo container shipment refers to using containers to ship commodities which traditionally are shipped by freight cargo. Freight cargo rate is usually lower than that of container freight rate, however the transit time is much longer and has high minimum quantity requirements. With the Chinese government banning the import of environmental wastes by the end of 2017, the empty container rate of COSCO Group's container shipping from the United States to China is further reduced. Therefore with the signing of a strategic cooperation agreement COSCO Beijing, we are able to take advantage of the low container rate to jointly promote bulk cargo container transportation. Revenue from bulk cargo container services amounted to $638,227 for the fiscal 2018 while we didn’t have such business in 2017.
 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we established a wholly-owned subsidiary, Ningbo Saimeinuo Supply Chain Management Ltd which primarily engages in transportation management and freight logistics services.
 
Our Strategy
 
Our strategy is to:
 

● | Provide better solutions for issues and challenges faced by the entire shipping and freight logistics chain to better serve our customers and explore additional growth avenues.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Diversify our current service offerings organically or through acquisitions and/or strategic alliance; continue to grow our business in the U.S. market;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continue to streamline our business practice, optimize our cost structure and improve our operating efficiency through effective planning, budgeting, execution and cost control and strengthening our IT infrastructure;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continue to reduce our dependency on our legacy business and few key customers; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continue to monetize our relationships with our strategic partners and leverage their support and our innovation to expand our business.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
With the establishment of our subsidiary in Los Angeles, we added cargo forwarding services to our service platform in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, which is included in our inland transportation business line at the end of June 30, 2016. As we are developing our cargo forwarding services, the Company provides freight logistics services and container trucking services as two new business segments in fiscal 2017. During fiscal year 2018, the Company began to provide bulk cargo container services to the customers.

Our Goals and Strategic Plan
 
By leveraging our fine reputation, extensive business relationships, technical ability and in-depth knowledge of the shipping industry, our goal is to further strengthen our position as a leading global logistics solution provider who offers innovative resolutions to better address complex issues in different aspects in the entire shipping and freight logistics chain.
 
We historically focused our business on providing our customers with customized shipping agency services. In the past, our business came predominately from our strong business relationships with our key strategic partners in China. To reduce our dependency on a single business line, we have leveraged, and will continue to leverage, our business relationships with strategic partners to introduce new service offerings to the market and to diversify our business. Our strategic plan for the next five years is to continue to diversify our service mix and actively seek new growth opportunities to expand our business footprint in the U.S. market to reduce our dependency on the revenue generated from China. For decades, the shipping industry has been operated under traditional business models without many meaningful changes. Today, technological innovation has already played a big role in changing every conventional industry. We believe the internet will be a big part of the future logistics chain services and a transformative era in shipping and freight logistics business is coming. As an innovative solution provider, we plan to apply our technical ability, industry expertise and cutting-edge information technology in the conventional shipping business to better connect supply and demand and to develop seamless linkages in logistics chains.
 
As a result of our plan to diversify, we continued to provide on inland transportation management services and logistics between the U.S. and China, such as providing freight logistics services, container trucking services and bulk cargo container services. During this process, we will continue to adjust and develop our strategic plans based on the change of business environment.
 
However, with our decades of experience in shipping agency business and solid business relationships with Baogang Group and Shougang Group, who are among the biggest importers of iron ore in China, we believe it is to the Company’s best interest to redirect our focus on this segment in 2019 based on our assessment of current global trading environments. To our understanding, we are one of few shipping agents specialized in providing a full range of general shipping agency services in China and the only shipping agency company listed on a public exchange in the U.S. while other shipping agencies are much smaller and more fragmented. With the setup of the Ningbo joint venture, we are able to use our resources such as our customer base, our currently developing IT infrastructure and our business insight to build a global network of shipping agencies. In addition, our current business segments like freight logistics and container trucking can also be integrated and enable us to provide more comprehensive logistics services for our customers.
 
Our plan is to develop a shipping agency network in China and South East Asia for the next three years and expand our shipping agency network worldwide. We plan to build the network through acquisitions or strategic partnership with other shipping agencies. Our shipping agency business will be mostly conducted through our China, Hong Kong and Australia subsidiaries.
 
Within the next one or two years, we plan to cover the following ports in our network. Ports in China include Zhanjiang, Fangcheng, Ningbo, Shanghai, Tianjin, Caofeidian, Bayuquan, Dalian, Qingdao, and Rizhao.
 
We also plan to develop shipping agency network in other Asia-Pacific countries like South Korea, Thailand, Singapore and Australia.
 
Our Hong Kong subsidiary will manage the Asia-Pacific shipping agency business network.
 
We plan to expand to European ports and major ports in America within the next three to five years.

Our Customers
 
In light of our strategic relationship with Zhiyuan Investment Group that began with the signing of a 5-year global logistics service agreement in June 2013, we expanded our business platform to include additional service offerings. We started to provide inland transportation management services to a third-party customer, Tengda Northwest Ferroalloy Co., Ltd. (“Tengda Northwest”), during the quarter ended September 30, 2014. As we continue to diversify our service platform, we endeavor to reduce our dependency on a few customers which we provide freight logistics, container trucking services, and bulk cargo container services.
 
For the year ended June 30, 2018, four customers accounted for 50%, 16%, 15% and 9% of the Company’s revenues, respectively. For the year ended June 30, 2017, three customers accounted for 26%, 24% and 19% of the Company’s revenues, respectively.
 
Our Suppliers
 
Our operations consist of working directly with our customers to understand in detail their needs and expectations and then managing local suppliers to ensure that our customers’ needs are met. For the year ended June 30, 2018, two suppliers accounted for 64% and 18% of the total costs of revenue, respectively. For the year ended June 30, 2017, two suppliers accounted for 42% and 11% of the total cost of revenue, respectively.
Our Strengths
 
We believe that the following strengths differentiate us from our competitors:
 

● | Proven industry experience and problem-solving reputation. We are a non-asset based global shipping and freight logistics solution provider. Unlike a traditional shipping agent, we provide tailored solutions and value-added services to our customers to drive effectiveness and control in related aspects throughout the entire shipping and freight logistics chain. We believe that our years of successful track record of applying integrated solutions to complex issues in the global shipping logistics business gives us a competitive advantage in attracting large clients and helps us maintain strong long terms business relationship with them.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Strong leadership and a competent professional team. Our CEO is an industry veteran with more than thirty years of extensive industry experiences including ten years’ working for COSCO, one of the largest shipping companies in the world. Most of our employees have marine business experience, and many of our managers/chief operators served in other large Chinese shipping companies prior to joining us. With these professionals and experienced staff, we believe that we provide the best services to our customers at competitive prices.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Extensive network and positive industry recognition. Doing business in China often requires a strong business network and support of key strategic partners. The Company served as one of the executive directors of China Association of Shipping Agencies & Non-Vessel-Operating Common Carriers (CASA), the authoritative industry association in China. We are the only non-state-owned enterprise represented on the CASA board guiding the development of the industry. Our good reputation and industry recognition enables us to maintain strong relationships with our business partners and have an extensive network of contacts throughout the industry, which helps us gain necessary support to execute our business plans.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Lean organization and a flexible business model. Although we are a small business with limited resources, we have a cohesive and effective organizational structure with the goal of maximizing customer value while minimizing waste. Our unique flexible business model allows us to quickly respond to changing market demand and offer our customers innovative problem-solving solutions, quality customer service, and competitive prices to achieve greater market acceptance and gain additional market share.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | U.S.-registered and NASDAQ-listed public company. We believe our status as a U.S. corporation gives us more credibility among existing and potential customers, suppliers, and other business partners than a privately owned company would have in our industry. Our ability to raise capital through the capital market or use our common stock as “currency” to facility potential merger and acquisition transactions can also help us carry out or accelerate our growth strategies.

Our Opportunities
 
For more than thirty years, the shipping and freight logistics industry has been operated under traditional business models without meaningful change. Many of these business practices are inefficient and problematic; therefore, maintaining an innovative mindset is critical to achieving continuous business success and growth. We are a value-added logistics solution provider with successful past performance and individuals that have been in the industry for a long time. Instead of playing the traditional logistics broker role, we focus on providing technology solutions and innovative leading-edge services to bridge the asset-based world with the digital world. We shape our industry practice and profit model by analyzing wider developments both in the global markets and the technology industry so we can address unique problems that are currently pervasive across the shipping and freight logistics industry.
 
We believe we can capture the business opportunity and grow our business organically or through acquisitions or strategic alliance by:
 

● | Continuing to streamline our business operations and improve our operating efficiency through innovative technology, effective planning, budgeting, execution and cost control;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Diversifying our business to focus on providing innovative technology based solution to our customers to promote our sustainable business growth;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Developing new service lines along the shipping and freight logistics industry value chain, and leveraging our relationships with COSCO, Zhiyuan Investment Group and other potential strategic business partners to expand our global business footprint.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The current market of China's shipping agency industry is mature comparing to what it was ten years ago when the shipping agency industry was fueled by the massive construction of China's infrastructure, yet the over-supply of shipping agencies has also shrunk the profits of the industry. Many shipping agencies were constrained by the small size and the limited services. We have the professionalism and are the pioneers and leaders in the shipping agency industry in China. SINO is a NASDAQ-listed company that already has more flexibility in capital raise comparing to companies that are not on a U.S. major stock exchange or private companies. We already have a network that covers the US East coast, West coast, Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Beijing, and Ningbo. We maintain strong relationships with customers and market resources. The current shipping agency market is more competitive, yet enable companies like us who has better resources in this market niche to expand,

Our Challenges
 
We face significant challenges when executing our strategy, including:
 

● | Given the complexity and length of restructuring our business, we face the challenge of generating sufficient cash from our current business activities to support our daily operations during the transition;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We may not be able to establish a separate department to solve critical issues in today’s shipping logistics industry;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We may not be able to manage our growth when we form more joint ventures for our shipping agency business as we need to better our standard operating and control procedures which may pose more challenges to our management.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We may not have or not be able to get the necessary funds to continue to expand our service and market our services successfully;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our ability to respond to increasing competitive pressure on our growth and margins;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our ability to gain further expertise and to serve new customers in new service areas;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | From time to time, we may have difficulty carrying out services effectively and in a profitable way due to the cyclical nature of the shipping industry, which could lead to a prolonged period of sluggish demand for our services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our ability to respond promptly to a changing regulatory environment, macroeconomic conditions, industry trends, and competitive landscape; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Developing a winning business model takes time and a new business model may not be recognized by the market immediately. As a publicly traded company, management may be forced to fulfill near-term performance goals that may not be consistent with the Company’s long-term vision. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We may not have the technological feasibility to compete in the marketplace.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Competition
 
The market segments that we serve do not have high entry barriers. There are many companies ranging from small to large in China that provide shipping and freight-related logistics services. At present, the state-owned companies in China still dominate the industry and generate a majority of the revenues in the industry. These companies have greater service capabilities, a larger customer base and more financial, marketing, network and human resources than we do. Most of them in a wide range of businesses and involve many aspects of the industry chain. However, we focus on providing tailored solutions and value-added services to select high-profile customers to drive effectiveness and control in related aspects throughout the entire shipping and freight logistics chain. As a boutique company that provides specialized services with limited resources and history, we face intense competition in the particular market segments that we serve. Our ability to be successful in our industry depends on our deep understanding of the complexity of industry issues and challenges and our technical ability to develop best solutions to respond to the identified issues and provide effective problem-solving strategies to our targeted customers to achieve the fastest and most cost-effective outcomes. Our value-added services and innovative approaches are highly recognized by our customers, which helps us to gain additional market share and compete effectively with the companies that may be better capitalized than we are or may provide services we do not or cannot provide to our customers.
Employees
 
As of the date of this report, we have 23 employees, 13 of whom are based in China. Of the total, four are in management, eleven are in operations, five are in finance and accounting and three are in administration and technical support. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good. We have never had a work stoppage, and our employees are not subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
Recent Development
 
Sino has signed joint project agreements with Sinotrans Guangxi and COSFRE Beijing during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. The project involved a shift from the current bulk cargo transportation model to a containerized model. The Company has started a trial by facilitating the delivery of Sulphur from Long Beach, California, in the U.S., to Fangcheng Port, Guangxi, PRC and ultimately to the warehouse of the customer. At the end of the fiscal year 2017, there was no revenue or cost of revenue recognized from this business model. Management expects the transportation of cargo via a containerized model will become a new business segment in incoming years.
