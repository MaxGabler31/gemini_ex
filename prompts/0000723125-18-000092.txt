Storage Business Unit
SBU includes SSDs and component-level solutions sold into enterprise and cloud, client, and consumer storage markets as well as other discrete storage products sold in component and wafer forms to the removable storage markets. SBU sales also include "non-trade" products consisting of products manufactured and sold to Intel through IMFT under a long-term supply agreement at prices approximating cost, which included 3D XPoint memory and NAND products. SBU reported revenue of $5.02 billion in 2018, $4.51 billion in 2017, and $3.26 billion in 2016. In 2018, we continued to ramp our 64-layer 3D NAND technology and achieved bit output crossover relative to 32-layer in the second half of 2018. In 2018, we also extended our leadership position in 3D NAND technology by delivering the industry's first commercially available QLC 3D NAND technology. Leveraging our 64-layer structure, the new QLC NAND technology achieves 1 terabit ("Tb") density per die, which has a 33% higher array density as compared to TLC, enabling new operating points for density and cost in the enterprise, cloud, and client-storage markets. In 2018, we advanced development of our third-generation 96-tier 3D NAND structure, providing a 50 percent increase in layers. Both the 64-layer QLC and 96-layer TLC 3D NAND technologies utilize CMOS under the array ("CuA") technology to reduce die sizes and deliver improved performance when compared to competitive approaches. By leveraging four planes versus two, our new NAND flash memory can write and read more cells in parallel, which delivers faster throughput and higher bandwidth at the system level.
SSDs: SSD storage products incorporate NAND, a controller, and firmware and offer benefits over HDDs of a smaller form factor, faster read and write speeds, and solid-state architecture. SSDs offer significant performance and features, including speed, reliability, and lower power consumption. We offer SSD solutions utilizing our NAND technology to the enterprise and cloud, client, and consumer markets.
Enterprise and Cloud SSDs: SBU sales to the enterprise and cloud SSD markets in 2018 consisted primarily of our flagship SATA 5100 and 5200 series SSDs. In 2018, our SATA 5200 series SSD achieved qualification at enterprise server OEMs, cloud service providers, and enterprise customers. Similar to trends in the memory market, the enterprise and cloud storage markets have been driven by intelligent edge devices capable of artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and other features that store, access, and analyze data in the cloud. Artificial intelligence servers require significantly higher SSD capacity, and our 64-layer QLC NAND technology provides cost-optimized storage solutions, providing significantly lower total cost of ownership for read-intensive cloud workloads. Our 5200 series SATA SSDs, which deliver best-in-class performance and capacity, are based on the same proven architecture as our 5100 series. We shipped our first 5200 series SATA SSDs in the third quarter of 2018 and received broad acceptance in the enterprise and cloud SSD markets. By leveraging our advanced CuA NAND in enterprise and cloud SSDs, we deliver low cost, high density, high performance storage solutions.
Client SSDs: SBU sales to the client SSD market in 2018 consisted primarily of our 1100 series 3D NAND SATA Client SSD, which is targeted for leading personal computer OEMs as a replacement to HDDs. Our client SSDs, used in notebooks, desktops, workstations, and related consumer applications, deliver high performance, power efficiency, security, and capacity to our customers. In the first half of 2019, we expect to introduce our 2200 series 3D NAND PCIe client SSD incorporating our internally-developed controller, enabling us to offer additional differentiated storage solutions for our client customers.
Consumer SSDs: SBU sales to the consumer SSD market in 2018 consisted primarily of our Crucial-branded MX500 SATA SSD, utilizing our 64-layer TLC 3D NAND. Similar to the client SSD market, our consumer SSD solutions are replacing HDDs as end-users seek the higher performance, power savings, and reliability of our SSDs.
Components and Wafers: SBU sales of components and wafers in 2018 consisted primarily of our 32-layer TLC NAND technology and our 64-layer TLC and QLC NAND technology. We continue to transition our business from a storage components supplier to a storage solutions provider with a richer mix of high-value solutions such as SSDs and mobile managed NAND. As a result, SBU sales of products in component and wafer form declined in 2018 as compared to 2017.
3D XPoint memory: 3D XPoint memory has 10 times the chip density of DRAM, 1,000 times the endurance capability of NAND, and is 1,000 times faster than NAND. These specifications create a significant value opportunity for 3D XPoint memory in solutions between DRAM and NAND in the memory and storage hierarchy. Trends in machine learning, big data analytics, and artificial intelligence are driving demand for the features offered by 3D XPoint memory. We are collaborating with our customers to develop 3D XPoint memory products and expect to sample such products in late calendar 2019.

Our embedded memory and storage solutions enable edge devices in the consumer products market to store, connect, and share information in the IoT.
Manufacturing
We manufacture our products at our worldwide, wholly-owned and joint venture facilities located in Taiwan, Singapore, the United States, Japan, and China and also utilize subcontractors to perform certain manufacturing processes. Nearly all of our products are manufactured on 300mm wafers in facilities that generally operate 24 hours per day, seven days per week. Semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive, requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment. A significant portion of our semiconductor equipment is generally replaced every five to seven years with increasingly advanced equipment. Our DRAM, NAND, 3D XPoint memory, and NOR Flash products share a number of common manufacturing processes, enabling us to leverage much of our product and process technology and manufacturing infrastructure across these product lines.
Our process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex and involves a number of precise steps, including wafer fabrication, assembly, and test. Efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple facilities. The primary determinants of manufacturing cost are process line-width, 3D non-volatile layers, NAND cell levels, process complexity, including number of mask layers and fabrication steps, and manufacturing yield. Other factors that contribute to manufacturing costs are the cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment, equipment utilization, process complexity, cost of raw materials, labor productivity, package type, cleanliness of our manufacturing environment, and utilization of subcontractors to perform certain manufacturing processes. We continuously enhance our production processes, increasing bits per wafer and transitioning to higher density products. In 2018, we significantly increased our volume production of 1Xnm process node DRAM and expect to achieve bit crossover by the end of the first quarter of 2019. In 2018, we continued to ramp our 64-layer 3D NAND technology and achieved bit output crossover relative to 32-layer in the second half of 2018. 
Wafer fabrication occurs in a highly-controlled clean environment to minimize dust and other yield and quality-limiting contaminants. Despite stringent manufacturing controls, individual circuits may be nonfunctional or wafers may need to be scrapped due to equipment errors, minute impurities in materials, defects in photomasks, circuit design marginalities or defects, and air particle defects. Success of our manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects to maximize yield of high-quality circuits. In this regard, we employ rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing, screening, and testing processes. We are able to recover certain devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionality.
 4

We sell semiconductor products in both packaged and unpackaged (i.e., "bare die") forms. Our packaged products include memory modules, SSDs, and managed NAND including MCPs and eMMCs. We assemble many products in-house and, in some cases, outsource assembly services for certain memory modules, SSDs, and MCPs.
We test our products at various stages in the manufacturing process, conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow, and perform high temperature burn-in on finished products. In addition, we use our proprietary AMBYX™ line of intelligent test and burn-in systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of semiconductor die during the burn-in process, capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost.
In recent years, we have produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products and system solutions, which enhances our ability to allocate resources to our most profitable products but also increases the complexity of our manufacturing and supply chain operations. Although our product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes, our cost efficiency can be affected by frequent conversions to new products, the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex, smaller-volume products, and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product lines.
Arrangements with Intel
IMFT
Since 2006, we have owned 51% of IMFT, a joint venture between us and Intel. IMFT is governed by a Board of Managers, for which the number of managers appointed by each member varies based on the members' respective ownership interests. IMFT manufactures semiconductor products exclusively for its members under a long-term supply agreement at prices approximating cost. In the first quarter of 2018, IMFT discontinued production of NAND and subsequent to that time has been entirely focused on 3D XPoint memory production. IMFT sales to Intel were $507 million, $438 million, and $457 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
The IMFT joint venture agreement extends through 2024 and includes certain buy-sell rights. At any time through December 2018, Intel can put to us, and from January 2019 through December 2021, we can call from Intel, Intel's interest in IMFT, in either case, for a price that approximates Intel's interest in the net book value of IMFT plus member debt at the time of the closing. If Intel exercises its put right, we can elect to set the closing date of the transaction any time between six months and two years following such election by Intel and we can elect to receive financing of the purchase price from Intel for one to two years from the closing date. If we exercise our call right, Intel can elect to set the closing date of the transaction to be any time between six months and one year following such election. Following the closing date resulting from exercise of either the put or the call, we will continue to supply to Intel for a period of one year between 50% and 100%, at Intel's choice, of Intel's immediately preceding six-month period pre-closing volumes of IMFT products for the first six-month period following the closing and between 0% and 100%, at Intel's choice, of Intel's first six-month period following the closing volumes of IMFT products for the second six-month period following the closing, at a margin that varies depending on whether the put or call was exercised.
IMFT's capital requirements are generally determined based on an annual plan approved by the members, and capital contributions to IMFT are requested as needed. Capital requests are made to the members in proportion to their then-current ownership interest. Members may elect to not contribute their proportional share, and in such event, the contributing member may elect to contribute any amount of the capital request, either in the form of an equity contribution or member debt financing. In 2018, Intel provided debt financing of $1.01 billion to IMFT pursuant to the terms of the IMFT joint venture agreement. Under the supply agreement, the members have rights and obligations to the capacity of IMFT in proportion to their investment, including member debt financing. Any capital contribution or member debt financing results in a proportionate adjustment to the sharing of output on an eight-month lag. Members pay their proportionate share of fixed costs associated with IMFT's capacity.
R&D Arrangements
We have agreements to jointly develop NAND and 3D XPoint technologies with Intel. We continue to jointly develop NAND technologies with Intel through the third generation of 3D NAND, which is expected to be completed in the second half of 2019. In the second quarter of 2018, we and Intel agreed to independently develop subsequent generations of 3D NAND in order to better optimize the technology and products for our respective business needs. We continue to jointly develop 3D XPoint technologies with Intel through the second generation of 3D XPoint technology, which is expected to be completed in the second half of 2019. To better optimize 3D XPoint technology for our product roadmap and maximize the benefits for our 
 5

customers and shareholders, in the fourth quarter of 2018, we announced that we will no longer jointly develop with Intel subsequent generations of 3D XPoint technology. As a result of the above actions, we expect reimbursements under our cost-sharing agreements to decrease in early fiscal 2019.
Supply Chain, Materials, and Use of Third-Party Service Providers
Our supply chain and operations are dependent on the availability of materials that meet exacting standards and the use of third parties to provide us with components and services. We generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and services. However, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials and services that meet our standards and, in some cases, materials, components, or services are provided by a single supplier. Various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials or components such as chemicals, silicon wafers, gases, photoresist, controllers, substrates, lead frames, printed circuit boards, targets, and reticle glass blanks. Shortages or increases in lead times may occur from time to time in the future. Our manufacturing processes are also dependent on our relationships with third-party manufacturers of controllers used in a number of our products and with outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers, contract manufacturers, logistic carriers, and other service providers. Certain raw materials are primarily available in certain countries, including rare earth minerals available primarily from China, and trade disputes or other political or economic conditions may limit our availability to obtain such raw materials. We and/or our suppliers and service providers could be affected by tariffs, embargoes or other trade restrictions, as well as laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change, conflict minerals, and responsible sourcing practices, which could limit the supply of our raw materials and/or increase the cost. In addition, disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials. Lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past. The disruption of our supply of raw materials, components, services, or the extension of our lead times could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. We monitor and manage supply-chain activities to mitigate risks associated with raw materials and service providers.
Marketing and Customers
We continue to transform how we interact with our customers from transactional opportunistic sales of standardized memory components to collaborative relationships where we work with our customers to understand their unique opportunities and challenges. We engage with our customers early in the product life-cycle to identify and design features and performance characteristics into our products that our customers need in their end products, and then manufacture products that better anticipate and fit their changing needs. By collaborating with our customers on their design needs in a changing end market, we differentiate our memory and storage solutions, which provides greater value to our customers.
Our semiconductor memory and storage products are offered under our Micron, Crucial, and Ballistix brand names and through private labels. We market our semiconductor memory and storage products primarily through our own direct sales force and maintain sales or representative offices in our primary markets around the world. We sell our Crucial-branded products through a web-based customer direct sales channel as well as through channel and distribution partners. Our products are also offered through independent sales representatives, distributors, and e-tailers. Our independent sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by us, and we make shipments against the orders directly to our customers. Our distributors carry our products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products, including competitors' products. We maintain inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of products. Many of our customers require a thorough review or qualification of semiconductor products, which may take several months.
In each of the last three years, approximately one-half of our total net sales were to our top ten customers. For other information regarding our concentrations and customers, see "Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Certain Concentrations."

Backlog
Because of volatile industry conditions, customers are generally reluctant to enter into long-term, fixed-price contracts. Accordingly, new order volumes for our memory and storage products may fluctuate significantly. We typically accept orders with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the date of shipment. For these reasons, we do not believe that our order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period.
Product Warranty
Because the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex, it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with applicable specifications, contain defects, or are otherwise incompatible with end uses. In accordance with industry practice, we generally provide a limited warranty that our products are in compliance with applicable specifications existing at the time of delivery and will operate to those specifications during a stated warranty period. Under our standard terms and conditions of sale, liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of, or a credit with respect to, amounts paid for such items. Under certain circumstances, we provide more extensive limited warranty coverage than that provided under our standard terms and conditions.
Competition
We face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets from a number of companies, including Intel; Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.; SK Hynix Inc.; Toshiba Memory Corporation; and Western Digital Corporation. Some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to invest in technology, capitalize on growth opportunities, and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete. Consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, some governments have provided and may continue to provide significant assistance, financial or otherwise, to some of our competitors or to new entrants and may intervene in support of national industries and/or competitors. In particular, we face the threat of increasing competition as a result of significant investment in the semiconductor industry by the Chinese government and various state-owned or affiliated entities that is intended to advance China's stated national policy objectives. In addition, the Chinese government may restrict us from participating in the China market or may prevent us from competing effectively with Chinese companies.
Our competitors generally seek to increase silicon capacity, improve yields, and reduce die size in their product designs which may result in significant increases in worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices. Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage also result from fabrication capacity expansions, either by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization, or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory and storage production. Our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply. We and some of our competitors have plans to ramp, or are constructing or ramping, production at new fabrication facilities. Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage, if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand, would lead to declines in average selling prices for our products and would adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If competitors are more successful at developing or implementing new product or process technology, their products could have cost or performance advantages.
Certain of our memory and storage products are manufactured to industry standard specifications and, as such, have similar performance characteristics to those of our competitors. For these products, the principal competitive factors are generally price and performance characteristics including: operating speed, power consumption, reliability, compatibility, size, and form factors.

Research and Development
Our process technology R&D efforts are focused primarily on development of process technology that enables continuous improvement to cost structures and performance enhancements for our future products. We are also focused on developing new fundamentally different memory structures, materials, and packages, which are designed to facilitate our transition to next generation products. Additional process technology R&D efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing, storage, and mobile memory architectures, the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise, and the development of new manufacturing materials. Product design and development efforts include our high density DDR4 and DDR5 DRAM and LPDRAM products as well as high density and mobile 3D NAND (including TLC and QLC technologies), 3D XPoint memory, SSDs (including firmware and controllers), managed NAND, specialty memory, and other memory technologies and systems.
To compete in the semiconductor memory and storage markets, we must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes. We believe that expansion of our semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for specific memory and storage products and solutions. Our process, design, and package development efforts occur at multiple locations across the world, with our largest R&D center located in Boise, Idaho and other R&D centers in Japan, China, Italy, Singapore, Taiwan, and other sites in the United States.
R&D expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed, the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development, and personnel costs. Because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products, we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing. Development of a product is deemed complete when it is qualified through reviews and tests for performance and reliability. R&D expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification.
Our R&D expenses were $2.14 billion, $1.82 billion, and $1.62 billion for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. We share the cost of certain product and process development activities under development agreements with partners, including agreements to jointly develop NAND and 3D XPoint technologies with Intel. These R&D expenses reflect net reductions of $201 million, $213 million, and $205 million for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, as a result of reimbursements under our cost-sharing arrangements with development partners.
Geographic Information
See "Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Geographic Information."
Patents and Licenses
We are a recognized leader in per capita and quality of patents issued. As of August 30, 2018, we owned approximately 13,750 active U.S. patents and 5,000 active foreign patents. In addition, we have thousands of U.S. and foreign patent applications pending. Our patents have various terms expiring through 2038.
From time to time, we sell and/or license our technology to other parties and continue to pursue opportunities to monetize our investment in our intellectual property through partnering and other arrangements. We have also jointly developed memory and storage product and process technology with third parties on a limited basis.
We have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements and have, from time to time, licensed or sold our intellectual property to third parties. Some of these license agreements require us to make one-time or periodic payments while others have resulted in us receiving payments. We may need to obtain additional licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future, and we may enter into additional sales or licenses of intellectual property and partnering arrangements. We are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on terms acceptable to us.
