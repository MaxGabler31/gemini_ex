Our Competitive Strengths
High Quality Data Center Facilities in Key Metropolitan Areas. Our premier flagship data center properties are best-in-class facilities designed and constructed to specifications to support the highest criteria of security, redundancy, and performance. These assets are located in 21 major metropolitan areas in nine countries. Our facilities are geographically diversified so that no one metropolitan area represents more than 15% of revenue. Our data center footprint is significant, with over one million gross square feet under management and approximately 600,000 square feet of sellable data center space. We are present primarily in the top MSAs in North America where we believe we touch a large addressable market of businesses and enterprises who need the products and services we offer and positions us to expand our market share and drive revenue growth.
Application-Driven Solution Engineering. The ever-evolving needs of IT environments are not one-size fits all. Applications and workloads perform optimally only when the underlying infrastructure is designed and configured to support their specific requirements. This is why we use an application-driven approach to solution engineering. First, we seek to understand the customer’s particular requirements, and only then do we recommend and build the best solution. Whether colocation, managed private cloud, or third party public cloud, our full-spectrum of services allow for best-fit solutions for our customers.
Full-Spectrum Data Center and Cloud Solutions. With growing demand for outsourced IT infrastructure, we believe our full-spectrum data center and cloud solutions are positioned to capture the opportunity, regardless of deployment model or service requirement. Whether an enterprise requires small or hyperscale colocation, private or public cloud, or a mix of these services in a multi-cloud or hybrid environment, we can support them. We connect all of our data centers and cloud services with our Performance IP™ service.
High-Performance Solutions Delivered via Automation and Technical Engineering. Through a combination of automation platforms and highly-skilled technical engineering, we are able to deliver best-in-class high performance IP, speed, resiliency, and scalability that interconnects our data centers and POPs around the world. We use technology and processes to optimize data routes, manage complex IT environments, and deliver a premium service that customers seek out for full solutions.
Strong, Experienced Management Team. Our senior leadership team is made up of veterans of the Data Center, Telecom, Media, and Technology industry sectors. The corporate and operations teams have years of experience working together at INAP and elsewhere with the ability to drive performance in accordance with set objectives. Collectively, the leadership team is focused on executing a profitable organic growth strategy through continued improvement of operating performance and accretive acquisitions and divestitures.
Diverse Customer Base. As of December 31, 2018, we have approximately 10,000 customers across various industries, including healthcare, advertising technology, finance, technology infrastructure, gaming, and software. Our customer base is not concentrated in any particular industry; in each of the past three years, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our revenues.
Market Opportunity

We compete in the large and fast-growing market for IT infrastructure services (outsourced data center, compute resources, storage, network services, and managed services). Enterprises continue to migrate from on-premise IT environments to outsourced services: colocation, managed hosting, or hyperscale public clouds. This migration is expected to move approximately $84.0 billion in on-premise IT value to an outsourced model by 2022, according to Structure Research, with continued movement in this direction for the foreseeable future. From 2017 to 2022, our addressable market is expected to grow from $68.4 billion to approximately $137.0 billion, with a 5-year CAGR of 15%.
Three complementary macro-level trends are driving demand for IT infrastructure services: the rapid growth of the digital economy, the increases in outsourcing of IT, and the emergence of IoT.
The Growth of the Digital Economy

The digital economy continues to impact existing business models with a new generation of software and networked applications. Widespread adoption of mobile devices combined with rising expectations around the performance and availability of both consumer and business applications places increasing pressure on enterprises to deliver a seamless end-user experience on any device at any time in any location. Simultaneously, Software-as-a-Service models have changed data usage patterns with information traditionally maintained on individual machines and back-office servers which are now being streamed across the Internet. These applications require predictable performance and data security.
Further, the growth of big data analytics is giving rise to a new breed of "fast data" applications that collect and analyze massive amounts of data in real time to drive immediate business decisions - for example, real-time ad bidding platforms and personalized e-commerce

portals. Finally, the emergence and adoption of the IoT is giving rise to the "edge," where data center and connectivity options are required to be closer to the end user.
The Outsourcing of IT Infrastructure
On-premise IT infrastructure still accounts for the largest overall share of the market but is in rapid decline due to workloads shifting to outsourced infrastructure models, such as colocation and cloud computing. This trend favors data center and cloud service providers that can offer a range of solutions to cater to the varying needs of medium and large enterprise IT. We expect that many customers will need technical expertise provided by companies like ours to migrate, secure, and manage third party public cloud workloads.
As distributed applications become more prevalent, security concerns and compliance issues are placing new burdens on the traditional IT model and driving new costs and complexity. As a result, IT organizations are increasingly turning to infrastructure outsourcing to free-up valuable internal resources to focus on their core businesses, improve service levels and lower the overall cost of their IT operations. We serve as a partner to those resource-limited businesses and enterprises by providing the necessary infrastructure and services to address the increasing complexity of IT environments in today’s digital-centric world. We serve as a partner to businesses and enterprises, as we provide those resources to customers who are limited.
The Emergence of IoT and the ‘Edge’
The IoT continues to evolve as more and more products now have IP addresses. The volume of IoT projects being deployed has risen dramatically in recent years. This offers countless opportunities for multi-tenant data center and cloud service providers, especially ones with ‘edge’ reach, such as ours. The necessary combination of data center proximity to end-users and the ability to deliver extremely low latency for real-time application interaction, will dictate where infrastructure is deployed to enable IoT projects.
Rapid growth in data generated from IoT deployments will also continue to drive a need for low latency storage. Internet infrastructure providers with extensive data center footprints, cloud and storage options will be prime targets for IoT deployments. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on this growing trend.
Our Growth Strategy
Our objective is to increase market share and continue to deliver profitable growth as a trusted partner to our customers. We aim to offer complete solutions that may require some or all of the full-spectrum of data center, cloud, and/or network services for businesses and enterprises globally. Our profitable growth strategy is designed to produce sustainable long-term returns, driven by both organic and inorganic activities:
Improve Performance of Technical and Economic IT Outcomes for Global Organizations. By taking an application-driven approach to solution design and engineering, along with the use of our innovative automation platforms, we partner with IT managers to deploy solutions aligned with the needs of the application and workloads, reducing unnecessary complexities and costs. Regardless of deployment model (i.e., colocation, bare metal, complex managed hosting, private cloud, or managed AWS/Azure), we have the expertise and tools to support the right mix of infrastructure to optimize both technical and economic solutions. We believe this positions us well to capture new business within the competitive landscape.
Increase Brand Awareness. Continued focus on our go-to-market efforts through sales and marketing are intended to give broader awareness to our full-spectrum of data center and cloud solutions. Investments in marketing initiatives, sales training, and overall brand coverage are designed to give greater attention and coverage to us and support the efforts of our quota bearing sales representatives with both prospective and existing customers.
Expand IT Wallet Share with our Large Existing Customer Base. With our growing portfolio of data center and cloud services, and a customer base of approximately 10,000, we have the opportunity to support our customers’ expansion needs with production, test and development, and disaster recovery offerings in addition to 24/7 managed services. Customers desire a single trusted partner that can offer them solutions for their needs today, as well as their projected needs of the future. Our "land and expand" approach to customer lifecycle management enables us to remain tied closely to the customer’s IT and business roadmap and anticipate their evolving needs. We are staffed with strong account management and customer success organizations that align with our strategy to grow in these efforts.
Accelerate Scale and Capabilities. We expect to accelerate our transformation through strategic acquisitions that add to or strengthen our service portfolio, expand our geographic reach and increase the scale of our business. We continuously evaluate opportunities that fit within this criteria and will ultimately strengthen our position in the market, including smart tuck-in acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures and transformational mergers or acquisitions.
