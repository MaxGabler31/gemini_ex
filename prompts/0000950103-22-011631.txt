Item 1. Business
Organization
 
Silver Spike Investment Corp. (“SSIC”), incorporated in Maryland on January 25, 2021, is structured as an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company. We have elected to be treated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (“1940 Act”). In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes we intend to elect to be treated, and intend to qualify annually to be treated, as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (“the Code”), commencing with our taxable year ending March 31, 2022. See “—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations—Taxation as a Regulated Investment Company.” Also, we are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act, and intend to take advantage of the exemption for emerging growth companies allowing us to temporarily forego the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
 
On February 8, 2022, we completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) of 6,071,429 shares of our common stock, par value $0.01, at a price of $14.00 per share. Our common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market on February 4, 2022 under the ticker symbol “SSIC.” We commenced operations on February 8, 2022, receiving approximately $83.3 million in total net proceeds from the offering, after deducting estimated organizational and offering expenses.
 
On February 25, 2022, the underwriters of the IPO exercised their option to purchase an additional 142,857 shares of common stock from the Company. The partial exercise of the over-allotment option closed on March 1, 2022, resulting in additional gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $2 million, before deducting offering expenses payable by the Company.
 
Overview
 
We are a specialty finance company formed to invest across the cannabis ecosystem through investments in the form of direct loans to, and equity ownership of, privately held cannabis companies. All of our investments are designed to be compliant with all applicable laws and regulations within the jurisdictions in which they are made or to which we are otherwise subject, including U.S. federal laws. We will make equity investments only in companies that are compliant with all applicable laws and regulations within the jurisdictions in which they are located or operate, including U.S. federal laws. We may make loans to companies that we determine based on our due diligence are licensed in, and complying with, state-regulated cannabis programs, regardless of their status under U.S. federal law, so long as the investment itself is designed to be compliant with all applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdiction in which the investment is made or to which we are otherwise subject, including U.S. federal law. We are externally managed by Silver Spike Capital, LLC (“SSC”) and seek to expand the compliant cannabis investment activities of SSC’s leading investment platform in the cannabis industry. We primarily seek to partner with private equity firms, entrepreneurs, business owners and management teams to provide credit and equity financing alternatives to support buyouts, recapitalizations, growth initiatives, refinancings and acquisitions across cannabis companies, including cannabis-enabling technology companies, cannabis-related health and wellness companies, and hemp and cannabidiol (“CBD”) distribution companies. Under normal circumstances, each such cannabis company derives at least 50% of its revenues or profits from, or commits at least 50% of its assets to, activities related to cannabis at the time of our investment in the cannabis company. We are not required to invest a specific percentage of our assets in such cannabis companies, and we may make debt and equity investments in other companies in the health and wellness sector.
 
Our investment objective is to maximize risk-adjusted returns on equity for our shareholders. We seek to capitalize on what we believe to be nascent cannabis industry growth and drive return on equity by generating current income from our debt investments and capital appreciation from our equity and equity-related investments. We intend to achieve our investment objective by investing primarily in secured debt, unsecured debt, equity warrants and direct equity investments in privately held businesses. We intend that our debt investments will often be secured by either a first or second priority lien on the assets of the portfolio company, can include either fixed or floating rate terms and will generally have a term of between three and six years from the original investment date. We expect our secured loans to be secured by various types of assets of our borrowers. While the types of collateral securing any given secured loan will depend on the nature of the borrower’s business, common types of collateral we expect to secure our loans include real property and certain personal property, including equipment, inventory, receivables, cash, intellectual property rights and other assets to the extent permitted by applicable laws and the regulations governing our borrowers. Certain attractive assets of our borrowers, such as cannabis licenses and cannabis inventory, may not be able to be used as collateral or transferred to us. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Investments—Certain assets of our borrowers may not be used as collateral or transferred to us due to applicable state laws and regulations governing the cannabis industry, and such restrictions could negatively impact our profitability.” In some of our portfolio investments, we expect to receive nominally priced equity warrants and/or make direct equity investments in connection with a debt investment. In addition, a portion of our portfolio may be comprised of derivatives, including total return swaps.
 
Generally, the loans in which we expect to invest will have a complete set of financial maintenance covenants, which are used to proactively address materially adverse changes in a portfolio company’s financial performance. However, to a lesser extent, we may
 
3

SILVER SPIKE INVESTMENT CORP.
 
invest in “covenant-lite” loans. We use the term “covenant-lite” to refer generally to loans that do not have a complete set of financial maintenance covenants. Generally, “covenant-lite” loans provide borrower companies more freedom to negatively impact lenders because their covenants are incurrence-based, which means they are only tested and can only be breached following an affirmative action of the borrower, rather than by a deterioration in the borrower’s financial condition. Accordingly, to the extent we invest in “covenant-lite” loans, we may have fewer rights against a borrower and may have a greater risk of loss on such investments as compared to investments in or exposure to loans with a complete set of financial maintenance covenants.
 
The loans in which we intend to invest typically pay interest at rates which are determined periodically on the basis of LIBOR plus a premium. The loans in which we expect to invest are typically made to U.S. and, to a limited extent, non-U.S. (including emerging market) corporations, partnerships and other business entities which operate in various industries and geographical regions. These loans typically are rated below investment grade. Securities rated below investment grade are often referred to as “high-yield” or “junk” securities, and may be considered a higher risk than debt instruments that are rated above investment grade.
 
We expect to invest in loans made primarily to private leveraged middle-market companies with approximately $5 million to $50 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or “EBITDA.” Our business model is focused primarily on the direct origination of investments through portfolio companies or their financial sponsors.
 
For the period February 8, 2022 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2022, we did not close on an investment in a portfolio company. Our targeted investment ranged between $5 million and $40 million, although this investment size may vary proportionally as the size of our capital base changes. We have an active pipeline of investments and are currently reviewing over $1.25 billion of potential investments in varying stages of underwriting.
 
On May 27, 2022, we funded a $21 million debt investment, net of fees, to a new portfolio company, Shryne Group, Inc.
 
The Investment Adviser
 
SSC will manage the Company and oversee all of its operations. SSC is registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. Our Adviser serves pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement in accordance with the Advisers Act, under which it receives a management fee as a percentage of our gross assets and incentive fees as a percentage of our ordinary income and capital gains from us.
 
Our Adviser also currently provides investment management services to several investment vehicles which are primarily special opportunities related to one or more specific transactions. In focusing on a broader sector-based credit and equity opportunity, our primary investment focus differs from that of other investments made by SSC, as SSC's other managed vehicles do not have the mandate to make discretionary investments other than for the purpose of the specific investments for which they were formed. However, there may be overlap in terms of our targeted investments.
 
We benefit from our Adviser’s ability to identify attractive investment opportunities, conduct diligence on and value prospective investments, negotiate investments and manage a portfolio of those investments. The principals and employees of our Adviser have broad investment backgrounds, with prior experience at investment funds, investment banks and other financial services companies, and have developed a broad network of contacts within the private equity community. This network of contacts provides our principal source of investment opportunities.
 
The Adviser manages Silver Spike Sponsor, LLC which is the sponsor of Silver Spike Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition company. Silver Spike Acquisition Corp. completed its IPO in August 2019, and in June 2021 consummated a business combination with WM Holding Company, LLC, the leading technology and software infrastructure provider to the cannabis industry. In connection with the transaction, Silver Spike Acquisition Corp. changed its name to WM Technology, Inc. (“WM Technology”). The transaction provided $579 million of gross proceeds to the combined company, implying a post-transaction equity value of approximately $1.5 billion, and was the largest single financing in the cannabis sector to date.
 
The Adviser also manages Silver Spike Sponsor II, LLC and Silver Spike Sponsor III, LLC, which are the sponsors of Silver Spike Acquisition Corp. II and Silver Spike III Acquisition Corp., respectively. Silver Spike Acquisition Corp. II and Silver Spike III Acquisition Corp. are special purpose acquisition companies that completed their IPOs in March 2021 and May 2021, respectively, and neither have yet consummated a business combination.
 
In addition to our management team’s involvement with WM Technology, our management team has a history of success in the cannabis industry, including, but not limited, to:
 

• | Our Adviser’s CEO and founder, Scott Gordon, began investing in the cannabis health and wellness industry in 2013, and soon thereafter co-founded Egg Rock Holdings, LLC (“Egg Rock”). Egg Rock is the parent company of Papa & Barkley Essentials, LLC, a leading consumer-focused family of cannabis and CBD products. Mr. Gordon currently serves as a director of Egg Rock.

Cannabis Market Overview
 
The cannabis industry has experienced significant growth over the last several years. Canada legalized cannabis for adult use in 2018, and thirty-seven states, the District of Columbia and several territories, have legalized some form of whole-plant cannabis cultivation, sales and use for certain medical purposes. Nineteen of those states, the District of Columbia and several territories have also legalized cannabis for adults for non-medical purposes. The cannabis industry is amongst the fastest growing industries in the world. 2021 estimated U.S. state-legal cannabis retail sales reached $26.5 billion, up 31% year-over-year and is expected to reach approximately $57.4 billion by 2030.1 We believe continued legalization of cannabis and the normalization of cannabis and its many uses - therapeutic, recreational and general health and wellness, are creating an attractive opportunity to invest in related businesses. At the same time, the cannabis industry is highly fragmented and subject to a complex regulatory framework, creating significant barriers to entry.
 
The transition of the cannabis and derivative products to a regulated and legal marketplace has been happening at a rapid pace over recent years, with full legalization in Canada (2018) and legislative momentum continuing to expand the U.S. market. There have been hundreds of businesses launched across various sub-sectors of the cannabis industry, many of which have raised significant amounts of capital, mainly from retail and family office investors, in both public and private markets. In addition, large multinational alcohol and tobacco companies have made strategic investments into the Canadian cannabis sector to diversify their core business while protecting against potential market share loss to cannabis.
 
Broadly speaking, the cannabis industry is still in its early stages, and we believe that businesses with strong management teams, deep operational expertise and financial acumen will thrive in this large and growing market. As cannabis markets continue to grow, there will be increased demand for capital on behalf of cannabis industry operators and ancillary companies serving the industry.
 
The cannabis capital markets, both credit and equity, are still currently dominated by small funds and family offices, which we believe lack the experience and capital to navigate such a dynamic and complex environment. Furthermore, the vast majority of banks and institutional investment funds are not lending to the cannabis industry, given the current regulatory environment, creating a void in the market for credit-based solutions.
 
Historically, cannabis firms have funded operations with equity, but as the industry matures and companies become more sensitive to equity dilution, we expect demand for credit-based solutions to increase. Market turbulence also added to the significant decrease in both debt and equity capital markets activity thus far in 2022.
 
The cannabis industry entered 2022 with a muted optimism from a partial or full federal reform perspective, but these hopes, once again, started to fade over the first few months of the year as progress seemed to stall among congressional leaders. These lowered expectations of federal reform, coupled with a significant sell-off in the public cannabis company stocks, has substantially decreased both equity and debt issuances, as well as merger and acquisition activity, in 2022.

We expect overall capital markets activity to remain muted for the remainder of 2022, unless federal reform momentum increases, but do expect demand for credit-based solutions to pick up in the second half of the year, as companies prefer less dilutive forms of growth capital. The lack of competition and financing options for cannabis businesses is as stark as we have seen in recent years and has created an opportune environment for us to make attractive growth capital investments from an advantageous position – the ability to drive terms and enhance structural protections while capturing above average risk-adjusted returns.
Potential Market Trends
 
We believe the middle-market lending environment provides opportunities for us to meet our goal of making investments that generate attractive risk-adjusted returns based on a combination of the following factors, which continue to remain true in the current environment, even with the economic shutdown resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Limited Availability of Capital for Cannabis Companies. We believe that regulatory and structural changes in the market have generally reduced the amount of capital available to U.S. middle-market companies, and, specifically, to cannabis companies. We believe that many commercial and investment banks have, in recent years, de-emphasized their service and product offerings to middle-market businesses in favor of lending to large corporate clients and managing capital markets transactions. In addition, these lenders may be constrained in their ability to underwrite and hold bank loans and high-yield securities for middle-market issuers as they seek to meet existing and future regulatory capital requirements. We also believe that there is a lack of market participants that are willing to hold meaningful amounts of certain middle-market loans. As a result, we believe our ability to minimize syndication risk for a company seeking financing by being able to hold its loans without having to syndicate them, coupled with reduced capacity of traditional lenders to serve the middle-market, present an attractive opportunity to invest in middle-market companies.
Robust Demand for Debt and Equity Capital. We believe U.S.-based cannabis companies will continue to require access to debt capital to support growth, refinance existing debt, and finance acquisitions. We expect that private equity sponsors and entrepreneurs will continue to pursue acquisitions and leverage their equity investments with secured and unsecured loans provided by companies such as us.
Attractive Investment Dynamics. An imbalance between the supply of, and demand for, cannabis debt capital creates attractive pricing dynamics. We believe the directly negotiated nature of direct lending also generally provides more favorable terms to the lender, including stronger covenant and reporting packages, better call protection, and lender-protective change of control provisions. Additionally, we believe our expertise in credit selection and in investing in the cannabis industry provides a strong basis for success.
Conservative Capital Structures. Given the lack of credit deployed in the federally legal cannabis industry, companies have been almost exclusively funded with equity capital from entrepreneurs, family offices and, to a lesser extent, private equity firms. The significant amount of equity invested in companies in the industry should provide us with opportunities to lend to companies that have a larger percentage of equity as a percentage of their total capitalization than other middle-market companies. With more conservative capital structures, federally legal cannabis companies can have higher levels of cash flows available to service their debt. In addition, we expect federally legal cannabis companies to have simpler capital structures than larger borrowers, which facilitates a streamlined underwriting process and, when necessary, restructuring process.
Attractive Opportunities in Investments in Loans. We invest in senior secured or unsecured loans, subordinated loans or mezzanine loans, equity and equity-related securities. We believe that opportunities in loans are significant because of the floating rate structure of most senior secured debt issuances and because of the strong defensive characteristics of these types of investments. Given the current low interest rate environment, we believe that debt issued with floating interest rates offer a superior return profile as compared with fixed-rate investments, since floating rate structures are generally less susceptible to declines in value experienced by fixed-rate securities in a rising interest rate environment. Senior secured debt also provides strong defensive characteristics. Senior secured debt has priority in payment among an issuer’s security holders whereby holders are due to receive payment before junior creditors and equity holders. Further, these investments are secured by the issuer’s assets, which may provide protection in the event of a default.
Attractive Opportunities in Equity Investments. We believe that opportunities to invest in the equity of federally legal cannabis businesses are significant. We expect that our ability to identify emerging businesses and to provide credit to the industry will provide us with proprietary equity investment opportunities. Our management team’s experience investing in and operating businesses in the federally legal cannabis industry will help us identify high-quality businesses, and our management team’s expertise will be beneficial to our portfolio companies.
Business Strategy
 
Our investment objective is to maximize risk-adjusted returns on equity for our shareholders. We will seek to capitalize on what we believe to be nascent cannabis industry growth and drive return on equity by generating current income from our debt investments and capital appreciation from our equity and equity-related investments. We have adopted the following business strategy to achieve our investment objective. 

 
6

SILVER SPIKE INVESTMENT CORP.
 
However, there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully implement our business strategy and, as a result, meet our investment objective.
 
Our business strategy is to identify investment opportunities in businesses in the cannabis industry. All of our investments are designed to be compliant with all applicable laws and regulations within the jurisdictions in which they are made or to which we are otherwise subject, including U.S. federal laws. We believe that there is an opportunity to take advantage of a newly emerging industry, with a variety of established operators seeking access to capital and managerial expertise. We intend to leverage our team’s collective operating, technical, regulatory and legal expertise to build a strong business with competitive advantages to emerge as a leading public company in the space.
 
As the industry continues to transition to a new legislative and regulatory framework, we believe that many companies will need a partner that can assist in providing a level of operational and financial expertise to support their growth. Our team includes a variety of investment, operational and healthcare professionals who will provide operating, technical, regulatory and legal expertise to evaluate investment opportunities. Our team includes Scott Gordon, Gregory Gentile, Dino Colonna, Frank Kotsen and Umesh Mahajan, all of whom have extensive expertise in cannabis-related industries. Our team consists of professionals who have decades of experience in capital markets globally and have extensive scientific and medical knowledge of the plant and its many compounds, and includes entrepreneurs and founders of consumer-facing businesses.
 
Our plan is to leverage our management team’s networks of industry relationships, knowledge and experience to become the leading investor in the legal cannabis industry. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships that we believe will serve as a useful source of acquisition opportunities. We plan to leverage relationships with management teams of public and private companies, investment professionals at private equity firms and other financial sponsors, owners of private businesses, investment bankers, restructuring advisers, consultants, attorneys and accountants, which we believe should provide us with a number of investment opportunities.
 
Potential Competitive Advantages
 
We believe that our Adviser is one of only a select group of specialty lenders that has its depth of knowledge, experience, and track record in lending to businesses in the cannabis industry. Our other potential competitive advantages include:
 
Our Adviser has deep industry and operating expertise on its management team and advisory board. Our Adviser has the ability to tap into this expertise for each of our target investment opportunities. The expertise, knowledge and experience of these individuals allows them to understand and evaluate the business plans, products and financing needs of businesses in the cannabis industry.
 
Direct origination networks that benefit from relationships with entrepreneurs, business brokers and private equity firms. Our Adviser seeks to be the first contact for professionals focused on raising capital for businesses in the cannabis industry. Given the history of our Adviser’s management team and advisory board as operators and investors in the industry, they have established relationships with the major investment banks and business brokers in the industry. Our Adviser also focuses on sourcing investment opportunities from private equity and venture capital firms that have been active in the industry. Given our Adviser’s reputation in the industry, it also receives referrals directly from executive officers of businesses in the cannabis industry.
 
A dedicated staff of professionals covering investment origination and underwriting, as well as portfolio management functions. Our Adviser has a broad team of professionals focused on every aspect of the cannabis industry and the investment lifecycle. Our Adviser has an investment team that manages and oversees our investment process from identification of investment opportunity through negotiations of final term sheet and investment in a portfolio company. The team members serving our investment management and oversight functions have significant industry and operating experience.
 
Investment Criteria
 
Consistent with our business strategy, our Adviser has identified the following general, non-exclusive criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective investment opportunities. We intend to focus on businesses that we believe:
 
•      exhibit institutional-level operations and financial controls. We intend to identify businesses in the cannabis space that have leading relying infrastructure and operations to survive and excel in this dynamic industry;
 
•      have durable competitive advantages that are differentiated in the sector. We intend to invest in businesses that not only benefit from secular tailwinds in the industry, but also exhibit hard-to-replicate competitive advantages amongst their peers; and
 
•      are fundamentally sound with consistent operational performance and free cash flow generation. We expect to identify businesses that have historically exhibited profitability and strong cash flow generation. Our management team has a proven track record accelerating growth of companies with strong past performance.
 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular investment opportunity may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria and guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant.
 
Investments
 
7

SILVER SPIKE INVESTMENT CORP.
 
We will seek to invest in portfolio companies primarily in the form of loans (secured and unsecured), but may include equity warrants and direct equity investments. The loans typically pay interest with some amortization of principal. Interest is generally paid on a floating rate basis, often with a floor, on the LIBOR rate. We will generally seek to obtain security interests in the assets of our portfolio companies that serve as collateral in support of the repayment of these loans. This collateral may take the form of first or second priority liens on the assets of a portfolio company. In some of our portfolio investments, we expect to receive nominally priced equity warrants and/or make direct equity investments in connection with a debt investment. In addition, a portion of our portfolio may be comprised of derivatives, including total return swaps.
 
We expect that our loans will typically have final maturities of three to six years. However, we expect that our portfolio companies often may repay these loans early, generally within three years from the date of initial investment.
 
We will seek to tailor the terms of the investment to the facts and circumstances of the transaction and the prospective portfolio company, negotiating a structure that protects our rights and manages our risk while creating incentives for the portfolio company to achieve its business plan and improve its profitability. We will seek to limit the downside potential of our investments by negotiating covenants in connection with our investments that afford our portfolio companies flexibility in managing their businesses, consistent with preservation of our capital. Such restrictions may include affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, lien protection, change of control provisions and board rights, including either observation or participation rights.
 
Investment Process
 
Investment Originations; New Opportunities Referred
 
We have a multi-channel sourcing strategy focused on entrepreneurs, venture capital firms, private equity firms and investment banks, as well as brokers who focus on our industry. We seek to interact directly with operating businesses owned and advised by these groups, and we typically negotiate investment terms directly with potential portfolio companies. We focus on businesses with strong management teams who have a successful history managing their companies. We have a nationwide network, and we have built relationships with these operators and investors. We have established SSC as a leading provider of financial solutions for the cannabis industry.
 
When a new investment opportunity is identified, a member of our investment team typically speaks with the prospective portfolio company to gather information about the business and its financing and capital needs. If, following this call, we see an opportunity as a potential fit with our investment strategy and criteria, we ask the prospective portfolio company to submit an information package, which includes detailed information regarding the portfolio company’s products or services, capitalization, customers, historical financial performance, and forward looking financial projections.
 
Once received, the portfolio company’s information package is then reviewed by our investment team and a summary investment memorandum is shared with our Adviser’s Investment Committee.
 
Preliminary Due Diligence and Executive Summary
 
The next phase of the due diligence process involves a structured call with the management team of the prospective portfolio company. A detailed discussion including a discussion of the prospective portfolio company’s products or services, market dynamics, business model, historical financial performance and projections, management team, existing investors and capital structure and debt. Following the management call, if the opportunity still appears to be worthy of consideration, an executive summary memorandum is prepared by the due diligence team for consideration and voting by our Adviser’s Investment Committee. The executive summary memorandum is distributed to the Investment Committee, and the deal terms for the investment are defined. If approved by the Investment Committee, we issue a term sheet to the prospective portfolio company.
Confirmatory Due Diligence and On-Site Meeting
 
If the term sheet offered by us is accepted by the prospective portfolio company, the process of obtaining additional confirmatory due diligence begins. The confirmatory due diligence process typically includes calls with the key constituents of the portfolio company, as well as key customers, suppliers, partners, or other stakeholders as may be deemed relevant by the due diligence team. Additional financial analysis is performed, in order to confirm the assumptions that were made prior to term sheet issuance. During this process, we will engage senior members of our investment team and advisory board to discuss industry dynamics and evaluate the business model of the portfolio company.
 
The final step in the confirmatory diligence process involves one or more on-site meetings, at which members of our due diligence team meet with the management team of the prospective portfolio company for a final review of the portfolio company’s financial performance and forward-looking plans. These meetings are typically held at the business offices of the portfolio company; however, occasionally the meeting will be held via video teleconference if travel to the portfolio company is not possible. One or more members of our Adviser’s Investment Committee will attend the on-site meeting, if possible.
 
Underwriting Report and Investment Committee Vote
 
Assuming that the confirmatory due diligence process reveals no issues that would cause the due diligence team to recommend against the proposed investment, the due diligence team prepares a final Investment Committee Memorandum, which is distributed to our Adviser’s Investment Committee. The Investment Committee then meets to discuss and review the investment terms regarding the proposed investment. Unanimous agreement of the Investment Committee is required to approve the transaction.
 
8

SILVER SPIKE INVESTMENT CORP.
 
Investment Management and Oversight
 
One or two members of the investment team will be responsible for monitoring the portfolio company. Beyond the dedicated portfolio management team, all of our management team members and investment professionals are typically involved at various times with our portfolio companies and investments. Our portfolio management team reviews our portfolio companies’ monthly or quarterly financial statements and compares actual results to the portfolio companies’ projections. Additionally, the portfolio management team may initiate periodic calls with the portfolio company’s venture capital partners and its management team, and may obtain observer rights on the portfolio company’s board of directors. Our management team and investment professionals anticipate potential problems by monitoring reporting requirements and having frequent calls with the management teams of our portfolio companies.
Underwriting
 
Underwriting Process and Investment Approval
 
We intend to make our investment decisions only after consideration of a number of factors regarding the potential investment, including but not limited to: (i) historical and projected financial performance; (ii) company- and industry-specific characteristics, such as strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats; (iii) composition and experience of the management team; and (iv) track record of the private equity sponsor leading the transaction. Our Adviser will use a proprietary scoring system to evaluate each opportunity. This methodology will be employed to screen a high volume of potential investment opportunities on a consistent basis.
 
If an investment is deemed appropriate to pursue, a more detailed and rigorous evaluation is made along a variety of investment parameters, not all of which may be relevant or considered in evaluating a potential investment opportunity. The following outlines the general parameters and areas of evaluation and due diligence we intend to utilize for investment decisions, although not all factors will necessarily be considered or given equal weighting in the evaluation process.
 
Management Assessment
 
Our Adviser makes an in-depth assessment of the management team, including evaluation along several key metrics:
 

• | The number of years in their current positions;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | Track record;
--+--------------


• | Industry experience;
--+---------------------


• | Management incentive, including the level of direct investment in the enterprise;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Background investigations; and
--+-------------------------------


• | Completeness of the management team (lack of positions that need to be filled).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Industry Dynamics
 
An evaluation of the industry is undertaken by our Adviser that considers several factors. If considered appropriate, industry experts will be consulted or retained. The following factors are analyzed by our Adviser:

• | Sensitivity to economic cycles;
--+--------------------------------


• | Competitive environment, including number of competitors, threat of new entrants or substitutes;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fragmentation and relative market share of industry leaders;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | Growth potential; and
--+----------------------


• | Regulatory and legal environment.
--+----------------------------------

Business Model and Financial Assessment
 
Prior to making an investment decision, our Adviser undertakes a review and analysis of the financial and strategic plans for the potential investment. There is significant evaluation of and reliance upon the due diligence performed by the private equity sponsor and third-party experts including accountants and consultants. Areas of evaluation include:

• | Historical and projected financial performance;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | Quality of earnings, including source and predictability of cash flows;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Customer and vendor interviews and assessments;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | Potential exit scenarios, including probability of a liquidity event;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

SILVER SPIKE INVESTMENT CORP.
 

• | Internal controls and accounting systems; and
--+----------------------------------------------


• | Assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities.
--+------------------------------------------------

Private Equity Sponsor
 
Among the most critical due diligence investigations is the evaluation of the private equity sponsor making the investment. A private equity sponsor is typically the controlling stockholder upon completion of an investment and as such is considered critical to the success of the investment. The private equity sponsor is evaluated along several key criteria, including:

• | Investment track record;
--+-------------------------


• | Industry experience;
--+---------------------


• | Capacity and willingness to provide additional financial support to the company through additional capital contributions, if necessary; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reference checks.
--+------------------

Portfolio Management
 
Involvement in our Portfolio Companies
 
As a BDC, we are obligated to offer to provide managerial assistance to our portfolio companies and to provide it if requested. In fact, we seek investments where such assistance is appropriate. However, we limit the offered (and any provided) assistance to services that would generally help any business operate in legal compliance and with good corporate governance. We do not offer any services that could be construed as assisting a borrower to grow, manufacture, or sell cannabis. The services are limited to: assistance relating to accounting and financial reporting best practices; assistance relating to tax planning and preparation; recommendations on accounting and financial reporting technology and operating systems, and assistance in negotiating with vendors and licensors of such technology; providing analyses of existing financing arrangements, assistance in negotiating additional debt financing or restructuring existing debt financing, and introductions to banks and other sources of capital; advice with respect to corporate best practices and corporate governance, including advice with respect to board structure and governance and implementing corporate codes of ethics and guidelines for transactions with related parties; assistance in preparing a portfolio company to become a public company, including guidance on public company accounting and financial reporting standards; assistance in corporate insurance planning, including analyses of appropriate coverage levels and insurance terms, and negotiating with insurance providers; assistance with human resources best practices; legal counsel referrals; and guidance on cash management.
 
We also monitor the financial trends of each portfolio company to assess the appropriate course of action for each company and to evaluate overall portfolio quality. We have several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance of our investments, including, but not limited to, the following:
 

• | Review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Periodic and regular contact with portfolio company management to discuss financial position requirements and accomplishments;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Attendance at board meetings;
--+------------------------------


• | Periodic formal update interviews with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the private equity sponsor; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Assessment of business development success, including product development, profitability and the portfolio company’s overall adherence to its business plan.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rating Criteria
 
In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, we will use an investment rating system to characterize and monitor the credit profile and our expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio. We use a five-level numeric rating scale. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of origination or acquisition), although it may also take into account the performance of the portfolio company’s business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. The rating system is as follows:

• | Investments rated 1 involve the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis. The borrower is performing above expectations, and the trends and risk factors for this investment since origination or acquisition are generally favorable.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Investments rated 2 involve an acceptable level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of origination or acquisition. The borrower is generally performing as expected and the risk factors are neutral to favorable. All investments or acquired investments in new portfolio companies are initially assessed a rating of 2.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SILVER SPIKE INVESTMENT CORP.
 

• | Investments rated 3 involve a borrower performing below expectations and indicates that the loan’s risk has increased somewhat since origination or acquisition.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Investments rated 4 involve a borrower performing materially below expectations and indicates that the loan’s risk has increased materially since origination or acquisition. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments may be past due (but generally not more than 120 days past due).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Investments rated 5 involve a borrower performing substantially below expectations and indicates that the loan’s risk has increased substantially since origination or acquisition. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. Loans rated 5 are not anticipated to be repaid in full and we will reduce the fair market value of the loan to the amount we anticipate will be recovered.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In the event that we determine that an investment is underperforming, or circumstances suggest that the risk associated with a particular investment has significantly increased, we will undertake more aggressive monitoring of the affected portfolio company. While our investment rating system will identify the relative risk for each investment, the rating alone does not dictate the scope and/or frequency of any monitoring that we perform. The frequency of our monitoring of an investment will be determined by a number of factors, including but not limited to the trends in the financial performance of the portfolio company, the investment structure and the type of collateral securing our investment, if any.
 
Valuation of Portfolio Investments and NAV Determinations
 
We will generally invest in illiquid loans issued by private middle-market companies. All of our investments are recorded at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board of Directors.
 
Authoritative accounting guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs are not available or reliable, valuation techniques are applied. These valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the investments or market and the investments’ complexity.
 
Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date at fair value. Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds received (excluding prepayment fees, if any) and the amortized cost basis of the investment using the specific identification method without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized, and include investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. The net change in unrealized gains or losses primarily reflects the change in investment values, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses with respect to investments realized during the period. We record current-period changes in fair value of investments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments in the statements of operations.
 
Investments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at the bid price of those market quotations. To validate market quotations, we utilize a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and number of the quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available, as is the case for substantially all of our investments, are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board of Directors, based on, among other things, the input of the Adviser, our Audit Committee and independent third-party valuation firm(s) engaged at the direction of the Board of Directors.
 
As part of the valuation process, the Board of Directors takes into account relevant factors in determining the fair value of our investments, including: the estimated enterprise value of a portfolio company (i.e., the total fair value of the portfolio company’s debt and equity), the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company’s ability to make payments based on its earnings and cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, a comparison of the portfolio company’s securities to any similar publicly traded securities, and overall changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made in the future. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, the Board of Directors considers whether the pricing indicated by the external event corroborates its valuation. The Board of Directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process, which includes, among other procedures, the following:
 

• | With respect to investments for which market quotations are readily available, those investments will typically be valued at the bid price of those market quotations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, the valuation process begins with the independent valuation firm(s) providing a preliminary valuation of each investment to the Adviser’s valuation committee;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and discussed with the Adviser’s valuation committee. Agreed upon valuation recommendations are presented to the Audit Committee;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Audit Committee reviews the valuation recommendations and recommends values for each investment to
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
11

SILVER SPIKE INVESTMENT CORP.
 
the Board of Directors; and
 

• | The Board of Directors reviews the recommended valuations and determines the fair value of each investment.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We conduct this valuation process on a quarterly basis.
 
We apply Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurements (“ASC 820”), as amended, which establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP and required disclosures of fair value measurements. ASC 820 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for an investment in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market (which may be a hypothetical market) that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC 820, we consider the principal market to be the market that has the greatest volume and level of activity. ASC 820 specifies a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes and ranks the level of observability of inputs used in determination of fair value. In accordance with ASC 820, these levels are summarized below:
 

• | Level 1 – Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Level 2 – Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Level 3 – Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Transfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the beginning of the quarter in which the transfer occurred. In addition to using the above inputs in investment valuations, we apply the valuation policy approved by our Board of Directors that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with the valuation policy, we evaluate the source of the inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar attributes are trading), in determining fair value. When an investment is valued based on prices provided by reputable dealers or pricing services (that is, broker quotes), we subject those prices to various criteria in making the determination as to whether a particular investment would qualify for treatment as a Level 2 or Level 3 investment. For example, we, or the independent valuation firm(s), review pricing support provided by dealers or pricing services in order to determine if observable market information is being used, versus unobservable inputs.
 
Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of such investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be realized. Further, such investments are generally less liquid than publicly traded securities and may be subject to contractual and other restrictions on resale. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, it could realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material.
 
In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected previously.
 
In December 2020, the SEC adopted Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, which is intended to address valuation practices and the role of the board of directors with respect to the fair value of the investments of a registered investment company or business development company. Among other things, Rule 2a-5 will permit a fund’s board to designate the fund’s primary investment adviser to perform the fund’s fair value determinations, which will be subject to board oversight and certain reporting and other requirements intended to ensure that the board receives the information it needs to oversee the investment adviser’s fair value determinations. Compliance with Rule 2a-5 will not be required until September 2022. We continue to review Rule 2a-5 and its impact on our valuation policies and related practices.
 
Quarterly NAV Determination
 
We will determine the NAV per share of our common stock on a quarterly basis. The NAV per share of our common stock is equal to the value of our total assets minus liabilities divided by the total number of shares of common stock outstanding. Our liabilities will include amounts which we have accrued under our Investment Advisory Agreement, including the management fee, Incentive Fee on Income and Incentive Fee on Capital Gains, the latter of which will be accrued based upon the cumulative realized and unrealized capital appreciation in our portfolio.
Determinations in Connection with Certain Offerings
 
In connection with certain future offerings of shares of our common stock, our Board of Directors will be required to make the determination that we are not selling shares of our common stock at a price below the then current net asset value of our common stock, exclusive of any distributing commission or discount (which net asset value shall be determined as of a time within 48 hours, excluding Sundays and holidays, next preceding the time of such determination). Our Board of Directors will consider the following factors, among others, in making such determination:

• | the net asset value of our common stock disclosed in the most recent periodic report that we filed with the SEC;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
12

SILVER SPIKE INVESTMENT CORP.
 

• | our management’s assessment of whether any material change in the net asset value of our common stock has occurred (including through the realization of gains on the sale of our portfolio securities) during the period beginning on the date of the most recently disclosed net asset value of our common stock and ending as of a time within 48 hours (excluding Sundays and holidays) of the sale of our common stock; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the magnitude of the difference between (i) a value that our Board of Directors has determined reflects the current (as of a time within 48 hours, excluding Sundays and holidays) net asset value of our common stock, which is based upon the net asset value of our common stock disclosed in the most recent periodic report that we filed with the SEC, as adjusted to reflect our management’s assessment of any material change in the net asset value of our common stock since the date of the most recently disclosed net asset value of our common stock, and (ii) the offering price of the shares of our common stock in the proposed offering.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Moreover, to the extent that there is a possibility that we may (i) issue share of common stock at a price per share below the then current net asset value per share at the time at which the sale is made or (ii) trigger the undertaking (which we provide in certain registration statements we file with the SEC) to suspend the offering of shares of our common stock if the net asset value per share fluctuates by certain amounts in certain circumstances until the prospectus is amended, our Board of Directors will elect, in the case of clause (i) above, either to postpone the offering until such time that there is no longer the possibility of the occurrence of such event or to undertake to determine the net asset value per share of common stock within two days prior to any such sale to ensure that such sale will not be below our then current net asset value per share, and, in the case of clause (ii) above, to comply with such undertaking or to undertake to determine the net asset value per share to ensure that such undertaking has not been triggered.
 
These processes and procedures are part of our compliance policies and procedures. Records will be made contemporaneously with all determinations described in this section and these records will be maintained with other records that we are required to maintain under the 1940 Act.
 
Competition
 
We will compete for investments with a number of investment funds (including private equity funds), as well as traditional financial services companies such as commercial banks and other sources of financing. Many of these entities have greater financial and managerial resources than we do. We believe we are competitive with these entities primarily on the basis of the experience and contacts of our management team, our responsive and efficient investment analysis and decision-making processes, the investment terms we offer, and our willingness to make smaller investments.
 
We believe that some of our competitors make loans with interest rates and returns that are comparable to or lower than the rates and returns that we target. Therefore, we do not seek to compete solely on the interest rates that we offer to potential portfolio companies. For additional information concerning the competitive risks we face, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure —We may face increasing competition for investment opportunities, which could reduce returns and result in losses.”
 
Employees
 
We do not have any employees. The day-to-day management of our investment portfolio is primarily the responsibility of our Adviser and its Investment Committee, which currently consists of Scott Gordon, our Chief Executive Officer and our Adviser’s Partner and Chief Executive Officer, Greg Gentile, our Chief Financial Officer, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary, and our Adviser’s Partner, President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer, William Healy, our Adviser’s Partner and Head of Capital Formation, Frank Kotsen, CFA, our Adviser’s Partner and Head of Credit, Dino Colonna, CFA, our Adviser’s Partner and Credit Portfolio Manager, Umesh Mahajan, our Adviser’s Partner and Credit Portfolio Manager and Derek Jeong, our Advisor's Credit Portfolio Manager. See “—Investment Advisory Agreement.”
 
We will reimburse our administrator, SSC, for the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations under an Administration Agreement, including our allocable portion of the costs of compensation of our CFO and CCO and their respective staffs (based on a percentage of time such individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business affairs). See “—Administration Agreement.”
Investment Personnel
 
The members of our Adviser’s Investment Committee will not be employed by us, and will receive no compensation from us in connection with their portfolio management activities. The Investment Committee members receive compensation that includes an annual base salary, an annual individual performance bonus, and a portion of the incentive fee or carried interest earned in connection with their services. Certain Investment Committee members, through their financial interests in the Adviser, are entitled to a portion of the profits earned by the Adviser, which includes any fees payable to the Adviser under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, less expenses incurred by the Adviser in performing its services under the Investment Advisory Agreement.
 
Certain investments may be appropriate for us and affiliates of our Adviser, and the members of our Adviser’s Investment Committee could face conflicts of interest in the allocation of investment opportunities between such entities.
 
Below are the biographies for the Investment Committee members.

Investment Advisory Agreement
 
Management Services
 
Silver Spike Capital, LLC will manage the Company and oversee all of its operations. SSC is registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. Our Adviser serves pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement in accordance with the Advisers Act. Subject to the overall supervision of our Board of Directors, our Adviser manages our day-to-day operations and provides us with investment advisory services. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, our Adviser will:

· | determine the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | determine what securities and other assets we purchase, retain or sell;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | identify, evaluate and negotiate the structure of the investments we make;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | execute, monitor and service the investments we make;
--+------------------------------------------------------


· | perform due diligence on prospective portfolio companies; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | provide us with such other investment advisory, research and related services as we may, from time to time, reasonably require for the investment of our funds, including providing operating and managerial assistance to us and our portfolio companies as required.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
From time to time, the Adviser may pay amounts owed by us to third-party providers of goods or services, including the Board of Directors, and we will subsequently reimburse the Adviser for such amounts paid on its behalf. Amounts payable to the Adviser are settled in the normal course of business without formal payment terms.
 
Our Adviser’s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not exclusive and it is free to furnish similar services to other entities so long as its services to us are not impaired.
 
Management Fee
 
We will pay our Adviser a fee for its services under the Investment Advisory Agreement consisting of two components: a base management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the base management fee payable to our Adviser and any incentive fees payable to our Adviser will ultimately be borne by our common stockholders.
Base Management Fee
 
The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.75% of our gross assets (i.e., total assets held before deduction of any liabilities), which includes any investments acquired with the use of leverage and excludes any cash and cash equivalents (as defined in the notes to our financial statements). The fair value of derivatives and swaps, which will not necessarily equal the notional value of such derivatives and swaps, will be included in our calculation of gross assets. The base management fee is calculated based on the average value of our gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed quarters. For example, the average value of our gross assets used for calculating the third quarter base management fee will be equal to our gross assets at the end of the second quarter plus our gross assets at the end of the third quarter, divided by two. The base management fee for any partial month or quarter, as the case may be, will be appropriately prorated and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant month or quarter, as the case may be.
Incentive Fee
 
The incentive fee has two parts. The first part of the incentive fee, the Incentive Fee on Income, is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on our “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” for the immediately preceding quarter. For this purpose, “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including (i) any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, advisory, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies, (ii) any gain realized on the extinguishment of our own debt and (iii) any other income of any kind that we are required to distribute to our stockholders in order to maintain our RIC status) accrued during the quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement with SSC, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as OID, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received and may never receive in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding quarter, will be compared to a “hurdle rate” of 1.75% per quarter (7% annualized), subject to a
 
16

SILVER SPIKE INVESTMENT CORP.
 
“catch-up” provision measured as of the end of each quarter. Our net investment income used to calculate the Incentive Fee on Income is also included in the amount of our gross assets used to calculate the 1.75% base management fee. The operation of the Incentive Fee on Income with respect to our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for each quarter is as follows:

· | No Incentive Fee on Income is payable to the Adviser in any quarter in which our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the “hurdle rate” of 1.75%;

· | 100% of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the “hurdle rate,” but is less than or equal to 2.19% in any quarter (8.76% annualized), will be payable to the Adviser. We refer to this portion of our Incentive Fee on Income as the catch up. It is intended to provide an Incentive Fee on Income of 20% on all of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income when our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds 2.19% in any quarter;

· | For purposes of computing the Incentive Fee on Income, the calculation methodology will look through derivatives or swaps as if we owned the reference assets directly. Therefore, net interest income, if any, associated with a derivative or swap (which is defined as the difference between (i) the interest income and transaction fees received in respect of the reference assets of the derivative or swap and (ii) all interest and other expenses paid by us to the derivative or swap counterparty) will be included in the calculation of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for purposes of the Incentive Fee on Income.

The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the Incentive Fee on Income:
 
Quarterly Incentive Fee on Income Based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income
 
(expressed as a percentage of the value of net assets)
 

Percentage of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Allocated to SSC
 
The second part of the incentive fee, the Incentive Fee on Capital Gains, payable at the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement) in arrears, equals 20% of cumulative realized capital gains from inception to the end of each fiscal year, less cumulative realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation from inception to the end of each fiscal year, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid Incentive Fees on Capital Gains for prior periods. In no event will the Incentive Fee on Capital Gains payable pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement be in excess of the amount permitted by the Advisers Act, including Section 205 thereof. The Incentive Fee on Capital Gains determined at the end of our first fiscal year will be calculated for a period shorter than 12 months to take into account any realized capital gains computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation from inception.
 
For purposes of computing the Incentive Fee on Capital Gains, the calculation methodology will look through derivatives or swaps as if we owned the reference assets directly. Therefore, realized gains and realized losses on the disposition of any reference assets, as well as unrealized depreciation on reference assets retained in the derivative or swap, will be included on a cumulative basis in the calculation of the Incentive Fee on Capital Gains.
 
While the Investment Advisory Agreement neither includes nor contemplates the inclusion of unrealized gains in the calculation of the Incentive Fee on Capital Gains, as required by U.S. GAAP, we accrue Incentive Fees on Capital Gains on unrealized gains. This accrual reflects the Incentive Fees on Capital Gains that would be payable to the Adviser if our entire investment portfolio was liquidated at its fair value as of the balance sheet date even though the Adviser is not entitled to an Incentive Fee on Capital Gains with respect to unrealized gains unless and until such gains are actually realized.
 
Example 1: Incentive Fee on Income for Each Quarter
 
Scenario 1
 
Assumptions
 
Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 1.25%
 
17

SILVER SPIKE INVESTMENT CORP.
 
Hurdle rate(1) = 1.75%
 
Management fee(2) = 0.4375%
 
Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.2%
 
Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income
 
(investment income – (management fee + other expenses)) = 0.6125%
 
Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed hurdle rate; therefore, there is no Incentive Fee on Income.
 
Scenario 2
 
Assumptions
 
Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 2.65%
 
Hurdle rate(1) = 1.75%
 
Management fee(2) = 0.4375%
 
Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.2%
 
Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income
 
(investment income – (management fee + other expenses)) = 2.0125%
 
Incentive Fee on Income = 100% × Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (subject to hurdle rate and “catch up”)(3)
 
= 100% × (2.0125% – 1.75%)
 
= 0.2625%
 
Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds the hurdle rate, but does not fully satisfy the “catch-up” provision; therefore, the Incentive Fee on Income is 0.2625%.
 
Scenario 3
 
Assumptions
 
Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.25%
 
Hurdle rate(1) = 1.75%
 
Management fee(2) = 0.4375%
 
Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.2%
 
Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income
 
(investment income – (management fee + other expenses)) = 2.6125%
 
Incentive Fee on Income = 100% × Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (subject to hurdle rate and “catch-up”)(3)
 
Incentive Fee on Income = 100% × “catch-up” + (20% × (Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income – 2.19%))
 
Catch-up = 2.19% – 1.75%
 
= 0.44%
 
Incentive Fee on Income = (100% × 0.44%) + (20% × (2.6125% – 2.19%))
 
= 0.44% + (20% × 0.4225%)
 
= 0.44% + 0.0845%
 
18

SILVER SPIKE INVESTMENT CORP.
 
= 0.5245%
 
Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds the hurdle rate, and fully satisfies the “catch-up” provision; therefore, the Incentive Fee on Income is 0.5245%.
 

(1) | Represents 7% annualized hurdle rate.
----+--------------------------------------


(2) | Represents 1.75% annualized base management fee.
----+-------------------------------------------------


(3) | The “catch-up” provision is intended to provide our Adviser with an Incentive Fee on Income of 20% on all Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as if a hurdle rate did not apply when our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds 2.19% in any quarter.

Example 2: Incentive Fee on Capital Gains(*):
 
Scenario 1
 
Assumptions
 

Year 1: | $20 million investment made in Company A (“Investment A”) and $30 million investment made in Company B (“Investment B”)
--------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Year 2: | Investment A sold for $50 million and fair market value (“FMV”) of Investment B determined to be $32 million
--------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Year 3: | FMV of Investment B determined to be $25 million
--------+-------------------------------------------------


Year 4: | Investment B sold for $31 million
--------+----------------------------------

The Incentive Fee on Capital Gains would be:
 

Year 1: | None
--------+-----


Year 2: | Incentive Fee on Capital Gains of $6 million — ($30 million realized capital gains on sale of Investment A multiplied by 20%)
--------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Year 3: | None — $5 million (20% multiplied by ($30 million cumulative capital gains less $5 million cumulative capital depreciation)) less $6 million (Incentive Fee on Capital Gains paid in Year 2)
--------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Year 4: | Incentive Fee on Capital Gains of $200,000 — $6.2 million ($31 million cumulative realized capital gains multiplied by 20%) less $6 million (Incentive Fee on Capital Gains paid in Year 2)
--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scenario 2
 
Assumptions
 

Year 1: | $20 million investment made in Company A (“Investment A”), $30 million investment made in Company B (“Investment B”) and $25 million investment made in Company C (“Investment C”)
--------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Year 2: | Investment A sold for $50 million, FMV of Investment B determined to be $25 million and FMV of Investment C determined to be $25 million

Year 3: | FMV of Investment B determined to be $27 million and Investment C sold for $30 million
--------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Year 4: | FMV of Investment B determined to be $24 million
--------+-------------------------------------------------


Year 5: | Investment B sold for $20 million
--------+----------------------------------

 
The Incentive Fee on Capital Gains, if any, would be:
 

Year 1: | None
--------+-----


Year 2: | $5 million Incentive Fee on Capital Gains — 20% multiplied by $25 million ($30 million realized capital gains on Investment A less $5 million unrealized capital depreciation on Investment B)

SILVER SPIKE INVESTMENT CORP.
 

Year 3: | $1.4 million Incentive Fee on Capital Gains(1) — $6.4 million (20% multiplied by $32 million ($35 million cumulative realized capital gains less $3 million unrealized capital depreciation on Investment B)) less $5 million (Incentive Fee on Capital Gains paid in Year 2)
--------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Year 4: | None
--------+-----


Year 5: | None — $5 million (20% multiplied by $25 million (cumulative realized capital gains of $35 million less realized capital losses of $10 million)) less $6.4 million (cumulative Incentive Fees on Capital Gains paid in Year 2 and Year 3)(2)

(1) | As illustrated in Year 3 of Scenario 2 above, if we were to be wound up on a date other than our fiscal year end of any year, we may have paid aggregate Incentive Fees on Capital Gains that are more than the amount of such fees that would be payable if we had been wound up on our fiscal year end of such year.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | As noted above, it is possible that the cumulative aggregate Incentive Fees on Capital Gains received by our Adviser ($6.4 million) is effectively greater than $5 million (20% of cumulative aggregate realized capital gains less net realized capital losses or net unrealized depreciation ($25 million)).

Duration and Termination
 
The Investment Advisory Agreement was first approved by our Board of Directors on July 7, 2021. Unless earlier terminated as described below, the Investment Advisory Agreement will remain in effect for two years from its initial approval, and from year-to-year thereafter, if approved annually by the Board of Directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, approval by a majority of our directors who are not interested persons.
 
The Investment Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment. In accordance with the 1940 Act, without payment of any penalty, we may terminate the Investment Advisory Agreement with the Adviser upon 60 days’ written notice. The decision to terminate the Investment Advisory Agreement may be made by a majority of the Board of Directors or the stockholders holding a majority (as defined under the 1940 Act) of the outstanding shares of our common stock. In addition, without payment of any penalty, the Adviser may generally terminate the Investment Advisory Agreement upon 60 days’ written notice.
 
Indemnification
 
The Investment Advisory Agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of their respective duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of their respective duties and obligations, our Adviser and its officers, managers, partners, members (and their members, including the owners of their members), agents, employees, controlling persons and any other person or entity affiliated with it, are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of our Adviser’s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement or otherwise as our investment adviser.
Organization of Our Investment Adviser
 
Our Adviser is a Delaware limited liability company that registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. The principal address of our Adviser is 600 Madison Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, NY 10022.

SILVER SPIKE INVESTMENT CORP.
 
Board of Directors’ Approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement
 
On July 7, 2021, our Board of Directors, including a majority of the directors who were not “interested persons,” as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, of the Company, approved the Investment Advisory Agreement for an initial term of two years. In its consideration of the approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement, our Board of Directors focused on information it had received relating to, among other things:

● | the nature, quality and extent of the advisory and other services to be provided to the Company by the Adviser;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | comparative data with respect to advisory fees or similar expenses paid by other BDCs with similar investment objectives;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the Company’s projected operating expenses and expense ratio compared to BDCs with similar investment objectives;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | any existing and potential sources of indirect income to the Adviser from its relationships with the Company and the profitability of those relationships;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | information about the services to be performed and the personnel performing such services under the Investment Advisory Agreement; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the organizational capability and financial condition of the Adviser and its affiliates.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Based on the information reviewed and related discussions, our Board of Directors concluded that the fees payable to the Adviser pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement were reasonable in relation to the services to be provided. Our Board of Directors did not assign relative weights to the above factors or the other factors considered by it. In addition, our Board of Directors did not reach any specific conclusion on each factor considered, but conducted an overall analysis of these factors. Individual members of our Board of Directors may have given different weights to different factors.
 
Administration Agreement
 
We have entered into an Administration Agreement with SSC, under which SSC will provide administrative services for us, including office facilities and equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and record-keeping services at such facilities. Under the Administration Agreement, SSC also will perform, or oversee the performance of, our required administrative services, which includes being responsible for the financial records which we are required to maintain and preparing reports to our stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, SSC will assist us in determining and publishing our NAV, overseeing the preparation and filing of our tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our stockholders, and generally overseeing the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Administration Agreement, SSC may delegate its obligations under the Administration Agreement to an affiliate or to a third-party and we will reimburse SSC for any services performed for it by such affiliate or third-party.
 
For providing these services, facilities and personnel, we will reimburse SSC the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by SSC in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our CFO and CCO and their respective staffs (based on the percentage of time those individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business and affairs). The Administration Agreement also provides that we shall reimburse SSC for certain organization costs incurred prior to the commencement of our operations, and for certain offering costs. Such reimbursement is at cost, with no profit to, or markup by, SSC. Our allocable portion of SSC’s costs will be determined based upon costs attributable to our operations versus costs attributable to the operations of other entities for which SSC provides administrative services. SSC may also provide on our behalf managerial assistance to our portfolio companies.
 
The Administration Agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of their respective duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of their respective duties and obligations, SSC and its officers, managers, partners, members (and their members, including the owners of their members), agents, employees, controlling persons and any other person or entity affiliated with it are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of services under the Administration Agreement or otherwise as our administrator.
 
Unless earlier terminated as described below, the Administration Agreement will remain in effect for two years from its initial approval, and from year-to-year thereafter, if approved annually by the Board of Directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, approval by a majority of our directors who are not interested persons. The Administration Agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty,
 
22

SILVER SPIKE INVESTMENT CORP.
 
on 60 days’ written notice, by the vote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, or by the vote of the Board of Directors, or by SSC.
 
In accordance with the Administration Agreement, and with the approval of the Board of Directors, the Company and SSC have entered into a services agreement with SS&C as sub-administrator (the “Services Agreement”). Under the Services Agreement, SS&C has assumed responsibility for performing certain administrative services for us.
 
License Agreement
 
We have also entered into a license agreement with SSC pursuant to which SSC has agreed to grant us a nonexclusive, royalty-free license to use the name “Silver Spike.” Under this agreement, we will have a right to use the “Silver Spike” name, for so long as SSC or one of its affiliates remains our investment adviser. Other than with respect to this limited license, we will have no legal right to the “Silver Spike” name.
Material Conflicts of Interest
 
Our executive officers and directors, and certain members of our Adviser, serve or may serve as officers, directors or principals of entities that may operate in the same or a related line of business as us or as investment funds managed by our affiliates. For example, SSC presently serves as a manager to several special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs.  These investment vehicles under management were formed for the purpose of investing in specific private equity transactions, which differ from our mandate.  SSC and its affiliates also manage private investment funds, and may manage other funds in the future, that have investment mandates that are similar, in whole or in part, to ours. Accordingly, they may have obligations to investors in those entities, the fulfillment of which might not be in the best interests of us or our stockholders. For example, the principals of our Adviser may face conflicts of interest in the allocation of investment opportunities to us and such other funds. The fact that our investment advisory fees are lower than those of certain other funds, could amplify this conflict of interest.
 
To the extent an investment opportunity is appropriate for us or any other investment fund managed by our affiliates, and co-investment is not possible, SSC will adhere to its investment allocation policy in order to determine to which entity to allocate the opportunity.  Any such opportunity will be allocated first to the entity whose investment strategy is the most consistent with the opportunity being allocated, and second, if the terms of the opportunity are consistent with more than one entity’s investment strategy, on an alternating basis. Although our investment professionals will endeavor to allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner, we and our common stockholders could be adversely affected to the extent investment opportunities are allocated among us and other investment vehicles managed or sponsored by, or affiliated with, our executive officers, directors and members of our Adviser.
 
The 1940 Act prohibits us from making certain negotiated co-investments with affiliates, unless we receive an order from the SEC permitting us to do so. SSC and certain of its affiliates expect to submit an exemptive application to the SEC to permit us to co-invest with other funds managed by SSC or its affiliates in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. There can be no assurance that any such exemptive order will be submitted or obtained. Prior to receiving any such exemptive order from the SEC, SSC will offer us the right to participate in all investment opportunities that it determines are appropriate for us in view of our investment objective, policies and strategies and other relevant factors. These offers will be subject to the exception that, in accordance with SSC’s investment allocation policy, we might not participate in each individual opportunity, but will, on an overall basis, be entitled to participate equitably with other entities managed by SSC and its affiliates.
 
SSC’s policies are also designed to manage and mitigate the conflicts of interest associated with the allocation of investment opportunities if we are able to co-invest, either pursuant to SEC interpretive positions or an exemptive order, with other accounts managed by our Adviser and its affiliates. Generally, under the investment allocation policy, a portion of each opportunity that is appropriate for us and any affiliated fund, which may vary based on asset class and liquidity, among other factors, will be offered to us and such other eligible accounts, as determined by SSC. The investment allocation policy further provides that allocations among us and other eligible accounts will generally be made in accordance with SEC interpretive positions or an exemptive order. SSC seeks to treat all clients fairly and equitably in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duty to each of them; however, in some instances, especially in instances of limited liquidity, the factors may not result in pro rata allocations or may result in situations where certain accounts receive allocations where others do not.
 
Dividend Reinvestment Plan
 
We have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of our distributions on behalf of our stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash as provided below. As a result, if our Board of Directors authorizes, and we declare, a cash distribution, then our stockholders who have not “opted out” of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, rather than receiving the cash distributions. Any fractional share otherwise issuable to a participant in the dividend reinvestment plan will instead be paid in cash.
 
23

SILVER SPIKE INVESTMENT CORP.
 
No action will be required on the part of a registered stockholder to have their cash distributions reinvested in shares of our common stock. A registered stockholder may elect to receive an entire distribution in cash by notifying ALPS Fund Services, Inc., the plan administrator and our transfer agent and registrar, in writing so that such notice is received by the plan administrator no later than three days prior to the distribution payment date for distributions to stockholders (the “Payment Date”). Those stockholders whose shares are held by a broker or other financial intermediary may receive distributions in cash by notifying their broker or other financial intermediary of their election. If the stockholder request is received less than three days prior to the Payment Date, then that distribution will be reinvested. However, all subsequent distributions to the stockholder will be paid out in cash.
 
With respect to each distribution, the Board of Directors reserves the right to either issue new shares or purchase shares in the open market in connection with the implementation of the dividend reinvestment plan. If newly issued shares are used to implement the plan and the most recently computed NAV per share exceeds the market price per share on the Payment Date, the number of shares to be issued to a stockholder will be determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the distribution payable to such stockholder by the market price per share of our common stock at the close of regular trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market on the Payment Date, or if no sale is reported for such day, the average of the reported bid and ask prices. If newly issued shares are used to implement the plan and the market price per share on the Payment Date exceeds the most recently computed NAV per share, the number of shares to be issued to a stockholder will be determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the distribution payable to such stockholder by the greater of (i) the most recently computed NAV per share and (ii) 95% of the market price per share (or such lesser discount to the market price per share that still exceeds the most recently computed NAV per share) at the close of regular trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market on the Payment Date, or, if no sale is reported for such day, the average of the reported bid and ask prices. For example, if the most recently computed NAV per share is $15.00 and the market price per share on the Payment Date is $14.00, we will issue shares at $14.00 per share. If the most recently computed NAV per share is $15.00 and the market price per share on the Payment Date is $16.00, we will issue shares at $15.20 per share (95% of the market price per share on the Payment Date). If the most recently computed NAV per share is $15.00 and the market price per share on the Payment Date is $15.50, we will issue shares at $15.00 per share, as the most recently computed NAV per share is greater than 95% of the market price per share on the Payment Date ($14.73 per share). If shares are purchased in the open market to implement the plan, the number of shares to be issued to a stockholder shall be determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the distribution payable to such stockholder by the weighted average price per share, excluding any brokerage charges or other charges, of all shares purchased by the plan administrator in the open market in connection with the distribution.
 
Stockholders who receive distributions in the form of our stock generally are subject to the same federal, state and local tax consequences as are stockholders who elect to receive their distributions in cash; however, since their cash distributions will be reinvested, such stockholders will not receive cash with which to pay any applicable taxes on reinvested distributions. A stockholder’s basis for determining gain or loss upon the sale of our stock received in a distribution from us will be equal to the fair market value of the stock so distributed to the stockholder at the time of the distribution. Any stock received in a distribution will have a holding period for tax purposes commencing on the day following the day on which the shares are credited to the stockholder’s account.
 
There will be no brokerage charges or other charges for dividend reinvestment to stockholders who participate in the plan. We will pay the plan administrator’s fees under the plan.
 
Participants may terminate their accounts under the plan by notifying our administrator by mail at 600 Madison Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, NY 10022, or by calling our administrator at (212) 905-4923.
 
We may terminate the plan upon notice in writing mailed to each participant at least 30 days prior to any record date for the payment of any distribution by us. All correspondence concerning the plan should be directed to our administrator by mail at 600 Madison Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, NY 10022, or by telephone at (212) 905-4923.
 
Emerging Growth Company
 
The Company is an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”) and is eligible to take advantage of certain specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies that are not “emerging growth companies,” including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. We expect to remain an emerging growth company for up to five years following the completion of our IPO or until the earliest of:

In addition, we will take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
 
Business Development Company Regulations
 
We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs and their affiliates, principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters. The 1940 Act requires that a majority of the directors be persons other than “interested persons,” as that term is defined in the 1940 Act.
 
In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by a majority of our outstanding voting securities. The 1940 Act defines “a majority of the outstanding voting securities” as the lesser of (i) 67% or more of the voting securities present at a meeting if the holders of more than 50% of our outstanding voting securities are present or represented by proxy or (ii) 50% of our voting securities.
 
As a BDC, we will not generally be permitted to invest in any portfolio company in which our Adviser or any of its affiliates currently have an investment or to make any co-investments with our Adviser or its affiliates without an exemptive order from the SEC. SSC expects to submit an exemptive application to the SEC to permit us to co-invest with other funds managed by SSC or its affiliates in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. There can be no assurance that any such exemptive order will be obtained.
 
Qualifying Assets
 
Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the company’s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are any of the following:

(1) | Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which:
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(a) | is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States;
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(b) | is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(c) | satisfies any of the following:
----+--------------------------------


(i) | does not have any class of securities that is traded on a national securities exchange;
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250 million;
-----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC and the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company; or
------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iv) | is a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than $4 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2 million.
-----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Securities of any eligible portfolio company that we control.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(4) | Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
25

SILVER SPIKE INVESTMENT CORP.
 

(5) | Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities. 
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(6) | Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, a BDC must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2) or (3) above.
 
Control, as defined by the 1940 Act, is presumed to exist where a BDC beneficially owns more than 25% of the outstanding voting securities of the portfolio company, but may exist in other circumstances based on the facts and circumstances.
 
The regulations defining qualifying assets may change over time. The Company may adjust its investment focus as needed to comply with and/or take advantage of any regulatory, legislative, administrative or judicial actions.
 
Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies
 
In order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70% test, we must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities (other than small and solvent companies described above) significant managerial assistance; except that, where we purchase such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company.
Temporary Investments
 
Pending investment in other types of “qualifying assets,” as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. Typically, we will invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement (which is substantially similar to a secured loan) involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price that is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the diversification tests in order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. Our Adviser will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions.
Senior Securities
 
We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of debt and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 150% immediately after each such issuance. Under a 150% asset coverage ratio a BDC may borrow $2 for investment purposes of every $1 of investor equity. We are currently targeting a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.50x (i.e., we aim to have one dollar of equity for each $0.50 of debt outstanding).
 
In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we may be prohibited from making distributions to our stockholders or repurchasing such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure — Regulations that will govern our operation as a BDC and RIC may affect our ability to raise, and the way in which we raise, additional capital or borrow for investment purposes, which may have a negative effect on our growth” and “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Use of Leverage and Credit Facilities — If we borrow money, the potential for loss on amounts invested in us will be magnified and may increase the risk of investing in us.”
 
Exclusion from CFTC Regulation
 
CFTC Rule 4.5 permits investment advisers to BDCs to claim an exclusion from the definition of “commodity pool operator” under the Commodity Exchange Act (the “CEA”) with respect to a fund, provided certain requirements are met. In order to permit our Adviser to claim this exclusion with respect to us, we must limit our transactions in certain futures, options on futures and swaps deemed “commodity interests” under CFTC rules (excluding transactions entered into for “bona fide hedging purposes,” as defined under CFTC regulations) such that either: (i) the aggregate initial margin and premiums required to establish such futures, options on futures and swaps do not exceed 5% of the liquidation value of our portfolio, after taking into account unrealized profits and losses on such positions; or (ii) the aggregate net notional value of such futures, options on
 
26

SILVER SPIKE INVESTMENT CORP.
 
futures and swaps does not exceed 100% of the liquidation value of our portfolio, after taking into account unrealized profits and losses on such positions. In addition to meeting one of the foregoing trading limitations, we may not market ourself as a commodity pool or otherwise as a vehicle for trading in the futures, options or swaps markets. Accordingly, we are not subject to regulation under the CEA or otherwise regulated by the CFTC. If the Adviser was unable to claim the exclusion with respect to us, the Adviser would become subject to registration and regulation as a commodity pool operator, which would subject the Adviser and us to additional registration and regulatory requirements and increased operating expenses.
Common Stock
 
We will not generally be able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below NAV per share. We will, however, be able to sell our common stock, warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the current NAV of the common stock if our Board of Directors determines that such sale is in our best interests and that of our stockholders, and our stockholders approve such sale. In any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price which, in the determination of our Board of Directors, closely approximates the market value of such securities (less any distributing commission or discount). We may also make rights offerings to our stockholders at prices per share less than the NAV per share, subject to applicable requirements of the 1940 Act. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure — Regulations that will govern our operation as a BDC and RIC may affect our ability to raise, and the way in which we raise, additional capital or borrow for investment purposes, which may have a negative effect on our growth.”
Code of Ethics
 
We have adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and we have also approved the Adviser’s code of ethics that was adopted by it under Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and Rule 204A-1 of the Advisers Act. These codes establish procedures for personal investments and restrict certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to the code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code’s requirements. The codes of ethics are available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC’s Internet site at www.sec.gov and are available at our corporate governance webpage at ssic.silverspikecap.com.
 
Compliance Policies and Procedures
 
We and our Adviser have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws and are required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation. Our CCO is responsible for administering these policies and procedures.
Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
 
We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to our Adviser. The proxy voting policies and procedures of our Adviser are set forth below. The guidelines are reviewed periodically by our Adviser and our non-interested directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change.
Introduction
 
As an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, our Adviser has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of its clients. As part of this duty, our Adviser recognizes that it must vote client securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of its clients.
 
These policies and procedures for voting proxies for the investment advisory clients of our Adviser are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act.
 
Proxy policies
 
Our Adviser will vote proxies relating to our portfolio securities in the best interest of our stockholders. Our Adviser will review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted for a stockholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by us. Although our Adviser will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on our portfolio securities, it may vote for such a proposal if there exists compelling long-term reasons to do so.
 
The proxy voting decisions of our Adviser will be made by the officers who are responsible for monitoring each of our investments. To ensure that its vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, our Adviser will require that: (a) anyone involved in the decision-making process disclose to our Adviser’s CCO any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (b) employees involved in the decision-making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how our Adviser intends to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties.

Proxy voting records
 
You may obtain information, without charge, regarding how we voted proxies with respect to our portfolio securities by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Chief Compliance Officer, Silver Spike Investment Corp., 600 Madison Avenue, 17th Floor, New York, NY 10022.
 
Other
 
We are subject to periodic examination by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act.
 
None of our investment policies are fundamental, and thus may be changed without stockholder approval.
 
We are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office.
Securities Exchange Act and Sarbanes-Oxley Act Compliance
 
We will be subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the Exchange Act, including the filing of quarterly, annual and current reports, proxy statements and other required items. In addition, we will be subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly held companies and their insiders. For example:

· | pursuant to Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer will be required to certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports will be required to disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our management will be required to prepare a report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. When we are no longer an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to audit our internal control over financial reporting.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act will require us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We intend to monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith.
 
The Nasdaq Stock Market Corporate Governance Regulations
 
The Nasdaq Stock Market has adopted corporate governance regulations that listed companies must comply with. We are in compliance with such corporate governance regulations applicable to BDCs.
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations
 
The following is a description of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of shares of our common stock. The discussion below provides general tax information relating to an investment in our shares, but it does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all the U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to a particular person’s decision to invest in our shares. This discussion does not describe all of the tax consequences that may be relevant in light of the particular circumstances of a beneficial owner of shares, including alternative minimum tax consequences, Medicare contribution tax consequences and tax consequences applicable to beneficial owners subject to special rules, such as:

• | certain financial institutions;
--+--------------------------------


• | regulated investment companies;
--+--------------------------------


• | real estate investment trusts;
--+-------------------------------


• | dealers or traders in securities that use a mark-to-market method of tax accounting;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | persons holding shares of our common stock as part of a straddle, wash sale, conversion transaction or integrated transaction or persons entering into a constructive sale with respect to the shares;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | U.S. Holders (as defined below) whose functional currency for U.S. federal income tax purposes is not the U.S. dollar;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
28

SILVER SPIKE INVESTMENT CORP.
 

• | entities classified as partnerships or otherwise treated as pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | certain former U.S. citizens and residents and expatriated entities;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | tax-exempt entities, including an “individual retirement account” or “Roth IRA”; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | insurance companies.
--+---------------------

 
If an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds shares, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships holding shares and partners in such partnerships should consult their tax advisers as to the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences of holding and disposing of our shares in light of their specific circumstances.
 
The following discussion applies only to an owner of shares that (i) is treated as the beneficial owner of such shares for U.S. federal income tax purposes and (ii) holds such shares as capital assets.
 
This discussion is based on the Code, administrative pronouncements, judicial decisions, and final, temporary and proposed Treasury regulations all as of the date hereof, any of which is subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect.
 
You are urged to consult your tax adviser with regard to the application of the U.S. federal income tax laws to your particular situation, as well as any tax consequences arising under U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws and the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction.
 
Taxation as a Regulated Investment Company
 
We intend to qualify as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Code (a “RIC”) in the current and future taxable years. Assuming that we so qualify and that we satisfy the distribution requirements described below, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on income distributed in a timely manner to shareholders.
 
To qualify as a RIC for any taxable year, we must, among other things, satisfy both an income test and an asset diversification test for such taxable year. Specifically, (i) at least 90% of our gross income for such taxable year must consist of dividends; interest; payments with respect to certain securities loans; gains from the sale or other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies; other income (including, but not limited to, gains from options, futures or forward contracts) derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies; and net income derived from interests in “qualified publicly traded partnerships” (such income, “Qualifying RIC Income”) and (ii) our holdings must be diversified so that, at the end of each quarter of such taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the value of our total assets is represented by cash and cash items, securities of other RICs, U.S. government securities and other securities, with such other securities limited, in respect of any one issuer, to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of our total assets and not greater than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer and (b) not more than 25% of the value of our total assets is invested (x) in the securities (other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs) of any one issuer or of two or more issuers that we control and that are engaged in the same, similar or related trades or businesses or (y) in the securities of one or more “qualified publicly traded partnerships.” A “qualified publicly traded partnership” is generally defined as an entity that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes if (i) interests in such entity are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof and (ii) less than 90% of such entity’s gross income for the relevant taxable year consists of Qualifying RIC Income. Our share of income derived from a partnership other than a “qualified publicly traded partnership” will be treated as Qualifying RIC Income only to the extent that such income would have constituted Qualifying RIC Income if derived directly by us.
 
In order to be exempt from U.S. federal income tax on our distributed income, we must distribute to our shareholders on a timely basis at least 90% of the sum of (i) our “investment company taxable income” (determined prior to the deduction for dividends paid) and (ii) our net tax-exempt interest income for each taxable year. In general, a RIC’s “investment company taxable income” for any taxable year is its taxable income, determined without regard to net capital gain (that is, the excess of net long-term capital gains over net short-term capital losses) and with certain other adjustments. Any taxable income, including any net capital gain, that we do not distribute to our shareholders in a timely manner will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates.
 
A RIC will be subject to a nondeductible 4% excise tax on certain amounts that we fail to distribute during each calendar year. In order to avoid this excise tax, a RIC must distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) 98% of its ordinary taxable income for the calendar year, (ii) 98.2% of its capital gain net income for the one-year period ended on October 31 of the calendar year and (iii) any ordinary income and capital gains for previous years that were not distributed during those years. For purposes of determining whether we have met this distribution requirement, (i) certain ordinary gains and losses that would otherwise be taken into account for the portion of the calendar year after October 31 will be treated as arising on January 1 of the following calendar year and (ii) we will be deemed to have distributed any income or gains on which we have paid U.S. federal income tax. Amounts distributed and reinvested pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan will be
 
29

SILVER SPIKE INVESTMENT CORP.
 
treated as distributed for all U.S. tax purposes, including for purposes of the distribution requirement described above and the excise tax.
 
If we fail to qualify as a RIC or fail to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement in any taxable year, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates on our taxable income, including our net capital gain, even if such income is distributed to our shareholders, and all distributions out of earnings and profits would be taxable to U.S. Holders as dividend income. Such distributions generally would be eligible for the dividends-received deduction in the case of corporate U.S. Holders (defined below) and would constitute “qualified dividend income” for individual U.S. Holders. See “— Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders — Distributions.” In addition, we could be required to recognize unrealized gains, pay taxes and make distributions (which could be subject to interest charges) before requalifying for taxation as a RIC. If we fail to satisfy the income test or diversification test described above, however, we may be able to avoid losing our status as a RIC by timely curing such failure, paying a tax and/or providing notice of such failure to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”).
 
In order to meet the distribution requirements necessary to be exempt from U.S. federal income and excise tax, we may be required to make distributions in excess of the income we actually receive in respect of our investments. In particular, we may be required to make distributions in respect of taxable income we recognize as a result of investing in OID and PIK instruments, without having actually received any amounts in respect of such taxable income.
 
Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders
 
The discussion in this section applies to you only if you are a U.S. Holder. A “U.S. Holder” is (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state therein or the District of Columbia; or (iii) an estate or trust the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source.
 
Distributions. Distributions of our ordinary income and net short-term capital gains will, except as described below with respect to distributions of “qualified dividend income,” generally be taxable to you as ordinary income to the extent such distributions are paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Distributions (or deemed distributions, as described below), if any, of net capital gains will be taxable as long-term capital gains, regardless of the length of time you have owned our shares. A distribution of an amount in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a return of capital that will be applied against and reduce your basis in our shares. If the amount of any such distribution exceeds your basis in our shares, the excess will be treated as gain from a sale or exchange of our shares.
 
The ultimate tax characterization of the distributions that we make during any taxable year cannot be determined until after the end of the taxable year. As a result, it is possible that we will make total distributions during a taxable year in an amount that exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits.
 
Distributions of our “qualified dividend income” to an individual or other non-corporate U.S. Holder will be treated as “qualified dividend income” and will therefore be taxed at rates applicable to long-term capital gains, provided that the U.S. Holder meets certain holding period and other requirements with respect to our shares and that we meet certain holding period and other requirements with respect to the underlying shares of stock. “Qualified dividend income” generally includes dividends from domestic corporations and dividends from foreign corporations that meet certain specified criteria.
 
Dividends distributed to a corporate U.S. Holder will qualify for the dividends-received deduction only to the extent that the dividends consist of distributions of dividends eligible for the dividends-received deduction received by us, we meet certain holding period requirements with respect to the underlying shares of stock and the U.S. Holder meets certain holding period and other requirements with respect to the underlying shares of stock. Dividends eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally are dividends from domestic corporations.
 
We intend to distribute our net capital gains at least annually. If, however, we retain any net capital gains for reinvestment, we may elect to treat those net capital gains as having been distributed to our shareholders. If we make this election, you will be required to report your share of our undistributed net capital gain as long-term capital gain and will be entitled to claim your share of the U.S. federal income taxes paid by us on that undistributed net capital gain as a credit against your own U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, and to claim a refund on a properly filed U.S. federal income tax return to the extent that the credit exceeds your tax liability. In addition, you will be entitled to increase your adjusted tax basis in our shares by the difference between your share of such undistributed net capital gain and the related credit and/or refund. There can be no assurance that we will make this election if we retain all or a portion of our net capital gain for a taxable year.
 
Because the tax treatment of a distribution depends upon our current and accumulated earnings and profits, a distribution received shortly after an acquisition of shares may be taxable, even though, as an economic matter, the distribution represents a return of your initial investment. Distributions will be treated in the manner described above regardless of whether paid in cash or invested in additional shares pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan. Although dividends generally will be treated
 
30

SILVER SPIKE INVESTMENT CORP.
 
as distributed when paid, dividends declared in October, November or December, payable to shareholders of record on a specified date in one of those months, and paid during the following January, will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as having been distributed by us and received by shareholders on December 31 of the year in which declared. Shareholders will be notified annually as to the U.S. federal tax status of distributions.
 
Sales and Redemptions of Shares. In general, upon the sale or other disposition of shares, you will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized on the sale or other disposition and your adjusted tax basis in the relevant shares. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if your holding period for the relevant shares was more than one year on the date of the sale or other disposition. Under current law, net capital gain (that is, the excess of net long-term capital gains over net short-term capital losses) recognized by non-corporate U.S. Holders is generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at lower rates than the rates applicable to ordinary income.
 
Losses recognized by you on the sale or other disposition of shares held for six months or less will be treated as long-term capital losses to the extent of any distribution of long-term capital gain received (or deemed received, as discussed above) with respect to such shares. In addition, no loss will be allowed on a sale or other disposition of shares if you acquire shares (including pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan), or enter into a contract or option to acquire shares, within 30 days before or after such sale or other disposition. In such a case, the basis of the shares acquired will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss.
 
Under U.S. Treasury regulations, if you recognize losses with respect to shares of $2 million or more if you are an individual, or $10 million or more if you are a corporation, you must file with the IRS a disclosure statement on IRS Form 8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases exempted from this reporting requirement, but under current guidance, shareholders of a RIC are not exempted. The fact that a loss is reportable under these regulations does not affect the legal determination of whether your treatment of the loss is proper. Certain states may have similar disclosure requirements.
 
Backup Withholding and Information Reporting. Payments on our shares (including of reinvested dividends) and proceeds from a sale or other disposition of shares will be subject to information reporting unless you are an exempt recipient. You will be subject to backup withholding on all such amounts unless (i) you are an exempt recipient or (ii) you provide your correct taxpayer identification number (generally, on IRS Form W-9) and certify that you are not subject to backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld pursuant to the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a credit against your U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle you to a refund, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS on a timely basis.
 
Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders
 
The discussion in this section applies to you only if you are a Non-U.S. Holder. A “Non-U.S. Holder” is a person that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is a beneficial owner of shares and is a nonresident alien individual, a foreign corporation, a foreign trust or a foreign estate. The discussion below does not apply to you if you are a nonresident alien individual and are present in the United States for 183 days or more during any taxable year; a nonresident alien individual who is a former citizen or resident of the United States; an expatriated entity; a controlled foreign corporation; a passive foreign investment company; a foreign government for purposes of Section 892 of the Code or a tax-exempt organization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. You should consult your tax adviser with respect to the particular tax consequences to you of an investment in shares of our common stock.
 
If the income that you derive from your investment in our shares is not “effectively connected” with a U.S. trade or business conducted by you (or, if an applicable tax treaty so provides, you do not maintain a permanent establishment in the United States to which such income is attributable), distributions of “investment company taxable income” to you (including amounts reinvested pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan) will generally be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a rate of 30% (or lower rate under an applicable tax treaty). Provided that certain requirements are satisfied, this withholding tax will not be imposed on dividends paid by us to the extent that the underlying income out of which the dividends are paid consists of U.S.-source interest income or short-term capital gains that would not have been subject to U.S. withholding tax if received directly by the Non-U.S. Holder (“interest-related dividends” and “short-term capital gain dividends,” respectively).
 
If the income you derive from your investment in our shares is not “effectively connected” with a U.S. trade or business conducted by you (or, if an applicable tax treaty so provides, you do not maintain a permanent establishment in the United States to which such income is attributable) you will generally be exempt from U.S. federal income tax on capital gain dividends and any amounts we retain that are designated as undistributed capital gains. In addition, you will generally be exempt from U.S. federal income tax on any gains realized upon the sale or exchange of shares.
 
If the income you derive from your investment in our shares is “effectively connected” with a U.S. trade or business conducted by you (and, if required by an applicable tax treaty, is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder), any distributions of “investment company taxable income,” any capital gain dividends, any amounts we retain that are designated as undistributed capital gains and any gains realized upon the sale or exchange of shares will be subject to U.S. federal income tax, on a net income basis, at the rates applicable to U.S. Holders. If you are a corporation, you may also

be subject to the U.S. branch profits tax.
 
In order to qualify for the exemption from U.S. withholding on interest-related dividends, to qualify for an exemption from U.S. backup withholding (discussed below) and to qualify for a reduced rate of U.S. withholding tax on our distributions pursuant to an income tax treaty, you must generally deliver to the withholding agent a properly executed IRS form (generally, Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable). In order to claim a refund of any Company-level taxes imposed on undistributed net capital gain, any withholding taxes or any backup withholding, you must obtain a U.S. taxpayer identification number and file a U.S. federal income tax return, even if you would not otherwise be required to obtain a U.S. taxpayer identification number or file a U.S. income tax return.
Backup Withholding and Information Reporting. Information returns will be filed with the IRS in connection with certain payments on the shares and may be filed in connection with payments of the proceeds from a sale or other disposition of shares. You may be subject to backup withholding on distributions or on the proceeds from a redemption or other disposition of shares if you do not certify your non-U.S. status under penalties of perjury or otherwise establish an exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld pursuant to the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a credit against your U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, and may entitle you to a refund, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS on a timely basis.
FATCA
 
Under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (“FATCA”), a withholding tax at the rate of 30% will generally be imposed on payments of dividends on shares to certain foreign entities (including financial intermediaries) unless the foreign entity provides the withholding agent with certifications and other information (which may include information relating to ownership by U.S. persons of interests in, or accounts with, the foreign entity). Treasury and the IRS have issued proposed regulations that (i) provide that “withholdable payments” for FATCA purposes will not include gross proceeds from the disposition of property that can produce U.S.-source dividends or interest, as otherwise would have been the case after December 31, 2018, and (ii) state that taxpayers may rely on these provisions of the proposed regulations until final regulations are issued. If FATCA withholding is imposed, a beneficial owner of shares that is not a foreign financial institution generally may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld by filing a U.S. federal income tax return (which may entail significant administrative burden). You should consult your tax adviser regarding the possible implications of FATCA on your investment in our shares.
 
All stockholders should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the U.S. federal income and withholding tax consequences, and U.S. federal non-income, state, local and non-U.S. tax consequences, of an investment in our common stock. We will not pay any additional amounts in respect of any amounts withheld.
