ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
At Sleep Number, our purpose is to improve the health and wellbeing of society through higher quality sleep. We are committed to leveraging the power of sleep and sleep science to improve lives and create a healthier, kinder and more inclusive world. We deliver on our mission of improving lives by individualizing sleep experiences through the superior execution of our differentiated consumer innovation strategy, the talents of our dedicated teams and the operating efficiencies of our vertically integrated business model. With our revolutionary Sleep Number 360® smart beds and SleepIQ® technology, we have improved nearly 14 million lives.
Financial Highlights
Our 2021 fiscal year included 52 weeks, compared with 53 weeks in fiscal 2020. Adjusting to exclude the estimated impact from this additional week in 2020, we increased annual 2021 net sales by 20% to $2.2 billion, grew 2021 earnings per diluted share (EPS) by 34% to $6.16 and generated cash from operations of $300 million. Return on invested capital (ROIC) was 27.6%, a 260 basis point improvement from 2020. Our net sales in the fourth quarter of 2021 were constrained by delayed receipt of critical semiconductor components, preventing deliveries and shifting more than $125 million of net sales to future periods. 2021 costs were also significantly impacted by inflation and inefficiencies arising from supply disruption and other global COVID challenges.
Breakthrough financial performance in 2021, despite significant headwinds, reflects the alignment of our sleep innovation strategy with consumers’ prioritization of their health and wellness, its connection to quality sleep and their increased adoption of digital products and services – all of which drive continued growth in demand for our life-changing 360 smart beds. In addition, in an environment characterized by ongoing and shifting pandemic impacts, including global supply chain disruption, labor shortages and inflationary cost pressures, our vertically-integrated business model and mission-focused team enabled Sleep Number to accelerate our operating efficiency, increase our organizational agility and advance sleep innovation, science and research while maintaining our focus on delivering an exceptional customer experience. 
As we navigate the current complexities of this global-business environment, we are unwavering in retaining our long-term perspective. For the five-year period ending with fiscal 2021, our compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for EPS was 41 percent and our net sales CAGR was 11 percent. With our strategic, enterprise-wide investments in innovation, technology, logistics, marketing and customer service, we have created a competitively-advantaged business and a highly-relevant brand – which together, are delivering superior shareholder value.
Proprietary Sleep Innovations
Delivering life-changing innovations, sleep health, sleep science and research, Sleep Number’s innovation roadmap is driven by proprietary data and research from its millions of Smart Sleepers, with a purpose to improve the health and wellbeing of society through higher-quality sleep. Our award-winning 360® smart bed started as the foundation of the global sleep tech category and has continued to propel its growth as consumers increasingly connect the impact of quality sleep to their overall health. Today, by leveraging 13 billion hours of sleep data gathered nightly from 1.6 billion, real-world sleep sessions, Sleep Number has significantly advanced the 360 smart bed, creating a superior sleep experience with every detail tailored to each individual sleeper. Developed with leading technologists, sleep scientists and data, our 360 smart beds are also a highly-innovative tool for sleep health, science and research, which helps our Company drive our innovation flywheel. 
The 360 smart bed’s proprietary “sense and do” technology digitally responds to each sleeper’s movements and automatically adjusts to relieve pressure points, effortlessly adjusting firmness, comfort and support throughout the night, keeping both sleepers comfortable at their individual Sleep Number® settings. It enables data quantification and delivers individualized sleep health evaluations and outcomes, responding to the needs of sleepers. SleepIQ technology, the bed’s operating system, is embedded into every Sleep Number 360 smart bed and its proprietary, dynamic algorithm measures sleep time, restful and restless sleep, average heart rate and average respiratory rate. Advancements to the smart bed platform enable new groundbreaking innovations: At CES 2022, we unveiled a new Sleep Number 360

smart bed technology platform that may be capable of providing advanced monitoring of personalized insights and health-risk evaluations – all from home. Coming in late 2022, the new Sleep Number Climate360® smart bed will also capture skin and microclimate temperature monitoring to facilitate temperature adjustments during the night.
Artificial intelligence (AI) and data science enable the automatic adjustments to improve sleep and provide actionable insights for our Smart Sleeper℠ community, connecting quality sleep to sleep health through highly accurate, comprehensive, longitudinal biometric data collected during each sleep session. Ongoing advancements to the 360 smart bed platform via over-the-air updates enable real-time, effortless data collection and the delivery of sleep and wellness insights including Sleep Circadian Analytics, Sleep Wellness Reports, Heart Rate Variability, My Daytime Alertness and My Sleep Health. 
Sleep Number offers a full line of exclusive FlexFit™ smart adjustable bases that allow customers to raise the head or foot of the bed. These industry-leading bases seamlessly integrate with the 360 smart bed to deliver features like our Partner Snore™ technology, which allows a sleeping partner to temporarily relieve mild snoring by raising the companion’s head at the touch of a button. 
Our exclusive Sleep Number bedding collection and smart furniture (coming in 2023) feature a full line of sleep products designed to improve sleep comfort and quality, including a pillow collection designed to fit each individual’s sleeping position. Our new smart furniture is designed to complement and enhance the features and health and wellness benefits of the 360 smart bed and FlexFit smart adjustable bases. The furniture creates an ideal environment to support sleep health and provides an integrated sleep experience with a modifiable form factor for aging and recovery, providing comfort, aiding in mobility and helping maintain independence at home. The new furniture also eliminates clutter, conveniently combining popular sleep accessories into a single solution for customers to have the perfect individualized sleep environment to fall asleep and stay asleep. 
Our smart bed technology is being used to capture data on natural sleep for research on disease prediction, diagnosis and treatment in a noninvasive, ecologically-valid manner. The 360 smart bed – along with partnerships and collaborations with the world’s leading physicians, researchers and institutions – is helping to advance the development of meaningful sleep health solutions, bringing significant benefits to real-world sleepers. 
Data, Research and Collaborations 
Sleep Number is redefining the standards for monitoring sleep for research and health, and our 360 smart bed offers a non-invasive, real-world and accurate method to conduct sleep research. Based on ballistocardiographic readings and leveraging high-resolution, full-body, continuous sensor recordings, as well as signal processing and machine-learning methods, SleepIQ technology automatically collects and analyzes billions of data points nightly, conducting one of the largest sample sizes of sleep studies every night.
To date, we have leveraged and learned from over 13 billion hours of sleep data gathered from over 1.6 billion real-world sleep sessions, generating comprehensive longitudinal and ecologically-valid data to improve sleep quality. Ongoing sleep science research is enabled by the more than 200,000 sleepers in the 360 smart bed Smart Sleeper community that have opted in to participate and advance the science of sleep and health. These sleepers have enabled rapid enrollment in Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved studies, which combine the power of our broad sleep database with subjective understanding of sleeper behaviors to understand real-world outcomes. 
The 360 smart beds stand out because of their continuous, longitudinal, ecologically-valid biosignal collection and they are effortless to use – with no need to wear or charge anything. They are the first and only smart bed with integrated and validated data collection and feedback that requires no action by the user to deliver proven quality sleep. The 360 smart bed is helping to advance the linkage of quality sleep to health, bringing significant benefits to real-world sleepers.

Exclusive Direct-to-Consumer Distribution
Our exclusive, direct-to-consumer distribution model supports lifelong relationships with our customers. Across our customer touchpoints which include Stores, Online, Phone and Chat, we deliver a value-added retail experience that seamlessly integrates our digital and physical experiences to meet customer needs. We offer an engaging and dynamic online experience to educate consumers and advance their purchase path, driving highly-qualified traffic to all our retail touchpoints. Our mission-driven, highly-trained sleep experts use digital technology and our best-in-class relationship-based selling process, which is continually tested and refined, to find the right sleep solutions for our customers — wherever and whenever they want to shop. This “sell-from-anywhere” model supports our customers’ shopping preferences and results in new customer acquisition, sustained repeat and referral, high conversion and strong revenue per smart bed unit — all of which drive continued sales and profitable growth. 
As the exclusive distributor of Sleep Number® products, we target high-quality, convenient and visible store locations based on several factors, including each market’s overall sales potential and store geography, demographics and proximity to other brand experiences. Since 2010, we have invested to reposition a large percentage of our mall stores to stronger, optimally-sized, non-mall locations, adding stores in both existing and new markets. As of January 1, 2022, we operated 648 Sleep Number® stores, with locations in all 50 states. More than 39% of our stores (including remodels) are less than five years old and more than 56% are less than seven years old.
Our Stores accounted for 87% of net sales in 2021. Average annual net sales per store in 2021, based on Total Retail (which includes Stores, Online, Phone and Chat), were $3.6 million, a new record. In 2021, 84% of our Stores open for a full year generated net sales of greater than $2 million, and 48% of our Stores open for a full year generated more than $3 million in net sales. In 2021, our Online, Phone, Chat and Other sales accounted for 13% of our net sales.
Brand Communications
Sleep Number has become a beloved brand, which was built on a foundation of individuality and wellbeing. Our relevant, engaging and individualized communications help to drive sustained demand and market share gains for our award-winning 360 smart beds. Our consumer innovation strategy — which has guided us since 2012 — enables a deep understanding of, and insights about, our target customers. These insights give us the perceptual acuity to see ahead of structural consumer-behavior shifts and helps us pivot when necessary, such as during the recent global pandemic.
Our brand communications strategies are designed to emotionally connect consumers with high-quality content about the benefits of life-changing sleep and the value of our 360 smart beds. We leverage and amplify our brand through highly-visible strategic partnerships; engage consumers seamlessly across multiple touchpoints with an emphasis on digital; and create lifelong customer relationships and brand advocacy by delivering an unparalleled sleep experience. Together, these actions result in driving strong brand health, increased brand interest, heightened consumer consideration, customer engagement and authentic advocacy for Sleep Number’s brand, innovations and services.
Strategic partnerships amplify the effectiveness, impact and scale of our brand and marketing efforts:
•We are in the fourth year of our strategic partnership as the Official Sleep and Wellness Partner of the National Football League (NFL) — one of the world’s largest marketing and fan-engagement platforms. Our partnership with the NFL broadens our brand reach, deepens our brand relevance and magnifies the benefits of our proprietary innovations. Additional partnerships with four clubs — Super Bowl LVI Champion Los Angeles Rams, Dallas Cowboys, Kansas City Chiefs and Minnesota Vikings — add to our national and community-activation efforts. Over 75% of active NFL players now have a Sleep Number 360 smart bed, which helps with the optimization of their performance and recovery through quality sleep; and
•Our multi-year partnerships with content and media companies like CNN, Yahoo!, Thrive Global, YouTube, NFL Media and more also provide opportunities to influence and educate consumers about the benefits of proven quality sleep on a regular basis.
We leverage a sophisticated media mix to drive our performance marketing and advertising, with emphasis on digital and aligned with consumer consumption, contributing to improved media return on investment (ROI). High-profile video, including television and online streaming, is our most efficient media, followed by digital and social platforms. Our world-class, in-house digital capabilities, content marketing, online user experience and data-driven tools give us the 

6 | 2021 FORM 10-K | SLEEP NUMBER CORPORATION

flexibility to pivot quickly and optimize media investment, messages and audience by platform in real-time. Our promotional strategy focuses on simplicity and relevance, driving consumers to the brand at the time when they are seeking a smart bed. In 2021, media expense represented 14.8% of net sales.
We continue to strengthen our digital interactions with a new “sell-from-anywhere” model which makes it easy for our customers to select the best Sleep Number solution for their needs, however they want to interact with us. And by delivering a superior, personalized customer connection with our highly-knowledgeable sleep professionals, we are building lifelong relationships. Overall, 2021 represented our fourth straight year of double-digit, digital-traffic growth.
We focus on lifelong relationships with our customers, whom we refer to as our Insiders, part of our Smart Sleeper community. The more deeply engaged our Insiders are with the brand, the greater their advocacy. Our Smart Sleeper community, now 2.1 million strong, regularly interacts with our brand through their 360 smart bed and SleepIQ technology. Our award-winning InnerCircle Rewards program amplifies this engagement and drives acquisition of new customers through referral, and greater retention with repeat purchases. That brand loyalty and advocacy has grown significantly in recent years — representing approximately 50% of our business — and we expect that the incremental health and wellbeing features introduced through their 360 smart beds will continue to drive Insider loyalty. Our Smart Sleeper community is our most efficient, and most valuable, source of new customers to the brand.
We continue to invest in our demand drivers for the near- and long-term success of our brand, delivering a simpler and even more engaging experience for our customers. Our newly launched enterprise customer identity platform creates a seamless connection for deeper customer engagement. This enables efficient customer acquisition and increased revenue, and empowers our customers to participate more deeply in the brand. By making it easier for our Smart Sleeper community to share their personal sleep health success stories from our 360 smart beds, we are driving lifetime value, richer customer relationships and lean into our purpose of improving the health and wellbeing of society through higher quality sleep.
Operations
Integrated Sourcing and Logistics
Our commitments to innovation and continuous improvement are employed to leverage our vertical business model by optimizing culture, processes and technology. In addition to a network of global suppliers, we currently operate two component manufacturing plants (Irmo, SC and Salt Lake City, UT) and five assembly distribution centers (Irmo, SC; Salt Lake City, UT; Ontario, CA; Baltimore, MD; and Tampa, FL) with three additional assembly distribution centers (Dallas, TX; Cincinnati, OH; and Minneapolis, MN) opening in 2022. Primary operations at the manufacturing sites, which have consistently won awards for safety and manufacturing excellence, include cutting and sewing of the fabric covers for our beds. In our Utah plant, we also assemble our electrical Firmness Control™ systems. Teams at our assembly distribution centers fulfill customer orders that are made-to-order daily and assemble final mattress and order kitting with bases and accessories for shipment. We also operate a national bedding-fulfillment center.
We source the raw materials and components used in our products from third parties. Throughout 2021, we encountered temporary disruptions in our supply of various materials and components due to well-documented shortages and constraints in the global supply chain. We have taken, and continue to take, various measures to mitigate the potential impact of supply disruptions, including strengthening relationships with primary suppliers, identifying new alternate suppliers, redesigning products, exploring alternative components and maintaining safety stocks. While we expect some supply constraints to persist through 2022, we are leveraging the flexibility, visibility and resilience of our vertically-integrated model to respond nimbly as conditions change and communicate clearly with customers regarding their delivery experience.
At the end of 2021, approximately 60% of our smart beds were pre-assembled in our assembly distribution centers prior to delivery versus being assembled in customers’ homes by Sleep Number technicians. We expect to complete a multi-year evolution of our supply chain distribution network to pre-assemble 100% of our smart beds by the end of 2022. Additionally in 2022, we will move our bedding fulfillment center from Minnesota to Ohio to be closer to our customers. We are advancing our outbound logistics network by adding full truckload carriers and dedicated cross docks to reduce product handling, hand-offs, damage and costs while in transit to customers’ homes. This new network design enables scale and agility to support volume spikes and disruptions, providing a superior and reliable experience for customers with lower costs for the business.

Home Delivery Service
Our home delivery teams are another direct touchpoint with our customers. Since 2018, 100% of our 360 smart beds sold are delivered and installed by our home delivery technicians or by our third-party service providers.
Our home delivery teams across the nation overcame the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic throughout 2021, adopting measures to safeguard customer and team member health while ensuring that customers were still able to receive the quality sleep they needed.
Customer Service
Serving our customers remains a strong focus. Through our U.S.-based, in-house customer service team based in Minneapolis, MN and New Orleans, LA, we provide direct post-purchase support that improves the customer experience and drives our business. Through frequent service and support interactions with customers via phone, email, live chat and social media, these team members also provide a unique opportunity to gather insights that help us continuously improve our products, strengthen our service quality and advance our innovation. This integration enables operational synergies and drives organizational efficiencies.
Information Systems
We use information technology systems to operate, analyze and manage our business, to reduce operating costs and to enhance our customers’ experience. Our major systems include an in-store order entry system, a retail portal system, a payment processing system, in-bound and out-bound telecommunications systems for direct marketing, delivery scheduling and customer service systems, e-commerce systems, a data warehouse system and an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. These systems are primarily comprised of packaged applications licensed from various software vendors plus a limited number of internally developed programs and digital solutions.
Intellectual Property
We hold various U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications regarding certain elements of the design and function of our products, including air control systems, remote control systems, air chamber features, mattress construction, foundation systems, sensing systems, automated adjustments, in-bed temperature control, as well as other technology. We have numerous U.S. patents, expiring at various dates between January 2022 and August 2045, and numerous U.S. patent applications pending. We also have numerous foreign patents and patent applications pending. Notwithstanding these patents and patent applications, we cannot ensure that these patent rights will provide substantial protection or that others will not be able to develop products that are similar to, or competitive with, our products.
We have a number of trademarks and service marks registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, including Sleep Number®, SleepIQ®, Sleep Number 360®, 360®, SleepIQ Kids®, the Double Arrow logo, Select Comfort®, AirFit®, the “B” logo, Comfortaire®, Does Your Bed Do That?®, the DualTemp logo, the DualAir Technology Inside logo, FlexTop®, HealthIQ®, IndividualFit®, It®, Know Better Sleep®, Pillow[ology]®, PillowFit®, Probably the Best Bed in the World®, Responsive Air®, Sleep Is Training®, Sleep Number Inner Circle®, Sleep30®, Smart Bed For Smart Kids®, Tech-e®, The Only Bed That Grows With Them®, This Is Not A Bed®, Tonight Bedtime.

Industry and Competition
Sleep disorders have been declared a public health epidemic by the U.S. Center for Disease Control. One in three adults suffer from a lack of adequate sleep. Sleep Number is focused on producing products to address this growing problem. The total U.S. sleep-health economy was estimated to be $30 billion to $40 billion in a 2017 report published by McKinsey & Company. This reflects the traditional view of the bedding industry which includes the sales of mattresses and foundations, as well as emerging solutions for insufficient sleep such as routine modification and therapeutic treatment. We believe the sleep economy will continue to evolve and grow as consumers look for products and reliable data sources to address sleep deprivation challenges.
The traditional view of the U.S. bedding industry, including mattresses and foundations (static and adjustable), is measured through data provided by the International Sleep Products Association (ISPA). According to ISPA, the industry has grown by approximately 5% annually over the last 20 years, including 6% annually, on average, over the past five years. According to ISPA and our estimates, industry wholesale shipments of mattresses and foundations (including imported products and adjustable bases) were approximately $13 billion in 2021 (approximately $26 billion at retail).
The retail bedding industry is commoditized and highly competitive. Sleep Number competes against regional and local specialty bedding retailers, home furnishing stores, mass merchants, national discount stores and online marketers. Furniture Today, a furniture industry trade publication, has ranked Sleep Number as the 5th largest mattress manufacturer and 2nd largest U.S. bedding retailer for 2020, with an estimated 8% market share of industry retail revenue. Our consumer innovation strategy with proprietary sleep innovations and exclusive direct-to-consumer distribution is highly differentiated, resulting in lifelong customer relationships and contributing to our continued profitable growth.
Manufacturers in the bedding industry compete through retail partners on price, quality, brand name recognition, product availability and product performance, including the perceived levels of comfort and support provided by a mattress. There is a high degree of concentration among manufacturers, who produce innerspring, memory foam and hybrid beds, under nationally recognized brand names, including Tempur Sealy, Stearns & Foster, Serta and Simmons. In recent years, numerous direct-to-consumer companies and low-cost importers have entered the market, offering “bed-in-a-box” products to consumers, primarily through online distribution though many now partner with traditional mattress retailers. Their products are generally foam-based and undifferentiated in terms of sleep benefits.

Governmental Regulation and Compliance
As a vertically integrated manufacturer and retailer, we are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting all aspects of our business.
As a manufacturer, we are committed to product quality and safety, including adherence to all applicable laws and regulations affecting our products and services. Compliance with health, safety and environmental laws and regulations, including the federal fire retardant standards developed by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, which requires rigorous and costly testing, has increased the cost and complexity of manufacturing our products and may adversely impact the speed and cost of product development efforts. Further, our manufacturing, distribution, delivery and other business operations and facilities are subject to additional federal, state or local laws or regulations including supply chain transparency, conflict minerals sourcing and disclosure, end-of-life disposal and recycling requirements, transportation and other laws or regulations relating to environmental protection and health and safety requirements, including COVID-19 safety and prevention.
As a retailer, we are subject to additional laws and regulations that apply to retailers generally and govern the marketing and sale of our products and the operation of both our retail stores and our e-commerce activities. Many of the statutory and regulatory requirements that impact our retail and e-commerce operations are consumer-focused and pertain to activities such as our promotions, advertising claims, pricing, credit-based promotional offers, truth-in-advertising, privacy, “do not call/mail” requirements, text messaging requirements, warranty disclosure, delivery timing requirements, accessibility and similar requirements.
Our operations are subject to federal, state and local labor laws including, but not limited to, those relating to occupational health and safety, employee privacy, wage and hour, overtime pay, harassment and discrimination, equal opportunity and employee leaves and benefits. We are also subject to existing and emerging federal and state laws relating to data security and privacy.
It is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements. Our procedures and internal controls are designed to promote such compliance.
Seasonality
Our business is modestly impacted by seasonal influences inherent in the U.S. bedding industry and general retail shopping patterns. The U.S. bedding industry generally experiences lower sales demand in the second quarter of the calendar year and increased sales demand during selected holiday or promotional periods.
Working Capital
We are able to operate with minimal working capital requirements because we sell directly to customers, utilize both “make-to-order” and “make-to-stock” production processes and operate retail stores that serve mainly as showrooms. We have historically generated sufficient cash flows to self-fund operations through an accelerated cash-conversion cycle. Our Credit Agreement provides a revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes with net aggregate availability of $825 million. The Credit Agreement contains an accordion feature that allows us to increase the amount of the credit facility from $825 million up to $1.2 billion in total availability, subject to Lenders’ approval. The Credit Agreement matures in December 2026.
Qualified customers are offered revolving credit to finance purchases through a private-label consumer credit facility provided by Synchrony Bank. Approximately 50% of our net sales in 2021 were financed by Synchrony Bank. Our current agreement with Synchrony Bank expires December 31, 2023, subject to earlier termination upon certain events. We pay Synchrony Bank a fee for extended credit promotional financing offers. Under the terms of our agreement, Synchrony Bank sets the minimum acceptable credit ratings, interest rates, fees and all other terms and conditions of the customers’ accounts, including collection policies and procedures. As the receivables are owned by Synchrony Bank, at no time are the receivables purchased or acquired from us. We are not liable to Synchrony Bank for our customers’ credit defaults. In connection with all purchases financed under these arrangements, Synchrony Bank pays us an amount equal to the total amount of such purchases, net of promotional related discounts, upon delivery to the customer. Customers that do not qualify for credit under our agreement with Synchrony Bank may apply for credit under a secondary program that we offer through another provider.

Human Capital
Grounded in our shared values of passion, integrity, innovation, courage and teamwork, and guided by our purpose to improve society’s health and wellbeing through higher quality sleep, our team members are highly engaged and make a difference in the world every day. With sleep at the center, our culture supports the wellbeing of our team members across the pillars of physical, emotional, financial, career and community, and connects their work to the Sleep Number mission and goals. We celebrate individuality in each other, in our own lives and in our customers’ lives. We embrace every individual’s unique talents, perspectives and experiences, and strive to create an environment where we can each be our best selves. Valuing diversity, equity and inclusion makes us stronger, smarter and fuels our innovation and teamwork.
At January 1, 2022, we employed a total of 5,515 team members, of which 145 were classified as part-time and 110 were employed on a temporary basis. The breakdown of team members by area was as follows: 2,487 in retail sales and support, 1,054 in field services, 415 in customer service, 642 in manufacturing and logistics, and 917 in technology, corporate, management and administrative positions.
Our holistic approach to talent management, designed to attract, motivate, develop, reward and retain the right talent is critical to the execution of our consumer innovation strategy. We sustain our inclusive culture built on individuality and wellbeing by providing an exceptional team member experience, offering ample opportunities for professional learning and advancement. Our leaders are deeply committed to the success of our talent management approach and we hold ourselves accountable by routinely measuring our progress on a variety of elements and metrics including:
•Retention: To advance brand awareness, increase overall candidate traffic and diverse hiring, and improve retention strategies, we track numerous talent recruitment, retention and turnover metrics, including new hires on a monthly, quarterly and rolling 12-month basis;
•Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI): We maintain a dashboard that tracks race/ethnicity and gender by job grade, tenure and generation to provide increased visibility to leaders across our Company on progress toward key goals. We also measure and report a team member inclusion and belonging index, and conduct a self-identification survey to learn how our team members identify and how they want to be appreciated as individuals;
•Engagement: We have a continuous listening strategy to ensure we stay connected to the voice of our team members at critical times of the team member experience. The key survey touchpoints are at new hire, pulse check-in, annual engagement and exit, enabling leaders to monitor team member sentiment and course-correct in real time as appropriate;
•Performance Management: We utilize our human capital management (HCM) system to track and follow team member performance assessments and development plans. We use our HCM system to monitor the completion of learning courses for our team members. Our enterprise learning management system provides all team members access to an equitable learning and training curriculum that is dynamic and mobile-accessible;
•Safety: We have a commitment to maintain a safety-first mindset at Sleep Number. We have policies and practices that create clear expectations for how each team member contributes to a safe and healthy workplace. We collect and monitor workplace injury and accident information across all our locations and take appropriate steps to reduce incident rates, number of workers’ compensation claims and lost workdays. We also evolved our health and safety policies during the year to ensure the safety of our team members and customers by reducing the risk of contracting or spreading the coronavirus; and
•Total Rewards: We benchmark and review, at least annually, all aspects of our total rewards program for team members. Our rewards offering is unique because all team members participate in some type of variable pay program (e.g., bonus, commissions) in addition to base pay. Recognizing the increasingly competitive environment for talent, we continue to enhance our benefits and wellbeing resources to maintain a strong team member value proposition.

Social Impact Commitment
We are committed to leveraging the power of sleep, and sleep science, to improve lives and create a healthier, kinder, more inclusive world. To further support this commitment and amplify our positive community impact, we are honored to partner with several national organizations to fulfill our purpose of improving the health and wellbeing of society through higher quality sleep. The strength of our purpose meets the needs of military personnel, children and adults facing health challenges and families in transition, including: 
•MAKE-A-WISH, with its mission to create life-changing wishes for children with critical illnesses, is one of the nation’s most beloved nonprofit organizations. During the past year, Sleep Number partnered with Make-A-Wish, granting bedroom makeover wishes – complete with Sleep Number 360 smart beds – for immunocompromised children, helping them find comfort and sanctuary in the benefits of quality sleep while at home. In addition, Sleep Number customers – our Smart Sleeper℠ community members – were given the opportunity to donate their InnerCircle℠ Rewards to purchase additional product for “Wish kids.”
•BLUE STAR FAMILIES is a nonprofit devoted to strengthening military families by connecting them with supportive individuals and organizations within their communities. Sleep Number has partnered with Blue Star Families for seven years, providing monetary support for the organization and the gift of quality sleep to the families of those who serve and sacrifice for our country.
•GENYOUth, an organization whose programming reaches 38 million students annually in 73,000 U.S. schools, is devoted to helping students live healthfully and raise their academic achievement. In 2021, Sleep Number partnered with GENYOUth to educate at-risk middle schoolers about the importance of quality sleep. 
•My Very Own Bed is a Minnesota-based non-profit that provides new beds and bedding to children of families who have recently transitioned into more stable housing, helping their new house feel more like a home and supporting their health and wellbeing through improved sleep.
•Bridging, a nonprofit organization primarily serving the Twin Cities area that provides donated furniture and household goods to families and individuals transitioning out of homelessness and poverty, by providing sheets, pillows and blankets.
•Let’s Sleep! Webinars, championed by the nonprofit Start School Later - a nonprofit that aims to help communities ensure safe, healthy school hours and provide sleep education programs for students and school communities - by sponsoring a monthly webinar for educators and school administrators about the importance of sleep and sharing 360 smart bed data to reinforce the information. Sleep Number also sponsored the creation of an online resource for parents of teens to help them access videos, articles and lectures featuring sleep experts to help their family achieve better sleep.
•Dream Foundation, a national organization serving terminally-ill adults and their families by providing end-of-life dreams that offer inspiration, comfort and closure, by providing smart beds and once-in-a-lifetime NFL experiences to terminal patients.
Our social impact extends beyond philanthropic partnerships. We announced a long-term partnership with the AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY to enable cancer research and prevention tied explicitly to quality sleep, as well as to provide support for patients and caregivers who need sleep to bolster their physical, mental and emotional resilience. And through our collaboration with MAYO CLINIC, Sleep Number continues to advance sleep science research and enhance our understanding of sleep's impact on cardiovascular health. In 2021, we provided funding for Mayo Clinic to conduct several multi-year studies, two of which particularly demonstrated our societal impact:
•A study that will investigate the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea and determine the presence of comorbid cardiovascular diseases in U.S. patients of Somali descent, a large and growing population in Minnesota, which is also home to both Sleep Number and Mayo Clinic headquarters; and 
•A study that will explore the relationship between disrupted sleep and markers of aging to test the hypotheses that disrupted or inadequate sleep and sleepiness are indicative of older biological age and may contribute to the acceleration of the aging process.
As part of our commitment to team member wellbeing and the health of our communities, Sleep Number also encourages team members to become involved in their local communities by volunteering their time and talents in support of causes or organizations that inspire them. Our leaders who participate on the board of directors of a qualified nonprofit are eligible to apply for a grant of up to $1,500 per calendar year that benefits the organization.
