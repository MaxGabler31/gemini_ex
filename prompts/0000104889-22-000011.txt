Item 1. Business.
Graham Holdings Company (the Company) is a diversified education and media company whose operations include educational services; television broadcasting; online, podcast, print and local TV news; manufacturing; home health and hospice care; and automotive dealerships. The Company’s Kaplan, Inc. (Kaplan) subsidiary provides a wide variety of educational services, both domestically and outside the United States (U.S.). The Company’s media operations comprise the ownership and operation of television broadcasting (through the ownership and operation of seven television broadcast stations) plus Slate and Foreign Policy magazines; City Cast, a daily local news podcast and newsletter company; and Pinna, an ad-free audio streaming service for children. The Company’s manufacturing companies comprise the ownership of a supplier of pressure treated wood, an electrical solutions company, a manufacturer of lifting solutions, and a supplier of certain parts used in electric utilities and industrial systems. The Company’s home health and hospice operations provide home health, hospice and palliative services. The Company’s automotive business comprise four dealerships. The Company also owns restaurants, a custom framing company, a cybersecurity training company, a marketing solutions provider, a customer data and analytics software company, and a consumer internet company that builds creator-driven brands in lifestyle, home and art design categories.
Financial information concerning the principal segments of the Company’s business for the past three fiscal years is contained in Note 19 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Revenues for each segment are shown in Note 19 gross of intersegment sales. Consolidated revenues are reported net of intersegment sales, which did not exceed 0.1% of consolidated operating revenues.
The Company’s operations in geographic areas outside the U.S. consist primarily of Kaplan’s non-U.S. operations. During each of the fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, these operations accounted for approximately 22%, 22% and 24%, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated revenues, and the identifiable assets attributable to non-U.S. operations represented approximately 19% and 21% of the Company’s consolidated assets at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
EDUCATION
Kaplan, a subsidiary of the Company, provides an extensive range of education and related services worldwide for students and professionals. In 2021, Kaplan served approximately 700,000 students and professionals worldwide and had associations with approximately 12,300 companies and commercial relationships with approximately 4,000 universities, colleges, schools and school districts across the globe. Kaplan conducts its operations through three segments: Kaplan North America Higher Education, Kaplan North America Supplemental Education and Kaplan International. As more fully described below, Kaplan consolidated its former Kaplan Higher Education, Kaplan Test Preparation and Kaplan Professional segments into one business, Kaplan North America, operating through two segments, Higher Education and Supplemental Education. In addition, the results of the Kaplan Corporate segment include results of Kaplan’s investment activities in education technology companies. The following table presents revenues for each of Kaplan’s segments:

 | Year Ended December 31
(in thousands) | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019
Kaplan International | $ | 726,875 | | | $ | 653,892 | | $ | 750,245 
Kaplan North America Higher Education | 317,854 | | | 316,095 | | | 305,672
Kaplan North America Supplemental Education | 309,069 | | | 327,087 | | | 388,814
Kaplan Corporate and Intersegment Eliminations | 7,447 | | | 8,639 | | | 7,019 
Total Kaplan Revenue | $ | 1,361,245 | | | $ | 1,305,713 | | $ | 1,451,750

In 2020, Kaplan combined its three segments based in the United States (Kaplan Higher Education, Kaplan Test Preparation and Kaplan Professional) into one business known as Kaplan North America. The combination reinforces Kaplan’s interconnected products and services, increases competitiveness in Kaplan’s markets and drives efficiencies. 
Kaplan International
Kaplan International (KI) operates businesses in Europe and the Middle East, North America and the Asia Pacific region, each of which is discussed below. 
Europe and the Middle East. In Europe, KI operates the following businesses, all of which are based in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Ireland: Kaplan UK, KI Pathways, Kaplan Languages Group, Mander Portman Woodward, 
Dublin Business School, Kaplan Open Learning and BridgeU. In the Middle East, Kaplan Middle East is based in the United Arab Emirates.
The Kaplan UK business in Europe, through Kaplan Financial Limited, is a provider of apprenticeship training and test preparation services for accounting and financial services professionals, including those studying for ACCA, CIMA and ICAEW qualifications. In 2021, Kaplan UK provided courses to over 47,000 students in accountancy and financial services. In addition, Kaplan UK has been the sole authorized assessment provider for the Solicitors Regulation Authority of assessments under The Qualified Lawyers Transfer Scheme for candidates seeking to become solicitors of England and Wales who are already qualified lawyers in certain recognized jurisdictions. In 2021 Kaplan UK became the sole authorized assessment provider for the Solicitors Qualifying Examination for all candidates seeking to become a solicitor in England and Wales. Kaplan UK is headquartered in London, England, and has 19 training centers located throughout the U.K.
The KI Pathways business offers academic preparation programs especially designed for international students who wish to study for degrees from universities in English-speaking countries. In 2021, university preparation programs were delivered in Australia, Japan, Myanmar, Singapore and the U.K.
The Kaplan Languages Group business provides English-language training, academic preparation programs and test preparation for English proficiency exams, principally for students wishing to study and travel in English-speaking countries. As of December 31, 2021, the Kaplan Languages Group operated 19 English-language schools, with 12 located in the U.K., Ireland and Canada and seven located in the U.S. In 2021, the Kaplan Languages Group served approximately 10,300 students for in-class and online English-language instruction. Through the Alpadia language schools located in France, Germany and Switzerland, Kaplan Languages Group also offers adolescents (from 16+) and adults, French and German language training. Alpadia also operates language camps for juniors (from 8+) and teens during the fall, spring and summer seasons in the U.K., France, Germany and Switzerland. 
Mander Portman Woodward (MPW) is a U.K. independent sixth-form college that prepares domestic and international students for A-level examinations that are required for admission to U.K. universities. MPW operates three colleges, in London, Cambridge and Birmingham. 
KI also operates Dublin Business School in Ireland, a higher education institution, and Kaplan Open Learning in the U.K., an online learning institution. At the end of 2021, these institutions enrolled an aggregate of approximately 10,400 students. 
In 2021, Kaplan Middle East, a financial training business operating in Dubai, United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, taught approximately 3,900 students.
U.K. Immigration Regulations. Certain KI businesses serve a significant number of international students; therefore, the ability to sponsor international students to come to the U.K. is critical to these businesses. Pursuant to regulations administered by the United Kingdom Visas and Immigration Department (UKVI), the KI Pathways business is required to hold or operate Student Route sponsorship licenses for international students to be permitted to enter the U.K. to study the courses that KI Pathways delivers. One of the Kaplan Languages Group schools also has a Student Route license to enable it to teach international students, although students at these schools generally choose to enter the U.K. on a Visitor or Short Term Student visa as opposed to a Student Route visa. 
Each Student Route license holder is required to have passed the annual Basic Compliance Assessment (BCA) and hold Educational Oversight accreditation, which requires a current and satisfactory full risk assessment, audit or review by the appropriate academic standards body. For the tenth consecutive year, all KI institutions have retained Educational Oversight accreditation, with high grades across colleges, and all Student Route annual BCA renewals have been approved with high scores in the core measurable requirements. Kaplan Languages Group has one U.K. English-language school listed on the Kaplan Student master license. The MPW schools each hold current Student and Child Student Route licenses and have performed well consistently, with good records in their Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills (OFSTED) and Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI) Educational Oversight inspections.
The Higher Education and Research Act 2017 (HERA) significantly reformed the regulation of the higher education sector in the U.K., including the formation of a new regulator for England, the Office for Students (OfS). Students enrolled at Pathways institutions registered with the OfS are, subject to the institution meeting certain compliance requirements, given many of the same student privileges as students of universities in the U.K. All of KI’s other higher education businesses in the U.K., excluding Glasgow International College and University of York International Pathway College, retained registration with the OfS in 2021 to ensure that they could continue operating and retain their Student Route sponsor licenses and/or continue to accept students funded by U.K. student loans. Glasgow International College, which is located in Scotland, is not regulated by the OfS and remains overseen by the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA). The University of York International 
Pathway College forms part of the University of York’s OfS registration. No assurance can be given that each KI business in the U.K. will be able to maintain its Student Route or Child Student route license and Educational Oversight or OfS/QAA registration. Maintenance of each of these approvals requires compliance with several core metrics that may be difficult to sustain. The loss by one or more institutions of either the Student Route or Child Student route license or Educational Oversight or OfS/QAA registration would have a material adverse effect on KI Europe’s operating results.
Impact of Brexit. On June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved a proposal that the U.K. leave the European Union (EU), commonly referred to as “Brexit.” The U.K.’s withdrawal became effective on December 31, 2020. The impact of Brexit on KI over time will depend on the long-term effects of the terms of the U.K.’s withdrawal from the EU. If the U.K. is no longer viewed as a favorable study destination, KI’s ability to recruit international students will be adversely impacted, which would materially adversely affect KI’s results of operations and cash flows. In November 2021, the EU granted the U.K. an adequacy decision under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for an initial period of four years. 
Revised U.K. immigration rules became effective on January 1, 2021, as the Brexit transition was completed. All international students, including EEA and Swiss students studying in the U.K. for more than six months, are required to obtain a Student Route visa unless they are undertaking an English language course in which case they can apply for a Visit Visa for up to six months or a Short Term Study visa of up to 11 months. Free movement ceased between the EEA (together with Switzerland) and the U.K.; students from these countries entering the U.K. are now subject to the same U.K. immigration rules as students from outside the EEA and Switzerland. EEA and Swiss nationals commencing a higher education course in England from August 2021 no longer qualify for home fee status or have access to financial support from Student Finance England. It is unclear how international student recruitment agents and prospective international students view the U.K. as a study destination after the introduction of any new immigration requirements, and the U.K.’s exit from the EU. The introduction of revised immigration rules has historically increased, and may continue to increase, KI’s operating costs in the U.K. The introduction of new visa and other administrative requirements for entry into the U.K., Brexit and the perception of the U.K. as a less favorable study destination may have a materially adverse impact on KI’s ability to recruit international students and KI’s results of operations and cash flows. 
Asia Pacific. In the Asia Pacific region, Kaplan operates businesses primarily in Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and the People’s Republic of China, including the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Hong Kong).
In Singapore, Kaplan operates two business units: Kaplan Higher Education and KHEA-Genesis (which comprises the former Kaplan Financial and Kaplan Professional business units). During 2021, the Kaplan Higher Education and KHEA-Genesis (Financial) divisions served more than 9,100 students from Singapore and approximately 3,400 students from other countries throughout Asia and Western Europe. KHEA-Genesis (Professional) provided short courses to approximately 400 professionals, managers, executives and businesspeople in 2021.
Kaplan Singapore’s Higher Education business provides students with the opportunity to earn bachelor’s and postgraduate degrees in various fields on either a part-time or full-time basis. Kaplan Singapore’s students receive degrees from affiliated educational institutions in Australia, Ireland and the U.K. In addition, this division offers pre-university and diploma programs.
Kaplan Singapore’s KHEA-Genesis (Financial) business provides preparatory courses for professional qualifications in accountancy and finance, such as the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) and Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA). Kaplan Singapore’s Professional business, through Kaplan Learning Institute, an authorized SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) Approved Training Organization (ATO), provided professionals with various skills training through workforce skills qualifications (WSQ) courses. Kaplan Learning Institute ceased offering such courses and voluntarily deregistered Kaplan Learning Institute as a private education institution on March 9, 2020, following a notice in June 2019 from SSG suspending Kaplan Singapore Professional’s WSQ ATO status and revoking accreditation and funding for all WSQ courses effective July 1, 2019. These actions have adversely affected and will continue to adversely affect Kaplan Singapore’s revenues and operating results. 
On October 7, 2020, Kaplan Higher Education Academy (KHEA) was granted approval by SSG to deliver WSQ courses as an ATO for a period of two years. KHEA-Genesis (Professional) started offering WSQ courses in the second quarter of 2021.
In June 2021, the Committee for Private Education (CPE) in Singapore instructed Kaplan Singapore to cease new enrollments for three marketing diploma programs on both a full and part-time basis due to noncompliance with minimum entry level requirements for admission and to teach out existing students in these programs. On August 23, 2021, the CPE issued the same instructions with respect to the Kaplan Foundation diploma and four information technology diploma programs on both a full and part-time basis. In November 2021, the CPE issued the same instructions with respect to a further 23 full-time or part-time diploma programs. Post regulatory action, Kaplan Singapore is currently still able to offer 449 programs that are registered with the CPE, out of which there are 16 diplomas, 361 bachelors and the balance of which are certificate and postgraduate courses. Kaplan Singapore will 
apply for re-registration of diploma programs in 2022. The impact from regulatory actions by the CPE will have a significant adverse impact on Kaplan Singapore’s revenues, operating results and cash flows in the future. No assurance can be given that applications for re-registration of the impacted programs will be successful. An inability to re-register one or more impacted programs could have a further material adverse effect on Kaplan Singapore’s revenues, operating results and cash flows.
In Australia, Kaplan delivers a broad range of financial services programs from certificate level through master’s level, together with professional development offerings through Kaplan Professional, as well as higher education programs in business, accounting, business analytics, hospitality, and tourism and management through Kaplan Business School. In 2021, these businesses provided courses to approximately 4,500 students through face-to-face and online or hybrid classroom programs (within Kaplan Business School) and approximately 30,000 students through online or distance-learning programs offered by Kaplan Professional. In 2021, Kaplan Professional also had approximately 34,000 subscribers for Ontrack, its continuing professional development platform for financial services professionals.
Kaplan Australia’s English-language business, which operates across five locations in Australia and one location in New Zealand, taught approximately 300 students in 2021. In July 2021, after the last student completed their course, the New Zealand English language business suspended its operations indefinitely. During 2021, due to the ongoing border closure, the Australian English businesses faced significant falls in student numbers leading to a consolidation of the four schools into one, with just the Sydney school offering online classes to a small number of remaining students. The Kaplan Australia Pathways business is also part of KI Pathways. In 2021, it consisted of Murdoch Institute of Technology, the University of Newcastle College of International Education and the University of Adelaide College, and offered face-to-face pathways and foundational education in 2021 to approximately 1,000 students wishing to enter Murdoch University, the University of Newcastle and the University of Adelaide. The contract with Murdoch University to run the Murdoch Institute of Technology expired in June 2021. In January 2021, Kaplan Australia launched the University of Newcastle College of International Education, as part of a seven-year collaboration with the University of Newcastle. In March 2021, the University of Adelaide College commenced delivery of teaching. In October 2021, Kaplan International New Zealand obtained approval to establish a new pathways college, Massey University College, which is scheduled to begin diploma and graduate diploma courses in July and October 2022, respectively. Kaplan Australia also owns Red Marker Pty Ltd., a machine learning and artificial intelligence-based provider of legal risk detection for digital, advertising and marketing content. Red Marker supports a wide variety of industries, including financial services, telecoms, automotive, pharmaceutical, food and beverage, media and government bodies. Red Marker’s Artemis product detects potentially noncompliant content as it is being created, helping advisers and licensees to identify and remediate compliance risks. 
In Hong Kong, Kaplan operates three main business units: Kaplan Financial, Kaplan Language Training and Kaplan Higher Education, serving approximately 10,600 students annually. 
Kaplan Hong Kong’s Financial division delivers preparatory courses to approximately 8,900 students and business executives wishing to earn professional qualifications in accountancy, financial markets designations and other professional fields.
Hong Kong’s Language Training division offers test preparation for both overseas study and college applications, including TOEFL, IELTS, SAT and GMAT, to approximately 500 students.
Kaplan Hong Kong’s Higher Education division offers both full-time and part-time programs to approximately 1,200 students studying for degrees from leading Western universities. Students earn doctorate, master’s and bachelor’s degrees in Hong Kong. Kaplan also offers a proprietary pre-college diploma program through the Kaplan Business and Accountancy School.
In 2014, Kaplan Holdings Limited (Hong Kong) signed a joint venture agreement with CITIC Press Corporation. Under the terms of the agreement, the parties incorporated a joint venture company, Kaplan CITIC Education Co. Limited, 49% of which is owned by Kaplan Holdings Limited. The joint venture company is carrying out publishing and distribution of Kaplan Financial training products in the People’s Republic of China. 
Each of Kaplan’s international businesses is subject to unique and often complex regulatory environments in the countries in which they operate, and the degree of consistency in the application and interpretation of such regulations can vary significantly in certain jurisdictions.
Kaplan North America
As previously discussed, in 2020 Kaplan combined its segments into one business named Kaplan North America (KNA), comprised of two segments, Kaplan North America Higher Education (comprising primarily former Kaplan Higher Education (KHE) products and services) and Kaplan North America Supplemental Education (comprising primarily former Kaplan Test Preparation (KTP) and former Kaplan Professional (KP) products and services).
Kaplan North America Higher Education 
Until March 22, 2018, through the KHE segment, Kaplan provided postsecondary education services to students through Kaplan University’s (KU) online and fixed-facility colleges. KU provided a wide array of certificate, diploma and degree programs designed to meet the needs of students seeking to advance their education and career goals. On March 22, 2018, certain subsidiaries of Kaplan contributed the institutional assets and operations of KU to a new university: an Indiana nonprofit, public-benefit corporation affiliated with Purdue University, known as Purdue University Global (Purdue Global). As part of the transfer to Purdue Global, KU transferred students, academic personnel, faculty and operations, property leases for KU’s campuses and learning centers, and Kaplan-owned academic curricula and content related to KU courses. Kaplan also indemnified Purdue for certain pre-closing liabilities. At the same time, KU and Purdue Global entered into a Transition and Operations Support Agreement, which was amended on July 29, 2019 (TOSA), pursuant to which KNA provides key non-academic operations support to Purdue Global. Kaplan received nominal upfront cash consideration upon the transfer of the institutional assets and operations of KU. The combination of the KHE, KTP and KP segments into one KNA business did not change Kaplan’s or Purdue Global’s obligations under the TOSA.
The transfer of KU did not include any of the assets of the KU School of Professional and Continuing Education (now managed by KNA), which provides professional training and exam preparation for professional certifications and licensures. The transfer also did not include the transfer of other Kaplan businesses.
KNA also provides non-academic operations support services for online pre-college, certificate, undergraduate and graduate programs to institutions such as Purdue University, Wake Forest University, and Lynn University. These are the same types of services and operations previously provided by the KHE segment which is now a part of the KNA business. 
Transition and Operations Support Agreement (TOSA). Purdue Global operates largely online as an Indiana public university affiliated with Purdue University. The operations support activities that KNA provides to Purdue Global (and other institutions of higher education, including Purdue University) include technology support, help-desk functions, human resources support for transferred faculty and employees, admissions support, financial aid processing, marketing and advertising, back-office business functions, certain test preparation, and domestic and international student recruiting services.
Pursuant to the TOSA, KNA is not entitled to receive any reimbursement of costs incurred in providing support functions, or any fee, unless and until Purdue Global has first covered all of its operating costs (subject to a cap). If Purdue Global achieves cost efficiencies in its operations, KNA may be entitled to an additional payment equal to 20% of such cost efficiencies (Purdue Efficiency Payment). In addition, during each of Purdue Global’s first five years, prior to any payment to KNA, Purdue Global is entitled to a priority payment of $10 million per year beyond costs (Purdue Priority Payment). To the extent that Purdue Global’s revenue is insufficient to pay the Purdue Priority Payment, KNA is required to advance an amount to Purdue Global to cover such insufficiency. Upon closing of the transaction, Kaplan paid to Purdue Global an advance in the amount of $20 million, representing, and in lieu of, a Purdue Priority Payment for each of the fiscal years ending June 30, 2019, and June 30, 2020.
To the extent that there is sufficient revenue to pay the Purdue Efficiency Payment, Purdue Global will be reimbursed for its operating costs (subject to a cap) and will be paid the Purdue Priority Payment. To the extent that there is remaining revenue, KNA will then be reimbursed for its operating costs (subject to a cap) of providing the support activities. If KNA achieves cost efficiencies in its operations, then KNA may be entitled to an additional payment equal to 20% of such cost efficiencies (KNA Efficiency Payment). The TOSA, as amended, reflects the parties’ intent that, subject to available cash (calculated as cash balance minus cash deficiencies, if any, projected for the next six-month period based on applicable budget), KNA is entitled to receive a fee equal to 12.5% (increasing to 13% from June 30, 2023, through June 30, 2027) of Purdue Global’s revenue, which served as the deferred purchase price for the transfer of KU (Deferred Purchase Price). Separately, KNA is entitled to a fee for services provided equal to 8% of KNA’s costs of providing such services to Purdue Global (Contributor Service Fee). KNA’s Contributor Service Fee is deducted from any amounts owed to KNA for the Deferred Purchase Price. Together these payments are known as “Contributor Compensation.” In each case, the Contributor Compensation remains subject to available cash and the limitations of payment carry over from year to year.
After the first five years of the TOSA, KNA and Purdue Global will be entitled to payments in a manner consistent with the structure described above, except that (i) Purdue Global will no longer be entitled to the Purdue Priority Payment and (ii) to the extent that there are sufficient revenues after payment of the KNA Efficiency Payment (if any), Purdue Global will be entitled to an annual payment equal to 10% of the remaining revenue after the KNA Efficiency Payment (if any) is paid, subject to certain other adjustments.
The TOSA has a 30-year initial term, which will automatically renew for five-year periods unless terminated. After the sixth year, Purdue Global has the right to terminate the agreement upon payment of an early termination fee equal to 125% of Purdue Global’s total revenue earned during the preceding 12-month period, which payment would be made pursuant to a 10-year note, and at the election of Purdue Global, it may receive for no additional 
consideration certain tangible assets used by KNA exclusively to provide the support activities pursuant to the TOSA. At the end of the 30-year term, if Purdue Global does not renew the TOSA, Purdue Global will be obligated to make a final payment of 75% of its total revenue earned during the preceding 12-month period, which payment will be made pursuant to a 10-year note, and at the election of Purdue Global, it may receive for no additional consideration certain assets used by KNA exclusively to provide the support activities pursuant to the TOSA. Either party may terminate the TOSA at any time if Purdue Global generates (i) $25 million in cash operating losses for three consecutive years or (ii) aggregate cash operating losses greater than $75 million at any point during the initial term. Operating loss is defined as the amount by which the sum of (1) Purdue Global’s and KNA’s respective costs in performing academic and support functions and (2) the $10 million Purdue Priority Payment in each of the first five years following March 22, 2018, exceeds the revenue Purdue Global generates for the applicable fiscal year. Upon termination for any reason, Purdue Global will retain the assets that Kaplan contributed pursuant to the TOSA. Each party also has certain termination rights in connection with a material default or material breach of the TOSA by the other party. Short of termination, Purdue Global has the right to take over (in-source) certain back-office support functions at any time with nine-months’ notice. Those include technology support, human resources, facility and property management, finance and accounting, communications, and default management. In 2022 Purdue Global began working with KNA to provide certain human resources, finance and accounting, facility management, and communications services itself, in-house.
Regulatory Environment. KNA no longer owns or operates KU or any other institution participating in student financial aid programs created under Title IV of the U.S. Federal Higher Education Act of 1965 (Higher Education Act), as amended (Title IV). KNA provides services to Purdue Global, Purdue University, Wake Forest University, Lynn University and other Title IV participating institutions that may require KNA to comply with certain laws and regulations, including applicable statutory provisions of Title IV. KNA also provides financial aid services to Purdue Global and, as such, meets the definition of a “third-party servicer” contained in the Title IV regulations to Purdue Global (but no other institution as of the date of this report). As a third-party servicer, KNA is subject to applicable statutory provisions of Title IV and U.S. Department of Education (ED) regulations that, among other things, require KNA to be jointly and severally liable with its Title IV participating client institution(s) to the ED for any violation by such client institution of any Title IV statute or ED regulation or requirement. KNA is also subject to other federal and state laws, including, but not limited to, federal and state consumer protection laws and rules prohibiting unfair or deceptive marketing practices, data privacy, data protection and information security requirements established by federal state and foreign governments, including for example the Federal Trade Commission and the applicable provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act regarding the privacy of student records. KNA’s failure to comply with these and other federal and state laws and regulations could result in adverse consequences to KNA’s business, including, for example:
•The imposition on KNA and/or Kaplan of fines, other sanctions or liabilities, including, without limitation, repayment obligations for Title IV funds to the ED or the termination or limitation on Kaplan’s eligibility to provide services as a third-party servicer to any Title IV participating institution;
•Adverse effects on KNA’s business and results of operations from a reduction or loss in KNA’s revenues under the TOSA or any other agreement with any Title IV participating institution if a client institution loses or has limits placed on its Title IV eligibility, accreditation, operations or state licensure, or is subject to fines, repayment obligations or other adverse actions due to noncompliance by KNA (or the institution) with Title IV, accreditor, federal or state agency requirements; 
•Liability under the TOSA or any other agreement with any Title IV participating institution for noncompliance with federal, state or accreditation requirements arising from KNA’s conduct; and
•Liability for noncompliance with Title IV or other federal or state laws and regulations occurring prior to the transfer of KU to Purdue.
The laws, regulations and other requirements applicable to KNA or any KNA client institutions are subject to change and to interpretation. For example, a Negotiated Rulemaking began in October 2021 that covered, in part, rules related to the borrower defense to repayment adjudication process and recovery from institutions, closed school loan discharges, disability loan discharges, public loan forgiveness, income driven repayment plans and arbitration agreements. As part of this current Rulemaking, in a session that began in January 2022, the ED also proposed a change to the Title IV definition of “Nonprofit” institution to generally exclude from that definition any institution that is an obligor on a debt owed to a former owner of the institution or maintains a revenue-based service agreement with a former owner of the institution. Such regulatory changes as well as those described above could subject Purdue Global to additional regulatory requirements. Any resulting new rules or changes to existing rules are not likely to be effective until July 1, 2023.
Incentive compensation. Under the ED’s incentive compensation rule, an institution participating in Title IV programs may not provide any commission, bonus or other incentive payment to any person or entity engaged in any student recruiting or admission activities or in making decisions regarding the awarding of Title IV funds if such 
payment is based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid. KNA is a third party providing bundled services to Title IV participating institutions that include recruiting and, in the case of Purdue Global, financial aid services. As such, KNA is also subject to the incentive compensation rules as applied to the institutions it serves and cannot provide any commission, bonus or other incentive payment to any covered employees, subcontractors or other parties engaged in certain student recruiting, admission or financial aid activities based on success in securing enrollments or financial aid. In addition, tuition revenue sharing payments to KNA under the TOSA (as well as any other agreement with any Title IV participating institution) must comply with revenue sharing guidance provided by the ED related to bundled services agreements. For more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. Failure to Comply with the ED’s Title IV Incentive Compensation Rule Could Subject Kaplan to Liabilities, Sanctions and Fines.
Misrepresentations. A Title IV participating institution is required to comply with the ED regulations related to misrepresentations and with related federal and state laws. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and may extend to statements by servicers, such as KNA, that provide marketing or certain other services to such institutions. The laws and regulations may also apply to KNA’s employees and agents, with respect to statements addressing the nature of an institution’s programs, financial charges or the employability of its graduates. Additionally, failure to comply with these and other federal and state laws and regulations regarding misrepresentations and marketing practices could result in the imposition on KNA or its client institutions of fines, other sanctions or liabilities, including, without limitation, federal student aid repayment obligations to the ED, the termination or limitation on KNA’s eligibility to provide services as a third-party servicer to Title IV participating institutions, the termination or limitation of a client institution’s eligibility to participate in the Title IV programs, or legal action by students or other third parties. A violation of misrepresentation regulations or other federal or state laws and regulations applicable to the services KNA provides to its client institutions arising out of statements by KNA, its employees or agents could require KNA to pay the costs associated with indemnifying its client institutions from applicable losses resulting from the violation and could result in fines, other sanctions or liabilities imposed on KNA.
Compliance by client institutions with Title IV program requirements and other federal, state and accreditation requirements.  KNA currently provides services to education institutions that are heavily regulated by federal and state laws and regulations and subject to extensive accrediting body requirements. Presently, a material portion of KNA’s revenues are attributable to deferred purchase and service fees it receives under the TOSA, which are dependent upon revenues generated by Purdue Global and dependent upon Purdue Global’s eligibility to participate in the Title IV federal student aid program. To maintain Title IV eligibility, Purdue Global and KNA’s other client institutions must be certified by the ED as eligible institutions, maintain authorizations by applicable state education agencies and be accredited by an accrediting commission recognized by the ED. Purdue Global and KNA’s other client institutions must also comply with the extensive statutory and regulatory requirements of the Higher Education Act and other state and federal laws and accrediting standards relating to their financial aid management, educational programs, financial strength, disbursement and return of Title IV funds, facilities, recruiting practices, representations made by the school and other parties, and various other matters. Additionally, Purdue Global and other client institutions are subject to laws and regulations that, among other things, limit student default rates on the repayment of Title IV loans, permit borrower defenses to repayment of Title IV loans based on certain conduct of the institution, establish specific measures of financial responsibility and administrative capability, regulate the addition of new campuses and programs and other institutional changes; require compliance with state professional licensure board requirements to the extent applicable to institutional programs and require state authorization and institutional and programmatic accreditation. If the ED finds that Purdue Global or other client institutions have failed to comply with Title IV requirements or improperly disbursed or retained Title IV program funds, it may take one or more of a number of actions, including, but not limited to:
•fining the school;
•requiring the school to repay Title IV program funds;
•limiting or terminating the school’s eligibility to participate in Title IV programs; 
•initiating an emergency action to suspend the school’s participation in Title IV programs without prior notice or opportunity for a hearing;
•transferring the school to a method of Title IV payment that would adversely affect the timing of the institution’s receipt of Title IV funds; 
•requiring the school to submit a letter of credit; 
•denying or refusing to consider the school’s application for renewal of its certification to participate in the Title IV programs or for approval to add a new campus or educational program; and
•referring the matter for possible civil or criminal investigation.
If Purdue Global or other client institutions lose or have limits placed on their Title IV eligibility, accreditation or state licensure, or if they are subject to fines, repayment obligations or other adverse actions due to their or KNA’s noncompliance with Title IV regulations, accreditor or state agency requirements or other state or federal laws, KNA’s financial results of operations could be adversely affected. After acquiring KU, on August 3, 2018, Purdue Global received an updated Provisional Program Participation Agreement (PPPA) from the ED which is necessary for continued participation in the federal Title IV programs after the change in ownership from Kaplan to Purdue. The PPPA expired on June 30, 2021, but continues in effect until the ED issues the final approved Program Participation Agreement. On October 15, 2021, Purdue Global received from the ED a new PPPA granting provisional certification until June 30, 2022. Under this PPPA, Purdue Global must apply for and receive approval for expansion or any substantial change before it may award, disburse or distribute Title IV funds based on the substantial change. Substantial changes generally include, but are not limited to: (a) establishment of an additional location; (b) increase in the level of academic offering beyond those listed in the institution's Eligibility and Certification Approval Report (ECAR); (c) addition of any educational program (including degree, non-degree or short-term training programs), or (d) the addition of any new degree program. In addition, the institution must pay any liabilities found in a currently open program review prior to the expiration of the PPPA. The provisional certification ends upon the ED's notification to the institution of the ED's decision to grant or deny a six-year certification to participate in the Title IV, Higher Education Act (HEA) programs. 
Compliance, regulatory actions, reviews and litigation. KNA and its client institutions are subject to reviews, audits, investigations and other compliance reviews conducted by various regulatory agencies and auditors, including, among others, the ED, the ED’s Office of the Inspector General, accrediting bodies and state and various other federal agencies. These compliance reviews could result in findings of noncompliance with statutory and regulatory requirements that could, in turn, result in the imposition of fines, liabilities, civil or criminal penalties or other sanctions against KNA and its client institutions. Separately, if KNA provides financial aid services to more than one Title IV participating institution (i.e., one or more participating institutions in addition to Purdue Global), it will be required to arrange for an independent auditor to conduct an annual Title IV compliance audit of KNA’s compliance with applicable ED requirements. KNA’s client institutions are also required to arrange for an independent auditor to conduct an annual Title IV compliance audit of their compliance with applicable ED requirements, including requirements related to services provided by KNA.
On May 6, 2021, Kaplan received a notice from the ED that it would be conducting a fact-finding process pursuant to the borrower defense to repayment (BDTR) regulations to determine the validity of more than 800 BDTR claims and a request for documents related to several of Kaplan’s previously owned schools. Beginning in July 2021, Kaplan started receiving the claims and related information requests. In total, Kaplan received 1,449 borrower defense applications that seek discharge of approximately $35 million in loans. Most claims received are from former KU students. The ED’s process for adjudicating these claims is subject to the borrower defense regulations but it is not clear to what extent the ED will exclude claims based on the underlying statutes of limitations, evidence provided by Kaplan, or any prior investigation related to schools attended by the student applicants. Kaplan believes it has defenses that would bar any student discharge or school liability including that the claims are barred by the applicable statute of limitations, unproven, incomplete and fail to meet regulatory filing requirements. Kaplan expects to vigorously defend any attempt by the ED to hold Kaplan liable for any ultimate student discharges and is responding to all claims with documentary and narrative evidence to refute the allegations, demonstrate their lack of merit, and support the denial of all such claims by the ED. If the claims are successful, the ED may seek reimbursement for the amount discharged from Kaplan. If the ED initiates a reimbursement action against Kaplan following approval of former students’ BDTR applications, Kaplan may be subject to significant liability.
On September 3, 2015, Kaplan sold to Education Corporation of America (ECA) substantially all of the assets of the prior KHE Campuses. The transaction included the transfer of certain real estate leases that were guaranteed or purportedly guaranteed by Kaplan. ECA is currently in receivership, has terminated all of its higher education operations and has sold most, if not all, of its remaining assets (including New England College of Business). Additionally, the receiver has repudiated all of ECA’s real estate leases. Although ECA is required to indemnify Kaplan for any amounts Kaplan must pay due to ECA’s failure to fulfill its obligations under the real estate leases guaranteed by Kaplan, ECA’s current financial condition and the amount of secured and unsecured creditor claims outstanding against ECA make it unlikely that Kaplan will recover from ECA. In the second half of 2018, the Company recorded an estimated $17.5 million in losses on guarantor lease obligations in connection with this transaction in other non-operating expense. The Company recorded an additional estimated $1.1 million in non-operating expense in 2019, $1 million in non-operating expense in 2020, and $1.1 million in non-operating expense in 2021; in each case consisting of legal fees and lease costs. The Company continues to monitor the status of these obligations. 
In addition, Kaplan could be the subject of future compliance reviews or lawsuits related to formerly owned KU and KHE schools in connection with the pre-sale conduct of such schools that could result in monetary liabilities or fines or other sanctions against Kaplan.
Kaplan North America Supplemental Education
In 2021, KNA’s supplemental education included all products of the former KTP and KP segments, including exam preparation, professional licensure and certification, and corporate training and continuing education. KNA offers a wide array of programs and services across various markets focusing on lifetime value creation and professional lifecycles. These markets are discussed below.
Precollege and Social Sciences. KNA provides exam preparation for high school and graduate students under the Kaplan Test Prep, Manhattan Prep and Barron’s Educational Series brands for a broad range of standardized, high-stakes tests, including the SAT, ACT, GMAT and GRE. KNA also provides admissions consulting, tutoring and other advisory services.
Healthcare.  KNA provides exam preparation for the medical college admissions test (MCAT) and professional licensure exam preparation for physicians (USMLE), nurses (NCLEX), pharmacists (NAPLEX), dentists (NBDE) and physician assistants (PANCE). Under the brand i-Human Patients, KNA offers online, simulated patient interaction training for medical health professionals, which is typically purchased by medical, nursing and physician assistant schools. KNA’s USMLE in-person programs are accredited and Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) approved for F-1 students and operate under the Kaplan Prep & Achieve brand. In 2021, KNA acquired a continuing medical education business for physicians, nurses and pharmacists which is accredited by Joint Accreditation for Interprofessional Continuing Education and operated under the brand Projects in Knowledge.
Legal, Government and Social Justice. KNA offers exam preparation for the law school admissions test (LSAT) and state bar licensure exam preparation for lawyers in 50 jurisdictions through Kaplan Bar Review and Preliminary Multistate Bar Review (PMBR). For the military, KNA offers the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) that measures developed abilities and helps predict future academic and occupational success in the military and in 2021, Kaplan acquired Bluejacketeer which offers practice test questions for Navy advancement exams on a subscription basis. 
Business and Financial. Professional licensure products are operated under the brands Dearborn Real Estate Education, Kaplan Real Estate Education, Bob Hogue School of Real Estate, Kaplan Financial Education, and Kaplan Schweser. KNA helps professionals obtain certifications, licenses and designations to enable them to advance their careers. Additionally, KNA collaborates with organizations to solve their talent management challenges through customized corporate learning and development solutions. Through live and online instruction, KNA provides professional license test preparation, licensing and continuing education, as well as leadership and professional development programs to businesses and individuals in the accounting, insurance, securities, real estate, financial services and wealth management areas.
Technology and Engineering. KNA offers data science and analytics online courses and training for corporations under the brand name Metis. In 2022, Metis expects to focus on providing courses and programs to educational institutions for their students rather than direct to student sales. KNA also offers licensing exam preparation for engineers, architects and designers under the brand name PPI. 
Publishing. Kaplan Publishing focuses on Kaplan Test Prep, Barron's, and Manhattan Prep test preparation and reference resources sold through retail channels. At the end of 2021, Kaplan Publishing had 1,182 products available in print and digital formats, including 368 digital products. In total, KNA test prep prepares students for more than 233 standardized tests, the large majority of which are U.S. focused.
In 2021, KNA served over 220,000 students through its exam preparation programs and related products (such as tutoring, online question banks and online practice tests), excluding sales of test prep books by third-party retailers. KNA exam preparation programs are taught online and at Kaplan-branded locations and at numerous other locations, such as hotels, high schools, universities and companies throughout the U.S., including Puerto Rico, as well as in Canada, Mexico and the U.K. KNA also licenses material for certain programs to third parties. Since the end of the first quarter of 2020, virtually all KNA exam preparation programs have been offered online, typically in a live online classroom or a self-study format, while some programs have continued in person. Private tutoring services are provided online and, in select markets, in person. In 2022, KNA expects to offer more in-person courses for select exam preparation offerings. 
In 2021, KNA served approximately 2,700 business-to-business clients including approximately 120 Fortune 500 companies. In 2021, approximately 218,000 students used KNA’s professional licensure exam preparation offerings.

Revenue from broadcasting operations is derived primarily from the sale of advertising time to local, regional and national advertisers. In 2021, advertising revenue accounted for 57.7% of the total for GMG’s operations. Advertising revenue is sensitive to a number of factors, some specific to a particular station or market and others more general in nature. These factors include a station’s audience share and market ranking; seasonal fluctuations in demand for airtime; annual or biannual events, such as sporting events and political elections; and broader economic trends, among others.
Regulation of Broadcasting and Related Matters
GMG’s television broadcasting operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under the U.S. Federal Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Communications Act). Each GMG television station holds an FCC license that is renewable upon application for an eight-year period. As shown in the table above, the current terms of the GMG station licenses expire in 2022 through 2029. GMG expects the FCC to grant future renewal applications for its stations in due course, but cannot provide any assurances that the FCC will do so. 
Digital Television (DTV) and Spectrum Issues.  Each GMG station (and each full-power television station nationwide) broadcasts only in a digital format, which allows transmission of HDTV programming and multiple channels of standard-definition television programming (multicasting). 
Television stations may receive interference from a variety of sources, including interference from other broadcast stations, that is below a threshold established by the FCC. That interference could limit viewers’ ability to receive television stations’ signals. The amount of interference to stations could increase in the future because of the FCC’s decision to allow electronic devices, known as “white space” devices, to operate in the television frequency band on an unlicensed basis on channels not used by nearby television stations. 
In November 2017, the FCC voted to adopt rules authorizing broadcast television stations to voluntarily transition to a new technical standard, called Next Generation TV or ATSC 3.0. The new standard is designed to allow broadcasters to provide consumers with better sound and picture quality; hyper-localized programming, including news and weather; enhanced emergency alerts and improved mobile reception. The standard allows for the use of targeted advertising and more efficient use of spectrum, for example, by allowing for more multicast streams to be aired on the same six-megahertz channel. ATSC 3.0 is not backward compatible with existing television equipment, and the FCC’s rules require full-power television stations that transition to the new standard to continue broadcasting a signal in the existing DTV standard until the FCC phases out the requirement in a future order. A transitioning station’s DTV-formatted content must be substantially similar to the programming aired on its ATSC 3.0 channel until July17, 2023, five years from the date the rules in the original 2017 FCC order were finalized. In June 2020, the FCC re-affirmed this sunset date, but stated that it would open a proceeding one year prior to the sunset date to determine whether the date should be extended. 
GMG launched its first ATSC 3.0 stream in December 2020 for station WDIV-TV in Detroit; prior to the launch, WDIV-TV had applied for and was granted authority by the FCC to effectuate an ATSC 3.0 simulcasting arrangement with WMYD (licensed to Scripps Broadcasting Holdings, LLC) in the Detroit area. In 2021, two GMG 
stations each entered into simulcasting arrangements. First, in June 2021, GMG station WKMG-TV (Orlando) applied for and was granted authority by the FCC to effectuate an ATSC 3.0 simulcasting arrangement with another station in the Orlando area (WRBW-DT, licensed to Fox Television Stations, LLC). The station’s ATSC 3.0 stream was then launched along with the rest of the market on June 30, 2021. Second, in November 2021, GMG station KPRC-TV (Houston) applied for and was granted authority by the FCC to effectuate an ATSC 3.0 simulcasting arrangement with another station in the Houston area (KIAH, licensed to Tribune Media Company). The station’s ATSC 3.0 stream was then launched on December 2, 2021. As required by the FCC rules, each of the respective station’s stream is in addition to such station’s current DTV stream, which viewers continue to be able to view.
In connection with the transition to ATSC 3.0, which is an internet protocol-based standard, the FCC has updated its rules to reflect how broadcasters may use their spectrum in non-traditional ways (Broadcast Internet). In June 2020, the FCC issued a Declaratory Ruling clarifying that the television ownership rules would not apply to the lease of broadcast spectrum for Broadcast Internet purposes, and in December 2020, the FCC voted to adopt rules that specifically apply its existing framework regarding derogation of service and use of spectrum for ancillary and supplementary purposes to Broadcast Internet; i.e., a broadcaster must continue to air at least one free, over-the-air television signal in SDTV format, and if a broadcaster opts to use its spectrum for Broadcast Internet services, it will incur a five percent fee based on the gross revenue received by the broadcaster. It is too soon to predict how the use of broadcast spectrum for Broadcast Internet services could impact the industry. 
In April 2017, the FCC announced the completion of an incentive auction in which certain broadcast television stations bid to relinquish spectrum or move to a different spectrum band in exchange for a share of the revenues obtained by auctioning the reallocated broadcast spectrum for use by wireless broadband providers. None of GMG’s stations participated in the incentive auction. However, certain GMG stations—specifically, WDIV, WSLS, WCWJ and WJXT—were required to move to new channel allotments in order to free up a nationwide block of spectrum for wireless broadband use. The FCC adopted rules requiring this “repacking” of broadcast television stations to new channels to be completed within 39 months after the incentive auction closed, with earlier deadlines set for particular stations in order to stagger the transition to new channels. The WSLS transition was completed on September 11, 2019, the WCWJ and WJXT transitions were completed on January 16, 2020, and the WDIV transition was completed on September 16, 2020 (following tolling of its assigned deadline due to delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic).
GMG’s repacked stations have been eligible to seek reimbursement for repacking-related costs and have been receiving reimbursement payments through the FCC’s process. Congress has capped the overall funds available for repack-related reimbursements. The initial legislation authorizing the incentive auction provided only $1.75 billion in total for all such reimbursements. Congress later made available an additional $1 billion in reimbursement funds, with $600 million in available funds allocated to 2018 and $400 million allocated to 2019.
To date, each repacked commercial television station, including each of the repacked GMG stations, has been allocated a reimbursement amount equal to approximately 94% of the station’s estimated repacking costs, as verified by the FCC’s fund administrator. Receipt of the allocated funds is subject to FCC approval of particular requests for reimbursement of actual costs fully incurred. By October 8, 2021, stations that transitioned in the first half of the 39-month post-auction repack had to submit all remaining invoices for incurred expenses. WSLS, which transitioned in the first half of the post-auction repack, complied with this deadline. The remaining GMG stations must submit all remaining invoices, to the extent there are any, in 2022. As of December 31, 2021, the repacked GMG stations have received approximately $19.6 million in FCC reimbursements since 2018.
In March 2020, the FCC announced the reformation of the 3.7-4.2 GHz band (C-band) through a public auction of the lower 280 megahertz of these frequencies (3.7-3.98 GHz). This auction, which concluded February 2021, allows winning bidders to use the 3.7-3.98 GHz frequencies for wireless broadband services. However, this spectrum reallocation requires the relocation of incumbent C-band satellite operations—including those used to deliver programming to television stations—to a “repacked” 4.0-4.2 GHz band. In exchange for a portion of the auction proceeds, satellite operators have chosen to relocate their operations pursuant to an “accelerated” relocation timeline.
GMG’s television stations receive programming from the relocating satellite operators, and this requires the transition of operations at GMG stations through the installation of antenna filters, repointing and retuning of antennas, and other activities. Although GMG elected to have the satellite operators manage these transition efforts, GMG coordinated with the satellite operators and submitted various filings to the FCC to confirm the transition eligibility of its stations and ensure the stations remain protected from harmful interference post-transition.
The first phase of the “accelerated” C-band transition concluded December 5, 2021, and the deadline for the second phase is December 5, 2023. GMG anticipates that the satellite operators and the FCC may request additional information about GMG’s stations to complete the second phase of the transition.
Carriage of Local Broadcast Signals.  Congress has established, and periodically has extended or otherwise modified, various statutory copyright licensing regimes governing the local and distant carriage of broadcast television signals on cable and satellite systems. The Company cannot predict whether or how Congress may maintain or modify these regimes in the future, or what net effect such decisions would have on the Company’s broadcast operations or on the Company overall.
The Communications Act and the FCC rules allow a commercial television broadcast station, under certain circumstances, to insist on mandatory carriage of its signal on cable systems serving the station’s market area (must carry). Alternatively, stations may elect, at three-year intervals, to forgo must-carry rights and allow their signals to be carried by cable systems only pursuant to a “retransmission consent” agreement. Commercial television stations also may elect either mandatory carriage or retransmission consent with respect to the carriage of their signals on direct broadcast satellite (DBS) systems that provide “local-into-local” service (i.e., distribute the signals of local television stations to viewers in the local market area). Stations that elect retransmission consent may negotiate for compensation from cable or DBS systems in exchange for the right to carry their signals. Each of GMG’s television stations has elected retransmission consent for both cable and DBS operators, and each is carried on all of the major cable and DBS systems serving each station’s respective local market pursuant to retransmission consent agreements. Retransmission consent elections must be made every three years. The most recent election deadline was October 1, 2020; all GMG stations elected retransmission consent for both cable and DBS operators. The 2020 election process was less time-intensive than prior processes, as the FCC in July 2019 moved to an electronic election system that now allows broadcasters to post their carriage elections online and to send notices to covered MVPDs electronically. The next election deadline is October 1, 2023 and will follow the same process.
Recent statutory changes have required the FCC to modify its rules governing retransmission consent negotiations. The Television Viewer Protection Act, enacted on December 20, 2019, made changes to the “good faith” standards for retransmission consent negotiations, calling for the FCC to implement regulations requiring “large station groups” (groups of television broadcast stations that have a national audience reach of more than 20%) to negotiate in good faith with MVPD “buying groups” (entities that negotiate on behalf of multiple small MVPDs). GMG does not qualify as a “large station group” under the statute and therefore will not be subject to this obligation. While GMG does not anticipate that these recent changes will materially affect its bargaining position in retransmission consent negotiations, if Congress or the FCC were to enact further changes to the retransmission consent rules (such as by requiring small station groups like GMG to negotiate with MVPD buying groups, or otherwise giving MVPDs heightened bargaining power), such changes could have a material effect on retransmission consent revenues.
The FCC has also considered proposals to alter its rules governing network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity. In March 2014, the FCC solicited comments on a proposal to eliminate its network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules, which restrict the ability of cable operators, direct broadcast satellite systems and other distributors classified by the FCC as MVPDs to import the signals of out-of-market television stations with duplicate programming during retransmission consent disputes or otherwise. The FCC has not acted on that proposal to date. If Congress or the FCC were to enact further changes to the exclusivity rules, such changes could materially affect the GMG stations’ bargaining position in future retransmission consent negotiations.
Ownership Limits.  The Communications Act and the FCC’s rules limit the number and types of media outlets in which a single person or entity may have an attributable interest. The FCC is required by statute to review its media ownership rules (with the exception of the national television ownership rule, discussed below) every four years to determine whether those rules remain necessary in the public interest as the result of competition. This process is referred to as the quadrennial review. In November 2017, the FCC conducted such a review and voted to eliminate certain of its ownership limit restrictions and to modify others. This FCC decision was challenged in court, and the Third Circuit Court of Appeals set aside the FCC’s decision in November 2019. However, the FCC appealed the Third Circuit court’s decision, and on April 1, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed that decision. This means that the media ownership rules now reflect the November 2017 changes. The current ownership rule most relevant to GMG is the local television ownership rule. The rule prohibits one broadcaster from owning (or having an attributable interest in) two full-power television stations licensed to the same Nielsen DMA if both of them are ranked among the top four stations in the market, unless the broadcaster can demonstrate to the FCC that the combination serves the public interest. Ownership of more than two full-power television stations is generally prohibited.
The FCC’s most recent quadrennial review of its media ownership rules was initiated in December 2018. That proceeding remains open. In June 2021, the FCC solicited comments to refresh the record, but no action has been taken in that proceeding to date. GMG’s ability to enter into certain transactions in the future may be affected by the resolution of the current FCC quadrennial review proceeding.
Under the national television ownership rule, a single person or entity may have an attributable interest in an unlimited number of television stations nationwide, as long as the aggregate audience reach of such stations does not exceed 39% of nationwide television households and as long as such interest complies with the FCC’s other 
ownership restrictions. In 2016, the FCC eliminated the 50% Ultra High Frequency (UHF) discount, under which stations broadcasting on UHF channels are credited with only half the number of households in their market for purposes of calculating compliance with the 39% cap. However, the FCC reversed that decision in early 2017, concluding that the UHF discount should not be altered except in connection with a broader review of the national ownership cap. The reinstatement of the UHF discount was upheld by the D.C. Circuit in the summer of 2018. In December 2017, the FCC initiated a rule making proceeding seeking comments regarding its authority to modify or eliminate the national television ownership cap, which was set at 39% by statute, as well as the potential elimination of the UHF discount. That proceeding remains open. 
Programming.  Six of GMG’s seven stations are affiliated with one or more of the national television networks that provide a substantial amount of programming to their television station affiliates. The expiration dates of GMG’s affiliation agreements are set forth at the beginning of this Television Broadcasting section. WJXT, one of GMG’s Jacksonville stations, has operated as an independent station since 2002. In addition, each of the GMG stations receives programming from syndicators and other third-party programming providers. GMG’s performance depends in part on the quality and availability of third-party programming, and any substantial decline in the quality or availability of this programming could materially affect the ability of GMG and its competitors to enter into certain transactions in the future.
Public Interest Obligations.  To satisfy FCC requirements, stations generally are expected to air a specified number of hours of programming intended to serve the educational and informational needs of children and to complete reports on a quarterly basis concerning children’s programming. In July 2019, the FCC modified these rules to provide broadcasters with more flexibility in meeting the public interest obligations. Among other things, these rules allow up to 52 hours per year of children’s programming to consist of educational specials and/or short-form programming. The prior rules required all qualifying programming to be regularly scheduled and in 30-minute blocks. While stations are required to air the substantial majority of their educational and informational children’s programming on their primary program stream, under the current rules they may now air up to 13 hours per quarter of regularly scheduled weekly programming on a multicast stream. In addition, the FCC requires stations to limit the amount of advertising that appears during certain children’s programs. 
The FCC has other regulations and policies to ensure that broadcast licensees operate in the public interest, including rules requiring the disclosure of certain information and documents in an online public inspection file; rules requiring the closed-captioning of programming to assist television viewing by the hearing impaired; video description rules to assist television viewing by the visually impaired; rules concerning the captioning of video programming distributed via the internet; and rules concerning the volume of commercials. Compliance with these rules imposes additional costs on the GMG stations that could affect GMG’s operations. 
Political Advertising.  The FCC regulates the sale of advertising by GMG’s stations to candidates for public office and imposes other obligations regarding the broadcast of political announcements more generally, including the disclosures of certain information related to such advertising in the station’s online public inspection file. The application of these regulations may limit the advertising revenues of GMG’s television stations during the periods preceding elections. Failure to comply with the political advertising rules may result in enforcement actions by the FCC. The Company has procedures in place regarding compliance with the FCC’s political advertising rules, but cannot predict how the FCC’s future application of these rules will affect GMG’s stations.
Broadcast Indecency.  The FCC’s policies prohibit the broadcast of indecent and profane material during certain hours of the day, and the FCC may impose monetary forfeitures when it determines that a television station has violated that policy. Broadcasters have repeatedly challenged these rules in court, arguing, among other things, that the FCC has failed to justify its indecency decisions adequately, that the FCC’s policy is too subjective to guide broadcasters’ programming decisions and that its enforcement approach otherwise violates the First Amendment. In June 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court held that certain fines against broadcasters for “fleeting expletives” were unconstitutional because the FCC failed to provide advance notice to broadcasters of what the FCC deemed to be indecent, but it also upheld the FCC’s authority to regulate broadcast decency. The Company cannot predict how GMG’s stations may be affected by the FCC’s current or future interpretation and enforcement of its indecency policies.
Other Matters. In addition to the matters described above, the FCC is conducting proceedings concerning various other matters, the outcome of which could adversely affect the profitability of GMG’s television broadcasting operations.

Hospice care focuses on relieving symptoms and supporting patients with a life expectancy of six months or less. Hospice care involves an interdisciplinary approach to the provision of medical care, pain management and emotional and spiritual support, with an emphasis on comfort, not curing. Hospice services can be provided in the patient’s home, as well as in free-standing hospice facilities, hospitals, nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. Palliative care is a specialized form of medicine provided by nurse practitioners that aims to enhance the quality of life of patients and their families who are faced with serious illness. It focuses on increasing comfort through prevention and treatment of distressing symptoms. In addition to expert symptom management, palliative care focuses on clear communication, advance planning and coordination of care. Each GHG operating unit offers care coordination, healthcare solutions and clinical expertise. All home health and hospice operations are Medicare certified and accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Health Care (ACHC) or are in the process of being ACHC accredited. GHG derives 90% of its revenues for home health and hospice services from Medicare. The remaining sources of revenue are from Medicaid, commercial insurance and private payers.
In 2019, GHG acquired two business units, Clinical Specialty Infusions, LLC (CSI Pharmacy) located in Texarkana, Texas, and Clarus Care, LLC (Clarus) in Nashville, Tennessee. CSI Pharmacy is a nationwide specialty pharmacy licensed in 38 states that serves patients suffering from chronic illness. CSI Pharmacy specializes in treating rare diseases with biologics and plasma-derived therapies, with revenues derived primarily from intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy. CSI Pharmacy delivers products to patients’ houses and employs nurses to provide specialized infusion therapies in the home on a monthly basis. Clarus provides call management solutions to physician groups and hospitals. Clarus replaces traditional human-staffed answering services with a SaaS-based solution. Clarus streamlines calls, eliminates patient hold times, and manages referrals and new appointments. The solution eliminates delays, call routing errors and malpractice risk inherent with traditional call centers.
In December 2021, GHG acquired two businesses, one of which expanded GHG’s home health operations into Florida and Weiss Medical, a full service physician practice based in Riverdale, New Jersey. Weiss has expertise in all allergic and immunologic conditions, and specializes in challenging cases. It is often able to help patients even after they have seen numerous other specialists. The practice also offers infusion services.

COMPETITION
Kaplan
Kaplan’s businesses operate in fragmented and competitive markets. Each of KI businesses competes in disaggregated markets with other for-profit institutions and companies (ranging in size from large for-profit universities to small competitors offering English-language courses) and, in certain instances, with government-supported schools and institutions that provide similar training and educational programs. Competitive factors vary by business and include program offerings, ranking of university partners, convenience, quality of instruction, reputation, placement rates, student services and cost. KI derives its competitive advantage from, among other things, delivering high-quality education and training experiences to students, having name brand recognition across multiple markets, developing strong relationships with corporate clients and recruitment partners and offering competitive pricing. KNA competes with companies that provide various education technology solutions, consumer test and licensure preparation and course delivery, corporate training, university administrative support for online programs and courses, curriculum development, overall online program development and analytics for colleges and universities, as well as support for corporate, employer and employee education programs. The market for KNA’s services and products, and especially its higher education services and products, is dynamic and rapidly evolving, and several competitors offer a mix of some of the same products and services or are seeking to move into the markets in which KNA operates. Competitive factors in these KNA markets include the ability to deliver a wide range 
of educational services and programs to clients across all levels of programs and administrative functions; cost effectiveness; expertise in marketing, recruitment and program delivery; student outcomes and satisfaction; the ability to invest in start-up and scaling initiatives; reputation; and compliance with laws and the ability to navigate complex regulatory requirements. KNA’s ability to effectively compete in the higher education services markets will depend in large part on its successful delivery and navigation of these factors. While the competitive landscape is expanding, KNA’s resources, capabilities and experience are key differentiators in the market. Similarly, KNA’s supplemental education products and services compete with a wide range of national, regional, local, online and location-based competitors. Competitors vary by test, with many focused on preparing students for a single high-stakes test. For its curricular and assessment services, KNA has a number of national competitors as well as competitors focused on preparation for particular tests. Competitive factors for the supplemental education products vary by product line and include price, features, modality, schedule and reputation. Although KNA faces intense competition and shifting consumer preferences in these areas, particularly with respect to online test preparation, where some new competitors are offering lower-cost and free test preparation products, KNA, and particularly Kaplan Test Prep, remains a leading name in test preparation owing in part to its technical expertise and capabilities, quality of instructors, content, curricula, longevity and reputation in the industry. KNA’s professional licensure training and preparation and corporate training products and services offer a broad portfolio of products, many within highly regulated and mature industries, including securities, insurance, real estate and wealth management, where competition includes a wide variety of national, regional and local companies seeking the same market share and resulting in deep price discounting and commoditization of offerings.
Graham Media Group
GMG competes for audiences and advertising revenues with television and radio stations, cable systems, video services offered by telephone and broadband companies serving the same or nearby areas, DBS services, digital media services, and, to a lesser degree, with other media providers, such as newspapers and magazines. Cable systems operate in substantially all of the areas served by the Company’s television stations, where they compete for television viewers by importing out-of-market television signals; by distributing pay-cable, advertiser-supported and other programming that is originated for cable systems; and by offering movies and other programming on an on-demand, digital or pay-per-view basis. In addition, DBS services provide nationwide distribution of television programming, including pay-per-view programming and programming packages unique to DBS, using digital transmission technologies. Moreover, to the extent that competing television stations in the Company’s television markets transition to ATSC 3.0, such stations may pose an increased competitive challenge to the Company’s stations in the future, such as by offering an increased number of multicast channels or by offering advanced features. 
Competition continues to increase from established and emerging online distribution platforms. Movies and television programming increasingly are available on an on-demand basis through a variety of online platforms, which include free access on the websites of the major TV networks, ad-supported viewing on platforms such as Hulu, and subscription-based access through services such as Netflix. In addition, online-only subscription services offering live television services have been launched both by traditional pay-TV competitors (such as DISH and DirecTV) and newer entrants (such as Fubo). The Company has entered into agreements for some of its stations to be distributed via certain of these services, typically through opt-in agreements negotiated by the stations’ affiliated networks. Participation in these services has given the Company’s stations access to new distribution platforms. At the same time, competition from these various platforms could adversely affect the viewership of the Company’s television stations via traditional platforms and/or the Company’s strategic position in negotiations with pay-TV services. In addition, the networks’ increased role in negotiating online distribution arrangements for their affiliated stations, together with the networks’ imposition of higher fees on affiliated stations in exchange for broadcast and traditional pay-TV retransmission rights, may have broader effects on the overall network-affiliate relationship, which the Company cannot predict.
Hoover
Hoover’s predominant product line is fire-retardant treated wood products for building interior applications that are specified by architects in accordance with building code requirements for multi-family residential, commercial and institutional nonresidential buildings. Hoover’s fire-retardant product lines are sold through a stocking distributor network of more than 100 locations spanning the U.S. and Canada. Hoover’s competitors are licensees of other chemical suppliers to the wood treating industry who compete with Hoover’s stocking distributors on a local basis. The primary areas of competition are product availability and price, although brand loyalty due to product quality is significant. Wood products are commodities with volatile market pricing; however, Hoover’s reputation for quality products and its unique distribution model, which provides superior product availability, enable Hoover to maintain a leading position across the continent.
Dekko
Dekko has three distinct product families that compete in fragmented, competitive global markets: power and data distribution for office and furniture products, lighting solutions, and electrical harness manufacturing. These products are sold through dealer and distribution channels and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers, focused primarily on the North American market. While all markets and products are price sensitive, technology, engineering solutions, quality and delivery performance are critical in purchase decisions. Dekko’s multiple long-term relationships, high-quality manufacturing facilities, engineering support and reputation as a solutions provider, in addition to being a product supplier, all contribute to sustaining its competitive advantages.
Graham Healthcare Group
The home health and hospice industries are extremely competitive and fragmented, consisting of both for-profit and nonprofit companies. According to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission’s July 2021 Data Book, there are approximately 11,456 Medicare-certified home health providers and approximately 4,840 hospice providers in the U.S., with the number of active home healthcare providers rapidly increasing. GHG markets its services to physicians, discharge planners and social workers at hospitals, nursing homes, senior living communities and physicians’ offices through a direct sales model. GHG differentiates its offerings based on response time, clinical programming, clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction. Throughout the three states in which it operates, GHG competes primarily with both privately owned and hospital-operated home health and hospice service providers.
Graham Automotive
The retail automotive industry is highly competitive and fragmented. Automobile dealerships compete with dealerships offering the same brands as well as those offering other manufacturers’ brands. Competitors include small local dealerships and large national multi-franchise automotive dealership groups. In addition to competition for vehicle sales, dealerships compete for parts and service business with other dealerships, automotive parts retailers and independent mechanics. The principal competitive factors in vehicle sales are price, selection of vehicles, location of dealerships and quality of customer service. The principal competitive factors in parts and service sales are price, the use of factory-approved replacement parts, factory-trained technicians and the quality of customer service. 
Leaf 
Leaf operates in highly competitive and developing industries that are characterized by rapid technological change, a variety of business models and frequent disruption of incumbents by innovative entrants. Its art and design marketplaces, Society6 Group and Saatchi Art Group, compete with a wide variety of online and brick-and-mortar companies selling comparable products. Its made-to-order marketplace business, Society6 Group, primarily competes with companies that also utilize a made-to-order business model whereby consumer products featuring artist designs are produced by third-party fulfillment partners and shipped directly to customers, such as Redbubble, Zazzle, Art.com, Shutterfly and Minted, as well as companies that offer broader home décor and apparel products, such as Amazon, Etsy, Wayfair, Urban Outfitters and West Elm. Its online art gallery and in-person art fair business, Saatchi Art Group, competes with traditional offline art galleries, art consultants and online platforms selling original artwork, such as Artfinder, Artspace, Rise Art, Singulart, eBay and Amazon Art, as well as various art fairs that feature reasonably priced artwork from emerging artists, such as The Affordable Art Fair. Leaf’s marketplaces must successfully attract, retain and engage both buyers and sellers to use our platforms and attend our fairs. The principal competitive factors for such marketplaces include the quality, price and uniqueness of the products, artwork or services being offered; the selection of goods and artists featured; the ability to source numerous products efficiently and cost-effectively with respect to its made-to-order products; customer service; the convenience and ease of the shopping experience; and its reputation and brand strength. Competition is expected to continue to intensify as online and offline businesses increasingly compete with each other and the barriers to enter online channels are reduced. For properties within its Media Group, Leaf faces intense competition from a wide range of competitors. These markets are rapidly evolving, highly fragmented and competition could increase in the future as more companies enter the space. The Media Group competes for advertisers on the basis of a number of factors, including return on marketing expenditures, price of our offerings, and the ability to deliver large audiences or precise types of segmented audiences. Principal competitors in this space currently include various online media companies ranging from large internet media companies to specialized and enthusiast properties that focus on particular areas of consumer interest, as well as social media outlets such as Facebook, TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram and Pinterest, where brands and advertisers are focusing a significant portion of their online advertising spend in order to connect with their customers. Some of its competitors have larger audiences and more financial resources and many of its competitors are making significant investments in order to compete with various aspects of this business. Many of Leaf’s current competitors have, and potential competitors may have, substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than Leaf; greater technical capabilities; greater brand recognition; longer operating histories; differentiated products and services; and larger customer bases. These resources may help some of these competitors and potential competitors respond more quickly as the industry and technology evolves, 
focus more on product innovation, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to website and system development. 
Clyde’s
The restaurant industry is highly competitive. Clyde’s competes with national and regional chains and independent, locally owned restaurants for customers and personnel. The principal basis for competition are types of food and service, quality, price, location, brand and attractiveness of facilities.
Framebridge
Framebridge operates in a highly fragmented market. Competitors include small local retail operations and a few national retail chains. The competitive factors in the framing industry are price, selection and convenience. Framebridge’s centralized manufacturing, clear and transparent pricing, retail stores that are optimized for foot traffic and a curated buying experience rather than framing workshops, and strong e-commerce and digital capabilities contribute to its competitive advantages.
Code3
The business of managed digital advertising is highly competitive. Public multinational advertising agencies may exacerbate price competition in an attempt to protect existing relationships with advertising clients in traditional media formats such as television. Public and private advertising technology companies, digital media agencies and newer market entrants such as consulting firms also compete on price, service and technology offerings. Code3 seeks to maintain a competitive advantage and maximize its clients’ return on advertising budgets by utilizing a combination of the deep expertise of its employees, who manage media spending on the largest digital platforms and a full-service creative team with a nuanced understanding of digital media.
Decile
Decile faces competition from lower-cost providers that provide a narrower data analytics offering. In addition, at higher price points aimed at larger marketers ($50M+ annual revenue), there are several large customer data platform (CDP) competitors that attempt to unify many disparate sources of data to improve omnichannel advertising outcomes. Decile seeks to maintain a competitive advantage by simplifying the connection between data and marketing and bridging the gap between financial and marketing analytics to help marketers extract the most value out of their customer and sales data, all at a competitive price. Decile’s additional third-party data enrichment capabilities and data science analytics serve as key differentiators in the mid-market space where those capabilities are not available at a competitive price.
Slate
As a digital media company, Slate operates in highly competitive markets for subscribers, audiences and advertisers. For written work, Slate faces competition from other online publishers, especially magazines and newspapers. In podcasting, Slate faces competition from other podcast networks, as well as traditional radio networks. In the face of stiff competition, Slate is able to attract and retain a large educated, affluent audience and subscriber base by creating high-quality content, and is then able to compete for advertisers who wish to reach that audience on trusted, brand-safe properties.
Pinna
Pinna is currently the only ad-free, audio on-demand streaming service designed just for children that offers multiple audio formats in one space that complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). The market for children’s subscription digital media entertainment is large. It includes media subscription services for families, subscription services for children, online learning/gaming destinations, audiobooks and podcasts for children, gaming subscriptions and free digital content. Key differentiators for Pinna include its access to multiple formats and its offering of curated best-in-class brands and original shows all in one ad-free COPPA-compliant place.

The Company recognizes the importance of attracting, developing and retaining highly qualified employees throughout each of its businesses. The following is a description of the Company’s efforts to manage and promote human capital within its organization.
Oversight and Management. The Company’s human resources organization and the human resource organizations of its various businesses manage employment-related matters, including recruiting and hiring, training, compensation, workplace safety, performance management, support for specific needs including supporting employees who are caregivers or working remotely, and creating diversity, equity and inclusion strategies. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors provides oversight of certain human capital matters, including compensation and benefits, executive development, workforce diversity and inclusion initiatives, and succession planning.
Compensation and Benefits. The Company offers strong compensation and benefits programs to its employees. In 2021 the Company utilized a market pay tool to ensure all our units have access to high-quality market compensation data that enables them to set fair and equitable compensation rates. Depending on the business unit, employee benefits may include healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, employee assistance programs, tuition assistance programs, bonuses, long-term incentive compensation plans, pension and a 401(k) Plan. The Company also offers a small group of eligible employees certain equity-based grants under the Company’s incentive compensation plan with vesting and performance conditions to facilitate the attraction, retention, motivation and reward of key employees and to align their interests with those of the Company’s stockholders.
Health and Safety. The health and safety of the Company’s employees is paramount. The Company’s health and safety programs are designed to address multiple jurisdictions and regulations as well as the specific risks and unique working environments of each of the Company’s businesses. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company’s businesses have adopted return to office and vaccination policies and procedures that are most appropriate for their businesses based on their industry and health risks as well as federal, state and local guidance and regulation. At this time the majority of our workforce is required to be vaccinated against COVID-19 for in-person work.
Training and Talent Development. The Company is committed to the continued growth and development of its employees across all businesses. While development opportunities vary across the Company’s businesses, the Company seeks to offer a variety of learning opportunities including virtual learning as well as on-the-job mentoring and coaching. All employees complete core harassment and discrimination training and ethics training and are offered specific skills training designed to support the growth and advancement of their professional skills. For example, CyberVista conducts web-based leadership management training for first-time managers. Leaf Group has deployed several continuous learning platforms, including a diversity and inclusion learning platform; an eLearning and development platform; and a performance management platform. Leaf Group’s leadership development program includes personal assessments and one-on-one coaching for senior leadership. Joyce/Dayton conducted leadership assessments for executives and managers as well as a personal assessment tool to improve organizational communication. GMG has established learning and development opportunities to support its mission to be the authentic, local voice in the communities they serve. GMG proudly offers in-house leadership programs such as ‘Boss School’ which focuses on key skills and knowledge for new managers and a continuing development program for experienced producers. 
Diversity and Inclusion. Diversity and inclusion remains a high priority within the Company and in 2021 several new initiatives were launched at both the corporate level and at our business units. These initiatives are focused on supporting the retention and training of a diverse workforce across the Company. The Company encourages all business units to promote policies prioritizing diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), and offers courses on inclusive leadership and unconscious bias as part of Company-wide training options. In 2021, the Company chose to focus its global efforts on learning and strategy-building. The Company’s business units participated in a corporate-funded training program to establish DEI goals focused on attracting, retaining, developing and engaging underrepresented talent. The outcomes of the exercise were reported to the Board in November 2021. Following the completion of the program, a GHC Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council was formed to support ongoing progress at each individual business and collectively across the Company.
The Company is committed to a culture in which its diverse employee base can thrive in an inclusive and respectful environment. As of December 2021, the diversity of the Company’s employees in the U.S. was: 54% female; 46% male; 63% White; 14% Black or African American; 14% Hispanic or Latino; 7% Asian; and 2% Other. 
The Company’s businesses have launched various initiatives to support their individual DEI efforts. For example, GMG launched a strategy that included the adoption of new training tools, the creation of employee resource groups, virtual employee learning activities around Juneteenth and other celebration events, and talent sourcing focused on attracting underrepresented talent. At Kaplan, they have prioritized educating managers and employees on DEI best practices and expectations, including creation of a Global Inclusive Leader and Inclusive Colleague training for all current and new employees. Kaplan also sponsors diversity appreciation months that include social activities and discussion forums around relevant topics that raise awareness and increase understanding of diversity. Kaplan continues to be the primary donor and supporter of The Kaplan Educational Foundation (KEF), an independent public charity founded by Kaplan executives to help promote racial equality through higher education. Other business units have established strategic diversity and inclusion initiatives in ways that speak to their unique environment and human capital needs. For example, GHG has committed to building a career pathing and mentorship program for all field-based positions to help employees, especially underrepresented talent, achieve their career advancement goals. Most of the Company’s businesses have incorporated diversity, equity and inclusion related questions in their engagement surveys and are beginning to gather and analyze their human capital data to better understand existing conditions, set goals, and measure progress moving forward.
