Overview



We are a rapidly growing developer of proprietary hardware and software cultivation and extraction solutions for the cannabis and hemp industry. We believe we are passionately transforming cannabis cultivation and extraction methods through innovation. Our mission is to become the world’s most vertically integrated solution provider for the cannabis and hemp industry globally, while driving superior quality, consistency, and Return on Investment (“ROI”) for our valued customers. We currently have three primary areas of business focus:

● | Cultivation Solutions
--+----------------------


● | Extraction Solutions
--+---------------------


● | Facility Design & Building Services
--+------------------------------------

Cultivation Solutions



While we do not cultivate, come in contact with, distribute, process, or dispense cannabis or hemp or any cannabis or hemp derivatives that are currently prohibited under United States federal law, our equipment and business solutions can be used within indoor grow and processing facilities by fully licensed cannabis and hemp cultivators and processors or in some cases, by individual processors for individual use in compliance with applicable law. We sell our proprietary cultivation solutions to independent licensed cultivators. The two primary products we sell are the Agrify Vertical Farming Unit and Agrify Insights SaaS (“Software-as-a-Service”) software.
Agrify Vertical Farming Unit (“VFU”)



We believe our proprietary VFU technology is the only product in the market that offers a modular, compartmentalized micro-climate growing system for indoor vertical farming. Our VFU system is designed for large-state and multi-state operators who are looking to consistently produce higher-quality crops at scale. The ideal facility size that we target in our sales process ranges from 20,000 square feet to 50,000 square feet. The VFU is an integrated hardware and software growing system. These units are designed to line up horizontally in rows, and they can be stacked vertically up to 3 units tall, taking advantage of unused indoor vertical space with the below advantages:

● | Superior Floor Space Utilization. Each VFU provides two growing rows. Our design introduces an open-room facility design approach to maximize available cultivation floor print while offering superior risk mitigation via individual compartmentalized cultivation chambers. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Precise Environmental Controls. Each VFU has an environmental control unit that is integrated with our proprietary cultivation software, Agrify Insights software. This integration allows for precise control and automation over light photoperiod and intensity, temperature, humidity, vapor pressure deficit (“VPD”), carbon dioxide, fertigation, and irrigation throughout the life cycle of the plants. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Modular Scalability. The VFU is designed with proper loading to stack up to 3 units tall, sextupling production volume over the same footprint. Each unit is designed to easily integrate with a mezzanine catwalk system. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Biosecurity and Risk Mitigation. The VFU has a motorized curtain on both sides of the unit that enclose the grow area to prevent light-leak and spread of disease that would typically lead to facility-wide crop failure. Contamination can be controlled and limited to the affected units, which are designed with sanitation in mind. From the aluminum frame to the selection of antimicrobial plastics and down to the IP65 electronics and polycarbonate-lensed LED lights, the entire VFU can be easily sanitized. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Worker Safety. The VFU’s working area is 8 feet tall, allowing easy access to both rows of plants within the unit. As the motorized curtains can be lifted on either side, this also allows efficient ergonomics at arm’s length. Similarly, our Interlight LED technology is dimmed or turned-off when the curtains are raised for a more ambient working environment. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------











Examples of VFU infrastructure verse traditional grows



To further illustrate the benefit of going with the VFU infrastructure versus a more traditional indoor cultivation setup with conventional LED lights or conventional HPS lights, we have conducted a comparative analysis internally on an approximately 45,000 square foot facility.



While the upfront cost is more for the facility that is outfitted in VFUs, that is quickly offset by the fact that a VFU outfitted facility has the capacity to generate about 4x the amount of estimated annual revenue and over 4x the annual estimated EBITDA. In looking at the numerical values in the model, it becomes even more compelling when comparing the VFU facility to a facility with a traditional grow room. Assuming an initial investment of approximately $27.7 million for the VFU facility build-out, our model indicates that the facility owner would recoup their initial investment and produce significant free cash flow in the first year of operation assuming the facility should be able to achieve almost $88 million of estimated annual revenue and roughly $78.4 million in annual estimated EBITDA. In contrast, the traditional indoor facilities would cost approximately $8.8 million or a little less than $16.5 million to build out depending on which lights are used and would generate approximately $20.4 million or $22.5 million in estimated annual revenue and right around $16 million or just under $19 million in annual estimated EBITDA. When comparing the different facility types on a side-by-side analysis, we believe the VFU facility is far more attractive than either type of traditional facility given the financial upside is significantly higher and is a far more sophisticated way to grow crops.



We have also modelled out another scenario in which a prospective customer has a license that stipulates that they are permitted to operate with at most 16,200 square feet of canopy space in their facility (which is the exact same amount of canopy square footage displayed in the above model for the traditional setup in the 45,000 square foot facility). However, given the modular and stackable nature of the VFUs, we are able to help the customer achieve the same canopy square footage with 253 VFUs in a facility that is only 20,000 square feet, which is less than half the size of the traditional facility. While canopy square footage is basically identical for all of the different cultivation approaches we looked at in this particular simulation, the VFU setup requires a much smaller and theoretically much less expensive facility, and because the VFUs are more productive, the estimated annual yield is about 31% higher than in the facility with the traditional grow room setup and conventional LED lights and 45% higher than in the facility with the traditional grow room setup and conventional HPS lights.  



Agrify Insights SaaS Software Solution



Each individual VFU sold includes a license for Agrify Insights SaaS Software (“Agrify Insights software”), and a monthly SaaS subscription fee is charged, per VFU. The VFU cannot operate successfully without the use of Agrify Insights software, and we typically charge between $2,400 to $3,600 per VFU sold, per year. On average Agrify Insights SaaS Software license agreement is for a multi-year term, with an annual auto renewal.



Agrify Insights software is cloud-based software as a service that interfaces with a microservices middleware and relational database that integrates with our hardware and provides our managers, facility owners, facility managers, and growers real-time control and monitoring of facilities, growing conditions, and insights into both production and profit optimization. The combination of precise environmental control and automation with data collection and actionable insights empowers our customers to be more efficient, more productive, and more intelligent about how they run their businesses. We believe that the robust data analytics capabilities from our Agrify Insights software platform coupled with our VFU system is enabling our customers to transform their businesses and quality of the product they are cultivating.



The Agrify Insights software is focused around optimizing four key components:




● | Optimization at the plant level;
--+---------------------------------


● | Optimization at the VFU unit level;
--+------------------------------------


● | Optimization at the facility level; and
--+----------------------------------------


● | Optimization at the business level.
--+------------------------------------




When these key components are combined, they encompass the cultivation operations of an Agrify customer. By reducing human error and providing insights through data collection and analysis, Agrify Insights software minimizes risk and increases operational efficiencies. Ultimately, our customers are seeking to produce the same consistent end product no matter where they are located.



Plant-Level Optimization



Central to our solution is granular control of the cultivation environment. The end-product of a crop is determined by both the plant’s genetics and the environment in which the plants are grown. Control over the growing environment is accomplished through the Agrify Insights software. By recording over 1.5 million data points per VFU per year and being able to reproduce specific environments based on the data, cultivators are effectively able to minimize the variation in their crops and dial-in the maximum quality. Further individual plant varietals can be optimized by tailoring the grow plan (recipe for cultivation) to enhance particular genetic traits; increasing the temperature can speed chemical processes and growth rates and adjusting the length of different phases of a plant’s lifecycle can maximize the crop’s yield. Additionally, when new varieties of plants are cultivated, having multiple controlled, compartmentalized, growth chambers allow for iterative experiments which offer real insight into how new varieties are best cultivated. For example, you can grow a new variety in 5 different VFUs that are set to mimic the climate of different geographies to see where the varieties are suited to grow.










Our “Grow Plans” are the templates or recipes that define the parameters for each lifecycle. Grow Plans define the environmental settings (light - photoperiod and intensity/ temperature / humidity / VPD / CO2 / irrigation / fertilization) for each crop variety and cultivator as well as the schedule for completing, as applicable, “plant-hands-on” tasks such as bottoming, pruning, and harvest. Agrify Insights software ships to the customer with many pre-developed Grow Plans and customers can create their own Grow Plans, electing to share them with other customers or not.



Individual VFU Level Optimization



Our VFU hardware provides cultivation environmental control within the growth chamber. This hardware and its component valves, motors and sensors are directed and controlled by Agrify Insights software.

● | Monitor and Control Agrify Hardware. Agrify Insights software can either automatically or manually control our hardware. For example, the water-chilled fan coil can keep temperature in a range accurate to 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cultivation Environmental Control. Using Agrify Insights software, users can view environmental charts that plot temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide over time. It also shows when the plants were irrigated and whether the unit is in cooling, circulating, or dehumidifying mode. We sample these values every minute and report them back to the cloud every 15 minutes, or more often if there have been significant changes. Each growing chamber reports approximately 1.5 million data points annually, enabling our clients to perform in-depth analysis of grow performance. The manual control screen visualizes the current state of the grow chamber and enables our technicians to take direct control for troubleshooting, if necessary. The device log shows us what decisions were made by the onboard Agrify Insights software and why. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Facility Level Optimization



Our modular VFUs are deployed in scale at a customer’s facility with the smallest commercial operation deployment to date being 63 VFUs. Agrify Insights software is designed to operate these individual VFUs as a combined facility. Agrify Insights software features at the facility level include:

● | Production Planning. The production planning feature is designed to maximize a facility’s utilization by executing a “best-fit” scheduling algorithm to selected Grow Plans across the growing units that have been deployed at a customer facility. Since grow plans typically have a different number of growing days that start on staggered schedules, this module is a critical component for optimizing the planting and moving schedules, significantly increasing plant production, and reducing the cost per pound of harvest. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Workforce Management. Agrify Insights software includes a workforce planning feature to assign tasks to staff. These tasks can be automatically assigned based on user role or their knowledge, skills, and abilities. The calendar displays the estimated amount of time required to complete plant-touching tasks on any given day. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Automatic Notification System. Users can select to subscribe to anomalous events, and users are notified in the order in which they are listed. If a user does not acknowledge the notification within the specified time frame, the next user in the list is notified, providing the business with 24/7 monitoring and notifications. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Preventative Maintenance. Our equipment and facility preventative maintenance schedules and related tasks are contained, tracked and monitored within Agrify Insights software. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Facility Infrastructure Controls. Agrify Insights software controls the irrigation on a facility level as well as connects with the water chilled HVAC system and ambient lighting system, providing our customers a central piece of software for facility management. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Optimization at the Business Level



Agrify Insights software analysis features enable customers to understand how cultivation decisions impact their overall business. Understanding the data from the cultivation facility can help our customers better plan and make informed decisions that impact downstream parts of their business.




● | Consumables Procurement Integration. Each task can also be assigned a set of consumables whose inventory will be reduced when the task is started. This feature can help customers manage supply levels and can automatically create purchase orders so that they never run out of required supplies. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Online Standard Operating Procedures (“SOPs’’) and Safety Datasheets. Agrify Insights software hosts digital copies of our included Standard Operating Procedures and datasheets, or users can upload their own via our content management system, ensuring that the most recent version of SOPs and forms are available to users.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Roles-Based Dashboards. Ability to obtain access to information specifically suited to your workforce’s various needs. Facility owners have access to high-level information about crop yields and equipment usage in an easy-to-understand scorecard. Farm managers receive a worksheet and calendar that lets them manage their workforce and automatically assign plant-touching tasks. This also provides facility managers with an ongoing window into consumables and lets them set inventory levels.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Data Collection. Agrify Insights software is a centralized repository for all data relating to the cultivation aspects of our clients’ business, including research and development testing data, and the ability to capture and compare test results. By doing so, Agrify Insights software becomes a customers’ cultivation statement of record. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Financial Simulator / What If Scenarios. Our operating expenses (“OpEx”) calculator enables users to evaluate impacts to profitability by changing hundreds of attributes including, but not limited to, changes to costs in labor, electric, water, CO2, and growing media as well as potential volatility in yields and pricing. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Regulatory Reporting Integration. We have integrated our software with Metrc, a leading seed-to-harvest compliance management and tracking solution, which will enable our customers to handle most regulatory reporting directly through Agrify Insights software. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Extraction Solutions



While we do not extract, come in contact with, distribute, process, or dispense cannabis or hemp or any cannabis or hemp derivatives that are currently prohibited under United States federal law, our extraction equipment and business solutions can be used within indoor processing facilities by fully licensed cannabis and hemp cultivators and processors or in some cases, by individual processors for individual use in compliance with applicable law. We sell our proprietary extraction solutions to independent, licensed cultivators and processing labs.



Cannabis represents a potential cornucopia of medicinal and pharmaceutical advancement. Cannabis produces over 550 different phytochemicals, over 120 of which are cannabinoids like tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”) and cannabidiol (“CBD”). Other cannabinoids like varins, cannabigerivarin (“CBGV”), tetrahydrocannabivarin (“THCV”), and cannabidivarin (“CBDV”) are less well known and potentially offer significant value. As we continue to learn more about the complex chemical composition of cannabis, the need for distillation solutions is clear. Distillation enables the identification, isolation, and separation of valuable cannabis metabolites. The ability to take cannabis compounds distilled into their pure forms, and then recombine them into specific, purposeful end-products could have significant potential for the pharmaceutical industry in the future.



Since October 2021, we have been strategically focused on establishing ourselves as a global leader in the cannabis and hemp extraction equipment industry, complementing our cutting-edge cannabis and hemp cultivation solutions. Over a 5-month period, we acquired four of the top brand names in the industry:




● | Mass2Media, LLC, d/b/a PX2 Holdings, LLC, d/b/a Precision Extraction Solutions (“Precision”) - Market leader in developing and producing high-quality hydrocarbon extraction solutions was acquired by Agrify on October 1, 2021. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cascade Sciences, LLC (“Cascade”)- Market leader in developing and producing high-quality vacuum purge ovens and decarboxylation ovens was acquired by Agrify on October 1, 2021. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | PurePressure, LLC (“PurePressure”) - Market leader in developing and producing high-quality solventless extraction solutions was acquired by Agrify on December 31, 2021. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | LS Holdings Corp. (“Lab Society”) - Market leader in developing and producing high-quality distillation and solvent separation extraction solutions was acquired by Agrify on February 1, 2022. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Combined, the four acquisitions listed above provide what we believe to be the most comprehensive extraction solutions from a single provider, with over 7,000 customers, including over 30 Multi-State-Operators, and some of the best extraction labs in the industry. Our leading extraction brands provide equipment and solutions for extraction, post-processing, and testing for the cannabis and hemp industry. The extraction, post-processing and testing services are complementary and highly attractive areas of the supply chain.



Our extraction division now offers cutting-edge technologies and end-to-end service solutions. Solutions from the extraction division include equipment, technology, facility and lab design, and extensive research and development capabilities. By providing new hardware-as-a-service we intend to capture higher margin recurring revenue and supply chain optimization through streamlined product sourcing, purchasing, manufacturing, and warehousing.



These acquisitions have greatly expanded our product and service offerings in the post-harvest segment of the supply chain, and believe we are positioning the Company as the most vertically integrated total solutions provider for our cannabis and hemp customers. The global cannabis extraction market is expected to potentially grow to $24 billion by 2028, and as the cannabis industry continues to experience rapid growth globally, we expect the sales of our extraction solutions to follow a similar growth trajectory.










Facility Design & Building Services



Agrify provides fully integrated architectural, engineering, and project management oversight of qualified General Contractors for its customers commercial cannabis facilities buildouts. Each custom commercial cannabis facility is specifically designed to maximize the production output of Agrify’s proprietary VFU’s and cannabis extraction product solutions.
Cannabis Market Opportunity



While we do not cultivate, come in contact with, distribute or dispense cannabis or any cannabis derivatives that are currently prohibited under U.S. federal law, our cultivation solutions can be used within indoor grow facilities by cannabis cultivators if they choose to do so.



In the U.S., the development and growth of the regulated medical and recreational (adult use) cannabis industry has generally been driven by state law and regulation, and accordingly, the market varies on a state-by-state basis. State laws that legalize and regulate cannabis for medicinal reasons allow patients to consume cannabis with a designated healthcare provider’s recommendation, subject to various requirements and limitations. As of December 31, 2021, 38 states have passed laws allowing their citizens to use medical cannabis. On top of this medical condition growth trend, there has been a slower but steady increase in the number of states that have chosen to legalize cannabis for recreational use. As of December 31, 2021, 18 states have passed laws allowing their citizens to use recreational cannabis. Shifting public attitudes and state law and legislative activity are driving this change as indicated by a 2019 poll by Quinnipiac University that found that 93% of Americans support patient access to medical-use cannabis, if recommended by a doctor, which was the same level of support from a similar poll conducted by Quinnipiac University in 2018. Similarly, the trend toward further legalization and regulation of cannabis sales is spreading globally. As of the date of this report, over 28 countries outside the U.S. currently have medicinal cannabis regulation in force, and that number is expected to significantly increase over time.



Given that the market size of legal cannabis in the U.S. in 2020 was expected to be $17 billion according to New Frontier, and 53% of cannabis volume is currently grown indoors according to New Leaf Data Services, we estimate that the indoor segment of the legal U.S. cannabis sector is a $9 billion market with the expectation that there will be even more growth on the horizon. In fact, according to a report from April 2020, BDSA, the leading provider of cannabis industry market research, in conjunction with Arcview Market Research, forecasted that U.S. legal cannabis sales will approach $34 billion by 2025, which represents 72% of their projection for total global sales of $47 billion in 2025.



The different cultivation environments for cannabis each have advantages and disadvantages, and this leads to a variance in price points based on quality, actual and perceived, and process. According to New Leaf Data Services’ March 25, 2022 U.S. cannabis spot index, the average wholesale price per pound of outdoor grown flower was $502 per pound, greenhouse flower averaged $840 per pound, while indoor grown flower averaged $1,651 per pound and the total market on average was $1,242 per pound. Based on the breakdown of production by cultivation environment, indoor grown flower represents 53% of total volume by type while greenhouse and outdoor represent 23% and 24%, respectively. Additionally, based on the breakdown of percentage of observed transactions, indoor grown flower represents 64% of total volume by type while greenhouse and outdoor represent 18% and 18%, respectively.



Outdoor cannabis has the lowest initial capital expenditures required to start cultivation. According to Marijuana Business Daily (“MBD”), the average start-up cost per square foot of outdoor cultivation is $10. The expansive size of outdoor grows and their reliance on natural soil, lighting and weather conditions means cultivators have relatively few infrastructure needs. They can get their business off the ground quickly and with minimal upfront expenditures trading quality for lower cost production.



Greenhouse grown cannabis commands a higher price per pound than field grown cannabis as the more protected environment produces higher quality flower. According to MBD, the average start-up cost per square foot for greenhouse cultivation is $50, but the true costs tend to be all over the map with an executive from Ohio-based Rough Brothers, an 84-year-old greenhouse company that started taking on cannabis clients in 2013, opining that such costs can vary greatly, going so far as to say “I could build you a cannabis greenhouse for $20 a square foot or $200 a square foot.”



Indoor grown cannabis commands the highest price per pound as it produces the highest quality flower due to the fact that growers have the most control over the environment. Indoor cultivation facilities vary significantly in sophistication and technology with the build-out costs reflecting that fact. While MBD states that the average start-up cost per square foot for indoor cultivation is $75, anything close to that cost would inevitably yield a primitive and arguably insufficient setup. In contrast, Jennifer Martin, a prominent cannabis cultivation consultant, indicated on MarijuanaPropagation.com that a far more advanced and scalable configuration would likely cost between $400 to $500 per square foot. In general, the more a company invests up front, the higher the upside will be in the future. However, beyond initial build-out costs, it has historically been very expensive to grow cannabis in an indoor facility. The industry norm for direct production-related operating costs ranges from approximately $436 per pound according to a competitive cost analysis conducted by MJardin to $516 per pound, which is based on another examination of cultivation costs by the website CannaBusinessPlans.com. 



Our premium indoor grow solutions, whether it’s our VFUs or our LED lights, are designed, engineered, and calibrated to drive significant improvements for our customers, who trust us to deliver the type of productivity and quality that was previously unattainable.








 

Competitive Landscape



We believe our full suite of product offerings form an unmatched ecosystem for indoor growing and extraction. At this time, our Agrify Vertical Farming Unit, Agrify Insights software, Extraction solutions, our facility design and build services, and our engineering/installation services are highly differentiated from anything else on the market.



At the same time, our customers are actively being approached by a variety of companies who do offer compelling standalone products and services, so we recognize that our customers do have choices and alternatives, and they also need to factor in opportunity cost whenever they make purchasing decisions. Consequently, we more broadly define our competition as any other company going after the same finite budget dollars as us in the indoor agriculture space. We have highlighted below the most notable players that operate across some of the same functional, highly fragmented areas of agriculture technology that we operate.




● | Semi-Integrated Vertical Cultivation Systems — Sprout AI
--+---------------------------------------------------------

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------




Despite the presence of some well-funded and well-established competitors who offer pieces of what we do, we are able to compete on the basis of several defensible factors including our industry experience, our technical expertise, the differentiated value proposition of our individual offerings, and our positioning as a single-source provider. However, we believe above all else, it is our ability to offer an unrivaled level of precision through a total end-to-end turnkey solution that sets us apart from existing competitors and potential new market entrants.



Our Competitive Strengths



We believe our business has, and our future success will be driven by, the following competitive strengths:




● | Innovative Technology in an Attractive Growing Industry. Our innovative solutions are aimed at large and growing U.S. domestic and global markets. We believe we are the only provider of a fully integrated end-to-end hardware and software turnkey solution for indoor cultivation and extraction facilities that allows customers to produce at scale, high-quality products with consistency that meet the growing demand and needs of end users at a relatively low cost. As such, we believe we have a first mover advantage due to innovating this new type of smart cannabis and hemp cultivation and processing solution, which is already designed, manufactured, and implemented in a number of commercial scale deployments across multiple states within the U.S. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Integrated Proprietary Components. We design and create our own hardware, software and SOPs from the ground up, rather than buying piecemeal from third parties. We take a systems-engineered integrated approach that we believe has inherent advantages over other, ad-hoc systems.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Emphasis on Precision and Consistency Through Our Proprietary Grow Solutions. While being able to help our customers increase capacity, yield and consequently revenues hold a tremendous amount of value, we believe that our biggest differentiator is our ability to impact the actual quality and consistency of the output by controlling the environment in which the crops are grown and all of the variables that influence harvests with an unparalleled level of precision. The by-product of our Agrify total turn-key solution (“TTK Solution”) is that our customers are able to create consistent high-quality products with repeatability from anywhere similar to any other consumer product company that provides a branded food or drink product. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Emphasis on Precision and Consistency Through Our Extraction Division. In addition to our premium grow solutions, we have begun offering our customers industry leading cannabis and hemp extraction equipment, design and training solutions. By acquiring leading brands earlier this year, we are immediately able to offer our customers premium solutions to meet their processing needs in this rapidly expanding sector. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Market Knowledge and Understanding. We have extensive experience with controlled agriculture environments, extraction, post-processing and scale-up manufacturing, as well as industry technical knowledge and relationships. We are keenly aware of the struggles that indoor cultivators and extractors face, and we serve as a credible and collaborative partner through the entire customer lifecycle. We believe that our fully integrated TTK Solution, extraction equipment and ancillary services are the key to resolving many of the challenges our customers face. 


● | Differentiated Business Model. Unlike many of our competitors, we offer a diversified mix of hardware, software and services, which leads to multiple revenue streams. Given the nature of our deployments, we become deeply embedded in our customers’ operations through our numerous product offerings, which include our TTK Solutions and the direct sale of our VFUs, and various extraction and processing equipment and this puts us in a position where their success is directly tied to our equipment. Our ability to differentiate our business model, through both our TTK Solutions, as well as through our direct VFU hardware sales, provides us with multiple opportunities to expand our installed user base, which we believe will lead to future high-margin and stable recurring SaaS revenues, via our Agrify Insights software, and production fee revenues.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Novel Equipment Financing Solution. Limited access to outside capital is a significant issue for cultivators as it can inhibit growth and cultivation facility expansion. We help solve this problem by offering equipment financing plans for select good credit customers, which we believe further enables us to become a vendor of choice. Qualified customers pay approximately 30%-50% upfront and finance the balance through a two-year payment plan. 


● | Experienced and Proven Management Team. Our leadership team has entrepreneurial experience, technical expertise, and a track record of scaling up businesses and operating public companies. Additionally, our team is supported by strong advisors and leading strategic and institutional investors. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We also intend to opportunistically pursue the strategies described below to continue our upward trajectory and enhance shareholder value. In 2021 we believe we have significantly improved our new bookings and qualified pipeline. With our expanded product line to included quality extraction solutions, we become more attractive to our prospects and customers, enhancing our value-add and improved wallet share opportunities. We expect our qualified pipeline and new bookings of opportunities to continue to grow.
Sales and Marketing



Rigorous Sales Process and Strong Infrastructure in Place to Drive Revenue Growth



We embrace and utilize a rigorous Sandler sales process to evaluate potential new opportunities and then advance vetted prospects through the different phases of our qualified pipeline. The Sandler sales process is the leading enterprise sales process globally, which is based on the psychology of human behavior, is consistent with the values and culture we have chosen to implement at Agrify, and consequently our salespeople spend most of their time building relationships and qualifying opportunities in order to make closing new business more streamlined, collaborative and organic in nature. There are specific requirements, milestones, and events that we have identified along the sales process that must be met to move prospects through and convert them from vetted opportunities into committed sales orders within a 12-month period. At each phase of the pipeline, a prospect opportunity is assigned a probability value for closing, providing management production forecast ability.



Our professional proactive sales team works to convert our qualified pipeline of opportunities into confirmed contractual bookings. Given our emphasis on enterprise sales opportunities we believe we are able to significantly scale our business in the coming year without significant increases our headcount. At the time of this report, our sales team was made up of Sales Operations Specialist, Order Management Representatives, Solution Architects, Account Managers, Director of Business Development, and Director of Channel Partners totaled 19 full-time employees.










We believe our business has, and our future success will be driven by, the following sales and marketing strategy:




● | Marketing Team Aligned with Sales Force to Maximize Our Industry Visibility to Drive Revenue. Our marketing department works in tandem with our sales and business development representatives to best represent and sell our cultivation and extraction solutions to the cannabis industry. The sales and business development representatives advance prospects through our sales funnel, also known as a “buyer’s journey”. Our sales funnel duties are completed using a customer relationship management (“CRM”) system, which allows us to track, qualify, and report on the pipeline velocity and ROI of our marketing initiatives. Leads are added into our funnel predominantly through our digital marketing efforts, including direct marketing, organic social media growth, thought leadership, events, and demand generation via paid advertisements. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Direct Marketing. We capitalize on our direct marketing efforts by utilizing our internal CRM database, as well as the external help of trusted industry databases to target the right audience. Emails go out on a weekly basis and are subdivided by product focus and state, depending on the campaign. We use A/B testing in our email campaign strategy to harness meaningful messages that result around 35%-40% engagement for open and click rates. The average open and click rates for all industries is 21.33%. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Social Media and Thought Leadership. Through the creation and promotion of engaging content that positions us as a thought leader, we continue to organically grow our social media audience. We share original video, photography, industry-related articles, and blog content on a consistent basis. By developing strategic partnerships with well-known and respected brands, we are working to better position ourselves with marketing and branding efforts on social. Furthermore, we promote our social media in our communication via email and on our website. We also keep our finger on the pulse of trends and competitors in the market, remaining in-the-know. 
● | Trade Shows. Trade shows and events related to the cannabis industry have proven to be highly effective. When attending trade shows and events, we typically position ourselves front and center, with high-level sponsorships, outstanding booth placement, and speaking opportunities. Our product and subject matter experts take advantage of speaking opportunities, positioning Agrify as industry thought leaders. We expect to continue to grow our industry presence by generating leads using conferences as a platform. The trade show plan has been carefully vetted to ensure that these shows are reputable, have a strong business to business focus, high foot-traffic rates, as well as hosted in a desirable market. 
● | Paid Advertising. We utilize paid advertising such as banner ads on high-trafficked media sites that largely focus on cannabis and other relevant topics. We provide content offers and other downloadable materials in order to capture these leads. As we gain experience through these different marketing initiatives, we will make appropriate spending adjustments with our most effective outlets. We seek to expand our business both nationally and internationally, and will do so when we have proven, viable marketing options available to us. 
● | Public Relations Campaigns. We have successfully gained the interest of press from networks such as CFN and a number of other cannabis media outlets. With our industry positioning using thought-leadership and on-going participation in industry conferences, we have been highlighted through the Newswire and featured in a variety of media outlets. We will continue to sponsor and keynote in industry-related events including technology and agriculture conferences, podcasts, radio shows and more to continue to gain press and ultimately more exposure. 

Agrify Total Turn-key Solutions



We also believe that our data-driven TTK Solution for cultivation solutions is unlike any other customer solution being offered and enables our customers to get to market faster by providing them with our seamlessly integrated hardware and software offerings as well as access to capital and a wide range of associated services from experts including consulting, training, design, engineering, and construction to form what we believe is the most complete solution available from a single provider.



Agrify’s TTK Solution provides our valued customers with the benefit of working with a single, highly qualified provider in what has historically been a decentralized market full of piecemeal solutions that were not necessarily designed and engineered to work harmoniously with one another. Given the significant shortcomings associated with traditional indoor grow methods across all commercial agriculture segments, it was apparent that a new paradigm in indoor cultivation was desperately needed, which is precisely why we are bringing a more modern, manufacturing style approach that is process driven through technology and measured via data and analytics. Overall, our holistic approach to addressing our customers’ cultivation needs treats their production facilities as an end-to-end ecosystem whose success depends on all of its components working together optimally. Despite the rapidly growing cannabis and hemp industry, many grower and processor customers face some significant obstacles to their operations that pose a serious threat to their long-term viability.



We believe Agrify proprietary TTK Solution is the key to resolving many of the challenges our customers encounter. Since launching our TTK Solution in June of 2021, we have generated significant momentum in the United States market and over time, we expect to have significant future TTK Solution opportunities both domestically and abroad. We have set ourselves apart by bringing to market a horticulturist expertise, bundled solution of state-of-the-art equipment, software and services that is turn-key, end-to-end, fully integrated and optimized for precision growing and extraction. Agrify’s TTK Solution provides customers with the following bundled equipment and services:




● | Facility design, lab design, and engineering services
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | Facility and lab buildout project management 
--+---------------------------------------------------
● | Agrify state of the art VFUs 
● | Agrify data driven Insights SaaS software 
● | Agrify state of the art extraction products 
● | Expert horticulturist training and ongoing support




Agrify’s TTK Solution agreement terms are typically for ten years. If facility design and building services are provided, on average the customer pays Agrify an annual interest rate ranging from 12% to 18% per annum and the money owed for the design and build services are completely repaid withing 24 months of facility occupancy certification. During the remaining term of the agreement the Agrify receives monthly recurring SaaS fees and for a production success fee based on the amount of each harvest. For extraction equipment and products, Agrify TTK Solution agreements range from five years to ten years and the Company receives a production success fee based on the amount produced.



Equipment Financing



We recognize that many new cultivators face particular capital and time constraints, and we also recognize that the initial cost of our equipment can be a deterrent for some. We solve this problem by offering equipment financing plans for select good credit customers, which we believe further enables us to become a vendor of choice. While we proactively show our prospects that the strong and immediate return on investment derived from Agrify solutions will more than make up for associated start-up costs, we wanted to do even more to support our prospective customers, which is why we unveiled an equipment financing program to help remove this final barrier to entry for otherwise excited cultivators. This requires participating credit-worthy customers to pay a substantial down payment, typically between 30% and 50% of the purchase price, with the balance financed over two years, with interest, under commercially reasonable terms.



Our individual offerings, which are described in more detail below, are compelling on their own. However, we believe what really sets us apart is our ability to bring to the market a tech-forward, bundled solution of equipment, software and services that is turn-key, end-to-end, fully integrated and optimized for precision growing.










Scale-Up Manufacturing Capabilities in Order to Meet the Increasing Demand for Our Grow Solutions



We currently use contract manufacturers (“CMs”) in the U.S. and in Asia for prototyping and volume manufacturing, and we plan to expand our capabilities in order to meet the increasing demand for our grow solutions. We design the systems internally, and then work with our CMs and suppliers to refine, prototype, and test the designs. The designs are documented at a level that allows us to have our products manufactured at multiple CMs, both in the U.S. and abroad.



Additionally, we work with domestic suppliers on a wide range of metal fabrication to allow for rapid prototyping and product development. One such CM and metal fabrication shop that we have worked with extensively in the past is Harbor Mountain Holdings, LLC (“HMH”), which is based in the Atlanta, GA area. HMH has been producing and assembling many of our products for over three years, and they have served our needs well as a versatile and valued partner. On July 21, 2020, we acquired HMH, including the acquisition of HMH’s research and development, testing, and flexible manufacturing plant located just outside Atlanta, GA, along with key personnel and equipment. We believe this acquisition fits in nicely with our overall scale-up manufacturing strategy. We expect HMH to evolve into more of a service, engineering development and prototyping, and test facility.



On December 7, 2020, we entered into a five-year supply agreement with Mack Molding Co., a Vermont corporation (“Mack”), pursuant to which Mack will become a key supplier of Company’s VFUs. Mack is a leading supplier of molded plastic parts, fabricated metal parts and high-level assemblies to the medical, industrial, transportation, energy/environment, computer and business equipment, defense, aerospace and consumer markets. Founded in 1920, Mack is a wholly owned subsidiary of the privately held Mack Group corporation, which also includes Mack Technologies and Mack Prototype. The supply agreement contemplates that, following an introductory period, we will negotiate a minimum percentage of our VFU requirements that we will purchase from Mack each year based on the agreed upon pricing formula. The introductory period is not time-based but rather refers to the production of an initial number of units after which the parties have rights to adjust pricing and negotiate a certain minimum requirements percentage. We believe this approach will result in both parties making a more informed decision with respect to the pricing and other terms of the supply agreement with Mack. In the event we are unable to agree with Mack on pricing or a minimum requirements percentage, either party may terminate the agreement upon notice without further consequence or obligation.



We believe the supply agreement with Mack provides us with several key benefits, including:




● | Rapid Scaling: We can scale to customer orders, as Mack has agreed to maintain a minimum safety stock of VFUs in inventory and allow us to store additional inventory pending customer deliveries; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Long-Term Efficiencies: Under a strategic partner governance structure, we intend to meet with Mack at least quarterly in efforts to improve components acquisition and logistics, to lower production costs over time, provide additional alternatives for third party component vendors and allow us to provide input as to Mack’s overall production process and operational effectiveness. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We anticipate that this key strategic relationship with Mack will grow with our continued and expanding need for additional VFUs.



Overall, our approach to manufacturing is to use CMs to prototype, iterate, and begin initial production, then transition to volume production including in lower cost geographies, which results in both rapid time-to-market and low production costs. As we grow, we intend to continually analyze and evolve our manufacturing capabilities to best meet our customer needs while always focusing on ways to maximize operating margins.



Intellectual Property



We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret, including federal, state and common law rights in the United States and other countries, nondisclosure agreements, and other measures to protect our intellectual property. We require our employees, consultants, and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements and to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived under their respective employment, consultant, or advisor agreement, using our property, or which relate to our business. Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Our business is affected by our ability to protect against misappropriation and infringement of our intellectual property, including our trademarks, service marks, patents, domain names, copyrights and other proprietary rights.
Patents



We hold 17 patents in the United States and 3 international patents. We also have nine pending patent applications. These patents and patents applications are directed to, among other things, extraction and processing of botanicals and particular compounds. 
Trademarks and Copyrights



We own or have applications for numerous national and state trademarks which are essential to our businesses, including Agrify, Precision, PurePressure, PressWare, Lab Society and Elitelab, among others. In addition, we recognize common-law trademark rights AGRIFY INSIGHTS and AGRINAMICS for different software as a service products.



Our subsidiary, Agrify Brands, LLC is the owner of certain common-law trademarks that it licenses to third parties. Marks covered by the license include, DAWG STAR (including multiple logo designs), WESTERN CULTURED (including multiple logo designs), TWISTED LEGION (logo), WAXTRONAUT (including multiple logo designs) and WAXTRONAUT COSMICALLY CURATED EXTRACTS.










Although we have not sought copyright registration for our technology or works to date, we rely on common law copyright and trade secret protections in relation to our TechOps/ Agrify Insights software computer program for indoor agriculture management. We have registered our Internet domain names related to our business. We license software from third parties and utilize open-source software for integration into our applications.



In addition, while we know that our current product and service capabilities are highly novel and compelling, we do not intend to be complacent. We will continue to learn from our customers and from the market, and if there is an opportunity to deploy a new and improved version of one of our offerings or if we decide there is room in the market for a new type of solution, we fully intend to diligently explore those possibilities to augment our existing business and grow our reach.



Employees and Human Capital Resources



As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of 141 employees, of which 136 are full-time employees, with 36 located in the New England area, 35 in Georgia, 31 in Michigan, 17 in Oregon and 22 in other states. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.



Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing, and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors, and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plan are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.



Legal Proceedings



From time to time, we may be subject to various claims, legal actions and regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.



On January 5, 2021, we received a demand letter from Nicholas Cooper and Richard Weinstein, two of our former employees (and one of Mr. Cooper’s affiliated entities), asserting that such individuals were entitled to compensation arising out of their employment by us, as well as their partial ownership of TriGrow Systems, Inc. The demand letter asserts that the former employees are due certain sales commissions under their applicable bonus plan, equity earn-outs based on certain sales targets, and various equity purchases through our employee stock ownership plan. The demand letter also asserts various employment claims, including, but not limited to, statutory wage withholding violations, wrongful termination, breach of contract, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, fraud in the inducement, promissory estoppel, minority shareholder oppression, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and violations of state and federal securities laws.



On January 19, 2021, Messrs. Cooper and Weinstein filed a lawsuit against Agrify Corporation in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, alleging the same claims made in their demand letter based on the same facts disclosed above. The plaintiffs are seeking relief in the form of monetary damages in an amount to be determined. Messrs. Cooper and Weinstein are also seeking relief in the form of reinstatement and Mr. Weinstein is seeking rescission of Mr. Weinstein’s Release of Claims Agreement. On March 10, 2021, we moved to dismiss all of Cooper and Weinstein’s claims, asserting that the claims failed to allege legal grounds for relief. A decision on our motion is expected in the summer of 2021. On May 12, 2021, a Magistrate issued a preliminary Report and Recommendation, which recommended dismissal of certain of Cooper and Weinstein’s claims, and recommended others for additional factual discovery. On July 27, 2021, a District Judge entered an order partially adopting the Report and Recommendation, dismissing one claim with prejudice, dismissing a second claim with leave to amend, and permitting the remaining claims to proceed. 



Additionally, on July 29, 2021, the Company filed a separate arbitration in Boston, Massachusetts against Cooper and Weinstein, in which the Company alleges that Cooper and Weinstein were liable for certain conduct during the time they were TriGrow employees, including breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, usurpation of corporate opportunity, conversion, fraudulent concealment, and false representation. Also on July 29, 2021, the Company submitted a claim for indemnification to certain legacy TriGrow Systems, LLC. shareholders. The claim for indemnification relates to conduct by Cooper and Weinstein during the time they were TriGrow employees. We do not believe these claims have any merit and intend to vigorously defend against them (see Note 21, Commitments and Contingencies, in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2021).










Corporate History



Agrify Corporation was incorporated in the state of Nevada on June 6, 2016, originally incorporated as Agrinamics, Inc. (or Agrinamics). On September 16, 2019, Agrinamics amended its articles of incorporation to reflect a name change to Agrify Corporation.



On December 8, 2019, we formed Agrify-Valiant, LLC, a 60/40 joint-venture limited liability company, in which we are the 60% majority owner with Valiant-America, LLC, one of the largest premium integrated consulting and general contracting firms in North America with more than ten years of facility general contracting experience across many states.



On January 22, 2020, we and Agrify Merger Sub, Inc., our newly formed wholly owned subsidiary (or “Merger Sub”), entered into an Agreement of Merger with TriGrow Systems, Inc., a Nevada corporation (or “TriGrow”), pursuant to which TriGrow was merged with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub as the surviving corporation, resulting in our indirect acquisition of TriGrow.



On July 21, 2020, we acquired HMH, who we have had a close working relationship with for over three years, including the acquisition of HMH’s research and development, testing, and flexible manufacturing plant located just outside Atlanta, GA, along with key personnel and equipment. We believe this acquisition will give us increased, and in some respects, new in-house resources and capabilities around engineering, prototyping, manufacturing, testing, warehousing, and installation services.



On October 1, 2021, we acquired Mass2Media, LLC, d/b/a PX2 Holdings, LLC, d/b/a Precision Extraction Solutions (“Precision”) and Cascade Sciences, LLC (“Cascade”). As part of the acquisition of Precision, Precision merged with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, Precision Extraction NewCo, LLC.



On December 31, 2021, we acquired PurePressure, LLC (“PurePressure”), a leader in solventless extraction and advanced ice water hash processing equipment in the cannabis and hemp industry.



Subsequent to December 31, 2021, on February 1, 2022, we acquired LS Holdings Corp. (“Lab Society”), a leader in distillation and solvent separation for the cannabis and hemp industry. As part of the acquisition of Lab Society, Lab Society merged with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, Lab Society NewCo, LLC.



Regulatory Implications of Providing Equipment and Services in the Cannabis and Hemp Industry



We sell products and services that end users may purchase for use in industries or segments, including the growing of cannabis and hemp, which are subject to varying, inconsistent, and rapidly changing laws, regulations, administrative practices, enforcement approaches, judicial interpretations, and consumer perceptions. For example, certain countries and 36 U.S. states have adopted frameworks that authorize, regulate, and tax the cultivation, processing, sale, and use of cannabis for medicinal and/or non-medicinal use, while the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and the laws of other U.S. states prohibit growing cannabis. In addition, with the passage of the Farm Bill in December 2018, hemp cultivation is now broadly permitted. The Farm Bill explicitly allows the transfer of hemp-derived products across state lines for commercial or other purposes. It also removes restrictions on the sale, transport, or possession of hemp-derived products, so long as those items are produced in a manner consistent with the law. Our products are multi-purpose products and may be used on a wide range of plants and are purchased by cultivators who may grow any variety of plants, including cannabis and hemp.



Despite well over a majority of state laws decriminalizing varying types of its use, marijuana remains a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act, making it illegal under federal law in the United States to, among other things, cultivate, distribute or possess cannabis in the United States. In those states in which the use of marijuana has been legalized, its use remains a violation of federal law pursuant to the Controlled Substances Act. The Controlled Substances Act classifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled substance, and as such, medical and adult cannabis use is illegal under U.S. federal law. Unless and until the U.S. Congress amends the Controlled Substances Act with respect to marijuana (and the President approves such amendment), there is a risk that federal authorities may enforce current federal law. Financial transactions involving proceeds generated by, or intended to promote, cannabis-related business activities in the United States may form the basis for prosecution under applicable U.S. federal money laundering legislation. The approach to enforcement of such laws by the federal government in the United States has trended toward non-enforcement against individuals and businesses that comply with medical or adult-use cannabis regulatory programs in states where such programs are legal, strict compliance with state laws with respect to cannabis.



In most states that have legalized medical- and recreational-use cannabis in some form, the growing, processing and/or dispensing of cannabis generally requires that the operator obtain one or more licenses in accordance with applicable state requirements. In addition, many states regulate various aspects of the growing, processing and/or dispensing of cannabis and hemp. Local governments in some cases also impose rules and regulations on the manner of operating cannabis and hemp businesses. As a result, applicable state and local laws and regulations vary widely, including, but not limited to, regulations governing the medical cannabis program, product testing, the level of enforcement by state and local authorities on non-licensed cannabis operators, state and local taxation of regulated cannabis products, local municipality bans on operations and operator licensing processes and renewals.










As part of its rigorous due diligence policy on all potential customers, the Company carefully reviews the appropriate licensure of each potential customers in the cannabis and hemp industry for compliance with applicable local, state, and federal laws. The Company is not involved in the cultivation, processing or retail of cannabis products and never takes a controlling interest in any of the operations of its cannabis customers as a matter of state law.



Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company



We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, which we refer to as the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other companies that are not emerging growth companies. Accordingly, for so long as we are an “emerging growth company,” we will not be required to:

● | engage an auditor to report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes–Oxley Act; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB, regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis); 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as “say-on-pay,” “say-on-frequency,” and “say-on-golden parachutes;” or 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparison of the chief executive officer’s compensation to median employee compensation. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards.



We will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest to occur of:




● | our reporting $1 billion or more in annual gross revenues;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | our issuance, in a three-year period, of more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the end of the fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | December 31, 2026.
--+-------------------




We cannot predict if investors will find our securities less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions, which could result in a less active trading market for our securities and increased volatility in the price of our securities.



Finally, we are a “smaller reporting company” (and may continue to qualify as such even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company) and accordingly may provide less public disclosure than larger public companies, including the inclusion of only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations disclosure. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests.
