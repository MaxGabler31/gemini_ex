Business Strategy
Since 2016, our strategic vision has been based on the following elements and objectives:

Strategic Element | Strategic Objectives 
Solidifying the base | Risk Reduction 
Growing high margin products | Bottom-Line Growth 
Expansion into adjacent markets | Exceed Peer Performance 
 | Build a Platform for Future Accretive Growth

Solidifying the base—The Company’s historic base business is our low-bid heavy highway projects within our Transportation Solutions segment. Heavy highway projects typically have gross margins of 7-8%; however, prior to 2016 our gross margin was approximately 4%. In 2016, we implemented a strategy to solidify this base business by improving bid discipline to significantly reduce the probability of project losses. To execute this strategic focus, a key objective, risk reduction, was prioritized. Since the implementation of the strategy and application of the key objective, we have improved the heavy highway backlog gross margin to 9.5% as of December 31, 2021, and we expect gross margins to continue improving as projects bid prior to implementing our strategy come to a completion.
Growing high margin products—While solidifying the base is important to the profitability of the Company, the improvement of gross margins is limited due to the highly competitive bidding environment for heavy highway projects. In 2016, we implemented a strategy to shift our project mix from low-bid heavy highway projects to alternative delivery heavy highway projects and other higher margin work (e.g., airports, commercial, piling and shoring). In 2016, our low-bid heavy highway revenue was approximately 79% of our total revenue, but we have progressively brought that down to 19% as of December 31, 2021. The key objective in this strategic area is our focus on bottom-line growth and the higher margin projects we target have gross margins in the range of 12%-15%.
Expansion into adjacent markets—In 2016, we implemented a strategy to pursue growth through the acquisition of companies and assets that will enable us to broaden the types of projects we execute and also expand into adjacent markets. Since 2016, we have completed four acquisitions and plan to consider other strategic acquisitions in the future. The companies we target for acquisition typically have gross margins of 15% or more. Specifically, we expanded into adjacent markets and broadened the types of projects we execute through our 2017 acquisition of Tealstone and our recent acquisitions of Plateau, Kimes and Petillo. This strategic focus allows us to broaden our portfolio of products and services, and broaden our end customer base to remain competitive in the markets where we operate. 
Recent Acquisitions
Petillo Acquisition—On December 30, 2021, we completed our acquisition of Petillo Incorporated and its related entities (collectively, “Petillo”) for aggregate consideration of $204.6 million, consisting of $175.0 million in cash, 759,447 shares of the Company’s common stock, and a target working capital adjustment of $1.4 million. Petillo is a leading specialty site development contractor based in Flanders, New Jersey and serves the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic States, providing large-scale site infrastructure improvement services, including full-service excavation, underground utility construction, 
environmental remediation, drainage systems for commercial construction and water management and distribution systems. The results of Petillo are included within our E-Infrastructure Solutions segment. See Note 3 - Acquisitions for further discussion.
Kimes Acquisition—On December 28, 2021, we completed our acquisition of Kimes & Stone (“Kimes”) for an all-cash purchase price of $7.6 million. Kimes provides a diversified services offering of soil stabilization for site development on e-commerce projects such as large fulfillment and distribution centers and data centers, as well as soil stabilization for roadways and manufacturing plant construction. The transaction includes a fleet of soil stabilization equipment and working capital. The results of Kimes are included within Plateau which is included within our E-Infrastructure Solutions segment.
Plateau Acquisition—On October 2, 2019, we completed our acquisition of Plateau Excavation, Inc. and its related entities (collectively, “Plateau”) for aggregate consideration of $427.5 million, consisting of $375.0 million in cash, a working capital adjustment of $21.3 million, 1.25 million shares of the Company’s common stock, a $10.0 million subordinated promissory note that bears interest at 8% and a tax basis election of $5.0 million. Plateau is engaged in executing site development for general contractors and developers on e-commerce projects such as large fulfillment and distribution centers and data centers. The results of Plateau are included within our E-Infrastructure Solutions segment.
Segments, Markets and Customers
The Company’s internal and public segment reporting are aligned based upon the services offered by its operating groups, which represent the reportable segments. With the December 30, 2021 acquisition of Petillo, the Company realigned its operating groups to reflect management’s present oversight of operations. After realignment, the Company’s operations consist of three reportable segments: Transportation Solutions, E-Infrastructure Solutions and Building Solutions, with our commercial business reclassified from the previously reported Specialty Services operating group into our newly formed Building Solutions operating group. See Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 21 - Segment Information for further discussion of our business segments.
    Transportation Solutions—Our Transportation Solutions segment is comprised of heavy highway, aviation and rail, and relies heavily on federal and state infrastructure spending. The principal markets of this segment are Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Nevada, Texas and Utah. Within these principal markets, our core customers are the Departments of Transportation (“DOT(s)”) in various states, regional transit authorities, airport authorities, port authorities, water authorities and railroads. In our Transportation Solutions segment, four state DOTs accounted for 42% of that segment’s revenue in 2021, 44% in 2020 and 43% in 2019.
E-Infrastructure Solutions—Our E-Infrastructure Solutions segment serves large, blue-chip end users in the e-commerce, data center, distribution center and warehousing and energy sectors. We are a leading provider of large-scale specialty site infrastructure improvement contracting services in the Southeastern, Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic U.S. In our E-Infrastructure Solutions segment, four customers accounted for 58% of that segment’s revenue in 2021 and 44% in 2020.
Building Solutions—Our Building Solutions segment is comprised of our residential and commercial businesses. The principal market for our residential business is Texas, specifically the Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston areas and the surrounding communities; and in 2021 we expanded our footprint into Phoenix, Arizona. Our core residential customer base is comprised of leading national home builders as well as regional and custom home builders. Our commercial business focuses on concrete construction of multi-family foundations, parking structures, elevated slabs and other concrete work for leading developers and general contractors in commercial markets. In our Building Solutions segment, four customers, including their respective affiliates, accounted for 57% of that segment’s revenue in 2021, 50% in 2020 and 46% in 2019.
We did not have any customers contribute more than 10% of our consolidated revenues in 2021; however we routinely construct projects for our largest customers mentioned above. If we lost any of these customers, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Refer to Item 1A “Risk Factors” and Note 19 - Concentration of Risk and Enterprise Wide Disclosures for the Company’s major customers that represent a concentration of risk due to their significant revenue contributions.
Competition
Competition for our segments ranges from small local contractors to large international construction companies. We traditionally try to position ourselves to bid on work too large for the small local contractors yet too small for the large national and international construction companies. However, if market conditions became less favorable, we would tend to see migration from both the small local contractors and large international players into that mid-level market. This, in return, could increase competitive bidding pressure and reduce both revenue growth and margins. See Item 1A “Risk Factors” for further discussion of risks associated with our competitive environment.
Seasonality
Operations for our segments are typically affected by weather conditions primarily during the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year, which may alter construction schedules and can create variability in our revenues, profitability and the required number of employees. For additional discussion regarding the potential impacts of seasonality on our business, see Item 1A “Risk Factors—Adverse weather conditions may cause delays, which could slow completion of our construction activity.”
Resources
We purchase raw materials for our segments, including but not limited to, cement, aggregate, concrete, liquid asphalt, lumber, steel, diesel and gasoline fuel, natural gas and propane from numerous sources. The price and availability of raw materials may vary from year to year due to fluctuations in market conditions and production capacities.
Backlog
    Our remaining performance obligations on our projects are referred to as “Backlog” and represent the amount of revenues we expect to recognize in the future from our contract commitments on projects. The value of our Backlog was $1.49 billion at December 31, 2021, as compared to $1.18 billion at December 31, 2020. We exclude from Backlog contracts where we are the apparent low bidder for projects (“Unsigned Low-bid Awards”) until the contract is executed by our customer (approximately $22.5 million at December 31, 2021). Certain Building Solutions revenue is recognized upon completion at a point in time and therefore is never reflected in our backlog. See Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Market Outlook and Trends” for discussion and quantification of our Backlog. Also see Item 1A “Risk Factors.”
Contracts
Our contracts are awarded on a competitively bid basis or negotiated bid basis using a range of contracting options, including fixed-unit price, lump sum and cost-reimbursable. Each contract is designed to optimize the balance between risk and reward. At December 31, 2021, substantially all of our backlog was contracted on a fixed-unit price or lump sum basis. We occasionally present claims or change orders to our clients for additional costs exceeding a contract price or for costs not included in the original contract price.
Substantially all of the contracts in our Backlog contain “termination for convenience” clauses which allow the customer to cancel the contract at their election but require that the Company be paid for work performed through the date of termination. As part of our business, we are a party to joint venture arrangements, pursuant to which we typically jointly bid on and execute particular projects with other companies in the construction industry. See Item 1A “Risk Factors” and Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a discussion of our types of risk and how we mitigate cancellation and credit risk.
Insurance and Bonding
Our buildings and equipment are covered by insurance, at levels our management believes to be adequate. In addition, we maintain general liability, excess liability, workers’ compensation and auto insurance all in amounts consistent with our risk of loss and industry practice.
As a normal part of the Transportation Solutions business and occasionally with the E-Infrastructure Solutions business, we are required to provide various types of surety and payment bonds that provide an additional measure of security for our performance under the contract. Typically, a bidder for a contract must post a bid bond, generally for 5% to 10% of the bid amount, and on being awarded the bid, must post a performance and payment bond for up to 100% of the costs to construct. Usually, upon posting of the performance bond, a contractor must also post a maintenance bond for generally 1% of the contract amount for one to two years. Our ability to obtain bonds depends upon our capitalization, working capital, aggregate contract size, past performance, management expertise and external factors, including the capacity of the overall surety market. Bonding companies consider such factors in light of the amount of our backlog that we have currently bonded and their current underwriting standards, which may change from time to time. As is customary, we have agreed to indemnify our bonding company for all losses incurred by it in connection with bonds that are issued, and we have granted our bonding company a security interest in certain assets, including accounts receivable, as collateral for such obligation.
Government and Environmental Regulations
Our operations are subject to compliance with numerous regulatory requirements of federal, state and local agencies and authorities, including regulations concerning safety, wage and hour, and other labor issues, immigration controls, vehicle and equipment operations and other aspects of our business. For example, our operations are subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state laws directed toward the protection of employees. In addition, most of our Transportation Solutions construction contracts are entered into with public authorities, and these contracts frequently impose additional governmental requirements, including requirements regarding labor relations and subcontracting with designated classes of disadvantaged businesses.
All of our operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, including those relating to discharges into air, water and land, climate change, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, the handling of underground storage tanks and the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substances. For example, we must apply water or chemicals to reduce dust on road construction projects and to contain contaminants in storm run-off water at construction sites. In certain circumstances, we may also be required to hire subcontractors to dispose of hazardous wastes encountered on a project in accordance with a plan approved in advance by the customer. Certain environmental laws impose substantial penalties for non-compliance and others, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, impose strict and retroactive joint and several liability upon persons responsible for releases of hazardous substances.
CERCLA and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, and, in some instances, third parties, to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur.
Solid wastes, which may include hazardous wastes, are subject to the requirements of the Federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, referred to as RCRA, and comparable state statutes. Although we do not generate solid waste, we occasionally dispose of solid waste on behalf of customers. From time to time, the EPA considers the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non-hazardous wastes. Moreover, it is possible that additional wastes will in the future be designated as “hazardous wastes.” Hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements than are non-hazardous wastes.
We continually evaluate whether we must take additional steps at our locations to ensure compliance with environmental laws. While compliance with applicable regulatory requirements has not materially adversely affected our operations in the past, there can be no assurance these requirements will not change and compliance will not adversely affect our operations in the future. In addition, tighter regulation for the protection of the environment and other factors may make it more difficult to obtain new permits and renewal of existing permits may be subject to more restrictive conditions than currently exist.
Human Capital
At December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately 2,900 employees, comprised of approximately 700 salaried employees and approximately 2,200 hourly employees. The percentage of our employees represented by unions at December 31, 2021 was approximately 14%. We have agreements, which we customarily renew periodically, with various unions representing groups of employees at project sites. We consider our relationships with our employees and the applicable labor unions to be satisfactory.
Our business is dependent upon a readily available supply of management, supervisory and field personnel. Substantially all of our employees are hired on a full-time basis; however, as is typical in the construction industry, we experience a high degree of turnover as construction projects are completed. In the past, we have been able to attract a sufficient number of personnel to support the growth of our operations; however, we continue to face competition for experienced workers in all our markets.
Our employees are important to the success of our business. Hiring, developing and retaining our employees is not only important, but is a necessity for continued growth and delivery at all levels within our organization. Every employee is critical to the success of our organization and we strive daily to ensure that we are managing our workforce’s needs and requirements. We often work in tight labor markets that make hiring and retaining employees challenging. Therefore, it is critical to have a strategic plan for hiring and managing our workforce. We develop hiring practices by geographic area to ensure a customizable 
recruiting strategy that allows all of our businesses to thrive. Retaining our employees through various means of succession planning and other retention tools is also a critical component of our strategy, particularly for our key positions. Planning for today as well as the future is the cornerstone of our people strategy.
Our focus on diversity is at the forefront of how we operate in each of our locations. We strive to instill an inclusive culture that allows all employees the opportunity to thrive. 
As of December 31, 2021, our workforce was comprised of the following race and ethnicity demographics:

Employees as of December 31, 2021
Hispanic | 47.1%
White | 44.2%
Black | 4.0% 
Pacific Islander | 2.5% 
Other | 2.2% 

We focus on our safety processes which have allowed us to maintain a high level of safety at our work sites. All project employees receive hazard specific training and our newly-hired employees undergo an initial safety orientation and receive follow-up trainings during their first 90 days of employment. Our project managers and superintendents work closely with the safety department to ensure safety is planned into all of our operations before they begin. Daily, our project foremen are required to conduct safety briefings with employees. Regular safety walkthroughs are conducted by our managers, supervisors and safety staff to evaluate project conditions and observe employee safety behavior. To address the safety and health of our workforce due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented additional employee health and safety protocols. For the Company’s office-based personnel, the Company is social distancing and, when needed, working from home. For personnel onsite at the Company’s construction sites, the Company has taken mitigation measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, including but not limited to, social distancing, wellness checks, providing sanitation stations and wearing personal protective equipment.
