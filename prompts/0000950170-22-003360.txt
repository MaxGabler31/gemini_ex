 Item 1. Business.
Throughout this section, references to “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Alight and its consolidated subsidiaries as the context so requires.
 We are a leading cloud-based provider of integrated digital human capital and business solutions. We have an unwavering belief that a company’s success starts with its people, and our solutions connect human insights with technology. The Alight Worklife employee engagement platform provides a seamless customer experience by combining content, plus artificial intelligence ("AI") and data analytics to enable Alight's business process as a service ("BPaaS") model. Our mission-critical solutions enable employees to enrich their health, wealth and wellbeing which helps global organizations achieve a high-performance culture.
 There are many factors today impacting how organizations can succeed and thrive in the future. Employees are facing increasing complexity around healthcare and retirement, and the burden of additional financial responsibility from healthcare costs being shifted from employers to employees. These trends have driven the need for integrated, personalized tools to help them make informed decisions. Employers are facing ever-changing workforce regulations and evolving dynamics across the employer/employee relationship, driving the need for flexibility, engagement and effective solutions for compliance. Alight is uniquely positioned between the employer and employee to address these factors to ultimately drive better outcomes for both.
 We aim to be the pre-eminent employee engagement partner by providing personalized experiences that help employees make the best decisions for themselves and their families about their health, wealth and wellbeing every day. At the same time, we help employers tackle their biggest people and business challenges by helping them understand prevalence, trends and risks to generate better outcomes for the future and get a return on their people investment. Using data, analytics and AI, we derive actionable insights to deliver the business and people outcomes organizations need. We provide solutions to manage health and retirement benefits, tools for payroll and HR management, as well as solutions to manage the workforce from the cloud. Our solutions include:
 Employer Solutions: driven by our digital, software and AI-led capabilities powered by the Alight Worklife platform and spanning total employee wellbeing and engagement, including integrated benefits administration, healthcare navigation, financial health, employee wellbeing and payroll. We leverage data across all interactions and activities to improve the employee experience, reduce operational costs and better inform management processes and decision-making. In addition, employees benefit from an integrated platform and user experience, coupled with a full-service client care center, helping them manage the full life cycle of their health, wealth and careers.
 Professional Services: includes our project-based cloud deployment and consulting offerings that provide expertise with both human capital and financial platforms. Specifically, this includes cloud advisory and deployment, and optimization services for cloud platforms such as Workday, SAP SuccessFactors, Oracle, and Cornerstone OnDemand.
We deliver our solutions through a set of proprietary and partner technologies, a well-developed network of providers and a structured approach to instill and sustain enterprise-wide practices of excellence. Our solutions are supported through a highly secure and scalable cloud infrastructure, together with our core benefits processing platforms and consumer engagement tools, and integrated with over 350 external platforms and partners. Our data and access across the breadth of human capital solutions provides us with comprehensive employee records to enable AI-driven, omnichannel engagement and a personalized, integrated experience for our clients’ employees. Through the use of predictive analytics and omnichannel engagement, Alight is able to tailor an employee experience that is unique to each individual’s needs and circumstance.
 We generate primarily all of our revenue, which is highly recurring, from fees for services provided from contracts across all solutions, which is primarily based on a contracted fee charged per participant per period (e.g., monthly or annually, as applicable). Our contracts typically have three to five-year terms for ongoing services with mutual renewal options. The majority of the Company’s revenue is recognized over time when control of the promised services is transferred and the customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits of our services. Payment terms are consistent with industry practice.
 We use annual revenue retention rates as some of the measures to manage our business. We calculate annual revenue retention by identifying the clients from whom we generate revenue in the prior year and determining what percentage of that revenue is generated from those same clients for the same solutions in the subsequent year.
 Human Capital Management
 As of December 31, 2021, we employed more than 16,000 colleagues, approximately 67% of whom were located in the Americas, 19% were located in Europe, and 14% were located in Asia. In the United States, 64% of our colleagues identified as

female and 37% of our colleagues self-identified as a minority group. We believe that our relations with our colleagues in all locations are positive.
 Attracting, developing, and retaining talent is critical to executing our strategy and our ability to compete effectively. We believe in the importance of creating a diverse and inclusive work environment for our colleagues, supporting their wellbeing with fair and market-competitive pay and benefits, and investing in their growth and development.
 We also value feedback from our colleagues and regularly survey them to understand how they feel about the company and subsequently take appropriate actions and employ employee engagement best practices to improve their work experience. Our efforts have resulted in being recognized as a Great Place to Work® for the fourth consecutive year and a Best Place to Work by Parents@Work and was listed among the top 100 companies for remote workers by Flexjobs.
 Inclusion and Diversity
At Alight, we are committed to creating a sense of belonging in the workplace, and to making Alight a place where all colleagues can feel happy and fulfilled while serving our clients and their people with excellence. In 2021, we earned a perfect score on the Human Right Campaign Foundation’s Corporate Equality Index for the third consecutive year. We continually work to build a better Alight for our colleagues and other stakeholders. We value diverse viewpoints and inclusive experiences and strive for balanced representation in our overall organization. We foster a culture of respect and inclusion in various ways, including offering unconscious bias and diversity training, tracking gender diversity, and celebrating diversity through global cultural appreciation initiatives. In addition, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors reviews and makes recommendations regarding the composition and size of our Board of Directors to ensure, among other things, that our Board of Director membership consists of persons with sufficiently diverse and independent backgrounds.
 Total Rewards
Our benefits are designed to help colleagues and their families stay healthy, meet their financial goals, protect their income and help them balance their work and personal lives. These benefits include health and wellness, paid time off, employee assistance, competitive pay, career growth opportunities, paid volunteer time, and a culture of recognition.
Growth and Development
 We understand that developing our talent is both critical for continuing success in a rapidly evolving environment and for colleague engagement and retention, and we are committed to actively fostering a learning culture and investing in ongoing professional and career development for our colleagues. We empower managers and employees with collective accountability for developing themselves and others, and promote ongoing dialogue, coaching, feedback, and improvement through our continuous performance management practices. We offer employees an extensive number of programs and tools for their personal and professional development including instructor-led training courses, leadership development programs, on-demand virtual learning, individual development planning, roles-based functional and technical training, compliance training, peer learning opportunities, and tuition reimbursement programs. We also aligned our talent and succession planning framework at a global level for our Director-level and above roles to support the development of our internal talent pipeline for current and future organizational needs, and to provide an overall health gauge of our global talent pool. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors oversees and approves the management continuity planning process.
