Item 1. Business.
Business Overview
Icahn Enterprises L.P. (“Icahn Enterprises”) is a master limited partnership formed in Delaware on February 17, 1987. Icahn Enterprises Holdings L.P. (“Icahn Enterprises Holdings”) is a limited partnership formed in Delaware on February 17, 1987. References to "we," "our" or "us" herein include both Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings and their subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. 
Icahn Enterprises owns a 99% limited partner interest in Icahn Enterprises Holdings. Icahn Enterprises G.P. Inc. (“Icahn Enterprises GP”), which is indirectly owned and controlled by Mr. Carl C. Icahn, owns a 1% general partner interest in each of Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings as of December 31, 2017. Icahn Enterprises Holdings and its subsidiaries own substantially all of our assets and liabilities and conduct substantially all of our operations. Therefore, the financial results of Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings are substantially the same, with differences relating primarily to debt, as discussed further in Note 10, "Debt," to the consolidated financial statements, and the allocation of the general partner interest, which is reflected as an aggregate 1.99% general partner interest in the financial statements of Icahn Enterprises. Mr. Icahn and his affiliates owned approximately 91.0% of Icahn Enterprises' outstanding depositary units as of March 1, 2018. 
We conduct our activities in a manner so as not to be deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended ("Investment Company Act"). Generally, this means that we do not invest or intend to invest in securities as our primary business and that no more than 40% of our total assets will be invested in investment securities as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act. In addition, we intend to structure our investments so as to continue to be taxed as a partnership rather than as a corporation under the applicable publicly traded partnership rules of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
Mr. Icahn's estate has been designed to assure the stability and continuation of Icahn Enterprises with no need to monetize his interests for estate tax or other purposes. In the event of Mr. Icahn's death, control of Mr. Icahn's interests in Icahn Enterprises and its general partner will be placed in charitable and other trusts under the control of senior Icahn Enterprises executives and family members.
We are a diversified holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in the following operating businesses: Investment, Automotive, Energy, Railcar, Gaming, Metals, Mining, Food Packaging, Real Estate and Home Fashion, as discussed further below. 
Business Strategy and Core Strengths
The Icahn Strategy
Across all of our businesses, our success is based on a simple formula: we seek to find undervalued companies in the Graham & Dodd tradition, a methodology for valuing stocks that primarily looks for deeply depressed prices. However, while the typical Graham & Dodd value investor purchases undervalued securities and waits for results, we often become actively involved in the companies we target. That activity may involve a broad range of approaches, from influencing the management of a target to take steps to improve shareholder value, to acquiring a controlling interest or outright ownership of the target company in order to implement changes that we believe are required to improve its business, and then operating and expanding that business. This activism has typically brought about very strong returns over the years.
Today, we are a diversified holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in ten diversified reporting segments. As of December 31, 2017, through our Investment segment, we have significant positions in various investments, which include American International Group, Inc. (AIG), Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG), Herbalife Ltd. (HLF), Freeport McMoRan Inc. (FCX), Xerox Corporation (XRX), Navistar International Corp. (NAV), Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. (HTZ) and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL).
Several of our operating businesses started out as investment positions in debt or equity securities, held either directly by us or Mr. Icahn. Those positions ultimately resulted in control or complete ownership of the target company. For example, in 2012, we acquired a controlling interest in CVR Energy, Inc. (‘‘CVR Energy’’), which started out as a position in our Investment segment and is now an operating subsidiary that comprises our Energy segment. The acquisition of CVR Energy, like our other operating subsidiaries, reflects our opportunistic approach to value creation, through which returns may be obtained by, among other things, promoting change through minority positions at targeted companies in our Investment segment or by acquiring control of those target companies that we believe we could run more profitably ourselves.
During the next several years, we see a favorable opportunity to follow an activist strategy that centers on the purchase of target stock and the subsequent removal of any barriers that might interfere with a friendly purchase offer from a strong buyer. 
2

Alternatively, in appropriate circumstances, we or our subsidiaries may become the buyer of target companies, adding them to our portfolio of operating subsidiaries, thereby expanding our operations through such opportunistic acquisitions. We believe that the companies that we target for our activist activities are undervalued for many reasons, often including inept management. Unfortunately for the individual investor, in particular, and the economy, in general, many poor management teams are often unaccountable and very difficult to remove.
Unlike the individual investor, we have the wherewithal to purchase companies that we feel we can operate more effectively than incumbent management. In addition, through our Investment segment, we are in a position to pursue our activist strategy by purchasing stock or debt positions and trying to promulgate change through a variety of activist approaches, ranging from speaking and negotiating with Boards of Directors and Chief Executive Officers ("CEO") to proxy fights, tender offers and acquiring control. We work diligently to enhance value for all shareholders and we believe that the best way to do this is to make underperforming management teams and Boards of Directors accountable or to replace them.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of our general partner, Carl C. Icahn, has been an activist investor since 1980. Mr. Icahn believes that the current environment continues to be conducive to activism. Many major companies have substantial amounts of cash. We believe that they are hoarding cash, rather than spending it, because they do not believe investments in their business will translate to earnings.
We believe that one of the best ways for many cash-rich companies to achieve increased earnings is to use their large amounts of excess cash, together with advantageous borrowing opportunities, to purchase other companies in their industries and take advantage of the meaningful synergies that could result. In our opinion, the CEOs and Boards of Directors of undervalued companies that would be acquisition targets are the major road blocks to this logical use of assets to increase value, because we believe those CEOs and Boards of Directors are not willing to give up their power and perquisites, even if they have done a poor job in administering the companies they have been running. In addition, acquirers are often unwilling to undertake the arduous task of launching a hostile campaign. This is precisely the situation in which we believe a strong activist catalyst is necessary.
We believe that the activist catalyst adds value because, for companies with strong balance sheets, acquisitions of their weaker industry rivals is often extremely compelling financially. We further believe that there are many transactions that make economic sense, even at a large premium over market. Acquirers can use their excess cash, that is earning a very low return, and/or borrow at the advantageous interest rates now available, to acquire a target company. In either case, an acquirer can add the target company’s earnings and the income from synergies to the acquirer’s bottom line, at a relatively low cost. But for these potential acquirers to act, the target company must be willing to at least entertain an offer. We believe that often the activist can step in and remove the obstacles that a target generally may seek to use to prevent an acquisition.
It is our belief that our strategy will continue to produce strong results into the future. We believe that the strong cash flow and asset coverage from our operating subsidiaries will allow us to maintain a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity.
Core Strengths
We believe that our core strengths include: identifying and acquiring undervalued assets and businesses, often through the purchase of distressed securities; increasing value through management, financial or other operational changes; and managing complex legal, regulatory or financial issues, which may include bankruptcy or insolvency, environmental, zoning, permitting and licensing issues.
The key elements of our business strategy include the following:
Capitalize on Growth Opportunities in our Existing Businesses.  We believe that we have developed a strong portfolio of businesses with experienced management teams. We may expand our existing businesses if appropriate opportunities are identified, as well as use our established businesses as a platform for additional acquisitions in the same or related areas.
Drive Accountability and Financial Discipline in the Management of our Business. Our CEO is accountable directly to our Board of Directors of our general partner, including the Chairman, Carl C. Icahn, and has day-to-day responsibility, in consultation with our Chairman, for general oversight of our business segments. We continually evaluate our operating subsidiaries with a view towards maximizing value and cost efficiencies, bringing an owner's perspective to our operating businesses. In each of these businesses, we assemble senior management teams with the expertise to run their businesses and boards of directors to oversee the management of those businesses. Each management team is responsible for the day-to-day operations of its businesses and directly accountable to its board of directors. 
Seek to Acquire Undervalued Assets.  We intend to continue to make investments in businesses that we believe are undervalued and have potential for growth. We also seek to capitalize on investment opportunities arising from market inefficiencies, economic or market trends that have not been identified and reflected in market value, or complex or special situations. Certain opportunities may arise from companies that experience disappointing financial results, liquidity or capital needs, lowered credit ratings, revised industry forecasts or legal complications. We may acquire businesses or assets directly or 
3

we may establish an ownership position through the purchase of debt or equity securities in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.
Use Activism to Unlock Value. As described above, we become actively involved in companies in which we invest.  Such activism may involve a broad range of activities, from trying to influence management in a proxy fight, to taking outright control of a company in order to bring about the change we think is required to unlock value. The key is flexibility, permanent capital and the willingness and ability to have a long-term investment horizon.
Segment Information
Icahn Enterprises began as American Real Estate Partners L.P. in 1987 and has grown its portfolio to ten diversified reporting segments, as discussed above. We report segment information based on the various industries in which our businesses operate and the strategies we use to manage them. With the exception of our Investment segment, our operating segments primarily comprise independently operated businesses that we have obtained a controlling interest in through execution of our business strategy. Our Investment segment derives revenues from gains and losses from investment transactions. Our other operating segments derive revenues principally from net sales of various products, primarily within our Automotive and Energy segments, which together accounted for more than 90% of our consolidated net sales for each of the three years ended December 31, 2017. Our other operating segments' revenues are also derived through various other revenue streams which primarily consists of services, leasing and casino operations. Geographically, the majority of our consolidated revenues are derived from customers in the United States. Our Automotive segment accounts for the significant majority of our consolidated revenues derived from customers outside the United States. 
Segment and geographic information for our reporting segments as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 and for each of the three years ended December 31, 2017 is presented in Note 13, “Segment and Geographic Reporting,” to the consolidated financial statements. Certain additional information with respect to our segments is discussed below. 
Investment
Our Investment segment is comprised of various private investment funds ("Investment Funds") in which we have general partner interests and through which we invest our proprietary capital. We and certain of Mr. Icahn's wholly owned affiliates are the sole investors in the Investment Funds. As general partner, we provide investment advisory and certain administrative and back office services to the Investment Funds but do not provide such services to any other entities, individuals or accounts. Interests in the Investment Funds are not offered to outside investors. 
Investment Strategy
The investment strategy of the Investment Funds is set and led by Mr. Icahn. The Investment Funds seek to acquire securities in companies that trade at a discount to inherent value as determined by various metrics, including replacement cost, break-up value, cash flow and earnings power and liquidation value.
The Investment Funds utilize a process-oriented, research-intensive, value-based investment approach. This approach generally involves three critical steps: (i) fundamental credit, valuation and capital structure analysis; (ii) intense legal and tax analysis of fulcrum issues such as litigation and regulation that often affect valuation; and (iii) combined business valuation analysis and legal and tax review to establish a strategy for gaining an attractive risk-adjusted investment position. This approach focuses on exploiting market dislocations or misjudgments that may result from market euphoria, litigation, complex contingent liabilities, corporate malfeasance and weak corporate governance, general economic conditions or market cycles and complex and inappropriate capital structures.
The Investment Funds are often activist investors ready to take the steps necessary to seek to unlock value, including tender offers, proxy contests and demands for management accountability. The Investment Funds may employ a number of strategies and are permitted to invest across a variety of industries and types of securities, including long and short equities, long and short bonds, bank debt and other corporate obligations, options, swaps and other derivative instruments thereof, risk arbitrage and capital structure arbitrage and other special situations. The Investment Funds invest a material portion of their capital in publicly traded equity and debt securities of companies that they believe to be undervalued by the marketplace. The Investment Funds often take significant positions in the companies in which they invest.
Income
Our Investment segment's income or loss is driven by the amount of funds allocated to the Investment Funds and the performance of the underlying investments in the Investment Funds. Funds allocated to the Investment Funds are based on the net contributions and redemptions by our Holding Company and by Mr. Icahn and his affiliates. 
4

Affiliate Investments
We and Mr. Icahn, along with the Investment Funds, have entered into a covered affiliate agreement, which was amended on March 31, 2011, pursuant to which Mr. Icahn agreed (on behalf of himself and certain of his affiliates, excluding Icahn Enterprises, Icahn Enterprises Holdings and their subsidiaries) to be bound by certain restrictions on their investments in any assets that we deem suitable for the Investment Funds, other than government and agency bonds and cash equivalents, unless otherwise approved by our Audit Committee. In addition, Mr. Icahn and such affiliates continue to have the right to co-invest with the Investment Funds. We have no interest in, nor do we generate any income from, any such co-investments, which have been and may continue to be substantial.
Automotive
We conduct our Automotive segment through our wholly owned subsidiaries Federal-Mogul LLC ("Federal-Mogul") and Icahn Automotive Group LLC ("Icahn Automotive"). Currently, we operate Federal-Mogul independently from Icahn Automotive, however, we generally discuss our automotive businesses together due to the nature of the industry in which they operate and how we manage these businesses in accordance with our investment strategies. 
Federal-Mogul
Federal-Mogul is a diversified, global supplier of automotive products to a variety of end markets. In order to improve management's focus for the respective business units, Federal-Mogul is operated with two end-customer focused business units, Powertrain and Motorparts. In January 2017, we increased our ownership in Federal-Mogul from 82% to 100%. In February 2017, Federal-Mogul was converted from a Delaware corporation to a Delaware limited liability company. Prior to this, Federal-Mogul was a majority owned subsidiary of ours with publicly traded common stock. 
Products, Services and Customers
Federal-Mogul is engaged in the manufacture and distribution of automotive parts. Federal-Mogul's Powertrain business unit focuses on original equipment powertrain products for automotive, heavy-duty and industrial applications, while its Motorparts business unit sells and distributes a broad portfolio of products in the global vehicle aftermarket, while also serving original equipment manufacturers with vehicle products including brakes, wipers and, to a limited extent, chassis components. 
Federal-Mogul's customers consist of automotive light vehicle, medium and heavy-duty commercial vehicle manufacturers as well as agricultural, off-highway, marine, railroad, aerospace, high-performance, power generation and industrial application manufacturers. Federal-Mogul's aftermarket customers include independent warehouse distributors that redistribute products to local parts suppliers, distributors, engine rebuilders, retail parts stores, mass merchants and service chains. 
Competition
The global vehicular parts business is highly competitive. Federal-Mogul competes with many independent manufacturers and distributors of component parts globally. In general, competition for sales is based on price, product quality, technology, delivery, customer service and the breadth of products offered by a given supplier. Federal-Mogul is meeting these competitive challenges by developing leading technologies, efficiently integrating and expanding its manufacturing and distribution operations, widening its product coverage within its core businesses, restructuring its operations and transferring production to best cost countries, and utilizing its worldwide technical centers to develop and provide value-added solutions to its customers. 
Research and Development
Federal-Mogul’s research and development activities are conducted at its technical centers located in the United States and internationally. Each of Federal-Mogul's business units is engaged in engineering and research and development efforts and works closely with customers to develop custom solutions to meet their needs. Total expenditures for research and development activities, including product engineering and validation costs, were $195 million, $192 million and $189 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
Intellectual Property
Federal-Mogul holds in excess of 6,500 patents and patent applications on a worldwide basis, of which more than 1,200 have been filed in the United States. Of the approximately 6,500 patents and patent applications, approximately 30% are in production use and/or are licensed to third parties, and the remaining 70% are being considered for future production use or provide a strategic technological benefit to Federal-Mogul.
Federal-Mogul does not materially rely on any single patent, nor will the expiration of any single patent materially affect its business. Federal-Mogul’s current patents expire over various periods into the year 2040. Federal-Mogul is actively introducing and patenting new technology to replace formerly patented technology before the expiration of the existing patents. In the aggregate, 
5

Federal-Mogul’s worldwide patent portfolio is materially important to its business because it enables it to achieve technological differentiation from its competitors.
Federal-Mogul also maintains more than 6,600 active trademark registrations and applications worldwide.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
Federal-Mogul purchases various raw materials and component parts for use in its manufacturing processes, including ferrous and non-ferrous metals, non-metallic raw materials, stampings, castings and forgings. Federal-Mogul has not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials, components or finished parts and normally does not carry inventories of raw materials or finished parts in excess of those reasonably required to meet its production and shipping schedules. Federal-Mogul, along with Icahn Automotive, also purchases parts manufactured by other manufacturers for sale in the aftermarket. 
Environmental Regulations
Federal-Mogul's operations, consistent with those of the manufacturing sector in general, are subject to numerous existing and proposed laws and governmental regulations designed to protect the environment, particularly regarding plant wastes and emissions and solid waste disposal. Capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment for environmental control activities did not have a material impact on Federal-Mogul's financial position or cash flows in 2017 and are not expected to have a material impact on its financial position or cash flows in 2018.
Icahn Automotive
Icahn Automotive is a wholly owned subsidiary formed by us to invest in and operate businesses involved in automotive repair and maintenance services as well as the distribution and sale of automotive aftermarket parts and accessories to end-user do-it-yourself customers, wholesale distributors, and professional auto mechanics. Icahn Automotive acquired IEH Auto Parts Holding LLC ("IEH Auto") in 2015, The Pep Boys - Manny, Moe & Jack ("Pep Boys") in 2016, the franchise businesses of Precision Tune Auto Care ("Precision Tune") and American Driveline Systems, the franchisor of AAMCO and Cottman Transmission service centers ("American Driveline"), in 2017, and various other businesses in recent years. 
Icahn Automotive operates in a highly competitive environment. Icahn Automotive's competitors for automotive service include national and regional chains, automotive dealerships, and local independent service providers. Its competitors for distribution and sales of auto parts and accessories include general, full range and discount retailers, national and regional auto parts retailers, and online retailers which carry automotive parts and accessories. Icahn Automotive believes that its operations in both do-it-for-me and do-it-yourself differentiates it from most of their competitors.
Energy
We conduct our Energy segment through our majority ownership in CVR Energy. CVR Energy is a reporting company under the Exchange Act and files annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") that are publicly available. As of December 31, 2017, we owned 82.0% of the total outstanding common stock of CVR Energy. 
CVR Energy is a diversified holding company primarily engaged in the petroleum refining and nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing industries through its holdings in CVR Refining, LP (“CVR Refining”) and CVR Partners, LP (“CVR Partners”), respectively. CVR Refining is an independent petroleum refiner and marketer of high value transportation fuels. CVR Partners produces and markets nitrogen fertilizers in the form of urea ammonium nitrate ("UAN") and ammonia. CVR Energy has a general partner interest in CVR Refining and CVR Partners and also owns approximately 66.0% of the outstanding common units of CVR Refining and 34.0% of the outstanding common units of CVR Partners as of December 31, 2017. In addition, we directly owned approximately 3.9% of the total outstanding common units of CVR Refining as of December 31, 2017.
On August 2, 2016, we sold 250,000 common units of CVR Refining. As a result of this transaction, we and our affiliates collectively own 69.99% of CVR Refining. Pursuant to CVR Refining’s partnership agreement, in certain circumstances, the general partner of CVR Refining has the right to purchase all, but not less than all, of CVR Refining's common units held by unaffiliated unit holders at a price not less than their then-current market price, as calculated pursuant to the terms of such partnership agreement (the “CVR Refining Call Right”). Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement, because our holdings were reduced to less than 70.0%, the ownership threshold for the application of such CVR Refining Call Right was permanently reduced from 95% to 80%. Accordingly, if at any time the general partner of CVR Refining and its affiliates owns more than 80% of CVR Refining's common units, it will have the right, but not the obligation, to exercise such CVR Refining Call Right.
Products, Raw Materials and Supply
CVR Refining has the capability to process a variety of crude oil blends. CVR Refining's oil refineries in Coffeyville, Kansas and Wynnewood, Oklahoma have a combined capacity of approximately 185,000 barrels per calendar day, representing 
6

approximately 23% of the region's refining capacity. Crude oil is supplied to its refineries through a wholly-owned gathering system and by owned, leased and joint venture pipelines. Petroleum refining product yield includes gasoline, diesel fuel, pet coke and other refined products such as natural gas liquids, asphalt and jet fuel among other products. 
CVR Partners produces and distributes nitrogen fertilizer products, which are used primarily by farmers to improve the yield and quality of their crops. The principal products are UAN and ammonia. CVR Partners' Coffeyville, Kansas facility uses pet coke to produce nitrogen fertilizer and is supplied primarily by its adjacent crude oil refinery pursuant to a renewable long-term agreement with CVR Refining. Historically, the Coffeyville nitrogen fertilizer plant has obtained the remainder of its pet coke requirements from third parties such as other Midwestern refineries or pet coke brokers at spot-prices. CVR Partners' East Dubuque, Illinois facility uses natural gas to produce nitrogen fertilizer. The East Dubuque facility is able to purchase natural gas at competitive prices due to its connection to the Norther Natural Gas interstate pipeline system, which is within one mile of the facility, and the ANR Pipeline Company pipeline. 
Customers, Marketing and Distribution
Customers for CVR Refining's products primarily include retailers, railroads, and farm cooperatives and other refiners/marketers in Group 3 of the PADD II region because of their relative proximity to the refineries and pipeline access. CVR Refining sells bulk products to long-standing customers at spot market prices based on a Group 3 basis differential to prices quoted on the New York Mercantile Exchange, which are reported by industry market-related indices such as Platts and Oil Price Information Service. CVR Refining's rack sales are at posted prices that are influenced by competitor pricing and Group 3 spot market differentials. Additionally, CVR Refining supplies jet fuel to the U.S. Department of Defense. For the year ended December 31, 2017, one customer accounted for approximately 19% of CVR Refining's net sales and approximately 52% of CVR Refining's net sales were made to its ten largest customers.
CVR Refining sells and distributes directly to its customers by tanker truck and railcar and also at throughput terminals on the refined products distribution systems of Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. ("Magellan") and NuStar Energy, L.P ("NuStar"). CVR Refining focuses its marketing efforts in the central mid-continent area because of its relative proximity to its refineries and pipeline access and the southern portion of the Magellan system which covers all of Oklahoma, parts of Arkansas as well as eastern Missouri, and all other Magellan terminals. CVR Refining also has access to the Rocky Mountain area as well as the Texas markets and some adjoining states with pipeline connections. CVR Refining also makes bulk sales (sales into third-party pipelines) into the mid-continent markets and other destinations utilizing the product pipeline networks owned by Magellan, Enterprise Products Partners, L.P. and NuStar. The outbound Enterprise Pipeline Red Line provides CVR Refining with access to the NuStar Refined Products Pipeline system. This allows gasoline and ultra-low sulfur diesel product sales from Kansas up into North Dakota.
CVR Partners sells UAN products to retailers and distributors. In addition, it sells ammonia to agricultural and industrial customers. CVR Partners' primary markets for its products are in Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska and Texas. Its products are primarily distributed by truck or by railcar. Given the nature of its business, and consistent with industry practice, CVR Partners does not have long-term minimum purchase contracts with most of its agricultural customers.
Competition
CVR Energy's petroleum business competes primarily on the basis of price, reliability of supply, availability of multiple grades of products and location. The principal competitive factors affecting its refining operations are cost of crude oil and other feedstock costs, refinery complexity, refinery efficiency, refinery product mix and product distribution and transportation costs. The location of the refineries provides the petroleum business with a reliable supply of crude oil and a transportation cost advantage over its competitors. The petroleum business primarily competes against five refineries operated in the mid-continent region. In addition to these refineries, the refineries compete against trading companies, as well as other refineries located outside the region that are linked to the mid-continent market through an extensive product pipeline system. These competitors include refineries located near the Gulf Coast and the Texas panhandle region. The petroleum business refinery competition also includes branded, integrated and independent oil refining companies, such as Phillips 66 Company, HollyFrontier Corporation, CHS Inc., Valero Energy Corporation and Flint Hills Resources LLC.
The nitrogen fertilizer business has experienced, and expect to continue to meet, significant levels of competition from current and potential competitors, many of whom have significantly greater financial and other resources. Competition in the nitrogen fertilizer industry is dominated by price considerations. However, during the spring and fall application seasons, farming activities intensify and delivery capacity is a significant competitive factor. Domestic competition is intense due to customers' sophisticated buying tendencies and competitor strategies that focus on cost and service. The nitrogen fertilizer business also encounters competition from producers of fertilizer products manufactured in foreign countries. In certain cases, foreign producers of fertilizer who export to the United States may be subsidized by their respective governments.

Environmental Regulations
CVR Energy's petroleum and nitrogen fertilizer businesses are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state and local, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations governing the emission and release of hazardous substances into the environment, the treatment and discharge of waste water, and the storage, handling, use and transportation of petroleum and nitrogen products, and the characteristics and composition of gasoline and diesel fuels. These laws and regulations, their underlying regulatory requirements and the enforcement thereof impact the petroleum business and operations and the nitrogen fertilizer business and operations by imposing:

• | restrictions on operations or the need to install enhanced or additional controls;


• | the need to obtain and comply with permits, licenses and authorizations;


• | liability for the investigation and remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater at current and former facilities (if any) and for off-site waste disposal locations; and


• | specifications for the products marketed by the petroleum business and the nitrogen fertilizer business, primarily gasoline, diesel fuel, UAN and ammonia.

CVR Energy's operations require numerous permits, licenses and authorizations. Failure to comply with these permits or environmental laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties or other sanctions or a revocation of CVR Energy's permits. In addition, the laws and regulations to which CVR Energy is subject to are often evolving and many of them have become more stringent or have become subject to more stringent interpretation or enforcement by federal or state agencies. These laws and regulations could result in increased capital, operating and compliance costs. 
CVR Energy's businesses are also subject to, or impacted by, various other environmental laws and regulations such as the federal Clean Air Act, the federal Clean Water Act, release reporting requirements relating to the release of hazardous substances into the environment, certain fuel regulations, renewable fuel standards, as discussed below, and various other laws and regulations. 
Renewable Fuel Standards
CVR Refining is subject to the Renewable Fuel Standard which requires refiners to either blend "renewable fuels" with their transportation fuels or purchase renewable fuel credits, known as renewable identification numbers (“RINs”), in lieu of blending. See Item 1A, "Risk Factors" and Note 17, "Commitments and Contingencies," to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
Safety, Health and Security Matters
CVR Energy is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations related to safety, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act ("OSHA") and comparable state statutes, the purpose of which are to protect the health and safety of workers. CVR Energy is also subject to OSHA Process Safety Management regulations, which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals. 
CVR Energy operates a comprehensive safety, health and security program, with participation by employees at all levels of the organization. They have developed comprehensive safety programs aimed at preventing OSHA recordable incidents. Despite CVR Energy's efforts to achieve excellence in its safety and health performance, there can be no assurances that there will not be accidents resulting in injuries or even fatalities. CVR Energy routinely audits its programs and considers improvements in its management systems.
Railcar
We conduct our Railcar segment through our majority ownership interest in American Railcar Industries, Inc. ("ARI") and, prior to June 1, 2017, our wholly owned subsidiary American Railcar Leasing, LLC ("ARL"). As of December 31, 2017, we owned approximately 62.2% of the total outstanding common stock of ARI. ARI is a reporting company under the Exchange Act and files annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC that is publicly available. As discussed below, we sold ARL during 2017. 
ARI is a prominent North American designer and manufacturer of hopper and tank railcars that provides its railcar customers with integrated solutions through a comprehensive set of high-quality products and related services through its railcar manufacturing, railcar leasing and railcar repair operations. 
ARI sells and markets its products and services in North America. ARI's primary customers include those that use railcars for freight transport, or shippers, leasing companies, industrial companies and Class I railroads. For the year ended December 31, 2017, one customer accounted for approximately 15% of ARI's net sales and other revenues from operations and ARI's top ten customers accounted for approximately 59% of such revenues. 
8

During 2017, we sold ARL and its fleet of more than 34,000 railcars to SMBC Rail Services, LLC ("SMBC Rail") for cash based on a value of approximately $3.3 billion, prior to repaying, or assigning to SMBC Rail, applicable indebtedness of ARL.
Regulations
The industries in which ARI operates are subject to extensive regulation by various governmental, regulatory and industry authorities and by federal, state, local and foreign authorities. The primary regulatory and industry authorities involved in the regulation of the railcar industry in the U.S. and Canada are the Federal Railroad Administration ("FRA"), the Association of American Railroads ("AAR"), U.S. Department of Transportation ("USDOT") and Transport Canada ("TC"). The FRA administers and enforces U.S. Federal laws and regulations relating to railroad safety. These regulations govern equipment and safety compliance standards for railcars and other rail equipment used in interstate commerce. The AAR promulgates a wide variety of rules and regulations governing safety and design of equipment, relationships among railroads with respect to railcars in interchange and other matters. The AAR also certifies railcar manufacturers and component manufacturers that provide equipment for use on railroads in North America. New products must generally undergo AAR testing and approval processes. In addition, their railcar and railcar component manufacturing facilities must be certified annually by the AAR, and products that they sell must meet AAR and FRA standards. ARI must comply with the rules of the USDOT and they are subject to oversight by TC that also requires compliance.
Future regulatory developments, such as ARI’s failure to achieve, maintain or renew required certifications, new regulations or changes to existing regulations, modified interpretations of existing regulations, enhanced regulatory investigation, stricter regulatory enforcement, or any determination that our processes or products are not in compliance with applicable regulations, could result in increased compliance and other costs, governmental or administrative fines, penalties, or proceedings, private litigation, product recalls, or plant shut-downs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on ARI’s operations, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.
Gaming
We conduct our Gaming segment through our majority ownership in Tropicana Entertainment Inc. ("Tropicana"), and our wholly owned subsidiary, Trump Entertainment Resorts Inc. ("TER") which we acquired out of bankruptcy in 2016.

Governmental and Gaming Regulations
The ownership and operation of our Gaming segment's facilities are subject to the laws and regulations of each of the six states in which it operates as well as in Aruba where Tropicana operates a small casino. Gaming laws generally are based upon declarations of public policy designed to protect gaming consumers and the viability and integrity of the gaming industry. Gaming laws also may be designed to protect and maximize state and local revenues derived through taxes and licensing fees imposed on the gaming industry participants as well as to enhance economic development and tourism. To accomplish these public policy goals, gaming laws establish procedures to ensure that participants in the gaming industry meet certain standards of character and fitness. Typically, a jurisdiction's regulatory environment is established by statute and is administered by a regulatory agency with broad discretion to regulate, among other things, the affairs of owners, managers and persons with financial interests in gaming operations. 
Our Gaming segment is also subject to other laws and regulations including, but not limited to, various licensing requirements, reporting and record keeping requirements, findings of suitability, permits and review and approval of certain transactions by appropriate authorities. Changes to laws or regulations, or changes to how laws or regulations are interpreted, may have a material adverse effect on our gaming operations.

PSC Metals is principally engaged in the business of collecting, processing and selling ferrous and non-ferrous metals, as well as the processing and distribution of steel pipe and plate products.
