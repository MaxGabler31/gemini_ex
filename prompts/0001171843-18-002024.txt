Market Overview
 
The Company’s applications are numerous and diverse. Examples include medical devices and components, disposable wound care components, automotive interior trim, athletic padding, abrasive nail files and other beauty aids, air filtration, high-temperature insulation, military uniform and gear components, and cushion packaging for various products. Cross-linked polyethylene foams have many of the same properties as traditional polyethylene foams, including lightweight, durability, resiliency, and flexibility, yet have many advantages, including the ability to be thermoformed (molded), availability in vibrant colors, a fine cell structure providing improved esthetics and lower abrasiveness, and enhanced resistance to chemicals and ultraviolet light. Certain grades of cross-linked foams can be radiation-sterilized and have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for open wound skin contact.
 
Cross-linked foam can be combined with other materials to increase product applications and market applications. For example, cross-linked foams can be laminated to fabrics to produce lightweight, flexible, and durable insoles for athletic and walking shoes, gun holsters, backpacks, and other products for the consumer and industrial markets. The Company believes that, as a result of their many advantages, cross-linked foam and cross-linked foam laminated products are being used in a wide range of markets as substitutes for traditional rubber, leather, and other product material alternatives.

Reticulated polyurethane foam is a versatile material typically used to make component products that involve filtration, liquid absorption, noise control, wiping, and padding. These foams feature high tensile, elongation, and tear characteristics; they are used extensively in the medical industry as they are easy to clean, impervious to microbial organisms, and can be made with fungicidal and bactericidal additives for added safety.
 
The interior cushion packaging market is characterized by three primary sectors: (1) custom fabricated or molded products for low-volume, high-fragility products; (2) molded or die-cut products for high-volume, industrial and consumer goods; and (3) loose fill and commodity packaging materials for products that do not require custom-designed packaging. Packaging solutions are used to contain, display, and/or protect their contents during shipment, handling, storage, marketing, and use. The Company serves both the low-volume, high-fragility market and the high-volume industrial and consumer market, with a range of materials and manufacturing capabilities, but does not materially serve the commodity packaging market.
 
The low-volume, high-fragility market is generally characterized by annual production volumes of less than 50,000 pieces. Typical goods in this market include precision instruments, sensitive electronic components, and other high-value industrial products that are very sensitive to shock, vibration, and other damage that may occur during shipment and distribution. The principal materials used to package these goods include polyethylene and polyurethane foams, foam-in-place polyurethane, and molded expanded polystyrene. Polyurethane and polyethylene foams have high shock absorbency, high resiliency, and vibration-damping characteristics.
 
The higher-volume consumer packaging market is generally characterized by annual production volumes in excess of 50,000 pieces. Typical goods in this market include toys, electronics, stereo equipment, and small appliances. These goods generally do not require as high a level of shock and vibration protection as goods in the low-volume, high-fragility market. The principal materials used to package these goods include various molded, rigid, and foamed plastics, such as expanded polystyrene foam (EPS), vacuum-formed polystyrene (PS) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and corrugated die-cut inserts that generally are less protective and less expensive than resilient foams and molded fiber.
 
Regulatory Climate and Environmental Considerations
 
The packaging industry has been subject to user, industry, and legislative pressure to develop environmentally responsible packaging alternatives that reduce, reuse, and recycle packaging materials. Government authorities have enacted legislation relating to source reduction, specific product bans, recycled content, recyclability requirements, and “green marketing” restrictions.
 
In order to provide packaging that complies with all regulations regardless of a product’s destination, manufacturers seek packaging materials that meet both environmentally-related demands and performance specifications. Some packaging manufacturers have responded by reducing product volume and ultimate waste product disposal through reengineering traditional packaging solutions; adopting new manufacturing processes; participating in recovery and reuse systems for resilient materials that are inherently reusable; creating programs to recycle packaging following its useful life; and developing materials that use a high percentage of recycled content in their manufacture. Wherever feasible, the Company aims to employ one or more of these techniques to create environmentally-responsible packaging solutions.
 
In addition to offering molded fiber packaging products made from recycled paper derived primarily from post-consumer newspaper waste, the Company actively promotes its philosophy of reducing product volume and resulting post-user product waste. The Company designs products to provide optimum performance with minimum material. In addition, the Company bales and disposes of certain of its urethane foam scrap for use in the carpeting industry. The Company is aware of public support for environmentally-responsible packaging and other products. Future government action may impose restrictions affecting the industry in which the Company operates. There can be no assurance that any such action will not adversely impact the Company’s products and business.
 
Products

The Company specializes in engineered products that use the Company’s close tolerance manufacturing capabilities, its expertise in various foam and plastic materials and its ability to manufacture in clean room environments. The Company’s products are sold primarily to customers in the medical, automotive, consumer, electronics, industrial, and aerospace and defense industries. These products include medical devices and components, disposable wound care components, automotive interior trim, athletic padding, abrasive nail files and other beauty aids, air filtration, high-temperature insulation, military uniform and gear components, and cushion packaging.
 
The Company believes it is one of the largest purchasers of cross-linked foam in the United States and as a result it has been able to establish important relationships with the relatively small number of suppliers of this product. Through its strong relationships with cross-linked foam suppliers, the Company believes it is able to offer customers a wide range of cross-linked foam products.
 
The Company benefits from its ability to custom-design its own proprietary manufacturing equipment in conjunction with its machinery suppliers. For example, the Company has custom-designed its own lamination machines, allowing it to achieve adhesive bonds between cross-linked foam and fabric and other materials that do not easily combine. These laminates typically command higher prices than traditional foam products.
 
The Company has developed a variety of standard products that are branded and, in some cases, trademarked and patented. These products include Wine Packs® (wine shipping solutions made from molded fiber); T-Tubes® (tube and pipe insulation for clean room environments); BioShell® (pharmaceutical bag protection system); Pro-Sticks® (sanitary solution for nail care services); FlexShield® (medical device pouch for protecting small instruments and tools) and Erasables® (multi-purpose cleaning eraser).
 
The Company also designs, manufactures, and markets a broad range of packaging solutions primarily using polyethylene, polyurethane, cross-linked polyethylene foams, and rigid plastics. These solutions are custom-designed and fabricated or molded to provide protection for less durable, higher-value items, and are primarily sold to original equipment and component manufacturers. Examples of the Company’s packaging solutions include foam inserts for protective shipping cases and end-cap packs for electronics. Markets for these products are typically characterized by lower to moderate volumes where performance, such as shock absorbency and vibration damping, is valued.
 
The Company’s engineering personnel collaborate directly with customers to study and evaluate specific customer requirements. Based on the results of this evaluation, packaging solutions are engineered to customer specifications, using various types and densities of materials with the goal of providing the desired protection for the lowest cost and with the lowest physical package volume. The Company believes its engineering expertise, breadth of material offerings, and manufacturing capabilities have enabled it to provide unique solutions to achieve these goals.
 
The process for producing the Company’s molded fiber packaging and vacuum-formed trays requires high volume production runs and rapid manufacturing turnaround times. Raw materials used in the manufacture of molded fiber are primarily recycled newspaper, and a variety of other grades of recycled paper and water. Raw materials used in vacuum-formed plastics include polystyrene (PS) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). These products compete with expanded polystyrene (EPS) and manually assembled corrugated die-cut inserts.
 
The Company believes that its molded fiber products provide customers with packaging solutions that are more responsive to stringent environmental packaging regulations worldwide and meet the demands of environmentally-aware consumers, while simultaneously meeting customer cost and performance objectives.

The Company markets and sells its products in the United States principally through direct sales forces. The Company also uses independent manufacturer representatives to sell its products. The Company’s sales people, in conjunction with Company engineers, collaborate with customers and in-house design and manufacturing experts to develop custom-engineered solutions on a cost-effective basis.
 
No one customer’s sales exceeded 10% of total sales for the year ended December 31, 2017. Seasonality is not a major factor in the Company’s sales. See the Company’s consolidated financial statements contained in Part IV, Item 15, of this Report for net sales by market information.
 
Working Capital
 
The Company funds its business operations through a combination of available cash and cash equivalents, and cash generated from operations. In addition, the Company’s revolving credit facility is available for additional working capital needs.
Manufacturing 
 
The Company’s manufacturing operations consist primarily of cutting, routing, molding, vacuum-forming, laminating, radio frequency and impulse welding and assembling. For custom-molded foam products and thermoplastic welded medical devices, the Company’s skilled engineering personnel analyze specific customer requirements to design and build prototype products to determine product functionality. Upon customer approval, prototypes are converted to final designs for commercial production runs. Molded cross-linked foam products are produced in a thermoforming process using heat, pressure, and precision metal tooling. Plastics and other materials are sealed using radio frequency and impulse welding.
 
Cushion foam packaging products that do not utilize cross-linked foam are fabricated by cutting shapes from blocks of foam, using specialized cutting tools, routers, water jets, and hot wire equipment, and assembling these shapes into the final product using a variety of foam welding or gluing techniques. Products can be used on a stand-alone basis or bonded to another foam product or other material such as a corrugated medium.
 
Laminated products are produced through a process whereby the foam medium is heated to the melting point. The heated foam is then typically bonded to a non-foam material through the application of mechanical pressure.
 
Molded fiber products are manufactured by vacuum-forming a pulp of recycled or virgin paper materials onto custom-engineered molds. With the application of vacuum and air, the molded parts are pressed and transferred to an in-line dryer, from which they exit ready for packing or subsequent value-added operations.
 
The Company does not manufacture any of the raw materials used in its products. With the exception of certain grades of cross-linked foam and technical polyurethane foams, these raw materials are available from multiple supply sources. Although the Company relies upon a limited number of suppliers for cross-linked and technical polyurethane foams, the Company’s relationships with such suppliers are good, and the Company expects that these suppliers will be able to meet its requirements for these foams. Any delay or interruption in the supply of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.
 
Research and Development
 
The Company’s engineering personnel continuously explore design and manufacturing techniques, as well as new, innovative materials to meet the unique demands and specifications of its customers. Because the Company’s products tend to have relatively short life cycles, research and development is an integral part of the Company’s ongoing cost structure. The Company’s research and development expenses were approximately $1.1 million, $1.3 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Competition
 
The foam and plastics converting industry is highly competitive. While there are several national companies that convert foam and plastics, the Company’s primary competition is from smaller independent regional manufacturing companies. These companies generally market their products in specific geographic areas from neighboring facilities. In addition, the Company’s foam and fiber packaging products compete against products made from alternative materials, including expanded polystyrene foams, die-cut corrugated, plastic peanuts, plastic bubbles, and foam-in-place urethane. The Company’s custom engineered products face competition primarily from smaller companies that typically concentrate on production of products for specific industries. The Company believes its access to a wide variety of materials, its engineering expertise, its ability to combine foams with other materials such as plastics and laminates, and its ability to manufacture products in a clean room environment, will enable it to continue to compete effectively in the engineered products market.

The Company believes its customers typically select vendors based on price, product performance, product reliability, and customer service. The Company believes it is able to compete effectively with respect to these factors.
 
Patents and Other Proprietary Rights 
 
The Company relies upon trade secrets, patents, and trademarks to protect its technology and proprietary rights. The Company believes the improvement of existing products, reliance upon trade secrets and unpatented proprietary know-how, and the development of new products are generally as important as patent protection in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage. Nevertheless, the Company has obtained patents and may continue to make efforts to obtain patents, when available, although there can be no assurance that any patent obtained will provide substantial protection or be of commercial benefit to the Company, or that its validity will be upheld if challenged.
 
The Company has a total of 20 active patents relating to technologies including foam, packaging, tool control technologies, radio frequency welding, automotive superforming processes and to certain nail file technologies. The Company also has patent applications in process. There can be no assurance that any patent or patent application will provide significant protection for the Company’s products and technology, or will not be challenged or circumvented by others. The expiration dates for the Company’s patents range from 2021 through 2034.
 
Backlog
 
The Company’s backlog, as of February 23, 2018, which includes Dielectrics, Inc., and February 4, 2017 totaled approximately $46.9 million and $33.4 million, respectively. The backlog consists of purchase orders for which a delivery schedule within the next twelve months has been specified by customers. Orders included in the backlog may generally be canceled or rescheduled by customers without significant penalty. The backlog as of any particular date should not be relied upon as indicative of the Company’s revenues for any period as it includes customer blanket purchase orders that are non-binding.
Employees
 
As of January 27, 2018, the Company had a total of 796 full-time employees (as compared to 805 full-time employees as of January 28, 2017). The Company is not a party to any collective bargaining agreements. The Company considers its employee relations to be good.
