ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
With a history of more than 75 years, Vectrus, Inc. (Vectrus, the Company, our company, we, us or our) is a leading provider of global service solutions, including facility and base operations, supply chain and logistics services, information technology mission support, engineering and digital integration services, security services, and maintenance repair and overhaul (MRO) services primarily to the United States (U.S.) government in 205 locations and 28 countries and territories across five continents in both stable and unstable political and economic environments. A primary strength of our company is our global footprint and ability to recruit U.S. and international personnel, as well as navigate the logistical, legal, and other complexities of operating in multiple austere overseas locations. We operate our business based on three core values: Integrity, Respect and Responsibility. We have a proven history of deploying resources rapidly and with precision to support the success of our customers' missions. Our future strategy is to advance our competitive profile and further differentiate Vectrus as an innovator in the converged infrastructure market.
Our primary customer is the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), with a large concentration in the U.S. Army. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we had total revenue of $1.8 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, substantially all of which was derived from U.S. government customers.
We employ approximately 8,100 people and engage approximately 6,100 additional subcontract personnel around the world. The executive management team has an average of 36 years of experience in the military, the defense industry, and a wide range of other U.S. government agencies. Our management team has experience winning contracts, driving premier operating efficiencies, and managing all aspects of the demanding compliance culture required of a U.S. government contractor in a global environment. We are also a leading employer of veterans with more than 39% of our employees with a military background, and we have been recognized numerous times in recent years by veteran-focused organizations as a military-friendly employer. 
Vectrus was incorporated as an Indiana corporation in February 2014 as part of a spin-off (Spin-Off) from Exelis, Inc. in September 2014, resulting in Vectrus becoming an independent, publicly traded company. References in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to Exelis or "Former Parent" refer to Exelis Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (other than Vectrus). Subsequent to the Spin-Off, Exelis was acquired by a predecessor entity of L3Harris Technologies, Inc. in May 2015.
Acquisitions
On December 31, 2020, Vectrus acquired Zenetex, LLC (Zenetex) and Higgins, Hermansen, Banikas, LLC (HHB). Zenetex is a leading provider of technical and strategic solutions focused on enabling mission readiness, performance, and enhanced protection for defense and national security clients globally and HHB delivers intelligence community solutions. These solutions are primarily integrated into our existing Vectrus business as additional services. The purchase prices of $117.6 million and $15.5 million, respectively, were funded with cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. 
In July 2019, Vectrus acquired Advantor Systems Corporation and Advantor Systems, LLC (collectively, Advantor) from Infrasafe Holding, Inc. and Infrasafe, LLC (collectively, Infrasafe). Advantor is a leading provider of integrated electronic security systems to the U.S. government and is the only vertically integrated and accredited Command, Control & Communications (C3) networked security technology platform in the industry. The purchase price of $45.1 million was funded with cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility

Competition
Our competition varies depending on our service offerings. In Facility and Base Operations, our primary competitors are AMENTUM, PAE Facilities Management (PAE), KBR Inc., IAP World Services, and Fluor Corporation (Government group). Our principal competitors in Information Technology Mission Support include divisions of Leidos Holdings, Inc., Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), Peraton, and General Dynamics Technologies Segment. In Engineering and Digital Integration, there are fewer direct competitors given the current lifecycle stage of this market. There are typically fewer competitors in the overseas market for each of our services capabilities. 
The U.S. government has implemented policies designed to protect small businesses and under-represented minority contractors. From time to time, certain U.S. government work in the U.S. has been restricted to small businesses, including 
Alaska native companies. We participate with these small businesses as a subcontractor for select opportunities. In addition, we rely on our teaming relationships with other prime contractors and subcontractors for large procurements or other opportunities where we believe the combination of services will help us win and perform the contract. Our competitors may consolidate or establish teaming or other relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address customers’ needs. 
Competitive bids for the work that Vectrus pursues are based on technical qualifications and corporate experience in performing contracts of similar size and scope and can be highly price sensitive. While not every contract is procured via selection of the lowest priced bidder, customers are sensitive to cost based on their budget allocations. Acquisition cycles are long (generally 12 to 24 months), and contracts are typically multi-year contracts that include an initial period of one-year or less with annual one-year (or less) option periods for the remaining contract period. 
Some U.S. government customers have shown a strong preference for multiple award IDIQ contracts. These contracts offer awards to a pool of contractors, followed by competition within the pool for individual programs via task orders under each IDIQ over the period of performance. The period of performance under IDIQ contracts follows a traditional three-to-ten-year performance cycle. The governing IDIQ contracts often have multi-billion-dollar ceiling values. 
Our company closely monitors costs to foster highly competitive pricing and uses an in-house business development model both to manage the cost of revenue and capture opportunities for future bids. 
Seasonality
We do not consider any material portion of our business to be seasonal. However, various factors can affect the distribution of our revenue between accounting periods, including the timing of awards, product deliveries, customer acceptance of products and services, contract phase-in durations, contract completions, and the availability of customer funding. Weather and natural phenomena can also temporarily affect the performance of our services. 
The U.S. government's fiscal year ends on September 30 of each year. U.S. government agencies may award extra tasks or complete other contract actions in the time frame leading up to the end of its fiscal year in order to avoid the loss of unexpended fiscal year funds, which may favorably impact our third fiscal quarter. 
Regulatory Environment
The U.S. government markets in which we serve are highly regulated. When working with U.S. agencies and entities, we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the creation, administration and performance of contracts. Among other things, these laws and regulations: 
•Require compliance with government standards for contract administration, accounting and management internal control systems; 
•Define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under various flexibly priced U.S. government contracts; 
•Require certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with certain contract negotiations; 
•Require us not to compete for, or to divest ourselves of, work if an organizational conflict of interest exists related to such work that cannot be appropriately mitigated; and 
•Restrict the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the exportation of certain products and technical data. 
U.S. government contracts generally are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which sets forth policies, procedures and requirements for the acquisition of goods and services by the U.S. government, agency-specific regulations that implement or supplement FAR, such as the DoD’s Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), and other applicable laws and regulations. These regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to government contracting, including various rules regarding procurement, import and export, security, contract pricing and cost, allowable costs, contract performance, contract termination and adjustment, audits, and IT system security and privacy controls. In addition, as government contractors, we are subject to routine audits and investigations by U.S. government agencies, such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) and the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA). These agencies review our performance, cost structure, incurred costs, forward pricing rates and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards under our contracts. The DCAA also reviews the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies, including our accounting, purchasing, government property, estimating, and related government business systems. 
The U.S. government may revise its procurement practices or adopt new or revised contract rules and regulations at any time. To help ensure compliance with these complex laws and regulations, all of our employees are required to complete ethics and other compliance training relevant to their respective positions. 
We are subject to other U.S. government laws, regulations and policies, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the False Claims Act. When working overseas, we must comply not only with applicable U.S. laws and regulations, but also with foreign government laws, regulations and procurement policies and practices, which may differ from U.S. laws, including regulations relating to import-export control, foreign tax considerations, data privacy, foreign labor and environmental law, and anti-corruption. 
Contracts
U.S. government programs generally are implemented by the award of individual contracts to a prime contractor, which may utilize one or more subcontractors. Our company usually is a prime contractor on long-term contracts that are of a finite duration of generally between three and ten years. We were the prime contractor on contracts representing 93%, 95% and 95% of our revenue for the three years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. In other contracts, we team with the prime contractor as a subcontractor. The U.S. Congress usually appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may extend across several fiscal years. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded initially, and additional funds are committed only as the U.S. Congress approves further appropriations. Prior to the expiration of a contract, if the customer requires further services of the type provided by the contract, it typically begins a competitive rebidding or recompete process. The contracts and subcontracts under a program generally are subject to termination for convenience or adjustment if appropriations for such programs are not available or if they change. The U.S. government is required to equitably adjust a contract for additions to or reductions in scope or other changes, including price, which it directs. 
Generally, the sales price elements for our contracts are cost-plus, cost-reimbursable, time-and-materials or firm-fixed-price. We commonly have elements of cost-plus, cost-reimbursable and firm-fixed-price contracts on a single contract. 
On a cost-plus type contract, we are paid our allowable incurred costs plus a profit, which can be fixed or variable depending on the contract’s fee arrangement, up to funding levels predetermined by our customers. On cost-plus type contracts, we do not bear the risks of unexpected cost overruns, provided that we do not incur costs that exceed the predetermined funded amounts. Most of our cost-plus contracts also contain a firm-fixed-price element. Cost-plus type contracts with award and incentive fee provisions are our primary variable contract fee arrangement. Award fees provide for a fee based on actual performance relative to contractually specified performance criteria. Incentive fees provide for a fee based on the relationship between total allowable and target cost. 
On most of our contracts, a cost-reimbursable element captures consumable materials required for the program. Typically, these costs do not bear fees.
On a time-and-materials type contract, we are reimbursed for labor at fixed hourly rates and generally reimbursed separately for allowable materials, costs and expenses at cost. For this contract type, we bear the risk that our labor costs and allocable indirect expenses are greater than the fixed hourly rate defined within the contract. 
A firm-fixed-price type contract typically offers higher profit margin potential and a greater level of risk than a cost plus type contract. On a firm-fixed-price type contract, we agree to perform the contractual statement of work for a predetermined contract price. Although a firm-fixed-price type contract generally permits us to retain profits if the total actual contract costs are less than the estimated contract costs, we bear the risk that increased or unexpected costs may reduce our profit or cause us to sustain losses on the contract. Although the overall scope of work required under the contract may not change, profit may be adjusted as experience is gained and as efficiencies are realized or costs are incurred.
The percentage of our total revenue generated from each contract type for the periods presented was as follows: 

 | Year Ended December 31,
Contract type | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019
Cost-plus and cost-reimbursable | 71 | % | | 68 | % | 73 | %
Firm-fixed-price | 25 | % | | 29 | % | 24 | %
Time and materials | 4 | % | | 3 | % | 3 | %
Total revenue | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

Backlog
For a discussion of our backlog, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Backlog” in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Environmental, Health and Safety
We are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations, including those governing the management and disposal of hazardous substances, the cleanup of contaminated sites, and the maintenance of a safe and healthy workplace for our employees, contractors, and visitors. Environmental, health and safety laws and regulations are subject to change, the nature of which is inherently unpredictable, and the timing of potential changes is 
uncertain. Environmental, health and safety requirements are significant factors affecting all of our operations, and we have established a comprehensive program to address compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety requirements. 
Human Capital Management
At December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 8,100 full-time employees, a 1,100 employee decrease from December 31, 2020 due primarily to the completion of one of our contracts. We also employed approximately 6,100 subcontract workers, substantially unchanged from 2020 year-end. At December 31, 2021, approximately 15% of our employees were represented under 21 collective bargaining agreements with labor unions. In the ordinary course of business, a number of collective bargaining agreements will be subject to renegotiation in a given year. We do not expect that any of the contracts subject to renegotiation in 2021 (individually or as a whole) present a significant risk to our business. We believe that relations with our employees and union representatives are positive.
We believe our employees are among our most important resources and are critical to our continued success. We focus significant attention on attracting and retaining talented and experienced individuals to manage and support our operations, and our management team routinely reviews employee turnover rates at various levels of the organization. Management also reviews employee engagement and satisfaction surveys to monitor employee morale and receive feedback on a variety of issues. We pay our employees competitively and offer a broad range of company-paid benefits, which we believe are competitive with others in our industry.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
Our vision to innovate and lead core capabilities unites the development of internal strategies to equip leaders to manage diversity by promoting accountability, measuring results, refining approaches, and institutionalizing a culture of equity and inclusion. We are a leading employer of veterans and veteran spouses with more than 39% of our employees voluntarily reporting a military background, and we have been recognized numerous times in recent years by veteran-focused organizations as a military-friendly employer,
Our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (D, E & I) Executive Council initiatives align closely with Vectrus’ strategic priorities. The Executive Council is led by our Executive Director of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and is co-chaired by two Senior Vice Presidents who report to our Chief Executive Officer. Given the national discussion on race and equity, the Executive Council encourages open dialogue, fosters inclusion, and supports employee engagement through Global Townhalls and D, E & I webinars in 2021. 
In setting the stage for 2022, our five Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) developed goals in three focus areas to foster awareness, respect, and inclusion:
•Business development and outreach 
•Employee engagement and retention and professional development 
•Recruitment 
Annually, in the first month of the last quarter, ERGs evaluate their performance to goals in each focus area and report these results to the D, E & I Executive Council. The D, E & I Executive Council reports annually to our Board of Directors regarding overall diversity distribution for employees and suppliers. 
Learning and Development
We continue to emphasize employee development and training and provide a range of development programs and opportunities, skills, and resources needed to have a successful career with Vectrus. Our on-line Vectrus University gives employees access to more than 1,600 virtual courses that address such topics as leadership/management and information technology skills, along with the standard required compliance courses of a defense contractor. We are committed to identifying and developing the talents of our next generation leaders by providing knowledge to help early-in-career employees develop the skills to move up within the organization, providing a training program to keep our supervisors current on best practices and ensure they focus on the success of their people and encouraging nominations into our programs that consist of additional training and mentoring opportunities.
We have a robust talent and succession planning process and have established a specialized program to support the development of our talent pipeline for critical roles. On a quarterly basis, we conduct a review of succession plans and the individual development plans of our emerging talent. These sessions focus on high potential talent, diverse talent, and the succession for our most critical roles, and are led by our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Human Resource Officer, and Senior Vice Presidents.
Employee Health and Safety
During 2021, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we continued public health and safety protocols including updated infectious disease procedures to protect our employees, our subcontractors, and our customers. These protocols include complying with social distancing and other health and safety standards as required by federal, state, and local government agencies, taking into consideration guidelines of our clients, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the 
World Health Organization, and other public health authorities in the countries where we operate. We continue to hold quarterly calls to educate and keep the work force informed on how to deploy the infectious disease response plan at the local level. We continued to provide continual efforts to share an environment of best practices and lessons learned including modified work presence. We modified the way we conduct many aspects of our business to reduce the number of in-person interactions. For example, we significantly expanded the use of virtual interactions in all aspects of our business, including customer facing activities. Many of our administrative and operational functions during this time have required modification as well, including most of our workforce working remotely. 
As a service provider, we continued to have a large employee population that was required to be on site daily. To maintain a healthy workforce, our focus included protect the employee, continue service delivery, and keep the business running. This was done by successfully deploying a Pandemic Plan early in the effort and keeping it current with continual updates and guidance. We continue to monitor the safety of our employees and keep universal precautions in the forefront. 
For a detailed discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our human capital, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Ethics and Compliance 
All employees must adhere to the Vectrus Code of Conduct that sets standards for appropriate behavior and includes required annual training on preventing, identifying, reporting and stopping any type of unlawful discrimination, unethical behaviors, and unacceptable conduct. With employees living and working on five continents and in 205 locations, Vectrus requires each employee to complete the Vectrus Code of Conduct training annually. 
Combating Trafficking in Persons (CTIP) and Other Country National (OCN) Compliance
Vectrus employs processes and procedures that focus on CTIP compliance and the overall candidate experience for both subcontract and direct hire OCN staffing. Key audit areas are staffing office safety, recruiting process compliance, CTIP awareness notifications and training, candidate document collection procedures and candidate interviews.
Vectrus conducts an extensive and robust vetting of potential subcontractors to identify those who have proven CTIP-compliance and recruiting processes in place. We seek only those companies that will fully protect human rights. 
Vectrus personnel conduct inspections and audits of the subcontractors regional recruiting centers following award of a contract. During these inspections, we confirm their employees have been trained in CTIP compliance and that their recruiting processes comply with all local and US government CTIP policies and regulations, as well as personnel countries of original and host nation labor laws. Vectrus personnel interview potential candidates about their recruiting experience with our subcontractors and review employment documents for compliance, if available. 
Over the life of our contracts, Vectrus Contracts/Subcontracting personnel, with assistance from Task Order Managers, Site Managers, and CTIP Teams (location-specific), monitor our contracted subcontractors to validate they are maintaining compliance with CTIP and all other provisions in their contracts with us. 
Once employees have been hired, Vectrus provides program-specific, CTIP, quality, safety, and task-specific training. This training reinforces our commitment to providing safe and anonymous options for reporting suspected CTIP violations. 
Vectrus maintains an active CTIP Awareness campaign, at each program location, to reinforce our protection of human rights. This helps empower all employees to confidently report suspected violations without fear of retaliation. Vectrus quickly investigates CTIP violation complaints that, if validated, are reported immediately to our Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Chief Legal Officer and the appropriate USG and program authorities. 
We have zero tolerance for CTIP violations. Vectrus rapidly requests corrective actions (CA) be put in place by subcontractors or employees for validated CTIP violations. If CTIP violations warrant, a subcontractors or employee unable to execute or comply with approved CAs will be removed swiftly from the contract and prevented from conducting future business with Vectrus.
Over the life of the contract, Vectrus conducts regularly scheduled audits and inspections of employee housing and transportation, interviews employees hired through our subcontractors, and reviews employment contracts and related documentation to further validate our subcontractor’s compliance with FAR 52.222-50 and both country of origin and host nation labor laws.
