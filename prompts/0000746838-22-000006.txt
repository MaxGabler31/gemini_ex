ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
Unisys Corporation, a Delaware corporation (Unisys, we, our, or the company), is a global information technology (IT) solutions company that delivers successful outcomes for the most demanding businesses and governments. Unisys offerings include digital workplace solutions, cloud and infrastructure solutions, enterprise computing solutions and business process solutions. 
In January 2021, the company changed its organizational structure to more effectively address evolving client needs. As a result, our reportable segments are as follows:
•Digital Workplace Solutions (DWS), which provides solutions that transform digital workplaces securely and create exceptional end-user experiences;
•Cloud and Infrastructure Solutions (C&I), which provides solutions that drive modern IT service platforms, cloud applications development, intelligent services, and cybersecurity services; and 
•Enterprise Computing Solutions (ECS), which provides solutions that harness secure, continuous high-intensity computing and enable digital services through software-defined operating environments.
During 2021, the company completed three acquisitions to accelerate its pace of innovation and capitalize on growing and evolving markets. In June and November, the company acquired Unify Square, Inc. and, the Mobinergy group of companies, respectively, to advance the company’s experience-focused Digital Workplace Solutions set and to deliver higher-value solutions to its clients. In December, the company acquired CompuGain LLC to enhance the company’s delivery of rapid and agile cloud migration, application modernization and data value realization to its clients. These acquisitions align with the company’s strategy to invest in capabilities that complement its core solutions. 
Principal Products and Services
We deliver advanced IT solutions to clients in our primary target markets: Government (national governments, other than directly to the U.S. federal government, and state and local governments globally), Commercial (e.g., travel and transportation and life sciences and healthcare), and Financial Services (e.g., commercial and retail banking). 
We market our products and solutions primarily through a direct sales force. Complementing our direct sales force, we make use of a select group of resellers and alliance partners to market our services and product portfolio. In certain countries, we market primarily through distributors.
Services
Our principal services include digital workplace solutions, cloud and infrastructure solutions, enterprise computing solutions and business process solutions.
•In digital workplace solutions, we help our clients create the world’s leading digital workplace experiences by transforming their end-user experience to engage and retain employees; increase collaboration and innovation; and drive productivity and business growth.
•In cloud and infrastructure solutions, we help our clients achieve digital transformation by applying proven experience to solve the toughest business and technology challenges. Our solutions accelerate hybrid and multi-cloud adoption and enable application modernization. Our cybersecurity services drive more compliant and highly secure technology environments from strategy through implementation, operation and optimization. 
•In enterprise computing solutions, we deliver high-intensity, cloud-based, software-defined operating environments and solutions. We partner with clients to evolve compute architectures as part of digital transformation in industries ranging from financial services to travel and transportation to telecommunications.
In addition, we deliver a range of next-generation capabilities that make government service easily accessible and efficient, enable law enforcement to solve more cases in less time and enhance the integrity of our clients’ financial services processing and payment platforms. Our clients and their customers benefit from proficient and effective 24x7 operations and continuous optimization of their mission-critical business processes. 
We deliver these outcomes through platforms that include:
•Unisys InteliServeTM, a service solution that transforms traditional service desk into an intelligent, user-centric experience aligned with the needs of the modern digital workplace. The service leverages the InteliServe platform, an integrated suite of technologies for omnichannel support, advanced analytics, automation, artificial intelligence, machine learning and identity authentication.
•Unisys CloudForte®, a comprehensive suite of digital services to help accelerate the secure move of data and applications to the cloud. The solution is available for hybrid and multi-cloud environments and includes the following features: an automated software-as-a-service platform to identify and provision private, public and hybrid cloud services, real-time analytics, and capabilities for industrial-grade modernization of legacy applications. 
•PowerSuite™ is our market-leading packaged software tool used by enterprise IT to monitor, analyze, troubleshoot and secure collaboration and communications multi-platform environments. PowerSuite leverages patented AI/ML technology to proactively surface actionable insights and helps orchestrate and deliver effective, reliable and secure user experiences spanning both cloud and on-premises environments. Leveraging the PowerSuite SaaS offering IT gains a real-time panoramic view of all collaboration and communications platforms, making it easy to troubleshoot and remediate infrastructure issues, benchmark the user experience both internally and externally and expedite responses to service interruptions and threats. 
Products
Our software products include: 
•Unisys ClearPath Forward®, a secure, scalable software operating environment for high-intensity enterprise computing capable of delivering Unisys security across multiple platforms. The ClearPath Forward operating environment is hardware-independent and provides a tested, integrated stack of software products that run on a range of contemporary, commonly-deployed Intel x86 server platforms and select virtualization environments of the client’s choice. Thus, ClearPath Forward provides clients with the flexibility to choose to deploy either as an integrated system, as a private cloud via software services or in a public cloud, starting with Microsoft Azure.
•Unisys Stealth® security software, which enables trusted identities to access micro-segmented critical assets and safely communicate through secure, encrypted channels. Stealth™ establishes user authentication, prevents lateral attacker movement and reduces data center, mobile and cloud attack surfaces and quickly isolates devices or users at the first sign of compromise. Stealth also reduces the cost and complexity of securing information and operation technology such as industrial control systems, allowing organizations to meet compliance and security mandates.
Our industry solutions help law enforcement agencies solve crime; social services case workers assist families; travel and transportation companies manage freight and distribution; and financial institutions deliver omnichannel banking.
Materials
Unisys purchases components and supplies from a number of suppliers around the world. For certain technology products, we rely on a single or limited number of suppliers, although we make every effort to assure that alternative sources are available if the need arises. The failure of our suppliers to deliver components and supplies in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner could adversely affect our business. For more information on the risks associated with purchasing components and supplies, see “Risk Factors” (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K). 
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
As of January 31, 2022, Unisys owns over 485 active U.S. patents and over 45 active patents granted in ten non-U.S. jurisdictions. These patents cover systems and methods related to a wide variety of technologies, including, but not limited to, information security, cloud computing, virtualization, database encryption/management and user interfaces. We have granted licenses covering both single patents, and particular groups of patents, to others. Likewise, we have active licensing agreements granting us rights under patents owned by other entities. Our business is not materially dependent upon any single patent, patent license, or related group thereof.
Unisys also maintains 23 U.S. trademark and service mark registrations, and over 480 additional trademark and service mark registrations in seventy-four non-U.S. jurisdictions as of January 31, 2022. These marks are valuable assets used on or in connection with our services and products, and as such are actively monitored, policed and protected by Unisys and its agents.
Seasonality
Our revenue is affected by such factors as the introduction of new services and products, the length of sales cycles and the seasonality of purchases. Seasonality generally has not resulted in material quarterly revenue changes. 
Customers
No single client accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2021. 
Backlog
At December 31, 2021, firm order backlog was $3.0 billion, compared to $3.6 billion at December 31, 2020. Approximately $1.2 billion (40%) of 2021 backlog is expected to be converted to revenue in 2022. Although we believe that this backlog is firm, we may, for commercial reasons, allow the orders to be canceled, with or without penalty. 
Competition
Our business is affected by rapid change in technology in the information services and technology industries and aggressive competition from many domestic and foreign companies. Principal competitors are systems integrators, consulting and other professional services firms, outsourcing providers, infrastructure services providers, computer hardware manufacturers and software providers. We compete primarily on the basis of service, product performance, technological innovation, and price. We believe that our continued focused investment in enhancing and expanding our solution portfolio through our build/partner/buy strategy, coupled with investment in our go-to-market capabilities, will have a favorable impact on our competitive position. For more information on the competitive risks we face, see “Risk Factors” (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K).
Environmental Matters
Our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position have not been materially affected by compliance with federal, state and local laws regulating the protection of the environment. Capital expenditures for environmental control facilities are not expected to be material in 2022 and 2023.
Human Capital
At December 31, 2021, the company employed approximately 16,300 professionals of which 18% are located in the United States and 82% are located in other countries around the world. Our associates ensure our success, and we are committed to providing a productive, ethical, diverse and safe working environment for each and every one of them.
We welcome associates of all ethnicities, races, ages, religions, abilities, genders and sexual orientations. We are committed to our culture of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) not only as the “right thing to do,” but also as a business imperative. Creating an equitable workplace improves our organization, local communities and society. 
At Unisys, we are focused on having a workforce that represents the diverse communities in which we live and serve. Based on our continued efforts to improve diverse representation, women now make up 32% of our workforce globally and associates from Underrepresented Ethnic Groups (UREG) make up 30% within the U.S. Although we are proud of our progress, there is more work to do to build a more diverse workforce. 
In addition to our efforts focused on representation, understanding our associates’ perspectives and experiences--their engagement--is critical to our success. Each year we measure associate engagement and develop action plans to improve based on feedback. This year, more than 80% of our associates participated in the survey with 7 out of 10 associates indicating they are engaged. Fostering an inclusive culture is a key component of engagement and 80% of associates indicated they “feel comfortable being themselves at work.” Our DEI initiatives are supported by our Inclusion and Diversity Council, which consists of 20 associates from around the world and includes several working groups that focus on specific aspects of issues including diversity, race and ethnicity, disability and gender equity. The Inclusion and Diversity Council’s vision is to build and nurture a better, more inclusive culture at Unisys. Since 2020, the Council has sponsored multiple new Associate Impact Groups, which are associate-led groups that provide support, career development, and professional networking for their members. 
The company recognizes that continuous learning and professional development are key factors in our success. We offer a range of development programs and opportunities that focus on leadership/management, information technology skills, regulatory compliance, diversity, anti-harassment, ethics, cybersecurity, ethics and more.
We are committed to the health, safety, and wellness of our employees. We provide our associates a wide range of offerings in this regard through a range of benefits and resources including health and welfare benefits, flexible time-off and employee assistance programs. 
Our safety programs include education, safe work practice guides, monitoring, and corrective actions to make sure that we are keeping every associate safe. In addition, we regularly conduct compliance validation reviews and use third-party assessments at our locations to ensure compliance to established company best practices and country-specific environmental, health, and safety regulations. In fact, we have maintained a perfect safety record over the past decade with zero violations of environmental, health or safety regulations. 
We also promote a culture of ethics and integrity through our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, policies, and training and all associates must adhere to the company’s Code. We assess risk using data analytics, an annual risk assessment, investigations, and other compliance-related initiatives.
