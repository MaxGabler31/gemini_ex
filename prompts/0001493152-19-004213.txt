Description of Business
 
Wiseman Global Limited, is a company that operates through its wholly owned subsidiary, Wisdom Global Group Co., Limited, a Seychelles Company. It should be noted that our wholly owned subsidiary, Wisdom Global Group Co., Limited, owns 100% of Wiseman Global Limited, the operating Hong Kong company which is described below. All of the previous entities share the same exact business plan.
 

Wiseman Global Limited is an early stage company that intends to distribute a full line of major household appliances and related products throughout China (PRC) and Hong Kong. Currently, the Company only operates in Hong Kong, but has intentions to expand into mainland China in the future. All plans pertaining to a future expansion into China are speculative at this point in time, and cannot be determined with any level of specificity. Wiseman Global Limited, a Hong Kong Company, is exploring the possibility of incorporating a wholly owned subsidiary in the PRC, for operations that may, in the future, take place in mainland China.
 
Our principal products are televisions, air-conditioners, laundry appliances, refrigerators and freezers, cooking appliances, dishwashers, mixers and other small domestic appliances. It should be noted that we acquire our products from independent third parties and we do not presently, nor do we plan to, take part in any manufacturing activities. At present all sales are conducted through the personal network of the Company’s sole officer and director. Our Company website, which we will also advertise products for sale, has been developed.
 
Our inventory, at present, is purchased subsequent to the receipt of a customer order. Subsequent to receipt of an order we will first verify the cost of the customer order with third party manufacturers and provide the customer a quotation of the estimated costs. Once the consumer accepts the quotation and deposits partial, or full, payment of the order, we will purchase the corresponding products with a third-party manufacturer. We will either have the ordered products delivered directly to the consumer once we receive them from the third-party manufacturer, or temporarily store the products at our company office while arranging for delivery to the consumer. We plan to expand the product lines and negotiate the pricing with third-party manufacturers upon an increase in consumer demand and business.

It is our belief as a Company that Chinese consumers are increasingly drawn towards, and desire, connected appliances which fit seamlessly into the larger home ecosystem. To fill the demand for such connectivity we plan to develop a new technology called the “Wiseman Home System” which will allow, via the consumer’s home Wi-Fi network, for appliances to be networked together, allowing the consumer to access and operate them through their mobile phone applications (APPS). The features of the “Wiseman Home System” are not yet finalized and we have yet commenced development. There are many steps that will need to be taken before the system is available for retail.
 
Marketing Efforts
 
Currently, our marketing efforts are comprised of our sole officer and director offering products to his personal network. However, we are also developing a website designed to bolster our presence in the Chinese marketplace. On the website we intend to list our product offerings which may include, but are not limited to, televisions, air-conditioners, laundry appliances, refrigerators and freezers, cooking appliances, dishwashers, mixers and other small domestic appliances. Additionally, subsequent to the development of the “Wiseman Home System”, we intend to market this system on our website, which we believe will significantly improve our brand awareness. Furthermore, we have tentative plans in place to pursue various online marketing campaigns which may include, but not strictly be limited to, paid online advertising, social media, and traditional print marketing. However, at this point of time our marketing activities have not been fully determined or planned with enough specificity to accurately predict where our marketing efforts will be even over the next six months.
Competition
 
Competition in the home appliance industry is intense, including competitors such as Midea, Haier and Xiaomi, many of which have substantially greater resources than we have, and may manufacture their own products. The competitive environment includes the impact of a changing retail environment, including the shifting of consumer purchase preferences towards e-commerce and other channels. As a new entrant, we believe that we can compete in the current environment by focusing on promoting new and innovative products, building our brand, and enhancing the customer experience.
Trademarks, Licenses and Patents
 
Effective October 1, 2018, we entered into a Licensing Agreement to be granted the use of the “Wiseman” trademark. The license is non-exclusive, non-transferable and is for a term of thirty years. There was no consideration exchanged for the use of the “Wiseman” trademark.
Future Plans
 
In addition to the creation of our company website, we intend to focus throughout the foreseeable future, primarily upon the development of the Wiseman Home System. The features of the “Wiseman Home System” are not yet finalized and we have yet commenced development. We expect application development to occur after the conclusion of our offering. The estimated amount of capital needed to develop the Wiseman Home System is range from $45,000 to $75,000. If our anticipated timeline is accurate, we anticipate it will be fully developed and completed by the end of 2019. However, a number of factors could alter our timeline over the course of development, and as such we cannot predict the conclusion of development with any more specificity.

As soon as the application is completed, we have tentative plans in place to pursue various online marketing campaigns which may include, but not strictly be limited to, paid online advertising, social media, and traditional print marketing, in order to capture an initial user base and generate revenue. However, such plans are tentative and have not been fully developed. The following are some, but not necessarily all, intended features of the Wiseman Home System:
 

- | Allow consumers to fully utilize energy by automating functions like adjusting temperature, lights on and off, controlling windows, and adjusting irrigation based on the weather. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- | Provide insights and arouse attentions on energy efficiency and ecological factors to the consumers. 
- | Pinpoint areas where consumers are using more energy than needed, allowing them to reduce the energy consumed in those areas and save money. 

 
Note: There can be no assurances, or guarantees, that our efforts to develop our proposed Wiseman Home System will succeed, if developed. In the event that we cannot successfully develop our application then our business will most likely fail.
 
Additionally, we may use a portion of the proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in, companies, technologies, products or assets that complement our business, we have no present understandings, commitments or agreements to enter into any acquisitions or make any investments. We cannot assure you that we will make any acquisitions or investments in the future.
 
Employees
 
Currently, we have one employee, our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Lai Jinpeng. Mr. Lai Jinpeng has the flexibility to work on our business up to 30 hours per week, but is prepared to devote more time if necessary. At present, Mr. Lai Jinpeng is responsible for every aspect of the Company’s operations.
 
We do not presently have pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing, or similar benefit plans; however, we may adopt plans in the future. There are presently no personal benefits available to our employee, Officer and/or Director. We have no employment agreements at this time with our officers and directors. We intend to hire more staff to assist in the development and execution of our business operations.
