Current Business
 
Effective December 28, 2016, the Company executed a Sale & Purchase Agreement (“S&P”) for the acquisition of 100% of the shares of Yingxi Industrial Chain Group Co., Ltd., a company incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Seychelles. Yingxi Industrial Chain Group Co., Ltd. (“YICG”) is currently a garment manufacturer. Intending to diversify its service portfolio, the Company plans to develop another branch of business: international supply chain management consulting service, which will focus exclusively on the textile & garments industry. The Company plans to assist clients to open textile and garment sales outlets throughout China. The Company will also provide assistance services in plan implementation. Pursuant to the Agreement, which closed on September 25, 2017, the Company issued five hundred million (500,000,000) restricted common shares of the Company to the owners of Yingxi Industrial Chain Group Co., Ltd. in consideration for the acquisition of YICG.
 
After the Share Exchange, YICG’s business became our business. We are a garment manufacturer and logistic service provider based in China. Our common stock is listed on the OTCQB under the symbol of “ATXG”. We classify our businesses into two segments: Garment manufacturing and logistics services.
 
Our garment manufacturing business consists of sales made principally to wholesalers located in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”). We have our own manufacturing facilities, with sufficient production capacity and skilled workers on production lines to ensure that we meet our high quality control standards and timely meet the delivery requirements for our customers. We conduct our garment manufacturing operations through two wholly-owned subsidiaries, namely Dongguan Heng Sheng Wei Garments Co., Ltd (“HSW”) and Shantou Chenghai Dai Tou Garments Co., Ltd (“DT”), which are located in the Guangdong province, China.
 
Our logistic business consists of delivery and courier services covering approximately 20 provinces in China. Although we have our own motor vehicles and drivers, we currently outsource some of the business to our contractors. We believe outsourcing allows us to maximize our capacity and maintain flexibility while reducing capital expenditures and the costs of keeping drivers during slow seasons. We conduct our logistic operations through two wholly-owned subsidiaries, namely Shenzhen Xin Kuai Jie Transportation Co., Ltd (“XKJ”) and Shenzhen Hua Peng Fa Logistic Co., Ltd (“HPF”), which are located in the Guangdong province, China.
 
Business Objectives
 
Garment Manufacturing Business
 
We believe the strength of our garment manufacturing business is mainly due to our consistent emphasis on exceptional quality and timely delivery. The primary business objective for our garment manufacturing segment is to expand our customer base and improve our profit. In the future, we plan to develop our growth opportunities and continued investment initiatives to provide value-added consulting services to the apparel supply-chain companies and retailers in China.
Logistic Business
 
The business objective and future plan for our logistic service segment is to establish an efficient logistic system and to build a nationwide delivery and courier network in China. As of June 30, 2018, we provide logistic service to 30 cities in approximately 20 provinces. We expect to develop an additional 20 logistic points in existing serving cities in the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2018 and improve the Company’s profit in the 2019 fiscal year.
Seasonality of Business
 
Our business is affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels of garment sales in our second and third quarters and higher logistic service revenue in our third and fourth quarters. These trends primarily result from the timing of seasonal garment manufacturing shipments and holiday periods in the logistic segment.
 
Garment manufacturing business
 
For our new customers, we generally require orders placed to be backed by advances or deposits. For our long-term and established customers with good payment track records, we generally provide payment terms between 30 to 180 days following the delivery of finished goods.

Logistic business
 
For logistic service, we generally receive payments from the customers between 30 to 90 days following the date of the register of our receipt of packages.
 
Future Business
 
In addition to our garment manufacturing business, we also want to kick start our supply chain management consulting service. Our supply chain management consulting service is still under development with no active clients. However, due to the uniqueness of our business model, we have attracted over 30 potential clients strongly interested in our proposed service. All of those potential clients are located in China. We plan to put our proposed service into operation in the third quarter of calendar 2018 or the first quarter of calendar 2019.
 
To help ensure the quality of our business, we conduct strict rules for our potential clients.
 
Client Qualifications: To sign a servicing contract with the Company, a potential client must:
 

1. | Be established and validly existing pursuant to relevant laws and regulations; 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Demonstrate that they have a good business reputation and operating performance, and comply with professional ethics; and 
3. | Have not breached any law or regulation, or have received any administrative penalty from a regulatory body or other department in the past twenty-four months. 

 
Medium and small-sized enterprises all over the world can search for our service, but our current focus is on helping clients in China.
 
Many medium-small sized enterprises in China experience the problem of business maintenance or expansion in the textile and garments industry where increasing operational costs cause decreasing profit. Most seek to employ new business models that can increase a company’s competitive advantage and increase sales. We have found that due to the limitation of resources and information, management of these enterprises find it hard to design a suitable plan for their company’s sustainable development.
 
To assist these enterprises, we set up a research team (currently totaling six persons) to carry out extensive investigation and integrate necessary industry information and resources which can help us to work out the best plan for our clients.
 
The research is planned to include:
 

1. | Client diligence: To collect details on the client including its financial reports, management, planned business model, internal systems, operation flows and other important information; 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Relevant business partner research: Focus on the raw material supplier and product buyer, and conduct comprehensive analysis; 
3. | Market research: To discover the actual market demands and market share; and 
4. | Environment research: Research and analyze the environment of policy, economy, technology and legal. 

 
We plan to develop a multi-task Industrial Chain Service System which we plan to call “Adden Chain” not only for providing business solutions to clients, but also assisting the clients to fully realize their business plan and potential.
 
Our company’s services can be divided into three parts:
 
Consulting & Plan Design
 
There are four main services within this part:
 
Promotion Service
 
We will design a “Promotion Plan” for our clients depending on their requirements to improve their marketing plans.

Operation Assistance Service
 
We can help clients to sort out all the individual parts (i.e., Raw Materials Supply, Manufacturing, Product Design and Marketing) within the whole operation chain, and assist them to fix weaknesses. We can also help clients to reallocate the resources they own and improve their operational efficiency.
Logistics and International Trading Service
 
We develop and apply our “YX logistics system” to improve our client’s transportation efficiency. Our YX logistics system mainly provides three services to our clients: transportation service; storage & distribution service; and bulk purchasing service.
 
We also work with qualified international trading companies to help expand our clients’ global market share. Currently we build trading routes to various areas like America, Australia and Africa which can help clients lower international trading costs.
 
Financial Services
 
We will offer financial services to selected clients. The services include long term & short term loans which we provide to clients, financing services and inventory pledge services. Also, we plan to build a third party payment center which can improve clients’ capital turnover. Clients will be able to employ the third party payment center to process transactions and accept the payment terms and payment period we set. As the third party guarantor, we could help our clients to pay or receive payments on time.
Plan implementation Assistance:
 
We have already built strategic cooperative relationships with over 40 textile and garments industry related entities. We are available to assist our clients to deal with various issues and problems.
Additional Services
 
Team Establishment:
 
We will assist clients to establish an organizational structure and a management team best suited for their business plan.
 
Headhunting Services:
 
We work with headhunting companies, i.e., companies that provide employment or recruiting services to find the most qualified managers and professionals to meet the specific needs of our clients.
Follow-up Service:
 
We provide clients with continuous consultancy and follow-up services throughout the entire startup and service period.
 
Markets
 
Currently, our market focuses on small and medium-sized enterprises in China who have business expansion plans.
 
Government Regulations
 
Currently there are no government regulations regarding our type of services in China. The Chinese government encourages small-medium sized traditional industry companies to conduct business model transformation and technology updates, which may help companies gain more competitive advantages in international markets.
 
Other than the required adherence to general business laws and regulatory disclosures, our services are not affected by any specific additional Chinese government regulations. However, this does not preclude the possibility that China will institute regulations that will make it difficult or impossible for us to operate successfully, if at all, in China, in the future, and if that were the case, we would have to focus our business on companies located outside China.

Our operations are not subject to environmental laws, including any laws addressing air and water pollution and management of hazardous substances and wastes and we do not anticipate capital expenditures for environmental control facilities.

As of July 16, 2018, we have 7 full-time employees, of which 1 is in the administrative department, 2 are in the consultancy service department, 2 are in the research & analysis department and 2 are in the technological department.
