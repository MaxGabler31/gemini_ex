ITEM 1 – Business
General Development of Business
 
Founded in 1870 by George H. Tennant, Tennant Company ("the Company, we, us, or our"), headquartered in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, is a world leader in the design, manufacture and marketing of solutions that help create a cleaner, safer and healthier world. Tennant was incorporated as a Minnesota corporation in 1909 and began as a one-man woodworking business, eventually evolving into a successful wood flooring and wood products company, and finally into a manufacturer of floor cleaning equipment. Throughout its history, the Company has remained focused on advancing our industry by aggressively pursuing new technologies and creating a culture that celebrates innovation.
 
Today, the Company has 11 global manufacturing locations and operates in three geographic areas including the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia Pacific (APAC). We aggregate our operating segments into one reportable segment that consists of the design, manufacture and sale and servicing of products used primarily in the maintenance of nonresidential surfaces. The Company is committed to developing innovative and sustainable solutions that help our customers clean spaces more effectively with high-performance solutions that minimize waste, reduce costs, improve safety and further sustainability goals.
 
The Company is focused on achieving operating efficiencies as we continue to innovate and invest in our product portfolio to deliver value to our customers and drive profitable growth for our shareholders.
 
Principal Products, Markets and Distribution
 
The Company offers products and solutions consisting of mechanized cleaning equipment for both industrial and commercial use, detergent-free and other sustainable cleaning technologies, aftermarket parts and consumables, equipment maintenance and repair services, and business solutions such as financing, rental and leasing programs, and machine-to-machine asset management solutions. The Company is committed to developing cleaning technologies, including autonomous solutions, which increase cleaning productivity. We have strong brand presence in the global markets we serve, offering both premium and mid-tier products for each region to meet customer needs.  
 
The Company's products are used in many types of environments including: retail establishments, distribution centers, factories and warehouses, public venues such as arenas and stadiums, office buildings, schools and universities, hospitals and clinics, parking lots and streets, and more. The Company markets its offerings under the following brands: Tennant®, Nobles®, Alfa Uma Empresa Tennant™, IRIS®, VLX™, IPC brands, Gaomei and Rongen brands as well as private-label brands. The Company's more than 40,000 customers include contract cleaners to whom organizations outsource facilities maintenance, as well as businesses that perform facilities maintenance themselves. The Company reaches these customers through the industry's largest direct sales and service organization and through a strong and well-supported network of authorized distributors worldwide.
 
The Company's global field service network is the most extensive in the industry. We sell products directly in 15 countries and through distributors in more than 100 countries.
 
Raw Materials and Component Parts
 
Steel, metal alloys and resin are the primary raw materials used to manufacture our mechanized cleaning equipment. We purchase various goods, including component parts and services used in production, logistics and product development processes from third parties. In 2021, the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic caused imbalances within global supply markets. As markets re-opened and demand increased following COVID lockdowns, the Company experienced raw material price inflation and constrained supply of certain raw materials and component parts. The Company continues work to minimize the impact of price inflation and market supply challenges by employing local-for-local and region-for-region manufacturing and sourcing to allow us to manufacture our products closer to our customers. At the same time, our engineering teams are evaluating platform design to allow for available parts and to increase our sourcing flexibility. We expect price inflation and market supply challenges to continue which may negatively impact our financial results.

Intellectual Property
 
The Company owns a broad range of intellectual property rights in both the United States and a number of foreign countries. Our patents, proprietary technologies and trade secrets, customer relationships, licenses, trademarks, trade names and brand names in the aggregate constitute a valuable asset, but we do not regard our business as being materially dependent upon any single item or category of intellectual property. We take appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property to the extent such intellectual property can be protected.
Research and Development
 
Research and development expenses include scientific research costs such as salaries, prototypes, shop supplies, testing, technical information technology and administrative expenditures as well as an allocation of corporate costs. We conduct research and development activities to develop new products and to enhance the functionality, effectiveness, ease of use and reliability of our existing products. We believe that our research and development efforts have been, and continue to be, key drivers of our success in the marketplace.
Seasonality
 
Although the Company’s business is not seasonal in the traditional sense, the percentage of revenues in each quarter typically ranges from 22% to 28% of the total year. The first quarter tends to be at the low end of the range reflecting customers’ initial slow ramp up of capital purchases and the Company’s efforts to close out orders at the end of each year. The second and fourth quarters tend to be toward the high end of the range and the third quarter is typically in the middle of the range.
Major Customers
 
The Company sells a wide range of products to a diversified base of customers around the world and has no material concentration of credit risk or significant payment terms extended to customers.
Competition
 
Public industry data concerning global market share is limited; however, through an assessment of validated third-party sources and sponsored third-party market studies, the Company is confident in its position as a world-leading manufacturer of floor maintenance and cleaning equipment. Several global competitors compete with the Company in virtually every geography of the world. However, small regional competitors are also significant competitors who vary by country, vertical market, product category or channel. The Company competes primarily on the basis of offering a broad line of high-quality, innovative products supported by an extensive sales and service network in major markets.
Human Capital
 
Tennant Company has a commitment to our employees to foster a culture of integrity and stewardship. This guides our actions as we manage our business and holds us accountable to our colleagues to care for one another and work together to bring to market sustainable cleaning innovations that empower others to create a cleaner, safer, and healthier world. To that end, our executive leadership, as well as our Board of Directors, emphasize the importance of positive human capital management. The following are key human capital measures and objectives that the Company currently focuses on:
Ethics and Employee Safety
 
We prioritize the health and safety of all of our employees. In our manufacturing facilities, we have established safety teams that proactively identify areas of improvement and help to reinforce employee behaviors in order to reduce or eliminate incidents. In our manufacturing facilities, behavioral safety culture is a primary focus, with a specific growing emphasis on “near-miss” reporting and resolution. We define a near-miss event as a situation where no property was damaged, and no personal injury was sustained, but given a slight shift in time or position, damage and/or injury could have occurred. This focus has increased awareness to potential incidents at our facilities. In addition to our established safety programs, our teams have continued our enhanced COVID-19 safety protocols in our manufacturing, distribution and office facilities. The result is we continue to meet or exceed our safety metrics. Additionally, we have an experienced team of Enterprise Health and Safety professionals that provide onsite and corporate-level support to our global teams. 
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
 
Tennant is proud to be an equal opportunity employer where we foster and maintain an ethical work environment free of discrimination. Employment decisions are made on the basis of individual skill, ability, reliability, productivity, and other factors important to performance. In 2021, we launched our Diversity Equity and Inclusion strategy with a vision to establish our worldwide diversity as a differentiator for our organization. We progressed work around diagnosing current state and establishing our baseline, putting in place executive oversight, communicating our strategy to our global workforce, starting leader education and initiating employee involvement through Employee Resource Groups (ERGs).

Diversity in Governance
 
As of December 31, 2021, women represented 57% of our executive management team and 33% of our Board of Directors.
 
Gender Equitable Pay
 
In November 2021, Tennant Company performed its annual gender wage gap analysis to evaluate any gender differences in pay. Our results showed the median income for women working full time in the United States was reported to be 98.76% as compared to their male counterparts. In other words, women at Tennant were seen to be making 98.76 cents to every $1 men earned. To put this figure in context, Tennant’s wage gap findings were compared to the national average. According to the national statistics published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in 2020, women on average made 82.3% of the earnings made by males. The adjusted pay gap at Tennant was found to be 100.56% after controlling for variables such as title, grade, and work location, which are legitimate and non-discretionary reasons for pay difference. This analysis suggests there is no evidence of pay gap at Tennant Company.
 
The following table represents employees by gender and region as of December 31, 2021:
 


 | Female | Male | Total
----------------------------+--------+-------+------
Americas | 404 | 1,776 | 2,180
Europe, Middle East, Africa | 406 | 1,265 | 1,671
Asia Pacific | 156 | 256 | 412 
Total | 966 | 3,297 | 4,263

Competitive Pay and Benefits
 
Our overall objective is to align executive compensation with our operating goals and the interests of our shareholders. We seek to offer a comprehensive compensation package that is competitive with those of similarly sized U.S. durable goods manufacturing companies. Our compensation programs take into account that an executive’s actual compensation level may be greater or less than targeted based on our annual and long-term financial performance against pre-established goals, the individual’s performance and the individual’s scope of responsibilities. Specifically, our compensation programs are designed to create a relationship between pay and performance by providing a strong link between our short- and long-term business goals and executive compensation, attract and retain high-caliber key executive officers who can create long-term financial success for the company and enhance shareholder return, motivate executive officers to achieve our goals by placing a significant portion of pay at risk, align the interests of executive officers with those of our shareholders by providing a significant portion of compensation in stock-based awards, and discourage risk-taking behavior that would likely have a material adverse effect on the company.
 
Tennant Company’s philosophy is to reward employees competitively for the work they perform so that we retain and attract new talent and remain competitive within our marketplace. As an employer we offer pay, benefits, recognition and well-being programs which are tailored for geographic location, statutory requirements and competitive practice as appropriate. We provide employee wages that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge and geographic location. 
 
Talent
 
We believe attraction, development, engagement and retention of talent is key to achieving our organizational objectives. We focus on creating a high-performance culture, including our annual performance management process for all employees which aligns with our employee and leadership competency framework. In addition, we engage in annual talent conversations to help us identify, develop and deploy talent to achieve our objectives and address talent risks. We believe employee feedback is key to engagement and survey our employees twice a year and make improvements as necessary.   Available Information
