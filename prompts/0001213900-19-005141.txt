As of December 31, 2018, Carbon California owns working interests approximately 300 gross wells (270 net) and has leasehold positions in approximately 9,000 net developed acres and approximately 8,000 net undeveloped acres.
 
Recent Acquisitions
 
When Carbon California makes acquisitions, we contribute our pro rata portion of the purchase price to fund such acquisitions. In 2018, we contributed an aggregate of $5.0 million to Carbon California in connection with Carbon California’s acquisition activities.
 
When Carbon Appalachia made acquisitions (prior to the OIE Membership Acquisition described below), we contributed our pro rata portion of the purchase price to fund such acquisitions. During 2018, we did not contribute any additional funds to Carbon Appalachia.
 
While Carbon Appalachia and Carbon California made other insignificant acquisitions that are not specifically listed, the acquisitions described below most meaningfully affect the financial condition of Carbon Appalachia and Carbon California, and, therefore, us. See “Acquisition and Divestiture Activities” for more information about our acquisitions and divestitures.
 

● | In December 2018, we acquired all of the Class A Units of Carbon Appalachia owned by Old Ironsides for a purchase price of $58.1 million, subject to purchase price adjustments (“OIE Membership Acquisition”). As a result of the OIE Membership Acquisition, we now hold all of the issued and outstanding ownership interests of Carbon Appalachia, along with its direct and indirect subsidiaries (Carbon Appalachia Group, LLC, Carbon Tennessee Mining Company, LLC, Carbon Appalachia Enterprises, LLC, Carbon West Virginia Company, LLC, Cranberry Pipeline Corporation, Knox Energy, LLC, Coalfield Pipeline Company and Appalachia Gas Services Company, LLC). The acquisition was funded with cash, debt and the issuance of notes to Old Ironsides. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | On July 11, 2018, we completed an acquisition of 54 operated oil and gas wells covering approximately 55,000 gross acres (22,000 net) and the associated mineral interests in the Appalachian Basin for a purchase price of $3.0 million, subject to customary and standard purchase price adjustments (the “Liberty Acquisition”). The Liberty Acquisition increased our working interest in the acquired wells from 60% to 100%. The Liberty Acquisition was funded through borrowings under our previous credit facility. The Liberty Acquisition is accounted for as a non-significant asset acquisition. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In May 2018, but effective as of October 1, 2017, Carbon California acquired 309 operated and one non-operated oil wells covering approximately 6,800 gross acres (6,600 net), and fee interests in and to certain lands, situated in the Ventura Basin, together with associated wells, pipelines, facilities, equipment and other property rights for a purchase price of $43.0 million, subject to customary and standard purchase price adjustments, from Seneca Resources Corporation (the “Seneca Acquisition”). We contributed approximately $5.0 million to Carbon California to fund our portion of the purchase price with the remainder funded by Prudential and debt. We raised our $5.0 million through the issuance of 50,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Preferred Stock”), to Yorktown. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name Change
 
Effective June 30, 2018, Carbon Natural Gas Company changed its name to Carbon Energy Corporation.
 
Increase in Authorized Shares of Common Stock
 
On June 1, 2018, we increased the number of authorized shares of our common stock from 10,000,000 to 35,000,000.
 
Preferred Stock Issuance to Yorktown
 
In connection with the closing of the Seneca Acquisition, we raised $5.0 million through the issuance of 50,000 shares of Preferred Stock to Yorktown.
 
Strategy
 
Our primary business objective is to create stockholder value through consistent growth in cash flows, production and reserves through drilling on our existing oil and gas properties and through the acquisition of complementary properties. We focus on the development of our existing leaseholds, which consist primarily of low risk projects. We invest in technical staff and geological and engineering technology to enhance the value of our properties.

We intend to accomplish our objective by executing the following strategies:
 

● | Capitalize on the development of our oil and gas properties. Our assets consist of oil and gas properties in the Appalachian, Ventura and Illinois Basins. We aim to continue to safely optimize returns from our existing producing assets by using established technologies to maximize recoveries of in-place hydrocarbons. We expect the production from our properties will increase as we continue to develop and optimize the operation of our properties. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Acquire complementary properties. A core part of our strategy is to grow our oil and gas asset base through the acquisition of properties in the vicinity of our existing properties that feature similar reserve and production attributes. During 2018 and 2017, we partnered with Prudential to finance the acquisitions of producing properties in the Ventura Basin through Carbon California and with Old Ironsides to finance the acquisitions of producing properties in the Appalachian Basin through Carbon Appalachia, in addition to complementary properties acquired directly by the Company. We own significant interest in Carbon California and now own 100% interest in Carbon Appalachia and plan to continue to aggregate complementary properties. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reduce operating costs through the aggregation and integration of newly acquired assets in our expanding operational footprint in both the Appalachia Basin and the Ventura Basin. We plan to continue to realize economies of scale and efficiency gains from spreading our fixed operating costs over a larger asset base and reducing variable costs. Historically, we have targeted overhead cost reductions, well maintenance cost reductions, field-level optimization and gathering system reconfigurations. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Replace reserves and production through a capital program of acquiring proved reserves and executing low risk development projects. We intend to capitalize on our regional expertise in our core operating areas to continue to aggregate complementary properties and to optimize field development spending to create production and reserve growth. We allocate capital among opportunities in these operating areas based on risked well economics, with a view to balancing our portfolio to achieve consistent and profitable growth in production and reserves. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Some of our estimated proved reserves and resources are classified as unconventional, including fractured shale formations, tight gas sands, and coalbed methane. Our technical team has significant experience in drilling vertical, horizontal and directional wells, as well as fracture stimulation of unconventional formations. We utilize geological, drilling and completion technologies that enhance the predictability and repeatability of finding and recovering hydrocarbons throughout our asset base.
 

● | Maintain financial flexibility. We expect to fund activities and acquisitions from a combination of cash flow from operations and our bank credit facilities with LegacyTexas Bank and Prudential. In the past, we also have accessed outside capital through the use of joint ventures or similar arrangements, including our recent partnerships with Prudential in Carbon California and Old Ironsides in Carbon Appalachia. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Acquire and develop reserves with crude oil the primary objective in California and natural gas the primary objective in Appalachia. We believe that a diverse commodity mix provides us with commodity optionality, which allows us to direct capital spending to develop the commodity that offers the best return on investment at the time. As of December 31, 2018, our proved reserves were composed of approximately 78.5% natural gas, 19.5% oil and 2.0% natural gas liquids. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Control operating decisions and capital program. At December 31, 2018, we operated approximately 7,600 producing wells, or approximately 90% of the wells in which we have a working interest. This high percentage of operated wells allows us to manage the nature and timing of our capital expenditures, lease operating expenses and marketing of our oil and natural gas production. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Manage commodity price exposure through an active hedging program. We maintain a hedging program designed to reduce exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices. As of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding natural gas hedges of approximately 15,055,000 MMBtu for 2019 at an average price of $2.85 per MMBtu, approximately 12,433,000 MMBtu for 2020 at an average price of $2.73 per MMBtu and approximately 2,598,000 MMBtu for 2021 at an average price of $2.69 per MMBtu. We also had outstanding natural gas collars of approximately 1,672,000 MMBtu in place for 2019 at an average floor and ceiling price of $2.60 and 3.19 per MMBtu and approximately 2,036,000 MMBtu for 2020 at an average floor and ceiling price of $2.50 and $2.70 per MMBtu. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding WTI oil hedges of approximately 219,000 barrels for 2019 at an average price of $53.50 per barrel and approximately 121,000 barrels for 2020 at an average price of $55.37 per barrel. We also had outstanding Brent oil hedges of approximately 148,000 barrels for 2019 at an average price of $66.82 per barrel, approximately 152,000 barrels for 2020 at an average price of $66.03 per barrel, and approximately 86,000 barrels for 2021 at an average price of $67.12.

● | Manage midstream assets and secure firm takeaway capacity. We own natural gas gathering and compression facilities in the Appalachian and Illinois Basins. We believe that owning gathering and compression facilities allows us to decrease dependence on third parties, and to better manage the timing of our asset development and to receive higher netback pricing from the markets in which we sell our production. We have secured long-term firm takeaway capacity on various natural gas pipelines to accommodate the transportation and marketing of certain of our existing and expected production.

Equity Investments in Affiliates
 
Carbon Appalachia
 
Our Carbon Appalachia Ownership Interests
 
After the closing of the OIE Membership Acquisition on December 31, 2018, we own 100% of Carbon Appalachia.
 Prior to the closing of the OIE Membership Acquisition on December 31, 2018, we owned 26.50% of the voting interest and 27.24% of the profits interest in Carbon Appalachia through our ownership of Class A Units and Class C Units in Carbon Appalachia. In addition, we owned 100% of the Class B Units in Carbon Appalachia.
2018 Credit Facility
 
In connection with and concurrent with the closing of the OIE Membership Acquisition, the Company and its subsidiaries amended and restated the previous credit facility and the CAE Credit Facility which, after the amendment, provides for a $500.0 million senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the “2018 Credit Facility”) which matures December 31, 2022 and a $15.0 million term loan which matures in 2020. The 2018 Credit Facility includes a sublimit of $1.5 million for letters of credit. The 2018 Credit Facility replaces the previous credit facility and the CAE Credit Facility. The initial borrowing base under the 2018 Credit Facility is $75.0 million.
 
The 2018 Credit Facility also provides for a $15.0 million term loan which bears interest at a rate of 6.25% and is payable in 18 equal monthly installments beginning February 1, 2019 with the last payment due on June 30, 2020.
 
As of December 31, 2018, there was approximately $70.0 million in outstanding borrowings and letters of credit and $5.0 million of additional borrowing capacity under the 2018 Credit Facility.
 
Carbon Appalachia Accounting Treatment
 
As a result of the OIE Membership Acquisition on December 31, 2018, we consolidate Carbon Appalachia.
 
Prior to the closing of the OIE Membership Acquisition on December 31, 2018, and based on our ownership of 26.50% of the voting interest and 27.24% of the profits interest, our ability to appoint a member to the board of directors and our role as manager of Carbon Appalachia, we accounted for our investment in Carbon Appalachia under the equity method of accounting as we believed we could exert significant influence on Carbon Appalachia. We used the hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”) method to determine our share of profits or losses in Carbon Appalachia and adjusted the carrying value of our investment accordingly. The HLBV method is a balance-sheet approach that calculates the amount each member of an entity would receive if the entity were liquidated at book value at the end of each measurement period. The change in the allocated amount to each member during the period represents the income or loss allocated to that member. For the year ended December 31, 2018 (and immediately preceding the closing of the OIE Membership Acquisition), Carbon Appalachia generated net income, of which our share was approximately $1.0 million. From the commencement of operations on April 3, 2017 through December 31, 2017, Carbon Appalachia generated net income, of which our share was approximately $1.1 million.
Carbon California
 
Our Carbon California Ownership Interests
 
As of December 31, 2018, we own 53.92% of the voting and profits interests in Carbon California through our ownership of Class A Units and Class B Units in Carbon California. The Class A Units and Class B Units, subject to certain limitations, participate pro rata in distributions from Carbon California. Carbon California does not currently pay distributions to its members, including us.
Carbon California Senior Revolving Notes and Subordinated Notes
 
In connection with the CRC Acquisition, Carbon California (i) entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the “Note Purchase Agreement”) for the issuance and sale of Senior Secured Revolving Notes to Prudential Legacy Insurance Company of New Jersey and Prudential Insurance Company of America with a revolving borrowing capacity of $25.0 million (the “Senior Revolving Notes”) which mature on February 15, 2022 and (ii) entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) with Prudential for the issuance and sale of $10.0 million of Senior Subordinated Notes (the “Subordinated Notes”) due February 15, 2024. We are not a guarantor of the Senior Revolving Notes or the Subordinated Notes. The closing of the Note Purchase Agreement and the Securities Purchase Agreement on February 15, 2017, resulted in the sale and issuance by Carbon California of (i) Senior Revolving Notes in the principal amount of $10.0 million and (ii) Subordinated Notes in the original principal amount of $10.0 million. The maximum principal amount available under the Senior Revolving Notes is based upon the borrowing base attributable to Carbon California’s proved oil and gas reserves which is to be determined at least semi-annually. The current borrowing base is $41.0 million, of which $38.5 million is outstanding as of December 31, 2018. The ability of Carbon California to make distributions to its owners, including us, is dependent upon the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement and Securities Purchase Agreement, which currently prohibit distributions unless they are agreed to by Prudential Legacy Insurance Company of New Jersey and Prudential Insurance Company of America.

Borrowings under the Senior Revolving Notes and net proceeds from the Subordinated Notes and the 2018 Subordinated Notes issuances were used to fund the Mirada Acquisition, the CRC Acquisition and the Seneca Acquisition. Additional borrowings from the Senior Revolving Notes may be used to fund field development projects and to fund future complementary acquisitions and for general working capital purposes of Carbon California. See Note 5 to the Carbon California financial statements.
 
As of December 31, 2018, Carbon California was in compliance with its covenants.
 
Carbon California Accounting Treatment
 
On February 1, 2018, upon the exercise of the California Warrant, our ownership of Carbon California changed to 53.92%. As a result, we consolidate Carbon California operations. Prior to February 1, 2018, and based on our ownership of 17.81% of the voting and profits interests, our ability to appoint a member to the board of directors and our role of manager of Carbon California, we accounted for our investment in Carbon California under the equity method of accounting as we believe we could exert significant influence. We used the HLBV method to determine our share of profits or losses in Carbon California and adjusted the carrying value of our investment accordingly. From February 15, 2017 (inception) through December 31, 2017 and for the period January 1, 2018 to January 31, 2018, Carbon California incurred a net loss, of which our share (as a holder of Class B Units for that period) was zero.
Risk Management
 
We hedge a portion of forecasted oil and gas production to reduce exposure to fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas and provide long-term cash flow predictability to pay dividends or distributions, respectively, and service debt. By removing a portion of the price volatility associated with future production, we expect to mitigate, but not eliminate, the potential effects of variability in cash flow from operations due to adverse fluctuations in commodity prices.

Preparation of Reserves Estimates
 
Our estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, were based on the average fiscal-year prices for oil and natural gas (calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the month price for each month within the 12-month period ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively). Proved developed oil and gas reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Proved undeveloped reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those locations on development spacing areas that are offsetting economic producers that are reasonably certain of economic production when drilled. Proved undeveloped reserves for other undrilled development spacing areas are claimed only where it can be demonstrated with reasonable certainty that there is continuity of economic production from the existing productive formation. Proved undeveloped reserves are included when they are scheduled to be drilled within five years.
 
SEC rules dictate the types of technologies that a company may use to establish reserve estimates including the extraction of non-traditional resources, such as natural gas extracted from shales as well as bitumen extracted from oil sands. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our estimated proved reserves.
 
Uncertainties are inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves, including many factors beyond our control. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating subsurface accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner, and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and its interpretation. As a result, estimates by different engineers often vary, sometimes significantly. In addition, physical factors such as the results of drilling, testing, and production subsequent to the date of an estimate, as well as economic factors such as changes in product prices or development and production expenses, may require revision of such estimates. Accordingly, quantities of oil and natural gas ultimately recovered will vary from reserve estimates. See “Risk Factors,” for a description of some of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business and reserves.
 
Reserve estimates are based on production performance, data acquired remotely or in wells, and are guided by petrophysical, geologic, geophysical and reservoir engineering models. Estimates of our proved reserves were based on deterministic methods. In the case of mature developed reserves, reserve estimates are determined by decline curve analysis and in the case of immature developed and undeveloped reserves, by analogy, using proximate or otherwise appropriate examples in addition to volumetric analysis. The technologies and economic data used in estimating our proved reserves include empirical evidence through drilling results and well performance, well logs and test data, geologic maps and available downhole and production data. Further, the internal review process of our wells and related reserve estimates includes but is not limited to the following:
 

● | A comparison is made and documented of actual data from our accounting system to the data utilized in the reserve database. Current production, revenue and expense information obtained from our accounting records is subject to external quarterly reviews, annual audits and additional internal controls over financial reporting. This process is designed to create assurance that production, revenues and expenses are accurately reflected in the reserve database.

● | A comparison is made and documented of land and lease records to ownership interest data in the reserve database. This process is designed to create assurance that the costs and revenues utilized in the reserves estimation match actual ownership interests. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A comparison is made of property acquisitions, disposals, retirements or transfers to the property records maintained in the reserve database to verify that all are accounted for accurately. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Natural gas pricing for the first flow day of every month is obtained from Platts Gas Daily. Oil pricing for the first flow day of every month is obtained from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. At the reporting date, 12-month average prices are determined. Regional variations in pricing and related deductions are similarly obtained and a 12-month average is calculated at year end. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the independent engineering firm, Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc. (“CGA”) reviewed with us, technical personnel field performance and future development plans. Following these reviews, we furnished our internal reserve database and supporting data to CGA in order for them to prepare their independent reserve estimates and final report. We restrict access to our database containing reserve information to select individuals from our engineering and corporate development departments. CGA’s independent reserve estimates and final report are for our interests in the respective oil and gas properties and represents 100% of the total proved hydrocarbon reserves owned by us or 99% of the consolidated proved hydrocarbon reserves presented in our consolidated financial statements. CGA’s report does not include the hydrocarbon reserves owned by the non-controlling interests of our consolidated partnerships. We calculated the estimated reserves of the non-controlling interests of the consolidated partnerships’ oil and gas properties by multiplying CGA’s independent reserve estimates for such properties by the respective non-controlling interests in those properties.
 
Our Vice President of Engineering, Richard Finucane, and our Director of Corporate Planning and Development, Todd Habliston, are responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserve estimates with consultations from our internal technical and accounting staff. Mr. Finucane has been involved in reservoir engineering in the Appalachian Basin since 1982 and has worked as an oil and natural gas engineer since 1978 and holds a B.S. in Civil Engineering from the University of Tennessee and is admitted as an expert in oil and natural gas matters in civil and regulatory proceedings in Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia. Mr. Habliston has over 35 years of oil and gas experience and has served as Adjunct Professor at the Colorado School of Mines. Mr. Habliston earned a B.S. in Chemical and Petroleum Refining Engineering from the Colorado School of Mines and an MBA from Purdue University. He is a registered Professional Engineer and is a member of SPE, SPEE, AAPG, API and IPAA.
 
Drilling Activities
 
Based on oil and natural gas prices during 2018, we reduced our drilling activities to manage and optimize the utilization of our capital resources. During 2018, our capital expenditures consisted principally of oil-related remediation, return to production and recompletion projects in California and the optimization and streamlining of our natural gas gathering and compression facilities in Appalachia to provide more efficient and lower cost operations and greater flexibility in moving our production to markets with more favorable pricing.
 
The following table summarizes the number of wells drilled for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Gross wells reflect the sum of all wells in which we own an interest. Net wells reflect the sum of our working interests in gross wells.

Present Activities
 
Our current focus is on growth through the acquisition of producing wells. We also intend to optimize field development opportunities to create production and reserve growth.
Marketing and Delivery Commitments
 
Our oil and natural gas production is generally sold on a month-to-month basis in the spot market, priced in reference to published indices. We believe that the loss of one or more of our purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our production, because any individual purchaser could be readily replaced by another purchaser, absent a broad market disruption.
 
We currently do not have any material delivery commitments.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 45% of our revenue was generated by three purchasers.
 
Through our acquisition activities, we acquired long-term firm transportation contracts that were entered into to ensure the transport of certain gas production to purchasers. Any shortfall of capacity use upon acquisition was recorded as a liability and is included in firm transportation obligations on the consolidated balance sheet of each entity.

Total firm transportation volumes and related demand charges for the remaining term of these contracts at December 31, 2018 related to us are summarized in the table below.

Sep 2022 – May 2027 | | 29,990 | | $ | 0.21 

Competition
 
We encounter competition in all aspects of business, including acquisition of properties and oil and natural gas leases, marketing oil and natural gas, obtaining services and labor, and securing drilling rigs and other equipment and materials necessary for drilling and completing wells. Our ability to increase reserves in the future will depend on our ability to generate successful prospects on existing properties, execute development drilling programs, and acquire additional producing properties and leases for future development and exploration. Competitors include independent oil and gas companies, major oil and gas companies and individual producers and operators within and outside of the Appalachian, Illinois and Ventura Basins. A number of the companies with which we compete with have larger staffs and greater financial and operational resources than we have. Because of the nature of our oil and natural gas assets and management’s experience in developing reserves and acquiring properties, we believe that we effectively compete in our and their markets. See - “Risk Factors - Competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, making it more difficult for us to acquire properties, market oil and natural gas and secure trained personnel.”
Regulation
 
Federal, state and local agencies have extensive rules and regulations applicable to oil and natural gas exploration, production and related operations. These laws and regulations may change in response to economic or political conditions. Matters subject to current governmental regulation and/or pending legislative or regulatory changes include the discharge or other release into the environment of wastes and other substances in connection with drilling and production activities (including fracture stimulation operations), bonds or other financial responsibility requirements to cover drilling risks and well plugging and abandonment, reclamation or restoration costs, reports concerning our operations, the spacing of wells, unitization and pooling of properties, taxation, and the use of derivative hedging instruments. Failure to comply with laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations and the issuance of injunctions that could delay, limit or prohibit certain of our operations. In the past, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production. In order to conserve supplies of oil and gas, oil and gas conservation commissions and other agencies may restrict the rates of flow of wells below actual production capacity, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas, and may impose certain requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individual wells. Further, a significant spill from one of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. The laws regulate, among other things, the production, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of oil and natural gas, by-products from each and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with our operations. Although we believe we are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations, such laws and regulations may be amended or reinterpreted. In addition, unforeseen environmental incidents may occur or past non-compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered. Therefore, we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations.
 
Most states require drilling permits, drilling and operating bonds and the filing of various reports and impose other requirements relating to the exploration and production of oil and natural gas. Many states also have statutes or regulations regarding conservation matters including rules governing the size of drilling and spacing units, the density of wells and the unitization of oil and natural gas properties. The federal and state regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and affects our profitability.
 
Federal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the prices received for natural gas production. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) has jurisdiction over the transportation and sale or resale of natural gas in interstate commerce under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (“NGA”), the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (“NGPA”), and the regulations promulgated under those statutes. We own an intrastate natural gas pipeline through our ownership of the Cranberry Pipeline, that provides interstate transportation and storage services pursuant to Section 311 of the NGPA, as well as intrastate transportation and storage services that are regulated by the West Virginia Public Service Commission. For qualified intrastate pipelines, FERC allows interstate transportation service “on behalf of” interstate pipelines or local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines without subjecting the intrastate pipeline to the more comprehensive NGA jurisdiction of FERC. We provide Section 311 service in accordance with a publicly available Statement of Operating Conditions filed with FERC under rates that are subject to approval by the FERC. By Letter Order issued May 15, 2013, the FERC approved the current Cranberry Pipeline rates. The May 15, 2013 Letter Order required Cranberry Pipeline to file a renewed rate petition by December 18, 2017. On November 21, 2017, FERC extended this filing deadline to December 18, 2018 in recognition of potential rate impacts of the September 2017 Acquisition. On December 12, 2018, FERC extended this filing deadline to February 19, 2019.

In 2005, Congress enacted the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (“EPAct 2005”), which amends the NGA to make it unlawful for any entity, including non-jurisdictional producers such as Carbon, Carbon Appalachia and Carbon California, to use any deceptive or manipulative device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to regulation by the FERC, or contravention of rules prescribed by FERC. EPAct 2005 also gives FERC authority to impose civil penalties for violations of the NGA up to approximately $1,200,000 per day per violation, and this amount is adjusted for inflation on an annual basis. The anti-manipulation rule does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales or gathering, but does apply to activities of otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” natural gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction. It therefore reflects a significant expansion of FERC’s enforcement authority. We do not anticipate we will be affected any differently than other producers of natural gas in respect of EPAct 2005.
 
In 2007, FERC issued rules requiring that any market participant, including a producer such as Carbon, Carbon Appalachia or Carbon California, that engages in physical sales for resale or purchases for resale of natural gas that equal or exceed 2.2 million MMBtus during a calendar year, must annually report such sales or purchases to FERC, beginning on May 1, 2009. These rules are intended to increase the transparency of the wholesale natural gas markets and to assist FERC in monitoring such markets and in detecting market manipulation. In 2008, FERC issued its order on rehearing, which largely approved the existing rules, except FERC exempted from the reporting requirement certain types of purchases and sales, including purchases and sales of unprocessed natural gas and bundled sales of natural gas made pursuant to state regulated retail tariffs. In addition, FERC clarified that other end use purchases and sales are not exempt from the reporting requirements. The monitoring and reporting required by the rules have increased our administrative costs. We do not anticipate we will be affected any differently than other producers of natural gas.
 
Gathering service, which occurs on pipeline facilities located upstream of jurisdictional transmission services, is regulated by the states onshore and in state waters. Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by FERC as a natural gas company under the NGA. Although FERC has set forth a general test for determining whether facilities perform a nonjurisdictional gathering function or a jurisdictional transmission function, FERC’s determinations as to the classification of facilities are done on a case-by-case basis. To the extent that FERC issues an order that reclassifies certain non-jurisdictional gathering facilities as FERC-jurisdictional transportation facilities, and depending on the scope of that decision, the costs of getting gas to point of sale locations may increase. We believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish a pipeline’s status as a gatherer not subject to regulation as a natural gas company. However, the distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is the subject of ongoing litigation, so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities is subject to change based on future determinations by FERC, the courts or Congress. In addition, state regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various occupational safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory-take requirements. Although such regulation has not generally been affirmatively applied by state agencies, natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny in the future.
 
Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the oil and natural gas industry are regularly considered by Congress, the states, FERC and the courts. For instance, legislation has previously been introduced in Congress to amend the federal Safe Drinking Water Act to subject hydraulic fracturing operations-an important process used in the completion of our oil and natural gas wells-to regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act. If adopted, this legislation could establish an additional level of regulation, and impose additional cost, on our operations. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposal, or any additional new legislative or regulatory proposal, may become effective. No material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the federal government.
 
Our sales of oil and natural gas are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. Interstate transportation of oil and natural gas by pipelines is regulated by FERC pursuant to the Interstate Commerce Act, the NGA, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. Intrastate oil and natural gas pipeline transportation rates may also be subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. We do not believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will affect our operations in any way that is materially different that those of our competitors who are similarly situated.
 
Regulation of Pipeline Safety and Maintenance
 
The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) has established safety requirements pertaining to the design, installation, testing, construction, operation and maintenance of gas pipeline facilities, including requirements that pipeline operators develop a written qualification program for individuals performing covered tasks on pipeline facilities and implement pipeline integrity management programs. PHMSA has the statutory authority to impose civil penalties for pipeline safety violations up to a maximum of approximately $200,000 per day for each violation and approximately $2 million for a related series of violations. This maximum penalty authority established by statute will continue to be adjusted periodically to account for inflation.

The Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 (“PIPES 2016 Act”), extended PHMSA’s statutory mandate under prior legislation through 2019. In addition, the PIPES 2016 Act empowered PHMSA to address imminent hazards by imposing emergency restrictions, prohibitions and safety measures on owners and operators of gas or hazardous liquid pipeline facilities without prior notice or an opportunity for a hearing. Additionally, in April 2016, PHMSA proposed rules that would, if adopted, strengthen existing integrity management requirements, expand assessment and repair requirements to pipelines in areas with medium population densities and extend regulatory requirements to onshore gas gathering lines that are currently exempt. The issuance of a final rule is uncertain at this time. The extension of regulatory requirements to our gathering pipelines would impose additional obligations on us and could add material costs to our and their operations. States are largely preempted by federal law from regulating pipeline safety for interstate lines but most states are certified by the U.S. Department of Transportation to assume responsibility for enforcing federal intrastate pipeline regulations and inspection of intrastate pipelines. In practice, because states can adopt stricter standards for intrastate pipelines than those imposed by the federal government for interstate lines, states vary considerably in their authority and capacity to address pipeline safety. However, we do not expect that any such costs would be material to our financial condition or results of operations. The adoption of new or amended regulations by PHMSA or the states that result in more stringent or costly pipeline integrity management or safety standards could have a significant adverse effect on us and similarly situated midstream operators. We cannot predict what future action the DOT will take, but we do not believe that any regulatory changes will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they will affect our or their competitors.
 
We believe our operations are in substantial compliance with all existing federal, state and local pipeline safety laws and regulations.
 
Environmental
 
As an operator of oil and natural gas properties in the U.S., we are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection as well as the manner in which various substances, including wastes generated in connection with exploration, production, and transportation operations, are released into the environment. Compliance with these laws and regulations can affect the location or size of wells and facilities, prohibit or limit the extent to which exploration and development may be allowed, and require proper closure of wells and restoration of properties when production ceases. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil, or criminal penalties, imposition of remedial obligations, incurrence of capital or increased operating costs to comply with governmental standards, and even injunctions that limit or prohibit exploration and production activities or that constrain the disposal of substances generated by oil field operations.
 
The most significant of these environmental laws that may apply to our operations are as follows:
 

● | The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended (“CERCLA”) and comparable state statutes which impose liability on owners and operators of certain sites and on persons who dispose of or arrange for the disposal of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substances releases have occurred or are threatening to occur. Parties responsible for the release or threatened release of hazardous substances under CERCLA may by subject to joint and several liability for the cost of cleaning up those substances and for damages to natural resources; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) subjects owners and operators of facilities to strict, joint and several liability for containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from oil spills, including the government’s response costs. Spills subject to the OPA may result in varying civil and criminal penalties and liabilities; 


● | The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (“RCRA”), and comparable state statues which govern the treatment, storage and disposal of solid nonhazardous and hazardous waste and authorize the imposition of substantial fines and penalties for noncompliance; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
16

 


● | The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, also known as the Clean Water Act (“CWA”), and analogous state laws that govern the discharge of pollutants, including natural gas wastes, into federal and state waters, including spills and leaks of hydrocarbons and produced water. These controls have become more stringent over the years, and it is possible that additional restrictions will be imposed in the future. Permits are required to discharge pollutants into certain state and federal waters and to conduct construction activities in those waters and wetlands. The CWA and comparable state statutes provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for any unauthorized discharges of oil and other pollutants and impose liability for the costs of removal or remediation of contamination resulting from such discharges; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”), which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells; and 
● | The Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and similar state and local requirements which govern the emission of pollutants into the air. Greenhouse gas record keeping and reporting requirements under the CAA took effect in 2011 and impose increased administrative and control costs. In recent years, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) issued final rules to subject oil and natural gas operations to regulation under the New Source Performance Standards, or NSPS, and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants, or NESHAPS, programs under the CAA, and to impose new and amended requirements under both programs. The EPA rules include NSPS standards for completions of hydraulically fractured oil and natural gas wells, compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks, natural gas processing plants and certain other equipment. In addition, the EPA finalized a more stringent National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”) for ozone in October 2015. This more stringent ozone NAAQS could result in additional areas being designated as non-attainment, which may result in an increase in costs for emission controls and requirements for additional monitoring and testing, as well as a more cumbersome permitting process. EPA anticipates promulgating final area designations under the new standard in the first half of 2018. 

 
Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal, cleanup or operating requirements could materially adversely affect our operations and financial condition, as well as those of the oil and natural gas industry in general. For instance, recent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as “greenhouse gases,” and including carbon dioxide and methane, may be contributing to the warming of the Earth’s atmosphere. Based on these findings, the EPA has begun adopting and implementing a comprehensive suite of regulations to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the CAA. Legislative and regulatory initiatives related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions could, and in all likelihood would, require us to incur increased operating costs adversely affecting our profits and could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we and they produce, depressing the prices we and they receive for oil and natural gas. See “The adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of “greenhouse gases” could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas we produce.”
 
We currently operate or lease, and have in the past operated or leased, a number of properties that have been subject to the exploration and production of oil and natural gas. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties operated or leased by us or on or under other locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal. In addition, these properties may have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes was not under our or their control. These properties and the wastes disposed thereon may be subject to laws and regulations imposing joint and several liability and strict liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct that could require us to remove previously disposed wastes or remediate property contamination, or to perform well or pit closure or other actions of a remedial nature to prevent future contamination.
 
Oil and natural gas deposits exist in shale and other formations. It is customary in our industry to recover oil and natural gas from these formations through the use of hydraulic fracturing, combined with horizontal drilling. Hydraulic fracturing is the process of injecting substances such as water, sand, and other additives under pressure into subsurface formations to create or expand fractures, thus creating a passageway for the release of oil and natural gas.
 
Most of our Appalachian Basin oil and natural gas reserves are subject to or have been subjected to hydraulic fracturing and we expect to continue to employ hydraulic fracturing extensively in future wells that we drill and complete. The reservoir rock in these areas, in general, has insufficient permeability to flow enough oil or natural gas to be economically viable without stimulation. The controlling regulatory agencies for well construction have standards that are designed specifically in anticipation of hydraulic fracturing. The cost of the stimulation process varies according to well location and reservoir.
 
We contract with established service companies to conduct our hydraulic fracturing. The personnel of these service companies are trained to handle potentially hazardous materials and possess emergency protocols and equipment to deal with potential spills and carry Safety Data Sheets for all chemicals. We require these service companies to carry insurance covering incidents that could occur in connection with their activities. In addition, these service companies are responsible for obtaining any regulatory permits necessary for them to perform their service in the relevant geographic location. We have not had any incidents, citations or lawsuits resulting from hydraulic fracture stimulation and we are not presently aware of any such matters.

In the well completion and production process, an accidental release could result in possible environmental damage. All wells have manifolds with escape lines to containment areas. High pressure valves for flow control are on the wellhead. Valves and piping are designed for higher pressures than are typically encountered. Piping is tested prior to any procedure and regular safety inspections and incident drill records are kept on those tests.
 
All fracturing is designed with the minimum water requirements necessary since there is a cost of accumulating, storing and disposing of the water recovered from fracturing. Water is drawn from nearby streams that are tributaries to the Ohio River and flow 365 days per year. Water recovered from the fracturing is injected into EPA or state approved underground injection wells. In some instances, the operation of underground injection wells has been alleged to cause earthquakes (induced seismicity) as a result of flawed well design or operation. This has resulted in stricter regulatory requirements in some jurisdictions relating to the location and operation of underground injection wells. In addition, the California Division of Oil, Gas & Geothermal Resources (“DOGGR”) adopted regulations intended to bring California’s Class II Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) program into compliance with the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, under which some wells may require an aquifer exemption. DOGGR reviewed all active UIC projects, regardless of whether an exemption is required. DOGGR is in the process of obtaining aquifer exemptions for UIC wells identified as requiring an aquifer exemption. In addition, DOGGR has undertaken a comprehensive examination of existing regulations and is in the process of issuing additional regulations with respect to certain oil and gas activities, such as management of idle wells, pipelines, underground fluid injection and well construction. The potential adoption of federal, state and local legislation and regulations in the areas in which we operate could restrict our or their ability to dispose of produced water gathered from drilling and production activities, which could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.
 
While hydraulic fracturing historically has been regulated by state and natural gas commissions, the practice has become increasingly controversial in certain parts of the country, resulting in increased scrutiny and regulation from federal agencies. The EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the federal SDWA over hydraulic fracturing involving fluids that contain diesel fuel and published permitting guidance in February 2014 for hydraulic fracturing operations that use diesel fuel in fracturing fluids in those states in which EPA is the permitting authority. In recent years, the EPA has issued final regulations under the federal CAA establishing performance standards for completions of hydraulically fractured oil and natural gas wells, compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks, natural gas processing plants and certain other equipment, and also finalized rules in June 2016 that prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. Many producing states, cities and counties have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. In addition, separate and apart from the referenced potential connection between injection wells and seismicity, concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing activities may be correlated to induced seismicity. The scientific community and regulatory agencies at all levels are studying the possible linkage between oil and gas activity and induced seismicity, and some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations or guidance to mitigate potential causes of induced seismicity. If legislation or regulations are adopted at the federal, state or local level imposing any restrictions on the use of hydraulic fracturing, this could have a significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additional burdens upon hydraulic fracturing, such as reporting or permitting requirements, will result in additional expense and delay in our operations. Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we are ultimately able to produce from our or their reserves. See “Environmental legislation and regulatory initiatives, including those relating to hydraulic fracturing and underground injection could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.”
 
Any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows and could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform hydraulic fracturing.
 
We are subject to the requirements of OSHA and comparable state statutes. The OSHA Hazard Communication Standard, the “community right-to-know” regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act and similar state statutes require us to organize information about hazardous materials used, released or produced in our operations. Certain of this information must be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and local citizens. We are also subject to the requirements and reporting set forth in OSHA workplace standards.
 
We believe that it is reasonably likely that the trend in environmental legislation and regulation will continue toward stricter standards. While we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations in effect at the present time and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on us, we cannot give any assurance that we will not be adversely affected in the future. We have established internal guidelines to be followed in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. Although we maintain pollution insurance against the costs of cleanup operations, public liability, and physical damage, there is no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to cover all such costs or that such insurance will continue to be available in the future.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, our workforce (including those employed by our subsidiaries Nytis LLC and CCOC) consisted of 222 employees, all of which are full-time employees. None of the members of our workforce are represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe we have a good relationship with the members of our workforce.
Offices
 
Our executive offices are located at 1700 Broadway, Suite 1170, Denver, Colorado 80290. We maintain an office in Lexington, Kentucky and Santa Paula, California from which we conduct our oil and gas operations.
Title to Properties
 
Title to our oil and gas properties is subject to royalty, overriding royalty, carried, net profits, working, and similar interests customary in the oil and gas industry. Under the terms of our bank credit facility, we have granted our lenders a lien on a substantial majority of our properties. In addition, our properties may also be subject to liens incident to operating agreements, as well as other customary encumbrances, easements, and restrictions, and for current taxes not yet due. Our general practice is to conduct title examinations on material property acquisitions. Prior to the commencement of drilling operations, a title examination and, if necessary, curative work is performed. The methods of title examination that we have adopted are reasonable in the opinion of management and are designed to ensure that production from our properties, if obtained, will be salable by us.

Proved reserves means quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. Existing economic conditions include prices that are the average price during the twelve-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.
 
20

 

Proved undeveloped reserves means estimated proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recovery to occur.
 
Reservoir means a porous and permeable underground formation containing a natural accumulation of producible natural gas and/or oil that is confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is individual and separate from other reservoirs.
 
Royalty means an interest in an oil or natural gas lease that gives the owner of the interest the right to receive a portion of the production from the leased acreage (or of the proceeds of the sale thereof), but generally does not require the owner to pay any portion of the costs of drilling or operating the wells on the leased acreage. Royalties may be either landowner’s royalties, which are reserved by the owner of the leased acreage at the time the lease is granted, or overriding royalties, which are usually reserved by an owner of the leasehold in connection with a transfer to a subsequent owner.
 
Standardized measure of present value of estimated future net revenues means an estimate of the present value of the estimated future net revenues from proved oil or natural gas reserves at a date indicated after deducting estimated production and ad valorem taxes, future capital costs, operating expenses and income taxes computed by applying year end statutory tax rates, with consideration of future tax rates already legislated. The estimated future net revenues are discounted at an annual rate of 10%, in accordance with the SEC’s practice, to determine their “present value.” The present value is shown to indicate the effect of time on the value of the revenue stream and should not be construed as being the fair market value of the properties. Estimates of future net revenues are made using oil and natural gas prices and operating costs at the estimation date and held constant for the life of the reserves.
 
Undeveloped acreage means acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of economic quantities of oil or natural gas, regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves.
 
Working interest means an operating interest which gives the owner the right to drill, produce, and conduct operating activities on the property, and to receive a share of production.
