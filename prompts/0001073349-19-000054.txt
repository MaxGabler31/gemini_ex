Our Products and Services 
Following is a summary of our major product offerings, however we continue to innovate and adapt our solutions as standards, customer needs and technology evolves.
Settlement Network Solutions
Paymode-X is an integrated payment solution allowing businesses to easily transition from manual accounts payable payments processes to an overall integrated solution, maximizing cost-savings, efficiency and security. With more than 400,000 member businesses, Paymode-X customers gain immediate benefits because many of their vendors are already part of the Paymode-X network and can begin to be paid electronically on day one. Our vendor enrollment process leverages our proprietary Intelligent Engagement Model which includes predictive analytics and proprietary processes and tools designed to maximize vendor adoption. Our solution leverages known payment type preferences across member businesses in order for customers to settle vendor payments utilizing a mix of card, automated clearing house (ACH), check and wire payments that will yield the greatest financial and efficiency gains. We continually incorporate innovative technologies and features into Paymode-X to make it easier for network members to implement, use and realize value quickly. Examples include the addition of electronic invoicing functionality, robust security features, the inclusion of an application programming interface library, the availability of multiple enterprise resource planning (ERP)-specific connectors that streamline system integration for customers, the incorporation of machine learning and predictive analytics, and the incorporation of voice technology and biometrics into our mobile app. A number of leading financial institutions partner with us to resell Paymode-X capabilities to their corporate clients. We have commercial relationships with both Visa and Mastercard and are able to offer both options to financial institutions as part of an overall Paymode-X solution.
Our financial messaging solutions leverage multiple payment networks and schemes, including SWIFT global messaging, Faster Payments, Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), BACS and others to allow banks and corporations to exchange financial information, including payment instructions, cash reporting and other messages to facilitate transaction settlement with banks and counterparties around the world. Our financial messaging solutions allow banks and corporations to achieve lower costs, rapid implementation, greater security and improved risk management, while avoiding costly internal infrastructure.
Banking Solutions
Our Digital Banking Intelligent Engagement platform (Digital Banking IQ) empowers banks to intelligently engage with customers, deliver a unified experience and acquire, deepen and grow profitable relationships. Digital Banking IQ combines a 360-degree view of all customer relationships, including the performance and volume of all customer products and services across all channels, which targeted actionable insights powered by machine learning.
We enable banks of all sizes to offer their customers a host of capabilities including ACH and BACS payments, wires, international payments, check production, fraud prevention, customer acquisition, balance and information reporting and other features that facilitate enterprise-wide cash management and interaction with their customers. Digital Banking IQ allows our bank customers to attract and service a full range of client segments from small businesses to multi-nationals. These solutions feature an intuitive user interface designed to simplify all aspects of payments and cash management for customers of all sizes and sophistication, through both browser-based and mobile channels.
Legal Spend Management
Our legal spend management solutions and services integrate with claims management and time and billing systems to automate legal invoice management processes and to provide insight into all areas of a company’s outside legal spend. The combination of automated invoice routing and a sophisticated rules engine allows corporate legal and insurance claims departments to create more efficient processes for managing invoices generated by outside law firms and other service providers, while offering insight into important legal spend factors including expense monitoring and outside counsel performance. We continue to expand the capabilities of these offerings to leverage predictive analytics to facilitate the selection and retention of counsel, forecast claim settlement and litigation expense and augment the management and budgeting of litigation matters.
Cyber Fraud and Risk Management
Our cyber fraud and risk management solutions (CFRM) non-invasively monitor, replay and analyze user behavior and payment transactions to flag and even stop suspicious activity in real time. These solutions are highly configurable and create accountability by recording and analyzing each application interaction and screen view, reducing the risk of theft, information leakage, internal fraud and payments fraud, as well as decreasing the cost of regulatory compliance. Case management capabilities centralize risk management, speed investigations, and facilitate compliance with regulations pertaining to Anti Money Laundering (AML), 
SWIFT CSP, PSD2, FATF16/WTR2, Basel II, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Know Your Customer (KYC).
Payment and Document Automation
Our payment automation solutions generate a wide variety of domestic and international payment instructions along with consolidated bank reporting of cash activity. Our web fraud and security module is designed to identify and track fraudulent activity that occurs in a customer’s platform. Our solutions reduce administrative expenses and strengthen compliance and anti-fraud controls. Users are able to gather and access data via the web related to payment and bank account information, including account totals and detailed transaction data, providing improved workflow, financial reporting and bank communications.
Our PTX payments and collections solutions suite offers organizations of any size simple, secure and efficient ways to pay and get paid. The solution can enable businesses to efficiently manage key business processes such as payments, accounts payable and accounts receivable. PTX is designed to incorporate regulatory changes such as the UK New Payments Architecture as well as innovation happening in the payments space such as Open Banking, leveraging these changes to facilitate consolidated views of bank accounts across the world. With new ways to pay including payment initiation service provider and request to pay, PTX is enabling companies to establish new payment relationships with customers.
To augment financial document workflow and delivery, we also offer a number of solutions designed to automate a wide variety of business documents and supply chain processes as well as a related web-based delivery and document archive. Our products offer advanced design, output formatting and delivery capabilities to replace paper-based forms, as well as automating the labor-intensive accounts payable processing of invoices.
Healthcare Solutions
In addition to our payments offerings referred to above, we offer several solutions specifically for healthcare to address patient registration, electronic signature, mobile document, payments and cybersecurity. Our solutions are utilized across the acute care hospital enterprise and broader healthcare systems, accelerating the paper-to-electronic transition while helping our customers streamline data flows and better protect themselves and their patient's data.
Professional Services
Our teams of service professionals draw on extensive payments experience to provide consulting, project implementation and training services. By easing the adoption of our products, these services help our customers accelerate the time to value. By improving the overall customer experience, these services help us retain customers and drive future revenue-generating arrangements from existing customers.

Our Competition 
The markets in which we participate are highly competitive. We believe our ability to compete depends on factors within and beyond our control, including:

• | our ability to develop new, innovative and feature-rich technology solutions that meet the evolving needs of our customers and the shifting dynamics of the markets we participate in;


• | our ability to attract and retain employees with the requisite domain knowledge and technical skill set necessary to develop and support our products;

Risk Factors.
Our Segments
Operating segments are the components of our business for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer. Our operating segments are generally organized by the type of product or service offered and by geography.
Similar operating segments have been aggregated into four reportable segments as follows: 
Cloud Solutions. Our Cloud Solutions segment provides customers with SaaS technology offerings that facilitate electronic payment, electronic invoicing, and spend management. Our legal spend management solutions, which enable customers to create more efficient processes for managing invoices generated by outside law firms while offering insight into important legal spend factors such as expense monitoring and outside counsel performance, are included within this segment. This segment also incorporates our settlement network solutions (financial messaging and Paymode-X). Our settlement network solutions are highly scalable, secure and cost effective and facilitate cash payment and transaction settlement between businesses, their vendors and banks. Revenue within this segment is generally recognized on a subscription or transaction basis or ratably over the contract term.
Banking Solutions. Our Banking Solutions segment provides solutions that are specifically designed for banking and financial institution customers. Our Banking Solutions products are sold predominantly on a hosted basis, with revenue recorded over time. This has the effect of contributing to recurring revenue and the revenue predictability of future periods, but results in revenue recognition over a longer period than a traditional on-premise software license transaction.
Payments and Transactional Documents. Our Payments and Transactional Documents segment supplies financial business process management software solutions, including making and collecting payments, sending and receiving invoices, and generating and storing business documents. This segment also provides a range of standard professional services and equipment and supplies that complement and enhance our core software products. When licensed for on-premise deployment, software license revenue is typically recorded upon delivery of the software and commencement of the license term. In hosted arrangements, we typically record revenue over time. Professional services revenue is normally recorded as we perform the work and software support and maintenance revenue is recorded ratably over the support period.
Other. Our Other segment consists of our healthcare and cyber fraud and risk management solutions. Our cyber fraud and risk management solutions non-invasively monitor, replay and analyze user behavior to flag and even stop suspicious activity in real time. Our healthcare solutions for patient registration, electronic signature, mobile document and payments allow healthcare organizations to improve business efficiencies, reduce costs and improve care quality. Software revenue for perpetual licenses of our cyber fraud and risk management and healthcare products is typically recorded upon delivery of the software and commencement of the license term. Professional services revenue is recorded as we perform the work and software support and maintenance revenue is recorded ratably over the support period which is normally twelve months.
Sales and Marketing 
As of June 30, 2019, we employed 411 sales and marketing employees worldwide, of whom 240 were focused on North American markets, 143 were focused on the United Kingdom and continental Europe markets and 28 were focused on Asia-Pacific and Middle East markets. We market and sell our products directly through our sales force and indirectly through a variety of channel partners and reseller relationships. We market and sell our products domestically and internationally, with an international focus on the United Kingdom and continental Europe. 
Product Development and Engineering
Our product development and engineering organization includes employees as well as strategic development partners who provide a flexible supplement to our internal resources. We have three primary development groups: product design and user experience, software engineering and quality assurance. Our teams work collaboratively, integrating design thinking approaches with development operations and scaled agile practices, to deliver validated solutions to our customers. We expensed $67.4 million, $57.5 million and $53.1 million in product development and engineering costs in fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In fiscal year 2020 we expect product development and engineering costs to increase as we continue to enhance our products and develop new, innovative, feature-rich solutions.
Our product design and user experience team is extensively involved in the design of all of our products, driving the user-centered design process to ensure elegant, engaging and intuitive, easy-to-use products. Part of this process is user experience testing that is conducted to provide additional productivity gains for the end user.
Our software engineers have substantial experience in advanced software development techniques as well as extensive knowledge of the complex processes involved in business document workflow, cash management, payment and invoicing applications. They maintain extensive knowledge of software development trends and best practices, including management of iterative development cycles and lean UX approaches to obtain customer feedback as early as possible. Our technologies focus on providing business solutions utilizing industry standards, providing a path for extendibility and scalability of our products. The team focused on applying relevant technologies to uniquely make our customers more successful. Security, control and fraud prevention, as well as performance, data management and resource efficiencies are priorities in the solutions we develop and deploy.
Our quality assurance engineers have extensive knowledge of our products and expertise in software quality assurance techniques. The quality assurance team participates in all phases of our product development processes. Members of the quality assurance group make use of both manual and automated software testing techniques to ensure high-quality software is being delivered to our customers. The quality assurance group members participate in alpha and beta releases, testing of new product releases and performance and security testing for our products. Our process promotes an end-to-end design to delivery pipeline view that connects these critical product development and engineering functions to our product management, delivery, operations and support organizations so that all share a common vision of customer-focused success.
Proprietary Rights 
We use a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret laws to help establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology and products. During fiscal year 2019, we added 3 patents to our portfolio. In total, we currently hold 36 U.S. patents as well as 8 foreign equivalent patents in Europe, Israel and India. We expect to receive other patents and we have 19 applications pending before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The earliest year of expiration of any of our remaining patents is 2019.
We intend to continue to file patent applications as we identify patentable technology. There can be no assurance, however, that our existing patent applications, or others that we may file in the future, will issue or will be of sufficient scope and strength to provide meaningful protection to our technology or any commercial advantage to us, or that the issued patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, we rely upon a combination of copyright and trademark laws and non-disclosure and other intellectual property contractual arrangements to help protect our proprietary rights. Given the rapidly changing nature of the industry’s technology, the creative abilities of our development, marketing and service personnel may be as or more important to our competitive position as are the legal protections and rights afforded by patents. We enter into agreements with our employees and clients that seek to limit and protect our intellectual property and the distribution of proprietary information. However, there can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to deter misappropriation of proprietary information and we may not be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our proprietary rights.
Government Regulation 
Our U.S. chartered financial institution customers are federally regulated by either the Federal Reserve (FED), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the National Credit Union Association (NCUA) or the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Our non U.S. based financial institution customers are normally subject to a similar regulatory oversight within their respective country of domicile. We are subject to periodic examination by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) interagency in our capacity as a technical financial service provider, during which our operating practices are risk-assessed and compared against applicable laws and regulations. If as part of such an examination we were to receive a material unfavorable regulatory rating, our customers may be advised by their direct federal regulators to reassess their commercial relationships with us, including the continued use of our products.
Each of our operating segments provides services and/or products that may be subject to various federal, state or foreign laws or regulations, particularly in the area of data security and privacy. These laws and regulations govern the collection, processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal information as well as notification requirements in the event of security breaches. We are subject to periodic General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance examinations by the Information Commissioner Office (ICO) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in our capacity as a technical financial service provider processing and/or storing financial 
data within a European Union (EU) and/or European Economic Area (EEA) country. The legal and regulatory framework in these areas is complex and continually evolving, particularly with respect to data security, payment technology and payment methodologies. We may become subject to new or increased regulation in the future, and the cost of complying with current or future regulatory requirements could be significant. Our products and services must be designed to work effectively within this legal framework and the regulatory framework that our customers operate within.
Employees 
As of June 30, 2019, we had approximately 1,900 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we believe that employee relationships are good. Our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly-qualified technical and managerial personnel in a very competitive market.
