Organization within the last five years
 
On October 31, 2012, the Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada. Through fiscal year 2013, we were engaged in the production, packing and selling of flavored yogurts and have not generated any revenue; our independent auditors have issued an opinion about our ability to continue as a going concern in connection with our audited financial statements for the year ended November 30, 2017. Our accumulated deficit is $148,601 as of November 30, 2017. We currently have no revenue generating business and are focusing on finalizing the transaction with the Target Company.
 
The discussion below provides an overview of our operations, discusses our results of operations, our plan of operations and our liquidity and capital resources.
 
We are authorized to issue 75,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share. On November 19, 2012, we issued 3,000,000 shares of common stock to our sole officer and director on that date. Mr. Naeem purchased such 3,000,000 shares at a purchase price of $0.001 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $3,000.
 
On December 5, 2013, Mr. Nissim Barih (“Barih”) and several other unrelated persons (each a “Buyer” and collectively, the “Buyers”), closed on a transaction (the “Purchase”) in which the Buyers acquired a total of 3,000,000 shares (the “Shares”) of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”) of Sipup from Rashid Naeem, the Company’s sole director and officer (“Naeem”) immediately prior to the Purchase. The Purchase was consummated pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement by and among the Buyers and Naeem. The aggregate purchase price paid for the Shares was $131,000. The Shares represented in the aggregate 75% of all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s Common Stock. Barih, one of the Buyers, holds 2,475,000 of the Shares, representing approximately 61% of all of our issued and outstanding Common Stock. The funds used to consummate the Purchase of the Shares were the personal funds of each participating Buyer. Accordingly, the purchase of the Shares resulted in a change in control of the Company.
 
In connection with the above transaction, Naeem resigned from all officers’ positions that he held in the Company, including President, Chief Executive Officer, Secretary and Treasurer, which resignation became effective immediately upon the closing of the Purchase.  Contemporaneously with closing of the Purchase, Jacob Daddon was appointed as our President and Chief Executive Officer and our sole director. Effective July 1 2014, Messrs Rafi Elul and Peretz Winkler were appointed director and chief executive officer and director, respectively, whereupon Mr. Daddon resigned. Thereafter, Effective March 17, 2015, Mr. Elul resigned and effective December 21, 2015, Mr. Baruch Yadid was appointed as a director, Mr. Yochai Ozeri was appointed as Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and as a director and Mr. Natanael Solomon was appointed VP Marketing and Investor Relations and as a director.
 
During December 2016, the Company and Rosario Capital Ltd. (“Rosario”) having their principal places of business at Tel Aviv, Israel have entered into service agreement, pursuant to which. Rosario is providing to the Company certain critical advisory and other services. In consideration of any and all Rosario's Services, the Company has issued to Rosario 500,000 restricted shares of common stock.
 
General

From inception until the date of this filing we have had limited operating activities.

Insurance
 
We do not maintain any insurance. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party of a legal action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations.
Employees
 
As of February 19, 2019, we have two employees, all of whom are officers. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
 
Offices
 
The Company’s principal offices are located at 30 Wall St. 8th floor, New York, NY 10005. Our telephone number is 212-634-4360.
 
Government Regulation
 
We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities in the future. As of now there are no required governments approvals present that we need approval from or any existing government regulation on our business.
 
We currently have not obtained any copyrights, patents or trademarks. We do not anticipate filing any copyright or trademark applications related to any assets over the next 12 months.
 
Plan of Operation
 
Our cash balance is $Nil as of November 30, 2017. We do not believe that our cash balance is sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations beyond one year’s time.
 
Our independent registered public accountant has issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we complete our initial business development. There is no assurance we will ever reach that stage.
 
We anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations, if any, will be insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months. We will require additional funds prior to such time and the Company will seek to obtain these funds by selling additional capital through private equity placements, debt or other sources of financing. If we are unable to obtain sufficient additional financing, we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned operations, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Additional funding to meet our requirements may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.
 
At the present time, we have been able to raise additional cash by selling of common stock, it will likely not be sufficient to support our planned operations. If we are unable to raise the cash needed to support our operations, we will either suspend product development and marketing activities until we do raise the cash, or cease operations entirely
 
We are currently in negotiations with several entities to enter into the technology business. No assurance can be provided that the Company will be successful in such endeavor.
 
Subject to raising working capital, for which we have no commitments, management may also consider other business opportunities, including a strategic merger or acquisition outside our current line of business, in order to increase shareholder value.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
 
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
 
Limited operating history; Need for additional capital
 
There is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in start-up stage operations and have not generated any revenues. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products.
 
We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders.
