Item 1. BUSINESS.
​
GENERAL
​
CUBIC CORPORATION (Cubic) is a technology-driven, market-leading global provider of innovative, mission-critical solutions that reduce congestion and increase operational readiness and effectiveness through increased situational understanding. Cubic designs, integrates and operates systems, products and services focused in the transportation, command, control, communication, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR), and training markets. We offer integrated payment and information systems, expeditionary communications, cloud-based computing and intelligence delivery, as well as state-of-the-art training and readiness solutions. We believe that we have significant transportation and defense industry expertise which, combined with our innovative technology capabilities, contributes to our leading market positions and allows us to deepen and further expand each of our business segments in key markets. Headquartered in San Diego, California, we had approximately 6,200 employees working on 4 continents and in 19 countries as of September 30, 2019. 
​
We operate in three reportable business segments: Cubic Transportation Systems (CTS), Cubic Mission Solutions (CMS), and Cubic Global Defense Systems (CGD). All of our business segments share a common mission of increasing situational awareness to create enhanced value for our customers worldwide through common technologies. Our transportation customers benefit from enhanced efficiency and reduced congestion, while our defense customers benefit from increased readiness and mission effectiveness. 
​
CTS provided 57% of our sales in fiscal year 2019. CTS specializes in the design, development, production, installation, maintenance and operation of automated fare payment, traffic management and enforcement solutions, real-time information systems, and revenue management infrastructure and technologies for transportation agencies. As part of our turnkey solutions, CTS also provides these customers with a comprehensive suite of business process outsourcing (BPO) services and expertise, such as card and payment media management, central systems and application support, retail network management, customer call centers and financial clearing and settlement support. As transportation authorities seek to optimize their operations by outsourcing bundled systems and services, CTS has transformed itself from a provider of automated fare collection (AFC) systems into a systems integrator and services company focused on the intelligent transportation market. 
​
CMS provided 22% of our sales in fiscal year 2019. CMS provides networked C4ISR capabilities for defense, intelligence, security and commercial missions. CMS’ core competencies include protected wide-band communications for space, aircraft, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), and terrestrial applications. It provides Rugged Internet of Things (IoT) cloud solutions, interoperability gateways, and artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) based Command and Control, intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) applications for video situational understanding. CMS is also building UAV systems to provide intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) -as-a-service.
​
CGD provided 21% of our sales in fiscal year 2019. CGD is a leading diversified supplier of live, virtual, constructive and game-based training solutions to the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), other U.S. government agencies and allied nations. We offer a full range of training solutions for military and security forces. Our customized systems and services accelerate combat readiness in the air, on the ground and at sea while meeting the demands of evolving operations globally.
 ​
We have a broad customer base across our businesses, with approximately 63% of our fiscal year 2019 sales generated from U.S. federal, state and local governments. Approximately 2% of these sales were attributable to Foreign Military Sales, which are sales to allied foreign governments facilitated by the U.S. government. The remainder of our fiscal year 2019 sales were attributable to sales to foreign government and foreign municipal agencies. Sales to countries outside the U.S. amounted to 43%, 54% and 2% of the total sales of CTS, CGD and CMS, respectively, for fiscal year 2019. In fiscal year 2019, 68% of our total sales were derived from products, with services sales accounting for the remaining 32%.

In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely evaluate and selectively pursue acquisition opportunities that will expand or complement our existing products and services, or customer base, at attractive valuations. From fiscal 2015 through 2019 we acquired GATR, DTECH, TeraLogics, Vocality, MotionDSP, Shield Aviation, and Nuvotronics in connection with our strategic efforts to build and expand our C4ISR business. These businesses collectively provide wideband ultra-portable expeditionary satellite communication terminal solutions, secure video delivery, real time processing and enhancement, exploitation and dissemination of full motion video in the cloud, computer vision analytics, deployable secure computing tactical cloud and networking solutions equipment, and communication gateways. In 2017 we acquired Deltenna, a wireless infrastructure company that designs and manufactures cutting-edge integrated wireless products and enhances our tactical communication and training capabilities. In 2019 we acquired Trafficware and GRIDSMART in our CTS segment which, when combined with our existing transportation capabilities, enhance our ability to offer compelling solutions to reduce urban congestion using their intelligent, data-rich intersection management technology. Generally, our business acquisitions are dilutive to earnings in the short-term due to acquisition-related costs, integration costs, retention payments and often higher amortization of purchased intangibles in the early periods after acquisition and expenses related to earn-outs. However, we expect that each of these recent acquisitions will be accretive to earnings in the mid-term.
​
We are operating in an environment that is characterized by continuing economic pressures in the U.S. and globally. A significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on innovative solutions, program execution, improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our products and services, and providing opportunities for customers to outsource services where we can provide a more effective solution. To the extent our business and contracts include operations in countries outside the U.S., other risks are introduced into our business, including changing economic conditions, fluctuations in relative currency rates, regulation by foreign countries, and the potential for deterioration of political relations.

​
Cubic Transportation Systems Segment
​
CTS is a systems integrator of payment and information technology and services for intelligent travel solutions. We deliver integrated systems for transportation and traffic management, delivering tools for travelers to choose the smartest and easiest way to travel and pay for their journeys, and enabling transportation authorities and agencies to manage demand across the entire transportation network — all in real time. We offer fare collection and revenue management devices, software, systems and multiagency, multimodal integration technologies, as well as a full suite of operational services that help agencies and operators efficiently collect fares and revenue, manage operations, reduce revenue leakage and make transportation more convenient. Our NextBus business provides transit passengers with accurate, real-time predictive arrival information about buses, subways and trains, and includes real-time management and dispatch tools that enable transit operators to effectively manage their systems. Our Intelligent Transport Management Solutions (ITMS) business has a portfolio of information-based solutions for transportation agency customers and provides traffic management systems technology, traffic and road enforcement and the maintenance of traffic signals, emergency equipment and other critical road and tunnel infrastructure. Our Trafficware and GRIDSMART businesses provide a 

4



combination of hardware, software and sensor technology to optimize the flow of people and vehicles through intersections, corridors and urban grids. Through our Urban Insights business, we use big data and predictive analytics technology and a consulting model to help the transportation industry improve operations, reduce costs and better serve travelers.
​
CTS is comprised of approximately 3,100 employees working in major transportation markets worldwide. As an established partner with transportation authorities and operators, we have installed systems in over 40 markets and currently serve over 41 million users a day, which in total process approximately 14 billion revenue-related transactions per year, generating more than $16 billion of revenue per year for such transportation authorities and operators. Products accounted for 58% of the segment’s fiscal year 2019 sales, with services accounting for 42%.
​
We believe that we hold the leading market position in large-scale automated fare payment and revenue management systems and services for major metropolitan areas. We have implemented and, in many cases, operate, automated fare payment and revenue management systems for some of the world’s largest transportation systems, examples include London (Oyster/Contactless Payment), the New York region (Metrocard/OMNY), the Chicago region (Ventra), the San Francisco Bay Area (Clipper), the Los Angeles region (TAP), the Washington D.C. region (Smartrip), the Vancouver region (Compass), the Sydney region (Opal Card) and the Brisbane region (Go Card). In fiscal 2018, we were awarded: a contract by the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to replace the MetroCard system with a New Fare Payment System (NFPS) and now branded as OMNY; a contract by the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority (MBTA) to provide the CharlieCard system with a next-generation fare payment system; a contract by the Queensland Department of Transportation & Main Roads to provide a next-generation ticketing system for the state of Queensland, Australia; and a contract by the San Francisco Bay Area’s Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) to deliver next-generation fare payment technology and operational services to the Clipper smart card system serving the Bay Area. The average lifecycle of our revenue management systems is approximately 10 years, providing long-term recurring sales visibility and opportunities for future replacements and upgrades. 
​
We are currently designing and building major new systems in New York, Boston, Brisbane, and the San Francisco Bay Area. Profit margins during the design and build phase of major projects can be slightly lower than during the operate-and-maintain phase. This has in the past caused, and may in the future cause, swings in profitability from period to period. Also, during the operate-and-maintain phase, revenues and costs are typically more predictable. 
​
Through our NextBus, ITMS, Trafficware and GRIDSMART businesses, we provide advanced transportation operational management capabilities and related services to hundreds of customers including organizations such as Transport for London, Transport Scotland, Highways England, Transport for Greater Manchester, Los Angeles Metro, San Francisco Muni and the Toronto Transit Commission. In August 2018, we were awarded an Intelligent Congestion Management Platform contract by Transport for New South Wales to provide Sydney, Australia with one of the world’s most advanced transport management systems. The new system will enhance monitoring and management of the road network across New South Wales, coordinate the public transport network across all modes, improve management of clearways, planning of major events and improve incident clearance times, while providing real-time information and advice to the public about disruptions.
​
We also provide a modern tolling and road user charging alternative that uses state-of-the-art tools that are flexible and modular compared to the proprietary, legacy systems that the industry views as their only option.
​
Most of our sales in CTS for fiscal year 2019 were from fixed-price contracts. However, some of our service contracts provide for variable payments, in addition to the fixed payments, based on meeting certain service level requirements and, in some cases, based on system usage. Service level requirements are generally contingent upon factors that are under our control, while system usage payments are contingent upon factors that are generally not under our control, other than basic system availability. For certain CTS contracts for which we develop a system for a customer and subsequently operate and maintain the customer’s system, the contract specifies that we will not be paid during system development, but rather we will be paid over the period that we operate and maintain the system.

Industry Overview
​
We define our addressable transportation market as multi-modal transportation revenue management systems (e.g. public transit fare collection, toll revenue collection, congestion charging), Real-Time Passenger Information and Intelligent Transportation Systems and services. We project the long-term growth for this market to be driven primarily by customer infrastructure expansion as well as technological refreshment and advancement which will lead to system replacements and upgrades. Together with additional opportunities that stem from our other businesses as well as entry into new geographies, we believe our overall addressable market to be in excess of $16 billion. We believe industry experience, past performance, technological innovation and price are the key factors customers consider in awarding programs and such factors can serve as barriers to entry to potential competitors when coupled with scale and the upfront investments required for these programs.
​
Advances in communications, networking and security technologies are enabling interoperability of multiple modes of transportation within a single networked system, as well as interoperability of multiple transportation operators within a single networked system. As such, there is a growing trend for regional payment systems, usually built around a large agency and including neighboring operators, all sharing a common regional payment media. Recent procurements for open payment systems will further extend the acceptance of payment media from smart cards, to contactless bank cards and Near Field Communication (NFC) enabled smartphones.
​
There is also an emerging trend for other applications to be added to these regional systems to expand the utility of the payment media and back-office system, offering higher value and incentives to the end users, and lowering costs and creating new revenue streams through the integration of multi-modal and multi-operator systems for the regional system operators. As a result, these regional systems have created opportunities for new levels of systems support and services including customer support call centers and web support services, smart card production and distribution, financial clearing and settlement, retail merchant network management, transit benefit support, and software application support. In some cases, operators are choosing to outsource the ongoing operations and commercialization of these regional payment systems. This growing new market provides the opportunity to establish lasting relationships and grow revenues and profits over the long term.
​
Some customers have responded to the current market environment by seeking financing for their projects from the system supplier or from other sources. An example of this is our contract with the MBTA, which was awarded in early 2018 to develop, build, operate, and maintain a next-generation fare payment system in Boston. Under this contract, the MBTA required that we and a financing partner, John Laing, establish a public-private partnership (P3) in order to finance the design and build phase of the payment system. MBTA does not begin making payments until the ten-year operate and maintain phase of the contract, which will span from 2021 through 2031. 
​
Backlog
​
Total backlog of CTS at September 30, 2019 and 2018 amounted to $2.953 billion and $3.545 billion, respectively. We expect that approximately $729 million of the September 30, 2019 backlog will be converted into sales by September 30, 2020.
​

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Industry Overview
​
We estimate that the Protected Communications, Ruggedized IoT and C2ISR markets within our CMS business have a total addressable market of approximately $3 billion annually. We believe that our products and technologies address mission critical requirements such as integrated communications suites for UAVs, ships and the dismounted soldier, battlefield awareness, and secure and encrypted communications. We believe that these technologies will continue to experience strong demand as the U.S. military maintains a smaller, more agile force structure.
​
Backlog
​
Funded and total backlog of CMS at September 30, 2019 was $104 million compared to $77 million at September 30, 2018. We expect that approximately $93 million of the September 30, 2019 backlog will be converted into sales by September 30, 2020.
​
Cubic Global Defense Segment
​
CGD is a market leader in live, virtual, constructive (LVC) and game-based training solutions to the DoD, other U.S. government agencies and allied nations. We design and manufacture realistic, high-fidelity air, ground, and surface instrumentation, visualization and data analytic systems that support LVC training in high fidelity environments. Our customized systems and services accelerate combat readiness in the air, on the ground and at sea while meeting the demands of evolving operations globally. 
​

Training systems provided by CGD include customized military range instrumentation systems, multi-domain LVC instrumentation, laser and non-laser based ground training systems, live-fire range design, virtual simulation systems, game-based synthetic training environments and advanced data visualization and analytics solutions. 
​
CGD’s training systems are used to effectively deliver a range of training objectives, such as training for fighter pilots, ground troops, infantry, armored vehicles, ship operation and maintenance personnel, cyber warriors, and special operations forces. These systems deliver high fidelity threat representative environments that are used to create stressful scenarios and weapons’ effects, collect event and tactical performance data, record simulated engagements and tactical actions, and deliver after actions reviews to evaluate individual and collective training effectiveness. 
​
CGD also provides software and services that take the data and information generated in instrumented training ranges and provides advanced data visualization and data analytics that allow for training, proficiency and readiness assessment.
​
Our products and systems help our customers to retain operational, tactical, and technological superiority with cost-effective solutions. We also provide ongoing support services for systems we have built for several of our international customers. Our training business portfolio is currently organized into air training, ground training, and synthetic/digital solutions. CGD is comprised of approximately 1,300 employees working in 13 nations on 4 continents providing training systems to the DoD and allied nations.
​
Our established international footprint in 35 allied nations is a key element of our strategy. Our global footprint helps to mitigate possible shifts or downturns in DoD spending. Sales to international customers of CGD accounted for 51% of sales in 2019. In addition, new innovative technologies such as LVC training systems and potential expansion into adjacent markets provides us the means to add scale to our business. Strategically, we believe CGD is very well positioned to lead the increasing trend to fully integrated solutions that connect LVC and game-based training in multi-domain environments.
​
Fixed-price contracts accounted for 92% of CGD’s revenue for fiscal year 2019. Fixed-price contracts create both the risk of cost growth and the opportunity to increase margins if we are able to reduce our costs. 
​
Air Training Solutions
​
In air training, Cubic was the initial developer and supplier of Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation (ACMI) capability during the Vietnam War. The ACMI product line has progressed through five generations of technologies and capabilities. The latest generation, the P5 Combat Training System, provides advanced air combat training capability to the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps, as well as allied nations which has solidified Cubic’s global market leading position. We have been awarded a series of contracts to produce and enhance ACMI for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. We have also developed a broad international base for our ACMI product, particularly in Asia Pacific and the Middle East. In addition to procuring the ACMI training system, many nations also rely on Cubic for on-site operations and maintenance support. We are constantly evolving our air combat training solutions to achieve full-spectrum LVC training systems. Cubic was the industry system integrator for the U.S. Air Force Research Lab’s Secure LVC Advanced Training Environment (SLATE) and Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD). SLATE ATD validated production ready LVC with National Security Agency certified multi-level encryption and a newly developed 5th generation advanced training waveform. The LVC system was verified operationally in both tethered and untethered LVC training scenarios. SLATE is a combination of protocols, standards, hardware and software that are joint, interoperable and supports advanced multi-domain warfighting concepts.
​
Ground Training Solutions
​
CGD is a leading provider of realistic, easy-to-use, high-fidelity, reliable, and cost-effective tactical engagement simulation systems that minimize user set-up time and increase training effectiveness. Our leadership role in instrumented training was established during the 1990s when Cubic provided turnkey systems for U.S. Army training centers including the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) at Fort Polk, Louisiana, and the Combat Maneuver Training Center (CMTC) at Hohenfels, Germany, now known as the Joint Multinational Readiness Center. Since the completion of these original contracts, we have significantly expanded our market footprint with the sale of fixed, mobile 

8



and urban operation training centers to uniformed military and security forces in the United States and allied nations around the world. Our ground combat training systems operate at over 90 combat training centers (CTCs) worldwide. Our laser-based tactical engagement simulation systems, widely known as Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement Systems (MILES), are used to enable realistic training without live ammunition. Cubic MILES are being utilized by multiple branches of the U.S. Armed Services, as well as the Department of Energy, and numerous international government customers. We have increased our focus on joint training solutions and those that can operate simultaneously in multiple simulation environments including live, virtual, constructive and gaming domains. The business continues to deliver innovative ground-based training solutions with the introduction of non-laser based solutions and synthetic overlay to live training environments
​
Synthetic/Digital Solutions
​
The Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) courseware contract win in 2013 has opened a large new market for CGD. A key discriminator in the LCS proposal was the use of a high-fidelity gaming engine that allows avatars to instruct students at their own pace in an immersive environment based on realistic graphics. By integrating instructional material into a gaming environment, we have dramatically reduced instructor costs and provided a platform that is ideal for embedded training. These technologies are easily transferrable to different training domains and subject matters. The experiential learning environment can be augmented with intelligent tutoring and assessment tools increasing the value of this approach. The acquisition of Intific in 2014 brought enhanced software, data visualization and data analytics capabilities that provide in depth training analysis for customers.
​
As the blend of LVC training creates broader higher fidelity training environments the data generated creates significant opportunity to capitalize on our advanced synthetic and digital capabilities to deliver greater insight into customer training effectiveness.
​
Industry Overview
​
CGD’s market is relatively large and stable. According to the 2018 Global Military Simulation and Virtual Training Market report, the value of the global military simulation and virtual training programs market was $10.2 billion in 2018.  
​
Backlog
​
Funded and total backlog of CGD at September 30, 2019 was $344 million compared to $443 million at September 30, 2018. We expect that approximately $183 million of the September 30, 2019 backlog will be converted into sales by September 30, 2020.
​
Additional Defense Industry Considerations
​
The U.S. government continues to focus on discretionary spending, tax, and other initiatives to control spending, debt and the deficit. More than 40 years since the Budget Act created the existing budget framework. Congress has rarely followed the required process and deadlines. Regular order has not been fully followed since fiscal year 1995—the last time Congress passed a budget conference agreement followed by all 12 appropriations bills before the beginning of the new fiscal year. The trend over the past decades has been reliance on continuing resolutions. 
​
Since 2011, we’ve experienced a constrained fiscal environment imposed by the Budget Control Act (BCA) and various ensuing Bipartisan Budget Acts (BBA). Budgetary considerations have put downward pressure on growth in the defense industry from 2011-2017 but under the BBA of 2018, defense budgets in 2018 and 2019 have shown substantial increases from previous years. 
​
In 2019, we were encouraged by the President’s proposed near-record defense spending of $750 billion for fiscal year 2020 and the U.S. Congress’ passage of a new BBA 2019 covering fiscal years 2020 and 2021 officially ending the threat of sequestration under the BCA. Unfortunately, even with the passage of BBA 2019, funding uncertainty endures as Congress has once again failed to pass all 12 appropriations bills for fiscal year 2020 and has relied on a continuing 

9



resolution to temporarily fund the government and avoid a government shutdown.  Nonetheless, beyond 2021, the President’s administration and Congress will likely continue to debate the size and expected growth of the U.S. federal budget as well as the defense budget over the next few years and balance decisions regarding defense, homeland security, and other federal spending priorities. If enacted, significant reductions in defense spending levels could have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. Regardless of the political outcomes and budgetary constraints, we believe that much of our business is well positioned in the DoD’s areas of focus for defense spending designed to help the DoD meet its critical future capability requirements for protecting U.S. security and the security of our allies in the years to come.
​
Regarding international markets, an important revenue source, global defense expenditures were again on the rise in 2018 reaching their highest level since the end of the Cold War at approximately $1.67 trillion in 2018. Defense spending increased by approximately 3.3% in 2018 - the fastest rate of growth in a decade - driven by the largest year-on-year increase in U.S. defense spending since 2008. The increase in defense spending reflects improved global economic conditions coupled with continuing instability in several key regions.
​
COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT
​
Our businesses operate in highly competitive markets. CTS is one of several companies specializing in the transportation systems and services market. Our competitors in various market segments include among others Accenture, Conduent, Econolite, IBM, Indra, Init, Intelight, Kapsch, Kimley-Horn, McCain, Flowbird, Roper Technologies, Scheidt & Bachmann, Siemens, Thales, Trapeze and Vix. For large tenders, our competitors may form consortiums that could include telecommunications companies, financial institutions and consulting companies in addition to the companies noted above. These procurement activities are very competitive and require that we have highly skilled and experienced technical personnel to compete. We believe that our competitive advantages include intermodal and interagency regional integration expertise, technical skills, innovation, past contract performance, systems quality and reliability, experience in the industry and long-term customer relationships.
​
CMS competes with numerous companies, large and small, including Boeing, General Dynamics, L3Harris, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman, as well as other smaller companies.

Pursue Strategic Acquisitions
​
We have developed an acquisition strategy that focuses our technology-driven, market-leading business strategy. We are focused on finding attractive acquisitions that enhance our market positions through technology, provide expansion into complementary growth markets and ensure sustainable long-term profitability and return on invested capital. Over the last several years, we have completed multiple acquisitions that have diversified our customer base and expanded our systems and services offerings. For example, from fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2019 we acquired GATR, DTECH, TeraLogics, Vocality, MotionDSP, Shield Aviation and Nuvotronics in connection with our strategic efforts to build and expand our C4ISR business. In fiscal 2019 we acquired GRIDSMART and Trafficware to complement our integrated traffic solutions business.
​
Enhance Services Business
​
We view services tied to our technologies as a core element of our business and we are working to expand our service offerings and customer base. In aggregate, approximately 32% of our sales in fiscal year 2019, were from service-related work. We believe that a strong base of service work helps to consistently generate profits and smooth the sales fluctuations inherent in systems work.
​
At CTS, we deliver a number of customer services from key service facilities for multiple transportation authorities worldwide. Due to the technical complexities of operating payment systems, transportation agencies are turning to their system suppliers for IT services and other operational and maintenance services, such as regional settlement, card management and customer support services that would otherwise be performed by the agencies. As a result, we have transitioned from a supplier to a systems integration and services company providing a suite of turnkey outsourced services for more than 20 transit authorities and cities worldwide. Today, CTS delivers a wide range of services from customer support to financial management and technical support at operation centers across the United States, Canada, United Kingdom and Australia.
​
At CGD, we primarily provide services for products for which we are the Original Equipment Manufacturer. Our services on OEM equipment drive value for our customers and allow us to earn higher margins. Compared to the U.S. market where small business requirements, omnibus contracts and local preferences create acquisition challenges, we believe the international market offers greater opportunities to bundle and negotiate multi-year, turnkey contracts. We believe these long-term contracts reinforce CGD’s competitive posture and enable us to provide enhanced services through regular customer contact and increased visibility of product performance and reliability.
​
Expand International Footprint
​
We have developed a large global presence in our business segments. CTS has delivered over 500 projects in 40 major markets on 4 continents to date. Approximately 43% of the CTS segment’s fiscal year 2019 sales were attributable to international customers. In fiscal 2018, CTS was selected by the Queensland Department of Transport & Main Roads (DTMR) in Australia to design, build and operate a new ticketing system for the state and signed a contract with 

13



Transport for New South Wales in Australia to build an Intelligent Congestion Management Platform. In 2017, CTS signed a contract with Transport for London (TfL) for a three-year extension of services to London’s Oyster and contactless ticketing system to extend the contract for these services from 2022 to 2025.
​
CGD has delivered systems in more than 35 allied nations. In fiscal year 2019, approximately 51% of CGD sales were to allied foreign governments and an additional 5% of CGD sales were to projects funded by the U.S. government pursuant to Foreign Military Sales and Foreign Military Financing arrangements. We have expanded our presence in the United Kingdom, Canada, and the Middle-East in response to growing opportunities. These complement a well-established and sound presence in Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, and Italy.
​
Our CMS products are designed to address the needs of numerous international defense and civil applications. Our ISR data links are used by a number of international allied forces. In early fiscal 2018, CMS was awarded an order to provide satellite communication solutions for the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) under which we are supplying inflatable satellite antennas with supporting hardware and equipment training for the NZDF Network Enabled Army program. In addition, in late fiscal 2018 Australia’s Ministry of Defense procured CMS Atlas Strike kits that provide communications capability and situational awareness for Australia’s Joint Tactical Air Controllers. In fiscal 2019, CMS was awarded a contract from the New Zealand Ministry of Defence to deliver Command and Control (C2) capabilities to support the Network Enabled Army (NEA) program's Tactical Network (TNet) project. The NEA program is a transformational program to be delivered in four tranches over 12 years and will benefit the New Zealand Army's Land Forces and Special Operations Forces. The TNet contract is a framework agreement allowing multiple awards over the life of the contract to address current, emerging and future requirements through support of the four tranches.

RAW MATERIALS
​
The principal raw materials used in our products include sheet aluminum and steel, copper electrical wire and castings, fabrics, purchased electronic subcomponents, cabling to include electrical wiring, connectors and harnesses, injection molded plastics, and composite products. A significant portion of our end products are composed of purchased electronic components and subcontracted parts and supplies that we procure from third-party suppliers. In general, supplies of raw materials and purchased parts are adequate to meet our requirements.
​
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
​
We seek to protect our proprietary technology and inventions through patents and other proprietary-right protection, and also rely on trademark laws to protect our brand. However, we do not regard ourselves as materially dependent on patents for the maintenance of our competitive position. We also rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation to remain competitive.

REGULATION
​
Our businesses must comply with and are affected by various government regulations that impact our operating costs, profit margins and our internal organization and operation of our businesses. We deal with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including all branches of the U.S. military and the DoD. Therefore, we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of U.S. government and other contracts. These laws and regulations, among other things, include the Federal Acquisition Regulations and all department and agency supplements, which comprehensively regulate the formation, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts. These and other federal regulations require certification and disclosure of cost or pricing data in connection with contract negotiations for certain types of contracts, define allowable and unallowable costs, govern reimbursement rights under cost-based contracts, and restrict the use, dissemination and exportation of products and information classified for national security purposes. For additional discussion of government contracting laws and regulations and related matters, see “Risk factors” and “Business—Industry Considerations” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments—Revenue Recognition” with respect to pricing and revenue under government contracts.
​
Our business is subject to a range of foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding environmental protection and employee health and safety, including those that govern the emission and discharge of hazardous or toxic materials into the environment and the generation, storage, treatment, handling, use, transportation and disposal of such materials. From time to time, we have been named as a potentially responsible party at third-party waste disposal sites. We do not currently expect compliance with such laws and regulations to have a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. However, such laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become increasingly stringent over time. Accordingly, we cannot assure that such laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our business in the future.
​
OTHER MATTERS
​
We do not generally engage in any business that is seasonal in nature. Since our revenues are generated primarily from work on contracts performed by our employees and subcontractors, first quarter revenues tend to be lower than the other three quarters due to our policy of providing many of our employees more holidays in the first quarter, compared to other quarters of the year. The U.S. government’s fiscal year ends on September 30 of each year. It is not uncommon for U.S. government agencies to award extra tasks or complete other contract actions in the weeks before the end of a fiscal year in order to avoid the loss of unexpended funds. These are not necessarily consistent patterns and depend upon actual activities in any given year. 
​
We employed approximately 6,200 persons at September 30, 2019.
​
Our domestic products and services are sold almost entirely by our employees. Overseas sales are made either directly or through representatives or agents.
