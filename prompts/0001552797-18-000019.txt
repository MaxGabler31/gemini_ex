ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
General 
Delek Logistics Partners, LP is a Delaware limited partnership formed in April 2012 by Old Delek (as defined below) and its subsidiary Delek Logistics GP, LLC, our general partner (our "general partner"). In November 2012, the Partnership completed its initial public offering (the "Offering"). 
In January 2017, Delek US Holdings, Inc. ("Old Delek") (and various related entities) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Alon USA Energy, Inc. (NYSE: ALJ) ("Alon USA"), as subsequently amended on February 27 and April 21, 2017 (as so amended, the "Merger Agreement"). The related merger (the "Delek/Alon Merger") was effective July 1, 2017 (the “Effective Time”), resulting in a new post-combination consolidated registrant renamed Delek US Holdings, Inc. (“New Delek”), with Alon USA and Old Delek surviving as wholly-owned subsidiaries. New Delek is the successor issuer to Old Delek and Alon USA pursuant to Rule 12g-3(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this report to "Delek" refer collectively to Old Delek with respect to periods prior to July 1, 2017, or New Delek, with respect to periods on or after July 1, 2017, and any of Old Delek's or New Delek's, as applicable, subsidiaries, other than the Partnership and its subsidiaries and its general partner. 
The Partnership's business primarily consists of certain crude oil, intermediate and refined products pipelines and transportation, storage, wholesale marketing, terminalling and offloading assets which were previously owned, operated or held by Delek and assets acquired from unrelated third parties. Irrespective of the party from whom we acquired our assets, Delek is our primary or sole customer for a substantial majority of our assets and is responsible, directly or indirectly, for the majority of our gross margin (as defined below). 
Overview
The Partnership primarily owns and operates logistics and marketing assets for crude oil and intermediate and refined products. We generate revenue and contribution margin, which we define as net sales less cost of goods sold and operating expenses, by charging fees for gathering, transporting, offloading and storing crude oil; for storing intermediate products and feed stocks; for distributing, transporting and storing refined products; and for wholesale marketing. A substantial majority of our existing assets are both integral to and dependent on the success of Delek's refining operations and most of our assets are contracted exclusively to Delek in support of Delek's refineries in Tyler, Texas (the "Tyler Refinery") and El Dorado, Arkansas (the "El Dorado Refinery"). See "—Commercial Agreements—Commercial Agreements with Delek" and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a discussion of our material commercial agreements with Delek. In addition to the services we provide to Delek, we also provide, and generate substantial revenue and contribution margin from, crude oil, intermediate and refined products transportation services for, and terminalling and marketing services to, third parties primarily in Texas, Tennessee and Arkansas. Certain of these services are provided pursuant to contractual agreements with such third parties. See "—Commercial Agreements—Other Agreements with Third Parties."
We are not a taxable entity for federal income tax purposes or the income taxes of those states that follow the federal income tax treatment of partnerships. Instead, for purposes of such income taxes, each partner of the Partnership is required to take into account 
 3

its share of items of income, gain, loss and deduction in computing its federal and state income tax liabilities, regardless of whether cash distributions are made to such partner by the Partnership. The taxable income reportable to each partner takes into account differences between the tax basis and the fair market value of our assets and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities, the acquisition price of the partner's units and the taxable income allocation requirements under the Partnership's First Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership (the "Partnership Agreement").
Recent Developments 
Big Spring Asset Dropdown. On February 26, 2018, a definitive agreement was entered into between the Partnership and Delek to acquire certain logistics assets primarily located adjacent to Delek's Big Spring, Texas refinery. In connection with the closing of the transaction, Delek, the Partnership and various of their subsidiaries expect to enter into a new wholesale and marketing agreement and amend certain existing contracts, such as new throughput and tankage agreement for the Big Spring Logistics Assets. See Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Formation of Green Plains Joint Venture. On February 20, 2018, the Partnership and Green Plains Partners LP ("Green Plains") announced the companies have formed DKGP Energy Terminals, LLC ("DKGP Energy"), a joint venture engaging in the light products terminalling business. The Partnership and Green Plains will each own a 50% membership interest in DKGP Energy. DKGP Energy signed a membership interest purchase agreement to acquire two light products terminals located in Caddo Mills, Texas and North Little Rock, Arkansas from an affiliate of American Midstream Partners, L.P. ("American Midstream"). Subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, this transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2018. DKGP Energy will consist of the assets purchased from the affiliate of American Midstream and assets contributed by the Partnership. Immediately prior to the closing of the acquisition by the joint venture of the two terminals from American Midstream, the Partnership will contribute to the joint venture its North Little Rock, Arkansas terminal and its Greenville tank farm located in Caddo Mills, Texas. The DKGP Energy board will oversee the newly formed joint venture and will appoint an affiliate of the Partnership as the operator with day-to-day operational responsibilities of the four terminals. 
Acquisition of Non-controlling Interest in Alon Partnership. On November 8, 2017, Delek and Alon USA Partners, LP (the "Alon Partnership") entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Delek agreed to acquire all of the outstanding limited partner units of the Alon Partnership that Delek did not already own in an all-equity transaction (the "Alon Partnership Transaction"). The Alon Partnership Transaction was approved by the board of directors of Delek and by all voting members of the board of directors of the general partner of the Alon Partnership upon the recommendation from its conflicts committee. As a result of the Alon Partnership Transaction, we anticipate additional growth opportunities through subsequent dropdowns of logistics assets acquired by Delek through the transaction. The Alon Partnership Transaction closed on February 7, 2018. 
Big Spring Pipeline Acquisition.  On September 15, 2017, the Partnership, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Delek Marketing & Supply, LP, acquired from Plains Pipeline, L.P. an approximately 40-mile pipeline and related ancillary assets (the "Big Spring Pipeline") (such transaction, the "Big Spring Acquisition") for approximately $9.0 million to complement our existing asset base. The Big Spring Pipeline originates in Big Spring, Texas and terminates in Midland, Texas.
Delek/Alon Merger. In January 2017, Old Delek, New Delek and various related entities entered into the Merger Agreement with Alon USA. The transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement became effective on July 1, 2017, and, among other things, resulted in Alon USA and Old Delek surviving as wholly-owned subsidiaries of New Delek. The Delek/Alon Merger did not affect the Partnership's commercial agreements with Delek discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Inflation Adjustments.  On July 1, 2017, the tariffs on our Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") regulated pipelines and the throughput fees and storage fees under certain of our agreements with Delek and third parties that are subject to adjustment using FERC indexing increased by approximately 0.2%, the amount of the change in the FERC oil pipeline index. Under certain of our other agreements with Delek and third parties, the fees increased based on the consumer price index or the producer price index, which increased approximately 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively. Any applicable decreases to such fees in the future will not result in a reduction to an amount below the fee initially set forth in such agreements. 
6.750% Senior Notes Due 2025. On May 23, 2017, the Partnership and Delek Logistics Finance Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Partnership (“Finance Corp.” and together with the Partnership, the “Issuers”), issued $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.750% senior notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”). The 2025 Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Issuers. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 Notes totaled approximately $242.3 million, after deducting the initial 
 4

purchasers' discount, commissions and offering expenses. The Partnership used substantially all of the net proceeds to pay down a portion of the outstanding balance under the Partnership's revolving credit facility. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.
Caddo Pipeline. In March 2015, we entered into a joint venture to construct a crude oil pipeline system and related ancillary assets (the "Caddo Pipeline"), which is serving third parties and subsidiaries of Delek. We own a 50% membership interest in the entity formed with an affiliate of Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. to construct the Caddo Pipeline. Operations on the Caddo Pipeline began in January 2017.
Assets and Operations 
We prepare segment information on the same basis that we review financial information for operational decision-making purposes. Currently, our business consists of two operating segments: (i) pipelines and transportation and (ii) wholesale marketing and terminalling. Additional segment and financial information is contained in our segment results included in Item 6, Selected Financial Data; Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; and Note 15, Segment Data, of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our principal assets, as of December 31, 2017, are described below under the segment that uses such assets.
The following provides an overview of our assets and operations: 
Pipelines and Transportation Segment 
Our pipelines and transportation segment consists of assets, including pipelines and trucks and ancillary assets, that provide crude oil gathering and crude oil, intermediate and finished products transportation and storage services primarily in support of the Tyler and El Dorado Refineries. Additionally, this segment provides crude oil and other products transportation services to certain unrelated third parties. In providing these services, we do not take ownership of the products or crude oil that we transport or store; and, therefore, the results of our pipelines and transportation segment are not directly exposed to changes in commodity prices. Our pipeline assets include approximately 460 miles of operable crude oil transportation pipelines, approximately 406 miles of refined product pipelines and approximately 600 miles of crude oil gathering and trunk lines. Associated with and currently used in connection with the operation of these lines are crude oil, intermediate and refined products storage tanks with an aggregate of approximately 7.3 million barrels of active shell capacity. We also own 95 tractors and 231 trailers used to haul primarily crude oil, finished products and other hydrocarbon products for unrelated and related third parties.

The discussion and tables below describe the operating results for each of our operating systems within this segment for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. 
Lion Pipeline System. Our Lion Pipeline System is a system of common carrier pipelines that transport crude oil to, and refined products from, Delek's El Dorado Refinery. The Lion Pipeline System consists primarily of:

• | the Magnolia Pipeline system;


• | the El Dorado Pipeline system;


• | multiple short crude oil pipelines located at the El Dorado Refinery and our Sandhill Station;


• | the Magnolia Station located west of the El Dorado Refinery;


• | the Refined Products Pipeline system; and


• | certain related crude oil pipelines.

The Magnolia Pipeline is an approximately 77-mile crude oil pipeline, with a capacity of approximately 68,500 bpd, which runs from a connection with ETP/ExxonMobil’s LOLA System near Shreveport, Louisiana to our Magnolia Station, where the crude oil is then stored and transferred to our El Dorado Pipeline. In addition, third-party pipelines connect to the Magnolia Pipeline near Haynesville, Louisiana, which allows for the receipt of crude oil transported from Longview, Texas. The service provided on the Magnolia Pipeline is regulated by the FERC and is subject to FERC tariffs. 
The El Dorado Pipeline is a 28-mile, 12-inch crude oil pipeline, with a capacity of approximately 22,000 bpd, which transports crude oil from our Magnolia Station to Delek's Sandhill Station adjacent to the El Dorado Refinery. The service provided on the El Dorado Pipeline is regulated by the FERC and is subject to FERC tariffs. Upon reaching Sandhill Station, the crude oil from the El Dorado Pipeline is transported, via multiple short crude oil pipelines owned by us, to Tank 192, a 150,000 barrel capacity storage tank ("Tank 192") or to Tank 120, an 80,000 barrel capacity storage tank ("Tank 120"), which receives heavier asphaltic crudes. At present, substantially all crude oil that enters the El Dorado Refinery, including the crude oil gathered on the SALA Gathering System, is routed through Sandhill Station. Through our SALA subsidiary, we own Tank 192 and Tank 120 and lease the underlying ground from Lion Oil under a long-term ground lease. 
The Magnolia Station is a location, owned by us, where the Magnolia and Lion Pipelines and SALA Gathering System have origination and destination points, as the case may be. In addition, the Magnolia Station has storage facilities with approximately 220,000 barrels of active shell capacity, which includes the addition of an 85,000 barrel crude oil storage tank in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
We also own two refined product pipelines that transport gasoline and diesel from the El Dorado Refinery to the nearby Enterprise TE Products Pipeline El Dorado Station (the “Refined Products Pipelines”). Pursuant to a capacity lease with Enterprise dated October 24, 2013, we also lease capacity of approximately 11,000 bpd on the approximately 240-mile Enterprise Products Pipeline from Enterprise's El Dorado Station to our refined products terminal in Memphis, Tennessee. The Refined Products Pipelines along with the leased capacity are collectively referred to as the "Refined Products Pipeline System." The service provided on the Refined Products Pipelines is regulated by the FERC and is subject to a FERC tariff. The diesel line is approximately eight miles and is 12 inches in diameter, while the gasoline line is approximately eight miles and is 10 inches in diameter. These two lines commence at the El Dorado Refinery. 
The pipelines in the Lion Pipeline System also have injection points where crude oil gathered from the SALA Gathering System can be injected and then transported to the El Dorado Refinery. Movements from the SALA Gathering System onto the Lion Pipeline System to the El Dorado Refinery are subject to a joint tariff for the transportation of these volumes that is on file with the FERC for both the SALA Gathering System and the El Dorado Pipeline; the joint rate for these movements is equal to the rate that would apply for movements only on the SALA Gathering System to the connection point with the Lion Pipeline System. The Lion Pipeline System has crude oil storage tanks and facilities ancillary to the operation of the pipeline system. The Lion Pipeline System is capable of transporting crude oil offloaded from rail cars at or near the El Dorado Refinery, including at the two crude oil rail offloading racks we acquired in March 2015. See "El Dorado Rail Offloading Racks" below.

(1) | Excludes crude oil gathered on our SALA Gathering System and injected into our Lion Pipeline System.

SALA Gathering System. The SALA Gathering System is a system of common carrier pipelines that primarily gathers and transports crude oil and condensate that is purchased from various crude oil producers in Arkansas, Texas and Louisiana by Delek or a third party to whom Delek has assigned certain of its rights. Service on the SALA Gathering System is regulated by the FERC and is subject to tariffs on file with the FERC. The SALA Gathering System includes approximately 600 miles of two- to eight-inch crude oil gathering and transportation lines in southern Arkansas and northern Louisiana, located primarily within a 60-mile radius of the El Dorado Refinery. In addition, the gathering system transports small volumes of crude oil that are received from other sources and condensate that is purchased from a third party in east Texas. All such crude oil and other products are ultimately transported to the El Dorado Refinery for processing. In addition, a pipeline within the SALA Gathering System transports minimal crude oil for third party shippers pursuant to a common carrier tariff. 
The SALA Gathering System includes 53 crude oil storage tanks and breakout tanks with a total combined active shell capacity of approximately 0.8 million barrels (including Tank 120, Tank 192 and approximately 37,000 barrels of capacity we lease to an unrelated third party), 14 truck receipt locations, approximately 500 pipeline gathering and receiving stations and 17 relay stations to deliver crude oil to the Magnolia Station, the El Dorado Pipeline System or directly to the El Dorado Refinery. We also have approximately 0.5 million barrels of combined shell capacity that is currently not in service. The table below sets forth historical throughput information for the SALA Gathering System.

SALA Gathering System: | | | 
Throughput (average bpd): | 15,871 | 17,756 | 20,673

Paline Pipeline System. Our Paline Pipeline System is primarily a 195-mile, 10-inch crude oil pipeline, with a capacity of approximately 36,000 bpd, running from Longview, Texas to the Phillips 66-operated Beaumont terminal in Nederland, Texas. It includes a three-mile section that runs north from Kilgore, Texas. Our Paline Pipeline System is operated as a common carrier pipeline and the service is regulated by the FERC. See "—Commercial Agreements—Other Agreements with Third Parties—Paline Pipeline System Capacity Reservation" for additional information on the use of our Paline Pipeline System. 
East Texas Crude Logistics System. Our East Texas Crude Logistics System includes two owned and operated crude oil pipeline systems and their related tank farms, which serve the Tyler Refinery: (i) the Nettleton pipeline, a bi-directional 36-mile pipeline, with a capacity of approximately 38,000 bpd, that is capable of transporting crude oil from our tank farms in and around Longview, Texas to (a) the Bullard Junction at the Tyler Refinery and (b) other of our tank farms in and around Longview, Texas, and (ii) the McMurrey Pipeline System, a 65-mile pipeline system, with a capacity of approximately 28,000 bpd, that transports crude oil from our tank farms in and around Longview, Texas and runs roughly parallel to the Nettleton Pipeline. While service on the East Texas Crude Logistics System may otherwise constitute transportation in interstate commerce and may be subject to the common carrier regulation and jurisdiction of the FERC, it is currently subject to a temporary waiver issued by the FERC on October 23, 2012, waiving the otherwise applicable tariff filing and reporting requirements for common carrier interstate service providers (the “East Texas Waiver Order”). The continuing 
 7

effectiveness of the East Texas Waiver Order depends upon the continuation in effect of the following conditions: (1) our affiliates continuing to own 100% of the throughput; (2) there being no demonstrated third party interest in shipping on the system; (3) our not anticipating any such interest materializing; and (4) there remaining no demonstrated opposition to the continuing effectiveness of the East Texas Waiver Order.
Our East Texas Crude Logistics System also includes five owned or leased crude oil storage terminals, at which we store crude oil owned by Delek for the Tyler Refinery. The LaGloria Station consists of two tanks with an active shell capacity of approximately 450,000 barrels. The Nettleton Station consists of five tanks with an active shell capacity of approximately 222,000 barrels. It is located on property that we lease from a third party, as described in more detail in Item 2, Properties. In addition to the active shell capacity, the Nettleton Station includes approximately 55,000 barrels of shell capacity that is currently not in service. The Bradford Station consists of two tanks with an active shell capacity of approximately 65,000 barrels. The Arp Station consists of two tanks with an active shell capacity of approximately 110,000 barrels. The Big Sandy Station consists of seven tanks with an active shell capacity of approximately 248,000 barrels. 
The table below sets forth historical average daily throughput for the East Texas Crude Logistics System. 

 | Average Daily Throughput (bpd)
 | Year Ended 
 | | December 31, | | 
 | 2017 | 2016 | | 2015
East Texas Crude Logistics System (average bpd) | 15,780 | | 12,735 | | 18,828


We have a pipelines and tankage agreement with Delek to provide throughput on the East Texas Crude Logistics System. However, in April 2013, a reconfigured pipeline system that is owned and operated by third parties began transporting crude oil to the Tyler Refinery from west Texas. Delek has a 10-year agreement, with an initial term expiring in 2023, with such third parties to transport a substantial majority of the Tyler Refinery’s crude oil requirements on this reconfigured pipeline system. As a result of the third parties' ability to transport crude oil on the reconfigured pipeline system directly to the Tyler Refinery, the crude oil supplied through the Nettleton and McMurrey Pipelines fell below the minimum aggregate throughput requirements of our pipelines and tankage agreement with Delek during the second quarter of 2013 and has remained below the minimum aggregate throughput requirements since that time. We expect crude oil volumes transported on our East Texas Crude Logistics System to continue to be below the minimum throughput requirement of 35,000 bpd for the foreseeable future. However, Delek is required under its commercial agreement with us, to pay us throughput fees in an amount equal to the fees it would pay were we to throughput 35,000 bpd, based on the per barrel fees in our agreement. The current term of this agreement expires in November 2022. 

Tyler-Big Sandy Product Pipeline. The Tyler-Big Sandy Product Pipeline is a pipeline that runs between the Tyler Refinery and the Partnership's terminal at Big Sandy, Texas. The line consists of two segments: (i) the Hopewell Pipeline, an approximately 13-mile pipeline with a capacity of approximately 26,000 bpd, which originates at the Tyler Refinery and terminates at the Hopewell Station, and (ii) the Big Sandy Pipeline, a 19-mile pipeline with a capacity of approximately 26,000 bpd, which originates at the Hopewell Station and terminates at the Big Sandy Terminal. The Big Sandy Terminal has 13 tanks with an aggregate shell capacity of approximately 177,000 barrels. Service on the Tyler-Big Sandy Product Pipeline is not provided to third parties, and is classified as private intrastate carrier service. 

Tyler Tank Assets. The Tyler Tank Assets consist of 96 storage tanks and certain ancillary assets (such as pumps and piping) located at and adjacent to the Tyler Refinery with an aggregate shell capacity of approximately 2.0 million barrels. 
El Dorado Tank Assets. The El Dorado Tank Assets consist of 158 storage tanks and certain ancillary assets (such as pumps and piping) located at and adjacent to the El Dorado Refinery with an aggregate shell capacity of approximately 2.5 million barrels. 

Greenville-Mount Pleasant Pipeline and Greenville Storage Facility. The Greenville-Mount Pleasant Pipeline is a 76-mile pipeline, connecting the Greenville Storage Facility and the Mount Pleasant Terminal. The service provided on the Greenville-Mount Pleasant Pipeline is regulated by the Texas Railroad Commission, subject to a tariff on file with the Texas Railroad Commission. The Greenville Storage Facility has four tanks with an aggregate shell capacity of approximately 330,000 barrels and is connected to the Explorer Pipeline System.
 8

North Little Rock Tanks. Our terminal in North Little Rock, Arkansas has five tanks with an aggregate shell capacity of approximately 180,000 barrels. 

FTT Trucking Assets.  We own 95 tractors and 231 trailers used primarily to haul crude oil and other products for third parties and Delek.
El Dorado Rail Offloading Racks. The El Dorado Rail Offloading Racks consist of two crude oil rail offloading racks, which are designed to receive up to 25,000 bpd of light crude oil or 12,000 bpd of heavy crude oil, or any combination of the two, delivered by rail to the El Dorado Refinery and related ancillary assets. 
Tyler Crude Tank. The Tyler Crude Tank is a crude oil storage tank and certain ancillary assets located adjacent to the Tyler Refinery. The Tyler Crude Tank has approximately 350,000 barrels of shell capacity and primarily supports the Tyler Refinery. 
Talco Crude Pipeline. The Talco crude pipeline is an approximately 60-mile pipeline that transports crude oil from the Exxon Talco field to the ETP/ExxonMobil LOLA pipeline injection point in the East Texas Longview Station. 
Big Spring Truck Unloading Station.  The Big Spring Truck Unloading Station is located at Delek's Big Spring, Texas Refinery (the "Big Spring Refinery"). The Big Spring Truck Unloading Station is designed to receive up to 10,000 bpd of crude oil. 
Big Spring Pipeline. The Big Spring Pipeline is an approximately 40-mile pipeline, which includes related ancillary assets. The Big Spring Pipeline originates in Big Spring, Texas and terminates in Midland, Texas. 
Wholesale Marketing and Terminalling Segment
Our wholesale marketing and terminalling segment provides wholesale marketing and terminalling services to Delek’s refining operations and to independent third parties from whom we receive fees for marketing, transporting, storing and terminalling refined products and to whom we wholesale market refined products. In providing certain of these services, we take ownership of the products and are therefore exposed to market risks related to the volatility of refined product prices in our west Texas operations, which depend on many factors, including demand and supply of refined products in the west Texas market, the timing of refined product deliveries and downtime at refineries in the surrounding area. As of December 31, 2017, we generated revenue in our wholesale marketing and terminalling segment by (i) providing marketing services for the refined products output of the Tyler Refinery, (ii) engaging in wholesale activity at our Abilene and San Angelo, Texas terminals, as well as at terminals owned by third parties, whereby we purchase light products for sale and exchange to third parties, and (iii) providing terminalling services to independent third parties and Delek. See “—Commercial Agreements—Other Agreements with Third Parties—West Texas." Also see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a discussion of our material commercial agreements with Delek. The tables below show the operating results for the wholesale marketing and terminalling segment. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we present the results for the period during which we owned the assets, as delineated in any notes accompanying the tables. 
Wholesale Marketing

East Texas. Pursuant to a marketing agreement with Delek, we market 100% of the refined products output of the Tyler Refinery, other than jet fuel and petroleum coke. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. The table below sets forth the historical sales volumes under this marketing agreement. 

 | | Year Ended |

 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 
Sales volumes (average bpd): | 73,655 | 68,131 | 59,174

West Texas. In our west Texas marketing operations, we generate revenue by purchasing refined products from independent third-party suppliers and from Delek for sale and exchange to third parties at our Abilene and San Angelo, Texas terminals and at third-party 
 9

terminals located elsewhere in Texas. Our terminals in Abilene and San Angelo, Texas were leased for nominal consideration to Noble Petro, Inc. ("Noble Petro") pursuant to a terminal and pipeline lease and operating agreement, which expired on December 31, 2017. 
We own approximately 104 miles of product pipelines in west Texas that connect our Abilene and San Angelo, Texas terminals to the Magellan Orion Pipeline. These pipelines were leased to Noble Petro until December 31, 2017. At these terminals, Noble Petro also regularly sold petroleum products to us that we then marketed to third parties. As of January 1, 2018, these regular sales of product by Noble Petro to us concluded. We are currently purchasing products from Delek and third parties at our Abilene and San Angelo terminals. To facilitate these purchases, we have constructed a pipeline into our Abilene Terminal to receive product from the pipeline owned by Holly Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE: HEP) through which Delek ships product that is produced at the Big Spring Refinery. We also have active connections to the Magellan Orion Pipeline that enable us to ship product to our terminals and to acquire product from other shippers. The table below provides the location of the Abilene and San Angelo terminals associated with our marketing activities and the number of tanks, their storage capacities, number of truck loading lanes and maximum daily available truck loading capacity for the year ended December 31, 2017. 

Terminal Location | Number of Tanks | Active Aggregate Shell Capacity (bbls) | Number of Truck Loading Lanes | Maximum Daily Available Truck Loading Capacity (bpd)
Abilene, TX (1) | 9 | | 368,000 | | 2 | 15,000

Total | 14 | | 461,000 | | 4 | 30,000


(1) | Excludes approximately 545,530 barrels of shell capacity that is out of service.

 Substantially all of our product sales in west Texas are on a wholesale basis. While we purchase finished products from Delek and from other third parties, a large portion of the products we sold in west Texas were purchased from Noble Petro during the year ended December 31, 2017 pursuant to the terms of a supply contract with Noble Petro that expired in December 2017 (the "Abilene Contract"). Under the Abilene Contract, we had the right to purchase up to 20,350 bpd of petroleum products for sale at our Abilene and San Angelo, Texas terminals. As of January 2018, we began replacing the product supplied under the Abilene Contract with product purchased from Delek, which is produced by the Big Spring Refinery and from third parties that may continue to include Noble Petro. See “—Commercial Agreements—Other Agreements with Third Parties—West Texas." 

The table below details the average aggregate daily number of barrels of refined products, and the margins associated with such products, that we sold in our west Texas wholesale operations for the periods indicated.

Commercial Agreements
Commercial Agreements with Delek 
The Partnership has a number of long-term, fee-based commercial agreements with Delek under which we provide various services, including crude oil gathering; crude oil, intermediate and refined products transportation and storage services; and marketing, terminalling and offloading services to Delek. Most of these agreements have an initial term ranging from five to ten years, which may be extended for various renewal terms at the option of Delek. The initial term of certain of these agreements expired in November 2017. Delek opted 
 11

to renew these agreements for subsequent five-year terms expiring in November 2022. In the case of our marketing agreement with Delek, the initial term has been extended through 2026. These agreements typically include minimum quarterly volume, revenue or throughput commitments. Fees under each agreement are payable to us monthly by Delek or certain third parties to whom Delek has assigned certain of its rights. For a discussion of a third party's involvement in certain agreements, see "Delek's Crude Oil and Refined Products Supply and Offtake Arrangement." In most circumstances, if Delek or the applicable third party assignee fails to meet or exceed the minimum volume, throughput or other commitment during any calendar quarter, Delek, and not any third party assignee, will be required to make a quarterly shortfall payment to us equal to the volume or amount of the shortfall multiplied or increased by the applicable fee, subject to certain exceptions as specified in the applicable agreement. Carry-over of any volumes or revenue in excess of such commitment to any subsequent quarter is not permitted. 
The tariffs and throughput and storage fees under our agreements with Delek are subject to increase or decrease on July 1 of each year, by the amount of any change in various inflation-based indices, including the FERC oil pipeline index or various iterations of the consumer price index and the producer price index; provided, however, that in no event will the fees be adjusted below the amount initially set forth in the applicable agreement. 
See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a complete discussion of our material commercial agreements with Delek. 
Other Agreements with Delek 
In addition to the commercial agreements described above, the Partnership has entered into an omnibus agreement with Delek, our general partner, Delek Logistics Operating LLC ("OpCo") and certain of the Partnership’s and Delek’s other subsidiaries on November 7, 2012, which was subsequently amended and restated on July 26, 2013, February 10, 2014 and March 31, 2015 and further amended on August 3, 2015 (collectively, as amended, the "Omnibus Agreement"). The Omnibus Agreement governs the provision of certain operational services and reimbursement obligations, among other matters, between the Partnership and Delek. 
Other Agreements with Third Parties 
Paline Pipeline System Capacity Reservation. We previously had separate agreements with two unrelated third parties for such parties to reserve certain capacity on the Paline Pipeline System. Pursuant to the terms of these agreements, each unrelated third party paid a fixed monthly fee for the exclusive right to use its respective reserved capacity on the pipeline, which together accounted for a combined 35,000 bpd. The initial term of each agreement ran through June 30, 2016. We extended one of the agreements through December 31, 2016, for a total reservation of 10,000 bpd. We currently maintain a tariff on file with the FERC for service provided on the Paline Pipeline System, which allows for third parties to ship on the available capacity of the pipeline. 
West Texas. In our west Texas marketing operations, we generate revenue by purchasing refined products from independent third-party suppliers and Delek for sale and exchange to third parties at our Abilene and San Angelo, Texas terminals and at third-party terminals located elsewhere in Texas. Substantially all of our product sales in west Texas are on a wholesale basis. We purchase finished products from Delek and from third parties. During the year ended December 31, 2017, a large portion of the petroleum products we sold in west Texas were purchased from Noble Petro. Under the terms of the Abilene Contract with Noble Petro, which expired in December 2017, we purchased petroleum products based on monthly average prices from Noble Petro immediately prior to our resale of such products to customers at our Abilene and San Angelo, Texas terminals, which we leased to Noble Petro. Under this arrangement, we had limited direct exposure to risks associated with fluctuating prices for these refined products due to the short period of time between the purchase and resale of these refined products. As of January 2018, we began replacing the product supplied under the Abilene Contract with product purchased from Delek, which is produced by the Big Spring Refinery and from third parties that may continue to include Noble Petro. Products purchased from Delek or other third parties are generally based on daily market prices at the time of purchase requiring price hedging risk management activities between the time of purchase and sale. Existing price risk hedging programs have been expanded to correspond to the higher volume of product purchased from Delek and third parties.

Delek's Crude Oil and Refined Products Supply and Offtake Arrangement 
Pursuant to an arrangement with Delek and Lion Oil, to which we are not a party, J. Aron & Company ("J. Aron") acquires and holds either title to or a lien on substantially all crude oil, intermediate and refined products transported on our Lion Pipeline System, SALA Gathering System and on pipeline capacity we lease from Enterprise TE Products Pipeline Company LLC on a pipeline that runs from the El Dorado Refinery to our Memphis Terminal (the "Memphis Pipeline"). J. Aron is therefore considered the shipper for the liquid it owns on the Lion Pipeline System, the SALA Gathering System and the Memphis Pipeline. J. Aron also has title to the refined products stored at our Memphis, North Little Rock and El Dorado terminals and in the El Dorado storage tanks. Under (i) our pipelines and storage agreement with Lion Oil relating to the Lion Pipeline System and the SALA Gathering System, (ii) our terminalling agreements with Lion Oil relating to the Memphis and North Little Rock terminals, and (iii) our throughput and tankage agreement relating to the terminal and tank assets at and adjacent to the El Dorado Refinery, Lion Oil has assigned to J. Aron certain of its rights under these agreements, including the right to have J. Aron's crude oil and intermediate and refined products stored in or transported on or through these systems, the Memphis and North Little Rock terminals and the terminal and tank assets at and adjacent to the El Dorado Refinery, with Lion Oil acting as J. Aron's agent for scheduling purposes. Accordingly, even though this is effectively a financing arrangement for Delek whereby J. Aron sells the product back to Delek, J. Aron is technically our primary customer under each of these agreements. J. Aron retains these storage and transportation rights for the term of its arrangement with Delek and Lion Oil, which currently runs through April 30, 2020, and J. Aron pays us for the transportation, throughput and storage services we provide to it. The rights assigned to J. Aron do not alter Lion Oil's obligations to meet certain throughput minimum volumes under our agreements with respect to the transportation, throughputting and storage of crude oil and refined products through our facilities, but J. Aron's throughput is credited toward Lion Oil's minimum throughput commitments. Accordingly, Lion Oil is responsible for making any shortfall payments incurred under the pipelines and storage agreement or the terminalling agreement which may result from minimum throughputs or volumes not being met. 
Customers
We are dependent upon Delek as our primary customer, and the loss of Delek as a customer would have a material adverse effect on both of our operating segments. We derive a substantial majority of our gross margin, which is defined as net sales less cost of goods sold, from fee-based commercial agreements with Delek or as a direct result of its operations. For more information pertaining to these agreements, please see "—Commercial Agreements." We also have other customers, including major oil companies, independent refiners and marketers, jobbers, distributors, utility and transportation companies and independent retail fuel operators.
Major Customers
 Delek, directly or indirectly, accounted for 28.9%, 32.8% and 24.2% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Sunoco LP accounted for 9.0%, 10.5% and 16.2% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. However, we believe that gross margin is a better measure of performance of our business on a customer specific basis than revenue, particularly in our wholesale marketing and terminalling segment, as total revenue varies with the price of the underlying product, such as a gallon of finished product. Delek, directly or indirectly, accounted for 85.8%, 90.5% and 90.0% of our gross margin for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Competition
Pipelines and Transportation
Our business in this segment primarily consists of gathering, transporting and storing crude oil, intermediate and finished products for Delek and third parties, especially other refiners. We face competition for the transportation and storage of crude oil from other pipeline owners whose pipelines or storage facilities (i) may have a location advantage over our pipelines or storage facilities, (ii) may be able to transport or store more desirable crude oil or finished products to Delek or to third parties, (iii) may be able to transport or store crude oil or finished product at a lower rate, or (iv) may be able to store more crude oil or finished product. Any or all such factors could cause Delek, or our third-party customers, to reduce throughput to a level that is below the minimum throughput commitments established in any contracts we may have with them or determine not to renew such contracts when the term expires. 
As a result of our physical integration with Delek's El Dorado Refinery, and our contractual relationships with Delek relative to the El Dorado Refinery, we do not believe that we will face significant competition for the transportation of crude oil or refined products to or from the El Dorado Refinery, particularly during the term of our Lion Pipeline System, SALA Gathering System, El Dorado Tank Assets 
 13

and El Dorado Assets agreements with Delek. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a discussion of our material commercial agreements with Delek.
Wholesale Marketing and Terminalling 
The wholesale marketing and terminalling business is generally very competitive. Our owned refined product terminals, as well as the other third-party terminals we use to sell refined product, compete with other independent terminal operators as well as integrated oil companies on the basis of terminal location, price, versatility and services provided. The costs associated with transporting products from a loading terminal to end users usually limit the geographic size of the market that can be served economically by any terminal. Two key markets in west Texas that we serve from our owned facilities are Abilene and San Angelo, Texas. However, there are no competitive fuel loading terminals in close proximity to our Abilene terminal or within approximately 90 miles of our San Angelo terminal. Our Nashville terminal competes with a significant number of other terminals located in the greater Nashville area. With respect to terminalling services we provide to Delek at our Memphis and North Little Rock terminals, as a result of our exclusive terminalling agreements, we do not believe we will face significant competition from third parties for these services. 

Pursuant to an exclusive marketing agreement with Delek, the term of which currently expires in 2026, we market 100% of the refined products output of the Tyler Refinery (other than jet fuel and petroleum coke). As a result, we do not believe that we will face significant competition for these services from third parties. In addition, as a result of our physical integration with the Tyler Refinery and our contractual relationships with Delek relative to the Tyler Refinery, we do not believe that we will face significant competition for the storage or throughput of intermediate or refined products at the Tyler Refinery, particularly during the term of our agreements with Delek. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information. Should Delek's wholesale customers, however, reduce their purchases of refined products due to the increased availability of more competitively priced products from other suppliers or for other reasons, the volumes we sell under the aforementioned agreement could decrease below the minimum volume commitment under the contract. Delek's Tyler Refinery is the only full-range product supplier within 100 miles; therefore, we believe its location gives the Tyler Refinery a natural advantage over more distant competitors. 

Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters
Rate Regulation of Petroleum Pipelines
The rates and terms and conditions of service on certain of our pipelines are subject to regulation by the FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act (“ICA”) and by the state regulatory commissions in the states in which we transport crude oil, intermediate and refined products, including the Texas Railroad Commission, the Louisiana Public Service Commission and the Arkansas Public Service Commission. Certain of our pipeline systems are subject to such regulation and have filed tariffs with the appropriate authorities. We also comply with the reporting requirements for these pipelines. Other of our pipelines have received a waiver from application of the FERC's tariff requirements, but comply with other applicable regulatory requirements. 
The FERC regulates interstate transportation under the ICA, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. The ICA and its implementing regulations require that tariff rates for interstate service on oil pipelines, including pipelines that transport crude oil, intermediate and refined products in interstate commerce (collectively referred to as “petroleum pipelines”), be just and reasonable and non-discriminatory and that such rates and terms and conditions of service be filed with the FERC. Under the ICA, shippers may challenge new or existing rates or services. The FERC is authorized to suspend the effectiveness of a challenged rate for up to seven months, though rates are typically not suspended for the maximum allowable period. Tariff rates are typically contractually subject to increase or decrease on July 1 of each year, by the amount of any change in various inflation-based indices, including the FERC oil pipeline index, the consumer price index and the producer price index; provided, however, that in no event will the fees be adjusted below the amount initially set forth in the applicable agreement. In addition, on October 20, 2016, the FERC issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Revisions to Indexing Policies and Page 700 of FERC Form No. 6, which could, if final rules are implemented as proposed, increase reporting burdens on interstate liquids transportation providers and, in some cases, prohibit pipelines, including ours, from increasing rates even if warranted by the annual index. See Item 1A, "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business."
While the FERC regulates rates for shipments of crude oil or refined products in interstate commerce, state agencies may regulate rates and service for shipments in intrastate commerce. We own pipeline assets in Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana; accordingly, such 
 14

assets may be subject to additional regulation by the applicable governmental authorities in those states. Without limitation, certain of our pipeline assets in Texas are operated under Texas Railroad Commission regulation and subject to filed tariffs with that agency. See "—Pipelines and Transportation Segment—Greenville-Mount Pleasant Pipeline and Greenville Storage Facility" for additional information on these tariffs. In Texas, a pipeline, with some exceptions, is required to operate as a common carrier by publishing tariffs and providing transportation without discrimination. Arkansas provides that all intrastate oil pipelines are common carriers. In Louisiana, all pipelines conveying petroleum from a point of origin within the state to a destination within the state are declared common carriers. The Louisiana Public Service Commission is empowered with the authority to establish reasonable rates and regulations for the transport of petroleum by a common carrier, mandating public tariffs and providing of transportation without discrimination. State commissions have generally not been aggressive in regulating common carrier pipelines, have generally not investigated the rates or practices of petroleum pipelines in the absence of shipper complaints and generally resolve shipper complaints informally. 
Whether a pipeline provides service in interstate commerce or intrastate commerce is highly fact-dependent and determined on a case-by-case basis. We cannot provide assurance that the FERC will not at some point assert that some or all of the transportation service we provide, for which we do not have a tariff on file at the FERC, is within its jurisdiction. If the FERC were successful with any such assertion, we may be required to pay refunds to customers and the FERC's ratemaking methodologies may subject us to potentially burdensome and expensive operational, reporting and other requirements. Service on the East Texas Crude Logistics System is currently subject to a temporary waiver issued by the FERC, as discussed above in "—Pipelines and Transportation Segment—East Texas Crude Logistics System." If the conditions to the continued effectiveness of that East Texas Waiver Order are no longer true at any point, service on that system would become fully subject to FERC tariff filing requirements and other regulatory requirements for the provision of transportation service.
Department of Transportation 
The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration ("PHMSA") of the United States Department of Transportation ("DOT") regulates the design, construction, testing, operation, maintenance, reporting and emergency response of crude oil, petroleum products and other hazardous liquids pipelines and other facilities, including certain tank facilities used in the transportation of such liquids. These requirements are complex, subject to change and, in certain cases, can be costly to comply with. We believe our operations are in substantial compliance with these regulations, but cannot assure you that substantial expenditures on our part will not be required to remain in compliance. Moreover, certain of these rules are difficult to insure adequately, and we cannot assure you that we will have adequate insurance to address costs and damages from any noncompliance. 

The United States Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011 (or the "Pipeline Safety Act") was enacted on January 3, 2012, pursuant to which the maximum civil penalties for certain violations were increased from $100,000 to $200,000 per violation per day and from a total cap of $1 million to $2 million. A number of the provisions of the Pipeline Safety Act have the potential to cause owners and operators of pipeline facilities to incur significant capital expenditures and/or operating costs. We intend to work closely with our industry associations to participate with and monitor DOT-PHMSA's efforts. 
In January 2017, PHMSA finalized a new regulation that, once effective, will impose additional responsibilities concerning the operation, maintenance, and inspection of hazardous liquid pipelines; the reporting of pipeline incidents; reference standards for in-line pipeline inspection and the direct assessment of stress corrosion cracking; and other requirements. We are reviewing the new regulations and intend to adjust our operations, to the extent necessary, in order to comply with the regulations upon their effective date.
The DOT has issued guidelines with respect to securing regulated facilities against terrorist attack. We have instituted security measures and procedures in accordance with such guidelines to enhance the protection of certain of our facilities. We cannot provide any assurance that these security measures would fully protect our facilities from an attack.
The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration of the DOT regulates safety standards and monitors drivers and equipment of commercial motor carrier fleets. Such standards include vehicle and maintenance inspection requirements, limitations on the number of hours drivers may operate vehicles and financial responsibility requirements. We believe that the operations of our fleet of crude oil and finished products truck transports are substantially in compliance with these regulations and safety requirements.
 15

Environmental, Health and Safety
We are subject to extensive and periodically changing federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety. Among other things, these laws and regulations govern the emission or discharge of pollutants into or onto the land, air and water, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, the remediation of contamination and the protection of workers and the public. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations increases our overall cost of business, including our capital costs to develop, maintain, operate and upgrade equipment and facilities. Numerous permits or other authorizations are required under these laws for the operation of our terminals, pipelines, and related operations, and may be subject to revocation, modification and renewal. These laws and permits may become the basis for future claims and lawsuits involving environmental and safety matters, which could include soil and water contamination, air pollution, personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by substances which we manufactured, handled, used, released or disposed of, or that relate to pre-existing conditions for which we have assumed or are assigned responsibility. 
We believe that our current operations are in substantial compliance with existing environmental, health and safety requirements. However, these laws and regulations are subject to changes by governmental or judicial authorities. The legislative and regulatory trend in recent years has been to place increasingly stringent restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment; however, the current administration has changed this trend at the federal level. Continued and future compliance with such laws and regulations may require us to incur significant expenditures. Violation of environmental laws, regulations and permits can result in the imposition of significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, injunctions limiting our operations, investigatory or remedial liabilities or construction bans or delays in the construction of additional facilities or equipment. Additionally, a release of hydrocarbons or hazardous substances into the environment could, to the extent the event is not insured, subject us to substantial expenses, including costs to respond to, contain and remediate a release, to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to resolve claims by third parties for personal injury, property damage, or natural resources damages. See "—Hazardous Substances and Waste" below for additional information on regulations pertaining to releases into the environment. These impacts could directly and indirectly affect our business. We cannot currently determine the amounts of such future impacts. There have been and will continue to be ongoing discussions about environmental and safety matters between us and federal and state authorities, including notices of violations, citations and other enforcement actions, some of which have resulted or may result in changes to operating procedures and in capital expenditures. 
Indemnification
Under the Omnibus Agreement, Delek has agreed to indemnify us for certain environmental matters associated with the ownership of our assets as specified therein, including matters arising from operations by Delek, at or before the time of our acquisition of these assets from Delek. 
Air Emissions and Climate Change
Our operations are subject to the Clean Air Act and its regulations and comparable state and local statutes. Under these laws, permits may be required before construction can commence on a new source of potentially significant air emissions, and operating permits may be required for sources that are already constructed. These permits may require controls on our air emission sources, and we may become subject to more stringent regulations requiring the installation of additional emission control technologies. Any such future obligations may require us to incur significant additional capital or operating costs. These air emissions requirements also affect Delek's refineries, from which we receive a substantial portion of our revenues. In the future, Delek may be required to incur significant capital expenditures to comply with new legislative and regulatory requirements relating to its operations. To the extent these capital expenditures have a material effect on Delek, they could have a material effect on our business and results of operations.    
Environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the United States and other countries have focused considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases ("GHGs") and their potential role in climate change. Developments in GHG initiatives that result in GHG-related requirements that disproportionately affect the cost of energy from oil in comparison to competing energy sources could affect demand for our services. Due to the uncertainties surrounding the risks and regulatory framework associated with greenhouse gas emissions, the financial impact of related developments cannot be estimated at this time.
 16

Renewable Fuel Standard 
The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 ("EISA") was enacted into federal law in December 2007 creating the Renewable Fuel Standard - 2 ("RFS-2") rule, requiring the amounts of renewable fuel sold or introduced in the United States to increase each year, reaching 36 billion gallons by 2022. The Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") has the ability to alter annual blending volume requirements based on inadequate domestic supply and has chosen to do so most years for lack of cellulosic biofuels. For this reason, the EPA has finalized volume requirements for 2018 below the statutory level. Although Delek’s refineries are obligated parties under this rule, our entities are not obligated parties and have no requirement to blend specific volumes of renewable fuels. However, the requirements could reduce future demand for petroleum products and thereby have an indirect effect on certain aspects of our business, although it could increase demand for our ethanol and biodiesel fuel blending services at our truck loading racks. 
Hazardous Substances and Waste 
To a large extent, the environmental laws and regulations affecting our operations relate to the release of hazardous substances or solid wastes into water or soils, and include measures to control pollution of the environment. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. They also require corrective action, including investigation and remediation, at a facility where such waste may have been released or disposed. For instance, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), which is also known as Superfund, and comparable state laws, impose liability without regard to fault or to the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of, the hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. In the course of our ordinary operations, we generate waste that falls within CERCLA’s definition of a “hazardous substance” and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up certain sites. However, we have not been identified as a potentially responsible party at any Superfund sites.
We also generate small quantities of solid wastes, including hazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA"), and comparable state laws. From time to time, the EPA considers the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non-hazardous wastes, including crude oil and refined products wastes. We are not currently required to comply with a substantial portion of the RCRA requirements, because our operations generate minimal quantities of hazardous wastes. However, it is possible that additional wastes, which could include wastes currently generated during operations, will in the future be designated as “hazardous wastes.” Hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements than are non-hazardous wastes. Any changes in the regulations could increase our, and our competitors’, maintenance capital expenditures and operating expenses. 
We currently own and lease, and Delek has in the past owned and leased, properties where hydrocarbons are being or have been handled for many years. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other waste may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where these wastes have been taken for disposal. In addition, many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under our control. These properties and wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA, and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater) or to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination. 
Water
Our operations can result in the discharge of pollutants, including crude oil and refined products. Several of our pipelines and terminals are located near, or cross under or over, environmentally sensitive waters, such as streams, creeks, rivers, lakes and wetlands. The transportation and storage of crude oil and refined products over and adjacent to water involves risk and subjects us to the provisions of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (the "OPA"), the Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (the "Clean Water Act") and related state requirements. These requirements subject owners of covered facilities to strict, joint and potentially unlimited liability for containment and removal costs, natural resource damages and certain other consequences of an oil spill where the spill is into navigable waters, along shorelines or in 
 17

the exclusive economic zone of the United States. In the event of an oil spill into navigable waters, substantial liabilities could be imposed upon us. States in which we operate have also enacted similar and, in some cases, more stringent laws. 
Regulations under the Clean Water Act, the OPA and state laws also impose additional regulatory burdens on our operations. Spill prevention control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws and some state laws require containment to mitigate or prevent contamination of navigable waters in the event of an oil overflow, rupture or leak. For example, the Clean Water Act requires us to maintain spill prevention control and countermeasure plans at many of our facilities. In addition, the OPA requires that most oil transport and storage companies maintain and update various oil spill prevention and oil spill contingency plans. We maintain such plans, and where required have submitted plans and received federal and state approvals necessary to comply with the OPA, the Clean Water Act and related regulations. We regularly review and modify our crude oil and refined product spill prevention plans and procedures to help prevent crude oil and refined product releases and to minimize potential impacts should a release occur. 
The Clean Water Act also imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters. Our facilities contract with third parties for wastewater disposal, discharge to local Publicly Owned Treatment Works, or discharge under the terms of a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit for wastewater and stormwater. In the event regulatory requirements change, or interpretations of current requirements change, and our facilities are required to undertake different wastewater management arrangements, we could incur substantial additional costs. The Clean Water Act imposes substantial potential liability for the violation of permits or permitting requirements and for the costs of removal, remediation, and damages resulting from such discharges. In addition, some states maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. 
Employees
We have no employees. Rather, all of the employees that conduct our business are employed by our general partner and its non-Partnership affiliates, and we believe that our general partner and its non-Partnership affiliates have a satisfactory relationship with those employees. 
Seasonality and Customer Maintenance Programs
The volume and throughput of crude oil and refined products transported through our pipelines and sold through our terminals and to third parties are directly affected by the level of supply and demand for all of such products in the markets served directly or indirectly by our assets. Supply and demand for such products fluctuates during the calendar year. Demand for gasoline, for example, is generally higher during the summer months than during the winter months due to seasonal increases in motor vehicle traffic. While demand for asphalt products, which are a substantial portion of the El Dorado Refinery's product mix, is also lower in the winter months. In addition, our refining customers, such as Delek, occasionally reduce or suspend operations to perform planned maintenance, which is more typically scheduled during the winter, when demand for their products is lower. Accordingly, these factors affect the need for crude oil or finished products by our customers and therefore limit our volumes or throughput during these periods, and our operating results will generally be lower during the first and fourth quarters of the year. We believe, however, that many of the potential effects of seasonality on our revenues and contribution margin will be substantially mitigated due to our commercial agreements with Delek that include minimum volume and throughput commitments. 
Working Capital
We primarily fund our business operations from operating cash flows, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and any potential future issuances of equity and debt securities.
