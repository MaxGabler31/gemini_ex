Strategy
Our Central to Home strategy reinforces our unique purpose to nurture happy and healthy homes and our ambition to lead the future of the pet and garden industries. Our objective is to grow net sales, operating income and cash flows by developing new products, increasing market share, acquiring businesses and working in partnership with our customers to grow the categories in which we participate. We run our business with a long-term perspective, and we believe the successful delivery of our strategy will enable us to create long-term value for all our stakeholders. To achieve our objective, we plan to capitalize on our competitive strengths and favorable industry trends by executing on five key strategic pillars to drive long-term growth:
Consumer: Build and Grow Brands that Consumers Love 
To grow, we are seeking to develop more differentiated new products and reinvest some of our annual cost savings in brand building and demand creation to help us drive sustainable organic growth and build market share. We continuously strive to get a deeper understanding of our consumers, including what products and features they desire and how they make their purchasing decisions. We are investing in consumer insights, data analytics and research and development to achieve our innovation goals with a strong pipeline of new products. We recognize that consumers are increasingly researching, as well as buying products online. Therefore, we are advancing our digital capabilities. One key area is in marketing communication where we are working to better reach consumers at key points in their path to purchase with advanced capabilities in precision marketing, search engine optimization and social listening, to name a few. We are seeing promising early marketing campaign results driving accelerated growth and share gains across several brands, including our Pennington "Smart from The Start" and Kaytee "All for the Small" campaigns. 
Customer: Win with Winning Customers and Channels 
We are building on our strong customer relationships by developing and executing winning category growth strategies. We produce both branded and private label products for our customers as well as distribute third-party brands that give our retail partners a breadth of selection from premium to value products. Recent trends have shown that eCommerce channels, including pure-play, omnichannel and direct-to-consumer, are the preferred solutions for today's convenience-oriented consumers. To address the changing consumer landscape, we are building out our digital and eCommerce capabilities while also ensuring we have the right policies, products and programs to allow all channels to compete effectively. Concurrently, we are optimizing our supply chain for high-demand eCommerce items to ensure customer and consumer availability requirements are met at optimal cost. Finally, we are also investing in sales planning, net revenue management and price pack architecture. 
Central: Fortify the Central Portfolio 
We are managing each business differentially, based on clearly articulated strategies that define the role of each business within our portfolio. We have assessed the profitability and growth potential of each of our businesses. All businesses have clear roles in the portfolio and a strategy that is consistent with that role. Some of our businesses are managed to optimize top-line growth, whereas others are more focused on reducing costs and maximizing operating income. 
We are building out our portfolio in attractive, broadly defined pet and garden markets. We are supplementing our organic growth with acquisitions and joint ventures. Our M&A priorities are to build scale in our core pet and garden categories, enter priority adjacencies and enhance key capabilities, for example in digital and eCommerce. We generally seek growth and margin accretive, brand-focused companies with talented management teams. We are also committed to divesting businesses where we cannot find a path to profitability and have done so in the past, for example the disposal of our dog and cat food business in 2020. 
Central Ventures, our venture fund which we established in 2020, further supports our M&A strategy. Our objective is to partner with leading entrepreneurs and innovators in the garden and pet industries and leverage our experience and capabilities to accelerate growth. The fund is primarily focused on three emerging growth areas across the pet and garden industries: sustainability, health and wellness, and digitally connected products and services. 
Grounded in our purpose to nurture happy and healthy homes, we are working towards a more sustainable future for all. We believe we have not only the opportunity but also the responsibility to make a difference and drive positive change. Our Central Impact Strategy - focused on protecting our planet, cultivating our communities and empowering our employees - is our commitment and approach to sustainability. 
Cost: Reduce Cost to Improve Margins and Fuel Growth 
Optimizing our supply chain footprint is a priority as we seek to become more efficient and cost-effective. Having the right facilities in the right locations is critical to lowering costs and enabling our businesses to meet the demands of our existing and new customers. We have already consolidated some of our dog and cat treat and toy businesses and numerous garden manufacturing facilities. We recently combined our outdoor cushion business with our pet bedding business given the synergies in sourcing, manufacturing and innovation. In addition, while we value being a business-unit led company, we believe we have significant opportunities to improve our performance by driving processes and programs that allow us to align for scale and share best practices across our business units. For example, we’ve simplified our portfolio by eliminating thousands of SKUs, shifted some of our wild bird and garden controls production from co-manufacturers to our own plants and invested in automation in many of our businesses.
Culture: Strengthen Our Entrepreneurial Business-Unit Led Growth Culture
Our values, created by leaders across the Company, are the cornerstone of our culture, and they are at the root of every decision we make – we call them “The Central Way.” We believe having a strong set of values provides a foundation for employees and strengthens how we all work together. They comprise six simple values: “We do the right thing.” ”We strive to be the best.” “We are entrepreneurial.” “We win together.” “We grow every day.” and “We are passionate." 
We believe our employees work at Central because they love the pet and garden categories and that creates a passionate and effective team. We strive to make Central a great place to work that embraces diversity and inclusion. In fiscal 2020, we implemented a diversity and inclusion council and introduced our diversity and inclusion strategy, which reflects our dedication to making meaningful progress in the areas where we can have the most impact including recruiting, employee education, mentorship and leadership development. Over the course of the past year, we formalized our mentorship program, designed for mid- to senior-level leaders, with a focus on women and people of color who have a desire to build their career and leadership skills. The intent is to develop strong and diverse talent in our future leaders, while fostering cross-level relationships.
In 2022, our 150 top leaders from across all business units and functions came together for the first Central Leadership Council Summit. Over the course of the Summit, we reaffirmed our conviction and ownership of our Central to Home strategy, shared best practices, celebrated accomplishments, and strengthened our winning culture.
Competitive Strengths
We believe we have a number of competitive strengths, which serve as the foundation of our Central to Home strategy, including the following:
Broad Portfolio of Leading Brands Across Key Garden and Pet Segments
We are one of the leaders in the U.S. pet supplies market and the lawn and garden consumables market. We have a diversified portfolio of brands in both segments, many of which are among the leading brands in their respective market categories, ranging from Kaytee in pet bird and small animal, Nylabone in dog toys, Cadet in dog treats and chews, Four Paws in waste management and grooming, K&H in heated pet products, Aqueon in aquatics and Farnam in equine to Pennington in wild bird products, grass seed and fertilizer, Ferry-Morse in packet seed and Amdro in controls. The majority of our brands have been marketed and sold for more than 40 years.
Robust Financial Performance 
We have demonstrated strength in our financial performance, in net sales, earnings and cash flow. Our net sales grew on average 10.2% annually over the last five years, driven by acquisitions and organic growth. Operating income grew slightly faster over the same period, 10.8% on a GAAP basis annually. We have a strong cash and liquidity position driven by a combination of capital raises and cash flow from operations which puts us in a strong position to grow further through both acquisitions and organically.
Proven Track Record of M&A 
Since 1992, we have completed over 60 acquisitions to create a company of approximately $3.3 billion in net sales. These acquisitions have successfully expanded the breadth of our pet and garden portfolios. We acquired D&D Commodities Ltd. ("D&D"), a leading provider of premium bird feed in June 2021 and Green Garden Products, a leading provider of vegetable, herb and flower packet seed, seed starters and plant nutrients in February 2021. In December 2021, we acquired Hopewell Nursery, a leading live goods grower and DoMyOwn®, a leading and fast-growing online retailer of professional-grade control products.
We are a patient and disciplined value buyer, typically focused on opportunities that build scale in our core garden and pet categories or in priority adjacencies, with a recent emphasis on those that enhance key capabilities, for example in digital and eCommerce. We are open to businesses that, on top of traditional operating synergies, can leverage our expertise and capabilities and allow us to add value through our low-cost manufacturing and distribution competencies. We generally prefer to acquire brand-focused businesses with growth and margin rates above Central’s rates, with proven, seasoned management teams, who are committed to stay with the acquired business after closing. We have been successful in growing our acquisitions organically after acquiring them into our portfolio. We continually review our businesses to ensure they meet expectations and have implemented strategies to reverse sub-par performance when necessary.
Strong Relationships with Retailers 
We have developed strong relationships with major and independent brick & mortar and online retailers, providing them broad product offerings including new product innovation, premium brands, private label programs, proprietary sales and logistics capabilities and a high level of customer service. Major retailers value the efficiency of dealing with suppliers with national scope and strong brands. We believe our ability to meet their unique needs for packaging and point of sale displays provides us with a competitive advantage. Independent retailers value our high level of customer service and broad array of premium branded products. We believe these strengths have assisted us in becoming one of the largest pet supplies vendors to Costco, Walmart and Petco and among the largest lawn and garden consumables vendors to Home Depot, Walmart and Lowe’s, and the club and mass merchandise channels, as well as a leading supplier to independent pet and lawn and garden retailers in the United States. 
In fiscal 2022, Bell Nursery was awarded the Home Depot Environmental Partner of the Year recognizing Bell Nursery’s commitment to sustainability and Petco recognized Central as the Companion Animal Vendor of the Year. Pet Supplies Plus acknowledged one of our leaders with the prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award at their annual Suppliers Awards meeting and our pet distribution business was awarded the 2022 Distributor of the Year Award by Petsense by Tractor Supply. In fiscal 2021, Bell Nursery was awarded Home Depot's Supplier Partner of the Year. 
Walmart, our largest customer, represented approximately 17% of our total company net sales in fiscal 2022 and 16% in fiscal 2021. Home Depot, our second largest customer, represented approximately 16%, and 15% of our total company net sales in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. Lowe's, Costco and Petco are also significant customers, and together with Walmart and Home Depot, accounted for approximately 51% of our net sales in both fiscal 2022 and 2021. 
Leading Manufacturing, Sales and Distribution Network 
We manufacture the majority of our branded products in our network of manufacturing facilities, located primarily in the United States. In addition, some of our proprietary branded products are manufactured by contract manufacturers, including one of our registered active ingredients, (S)-Methoprene, which is manufactured by a third party under an exclusive arrangement. 
We are a leading supplier to independent specialty retailers for the pet supplies market and the lawn and garden consumables market. Our sales and distribution facilities are strategically placed across the United States to allow us to service both our mass market customers as well as independent specialty retail stores, serving traditional brick & mortar but increasingly also omnichannel and pure-play retailers selling only through the internet. In addition, we operate facilities in China, Canada, the United Kingdom and Mexico. This network also supports distribution of many other manufacturers’ brands and combines these products with our branded products into single shipments, enabling us to serve our customers in an effective and cost-efficient manner. We believe this gives us a competitive advantage over other suppliers as this network provides us with key access to independent pet specialty retail stores and retail lawn and garden customers that require two-step distribution, facilitating acquisition and maintenance of shelf placement, prompt product replenishment, customization of retailer programs, quick responses to changing customer and retailer preferences, rapid deployment and feedback for new products and immediate exposure for new internally developed and acquired brands.
We plan to continue to utilize our team of dedicated salespeople and our sales and logistics networks to expand sales of our branded products. 
Strong and Experienced Leadership Team
Our leadership team is committed to delivering value for all our stakeholders and is comprised of highly tenured professionals, combining both deep Central and consumer products industry expertise. We believe the depth and breadth of their perspectives and experiences create an optimal foundation for our entrepreneurial business-unit led growth culture and facilitates innovation, which is critical to capturing and maintaining market share.
Pet Segment
Pet Overview
We are one of the leading producers and marketers of pet supplies in the United States. In addition, our Pet segment operates one of the largest sales and distribution networks in the industry, strategically supporting our brands.
Pet Industry Background
The pet industry includes food, supplies, veterinary care and non-medical services, and live animals. We operate primarily in the pet supplies segment of the industry as well as in the live fish and small animal categories. The pet supplies segment includes: products for dogs and cats including edible bones, premium healthy edible and non-edible chews, rawhide, toys, pet beds, pet containment, grooming supplies and other accessories; products for birds, small animals and specialty pets including cages and habitats, toys, food and chews and related accessories; animal and household health and insect control products; products for fish, reptiles and other aquarium-based pets including aquariums, terrariums, stands and lighting fixtures, pumps, filters, water conditioners, food and supplements, and information and knowledge resources; as well as products for equine and livestock. The total annual retail sales of the pet food, treats and chews, supplies, veterinary and non-medical services and live animal industry in 2022 was estimated by Packaged Facts to have been approximately $131 billion. We expect the industry to continue to grow from that foundation. Based on Packaged Facts estimates for 2022, we estimate the annual retail sales of the pet supplies, live animal and treats and chews markets in the categories in which we participate to be approximately $30 billion. 
According to Packaged Facts, the U.S. pet supplies market is highly fragmented with over 2,500 manufacturers, ranging from mostly single-category or limited-range players to approximately two dozen companies with a solid multi-category presence. The majority of these smaller companies do not have a captive sales and logistics network and rely on us or other independent distributors to supply their products to regional pet specialty chains and independent retailers. 
The pet food and supplies industry retail channel is composed of a wide range of retailers, from national chains like Petco and PetSmart to approximately 14,000 independent pet specialty stores in addition to mass-market, online and other retailers. In the last decade, independent pet stores have suffered not only from growing online competition, but also competition from mass-market retailers expanding their pet offerings with services and private label products. Following a surge in online ordering for at-home delivery or curbside pickup during the pandemic, eCommerce growth has somewhat moderated today but continues to outpace brick-and-mortar. To counter the success of online retailers, brick-and-mortar based retailers are continuing to add veterinary and non-medical services to their offerings, such as grooming, boarding, and training, attempting to drive in-store traffic and increase profitability. 
Long-Term Pet Industry Characteristics
Long term, we believe the U.S. pet supplies market will continue to grow due to favorable demographic and wellness trends tracking within Pet. During the Covid-pandemic, the pet supplies market benefited from the addition of millions of pets, the heightened focus on wellness among pet owners, the rush of online shopping and adaptability of consumers, marketers, retailers and service providers to meet every pet's healthcare needs. A 2022 Packaged Facts survey found that approximately 95% of U.S. pet owners view their pet as family. The pandemic has elevated concerns over human and pet health and wellness and almost 90% of pet owners agree that they look for products to improve their pet's health and well-being. Pet adoption has been higher among the younger generations as Gen Z adults are joining the pet owner pool, with 45% of pets now being owned by Millennials and Gen Z, which should support continued growth. 
Branded Pet Products
Our principal pet supplies categories are dog and cat supplies, dog treats and chews; aquatics and reptile supplies, small animal and pet bird supplies, animal health products as well as live fish and small animals. Our Nylabone brand is one of the leading brands in dog toys and treats, Kaytee in pet birds and small animal, Farnam in equine, Aqueon in aquatics and Comfort Zone in cat calming. In addition, we operate our Arden Companies® outdoor cushion business in the Pet segment due to synergies in sourcing, manufacturing and innovation with our pet bedding business.
We continuously seek to introduce new products, both as complementary extensions of existing product lines and in new product categories. In fiscal 2022, we launched our new GoodGood dog supplements line with no artificial colors and only natural flavors. We also launched Nylabone Gourmet style dog chew toys, which are uniquely crafted with enticing gourmet flavor bits roasted throughout. In fiscal 2021, we launched our new Comfort Zone Opticalm™ diffuser, helping cats feel safe and happy. We also launched a patented aquarium kit with smart clean technology under our Aqueon brand. It combines the easy to clean function fish keepers need with the styling and design they want. We introduced Field+Forest by Kaytee premium small animal food, hay and hay rolls with wholesome ingredients, carefully curated from nature's fields and forests to support a healthy diet. 
Over the last two years, many of our pet products have won industry awards. In fiscal 2022, Field + Forest by Kaytee Hay Bale was selected as an Editor’s Choice Winner by Pet Product News, Nylabone again won Chew Toy Product of the Year award, Kaytee NutriSoft™ was selected as winner of the Bird Food Product of the Year award and Vetrolin® Bath was selected as winner of the Shampoo Product of the Year award in the 2022 Pet Independent Innovation Awards. At SuperZoo 2022, Aqueon Stick’ems and Zilla Rapid Sense Décor won first place in the New Product Showcase award in the Aquatics and Herptile category. In fiscal 2021, Nylabone won Chew Toy Product of the Year in the 2020 Pet Independent Innovation Awards. At SuperZoo 2021, Farnam earned Top Honors in Equine for its Apple Elite electrolyte pellets. Kaytee's Superfood Treat Stick won an Editors choice award from Pet Product News International. Eight of our pet brands (Aqueon, Coralife®, Four Paws, K&H, Kaytee, Magic Coat®, Nylabone and Zilla) were recognized by Newsweek in August 2021 as America's Best Petcare Brands.
Dog and Cat. Our dog and cat category, featuring brands such as Cadet, Four Paws, Healthy Edibles®, K&H, Mikki, Nylabone, Nubz®, NutriDent® among others, is an industry leader in manufacturing and marketing premium edible and non-edible chews, interactive toys, grooming supplies and pet beds, pet containment, training and waste management solutions. 
Aquatics and Reptile Supplies. We are a leading supplier of aquariums and terrariums as well as related fixtures and stands, water conditioners and supplements, water pumps and filters, sophisticated lighting systems and accessories featuring the brands Aqueon, Blagdon®, Coralife, Interpet® and Zilla.
Small Animal and Bird Supplies. We are a leading manufacturer of supplies and pet food for small animals, pet birds and wild birds. We offer a full range of products including species specific diets, treats, habitats, bedding, hay and toys under brands such as Kaytee, Critter Trail, C&S Products®, and Field+Forest by Kaytee. Many of our branded wild bird mixes are treated with a proprietary blend of vitamins and minerals. Our brands are some of the most widely recognized and trusted brands for birds and small animals.
Animal Health (Health & Wellness, Equine and Professional). We supply calming products under the Comfort Zone brand, dog supplements under our GoodGood brand as well as flea and tick controls under the Adams® brand. We also offer innovative products for horses in the fly control, supplements, grooming, deworming, wound care, leather care and rodenticides categories. Our portfolio of brands for equine includes Farnam, Horse Health™ Products, Vita Flex®, Just One Bite® and Rodentex™. These brands, along with sub-brands including Bronco®, Endure®, IverCare®, Horseshoer’s Secret®, Red Cell®, Sand Clear™, Super Mask® II and Vetrolin® position us as a leader in these categories. Moreover, we are a leading supplier of insect control products sold into various markets. We are the only domestic producer of (S)-Methoprene, which is an active ingredient used to control mosquitoes, flies, fleas, beetles and ants in many professional and consumer insect control applications. Our products are sold primarily under the Starbar® and Zoëcon® family of brands, as well as standalone brands such as Altosid®, Centynal™, ClariFly®IGR, Diacon®, Essentria® and Extinguish®. We also sell (S)-Methoprene to manufacturers of other insect control products, including Frontline Plus. 
Live Fish and Small Animals. Segrest and SunPet are leading wholesalers of aquarium fish and plants, reptiles and small animals to pet specialty and mass merchandiser stores as well as public aquariums and research institutions. 
Outdoor cushions. We sell Arden-branded outdoor cushions through major retailers, both in-store and online, and private label outdoor cushions through the largest big box stores in North America, all leveraging Arden's EverTru-branded outdoor fabric. Our OceanTex™ fabrics, developed by EverTru, are responsibly made and composed of up to 100% recycled materials, including reclaimed ocean plastic and fishing nets. 
Pet Sales and Distribution Network
Our domestic sales and distribution network exists to promote both our proprietary brands and third-party partner brands. It provides value-added service to over 9,800 retailers, many of which are independent specialty stores with fewer than 10 locations, and over 6,400 veterinary offices. This includes acquisition and maintenance of premium shelf placement, prompt product replenishment, customization of retailer programs, quick response to changing customer and retailer preferences, rapid deployment and feedback for new products and immediate exposure for acquired brands. The combination of brands in the network that are supplied in single shipments enables our independent customers to work with us on a cost-effective basis to meet their pet supplies requirements. We also operate a sales and logistics facility in the United Kingdom.
Pet Sales and Marketing
Our sales strategy is multi-tiered and designed to capture maximum market share with retailers. Our customers include retailers, such as club, regional and national specialty pet stores, independent pet retailers, mass merchants, grocery and drug stores, as well as the eCommerce channel. We also serve the professional market with insect control and health and wellness products for use by veterinarians, municipalities, farmers and equine product suppliers. Costco Wholesale accounted for approximately 11% of our Pet segment's net sales in both fiscal 2022 and 2021. Walmart, Petco, Amazon and Kroger are also significant customers.
To optimize our product placement and visibility in retail stores, our focused sales resources are segmented as follows:
•a sales organization operating by category and channel;
•dedicated account teams servicing our largest customers;
•a group of account managers focused on regional chains;
•a geographic based group of territory managers dedicated to the independent retailer; and
•a specialized group of account managers dedicated to the professional and equine markets.
These sales teams deliver our marketing strategy that is consumer, brand and channel driven. We provide value creation with a focus on innovation, product quality and performance, premium packaging, product positioning and consumer value. We collaborate closely with our customers to identify their needs, jointly develop strategies to meet those needs and deliver programs that include digital execution, print, broadcast and direct mail. We continue to invest in talent, innovation, brand building, digital capabilities and eCommerce as these play a critical role in our ambition to lead in the pet segment.
Over the last two years we have received a number of awards for marketing. In fiscal 2022, Kaytee won two packaging design awards from Graphic Design USA for Kaytee Nutrisoft and Field + Forest by Kaytee. In fiscal 2021, the National Association of Container Distributors (NACD), recognized Farnam's Vetrolin packaging with a bronze award.
Pet Competition
The pet supplies industry is highly competitive and has experienced considerable consolidation. Our branded pet products compete against national and regional branded products and private label products produced by various suppliers. Our largest competitors in the product categories we participate in are Mars, Inc., Spectrum Brands and the J.M. Smucker Co. The Pet segment competes primarily on the basis of brand recognition, innovation, upscale packaging, quality and service. Our Pet segment’s sales and distribution network competes with Animal Supply Co., Phillips Pet Food & Supplies and a number of smaller local and regional distributors, with competition based on product selection, price, value-added services and personal relationships. 
Garden Segment
Garden Overview
We are a leader in the consumer lawn and garden consumables market in the United States and offer both premium and value-oriented branded products. We also produce value brands at lower prices, including numerous private label brands. In addition, our Garden segment operates a manufacturing, sales and distribution network that strategically supports our brands.
Garden Industry Background
The garden industry includes consumables such as grass and other seeds, fertilizer, controls, live goods, wild bird products as well as soil and mulch, and durables such as landscaping and decorative products including pottery, outdoor furniture, water features, lighting, arches and trellises. The total lawn and garden consumables industry in the United States is estimated by Packaged Facts, The Freedonia Group, Numerator and internal estimates to be approximately $32 billion in annual retail sales in 2022, including grass and other seeds, fertilizer, controls, live goods, wild bird products as well as soil and mulch. We estimate the annual retail sales of the lawn and garden consumables market in the categories in which we participate to be approximately $31 billion. 
The lawn and garden consumables market is highly concentrated with most products sold to consumers through a number of distribution channels, including home centers, mass merchants, independent nurseries and hardware stores. Home and garden centers and mass merchants typically carry multiple premium and value brands. 
Long-Term Garden Industry Characteristics
The Freedonia Group expects the industry to continue to grow as lifestyle changes and shifts in demographics are creating new opportunities in gardening. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted daily habits, with many people spending much more time at home. As such, outdoor living has become much more significant and increased the emphasis on creating a pleasant outdoor living space. A survey by Freedonia Group found that in the 12 months ending March 2021, 36% of consumers agreed that they spent more time on outdoor projects while 26% of consumers planted a food garden because of the pandemic. Among key outdoor living trends, millennials are increasingly interested in gardening as a leisure pursuit, with 70% of respondents indicating that they enjoy gardening. They have become the nation's largest group of gardeners, representing 29% of all gardeners. According to the National Association of Realtors, Millennials have become homeowners in large numbers; a shift accelerated by COVID-19, remote work and a steady increase in income. Their interest in natural and organic products is particularly benefiting products with a positive environmental profile. The Freedonia Group reports that nearly three quarters of gardeners believe that they have a personal responsibility to be environmentally friendly. 
Branded Lawn and Garden Products
Our principal lawn and garden consumables product lines are grass seed, vegetable, herb and flower packet seed, wild bird products, insect control products, lawn and garden care products including fertilizers and live plants. Our Pennington brand is one of the largest in grass seed, wild bird feed and birding accessories. Ferry-Morse is a leader in vegetable, herb and flower packet seed and our Amdro brand is a leading portfolio of control products.
We continuously seek to introduce new products, both as complementary extensions of existing product lines and in new product categories. In fiscal 2022, we launched Pennington Smart Patch lawn products, ideal for patching bare lawn spots and thinning areas. In fiscal 2021, we relaunched Pennington Smart Seed® lawn products with patent-pending fertilizer-enhanced seed coating to speed seed establishment and promote greener grass. We also launched a variety of new bird feeders under our Pennington brand. We expanded our live plants offering with small decorated holiday products and introduced plantlings delivered directly to the consumers. 
Controls. We are a leading marketer, producer and distributor of lawn and garden weed, moss, insect and pest control products. We sell these products under brands such as Amdro, Corry’s®, Daconil®, IMAGE, Knockout™, Lilly Miller®, Moss Out®, Over-N-Out®, Rootboost™ and Sevin as well as other private and controlled labels.
Grass Seed. We are a leading marketer, producer and distributor of numerous varieties and mixtures of cool and warm season grass seed for both the residential and professional markets, as well as forage and wildlife seed mixtures. We sell these products under the Pennington brand along with several sub-brands including Lawn Booster, One Step Complete®, Rackmaster®, Slopemaster®, Smart Seed, Smart Patch, The Rebels® and other brand names. We also produce numerous private label brands of grass seed. The Pennington grass seed manufacturing facilities are some of the largest and most modern seed coating and conditioning facilities in the industry. 
Vegetable, Herb and Flower Seed. We are a leading provider of vegetable, herb and flower packet seeds and seed starters. We sell these products under the American Seed®, Ferry-Morse, Livingston®, McKenzie® Seed, Jiffy and other brand names. 
Wild Bird. We are the leading producer, marketer and distributor of wild bird feed, bird feeders, bird houses and other birding accessories. These products are sold under the Pennington, Wild Delight® and 3-D® Pet Products brands. Many of our branded wild bird mixes are treated with a proprietary blend of vitamins and minerals. For example, our Pennington brand mixes are enriched with Bird-Kote®, our exclusive process which literally seals each seed with a nutritious coating containing vitamins and minerals that are beneficial to the health of wild birds.
Fertilizers. We are a leading producer, marketer and distributor of soil supplements and stimulants. We manufacture several lines of lawn and garden fertilizers and soil supplements in granular and liquid form under the Alaska® Fish Fertilizer, Ironite®, Pennington, Superthrive® and Pro Care® brand names and other private and controlled labels.
Live Plants. With Bell Nursery and Hopewell Nursery, we are the primary supplier of superior quality flowers, trees, shrubs and other plants to Home Depot in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions, producing and shipping tens of millions of annuals and perennials each year, also offering items we don’t grow, such as orchids and indoor plants. 
Garden Sales and Distribution Network
Our sales and distribution network exists primarily to promote our proprietary brands and provides us with key access to retail stores for our branded products, acquisition and maintenance of premium shelf placement, prompt product replenishment, customization of retailer programs, quick responses to changing customer and retailer preferences, rapid deployment and feedback for new products, immediate exposure for acquired brands and comprehensive and strategic information. The network also sells other manufacturers’ brands of lawn and garden supplies and combines these products with our branded products into single shipments enabling over 4,400 customers and over 38,000 stores to deal with us on a cost-effective basis to meet their lawn and garden supplies requirements.
Garden Sales and Marketing
The marketing strategy for our premium products is focused on meeting consumer needs through product performance, innovation, quality, upscale packaging and retail shelf placement. The marketing strategy for our value products is focused on promotion of the quality and efficacy of our value brands at a lower cost relative to premium brands. Our customers include retailers, such as mass merchants, home improvement centers, independent lawn and garden nurseries, drug and grocery stores, and professional end users. Sales to Home Depot represented approximately 33% and 33%, sales to Walmart represented approximately 28% and 26% and sales to Lowe’s represented approximately 16% and 18% of our Garden segment’s net sales in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.
To maximize our product placement and visibility in retail stores, we market our products through the following four complementary strategies:
•dedicated sales forces represent our combined brand groups;
•retail sales and logistics network, which provides in-store training and merchandising for our customers, especially during the prime spring and summer seasons;
•dedicated account-managers and sales teams located near several of our largest customers; and
•selected independent distributors who sell our brands.
We continue to invest in talent, digital capabilities and eCommerce as these play a critical role in our ambition to lead in the Garden segment.
Garden Competition
The lawn and garden consumables industry is highly competitive. Our lawn and garden products compete against national, regional and private label products produced by various suppliers. Our turf and forage grass seed products, fertilizers, pesticides and combination products compete principally against products marketed by The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company. In addition, Spectrum Brands and S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc. are strong competitors in yard and household insecticides. Our Garden segment competes primarily based on its strong premium and value brands, quality, service, price and low-cost manufacturing. Our Garden segment’s sales and distribution network also competes with a large number of distributors, with competition based on price and service.
Seasonality 
While demand for our pet supplies products, except for pest controls, is generally balanced over the year, our lawn and garden consumables business is highly seasonal with approximately two thirds of net sales occurring in our second and third fiscal quarters combined. We build inventory based on expected demand and typically fill customer orders within a few days of receipt, so the backlog of unfilled orders is not material. Funding for working capital items, including inventory and receivables, is normally sourced from operating cash flows and short-term borrowings under our revolving credit facility. For additional information on our liquidity, working capital management, cash flow and financing activities, see Liquidity and Capital Resources, and Note 11, Long-Term Debt, appearing later in this Form 10-K.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
We purchase most of our raw materials from multiple suppliers. We obtain one of the raw materials used to manufacture (S)-Methoprene from a single source of supply. We maintain an inventory of this raw material (in addition to our (S)-Methoprene inventory) to reduce the possibility of interruption in the availability of (S)-Methoprene, since a prolonged delay in obtaining (S)-Methoprene or this raw material could result in a temporary delay in product shipments and have an adverse effect on our Pet segment’s financial results.
The key ingredients in our fertilizer and insect and weed control products are commodity and specialty chemicals, including urea, potash, phosphates, herbicides, insecticides and fungicides.
The principal raw materials required for our bird feed are bulk commodity grains, including millet, milo and sunflower seeds, which are generally purchased from large national commodity companies and local grain cooperatives. In order to ensure an adequate supply of grains and seed to satisfy expected production volume, we enter into contracts to purchase a portion of our expected grain and seed requirements at future dates by fixing the quantity, and often the price, at the commitment date. Although we have never experienced a severe interruption of supply, we are exposed to price risk with respect to the portion of our supply which is not covered by contracts with a fixed price. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant increase in demand for pet supplies and garden consumables. This has caused strain on our supply chain network and its ability to meet such demand. For information regarding the impact of changes in commodity prices, see “Risk Factors – The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted how we are operating our business, and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain” and “Risk Factors – Seeds and grains we use to produce bird feed and grass seed are commodity products subject to price volatility that has had, and could have, a negative impact on us” in Item 1.A.
Patents, Trademarks and Other Proprietary Rights
We hold numerous patents in the United States and in other countries and have several patent applications pending. We consider the development of patents through creative research and the maintenance of an active patent program to be advantageous to our business, but do not regard any particular patent as essential to our operations. In addition to patents, we have numerous active ingredient registrations, end-use product registrations and trade secrets. Along with patents, active ingredient registrations, end use product registrations and trade secrets, we own numerous trademarks, service marks, trade names and logotypes. Many of our trademarks are registered but some are not.
Human Capital Management
We believe Central employees are part of our organization because they are passionate about the pet and garden industries. Every Central Team member and every job is important to our success and helping us to achieve our purpose.
As of September 24, 2022, we had approximately 7,000 employees, of whom approximately 6,400 were full-time employees and 600 were temporary or part-time employees. We also hire substantial numbers of additional temporary employees for the peak lawn and garden shipping season of February through June to meet the increased demand experienced during the spring and summer months. The majority of our temporary employees are paid on an hourly basis. Except for approximately 50 employees at a facility in Puebla, Mexico, none of our employees are represented by a labor union. The attrition rate of our non-seasonal full-time and part-time workforce was 36% in fiscal 2022.
We believe that attracting, developing and retaining a diverse and inclusive workforce is an important component to our continued success. We have taken several steps to further enhance our diversity, including the creation of a diversity and inclusion council. We consider gender, nationality, ethnicity, age, educational and professional background, among other things, in our recruiting and internal promotion decisions. Women serve in several senior leadership roles, holding 39% of leadership positions (defined as Managers, Directors and Senior leaders (Vice President and above), including Senior Vice President Human Resources, General Counsel and Secretary, Chief of Staff, Senior Vice President Pet Consumer Marketing, Vice President Accounting Operations, Vice President Investor Relations, Vice President Corporate Development, Vice President Real Estate, President Segrest, General Manager Health & Wellness and Vice President Pet Specialty Sales.
We recognize financial stability is a critical component to our employees’ well-being. Our competitive compensation programs include base salary or hourly compensation for all employees. In addition, we provide an annual 401k profit-sharing bonus program and a bonus program for eligible employees which is based on the success of our businesses as measured by designated performance metrics and individual performance contributions. Another component of our overall compensation program is long-term equity which is offered through annual and individual grants. We use such long-term equity grants as a means of attracting and retaining key employees to reward performance and to give these employees a vested interest in the success of the Company. Moreover, our physical health programs, like our medical and dental coverage, help our employees to feel their best on the job and at home.
Developing our employees so that they can assume key roles within Central is an important strategic priority for us. We offer a variety of programs and resources to train and enhance the skill set of our workforce, including subsidizing college and advanced degrees for eligible employees. We also engage in regular discussions around succession planning and talent development at all levels of the Company. Our Board has frequent contact with business leaders within the organization and participates actively in the succession planning process. Our Senior Vice President Human Resources reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer and works with management to evaluate internal talent for future leadership positions within the organization on an ongoing basis. In evaluating potential acquisitions, an important consideration is the quality of the management team of the target company and our ability to obtain sufficient assurance that such management will remain with Central as needed if and after we acquire the business.
We encourage and drive high standards in our safety performance by recording, reporting and investigating all incidents to root cause. In the ongoing push for progress, we set new annual safety targets and invest in our operational capabilities. In fiscal 2022, we were able to improve our recordable incident rate by 24% compared to fiscal 2021.
In February 2021, for the first time in the Company's history, Central was named as one of Forbes 2021 America’s Best Midsize Employers.
Regulatory Considerations
Many of the products that we manufacture or distribute are subject to local, state, federal and foreign laws and regulations. Such regulations are often complex and are subject to change. For example, in the United States, all pesticides must be registered with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), in addition to individual state and/or foreign agency registrations before they can be sold. Fertilizer products are also subject to state Department of Agriculture registration and foreign labeling regulations. Grass and other seed are also subject to state, federal and foreign labeling regulations.
The Food Quality Protection Act ("FQPA") establishes a standard for food-use pesticides, which is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the cumulative effect of pesticide exposures. Under this Act, the EPA is evaluating the cumulative risks from dietary and non-dietary exposures to pesticides. The pesticides in our products, which are also used on foods, are evaluated by the EPA as part of this non-dietary exposure risk assessment.
In addition, the use of certain pesticide and fertilizer products is regulated by various local, state, federal and foreign environmental and public health agencies. These regulations may include requirements that only certified or professional users apply the product or that certain products be used only on certain types of locations (such as “not for use on sod farms or golf courses”), may require users to post notices on properties to which products have been or will be applied, may require notification of individuals in the vicinity that products will be applied in the future or may ban the use of certain ingredients. 
Various federal, state and local laws, including the federal Food Safety Modernization Act (“FSMA”), also regulate pet food products and give regulatory authorities the power to recall or require re-labeling of products. Several new FSMA regulations became effective in recent years. 
Various local, state, federal and foreign environmental laws also impose obligations on various entities to clean up contaminated properties or to pay for the cost of such remediation, often upon parties that did not actually cause the contamination. In the course of our extensive acquisition history, we have acquired a number of manufacturing and distribution facilities, and most of these facilities have not been subjected to Phase II environmental tests to determine whether they are contaminated.
Environmental, Social and Governance
The long-term profitability of our business requires us to do our part to protect the planet, care for the local areas we serve, and provide our Central employees a safe, healthy and rewarding workplace. Sustainability is embedded throughout our long-term enterprise roadmap, and brought to life through our Central Impact strategy. We demonstrated our commitment to sustainability by publishing our first Central Impact Report in fiscal 2022. This inaugural report provides detailed information on our Central Impact strategy, our focus areas - protecting our planet, cultivating our communities and empowering our employees, and we have set goals in 10 critical areas - energy & greenhouse gases, water, waste, biodiversity, philanthropy, employee volunteering, product stewardship, health & safety, diversity & inclusion, learning & development - and our progress and examples of our commitment in action. The report can be found on our website www.central.com.
