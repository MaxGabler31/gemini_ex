Business Overview
 
Agape ATP Corporation is a company which plans to develop and provide health solution advisory services to our future clients. We will, at least initially, primarily focus our efforts on attracting customers in Malaysia. Our advisory services will center on the “ATP Zeta Health Program”, which is a health program designed to assist in the elimination of various diseases caused by polluted environments, unhealthy dietary intake and unhealthy lifestyles. The program aims to promote improved health and longevity in our clients through a combination of modern medicine, proper nutrition and advice from skilled dieticians.
 
At its core, the ATP Zeta Super Health Program is focused upon biological energy, Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), at the cellular level. The stimulation of ATP production at the cellular level can increase the metabolism and service to promote and maintain normal and healthy functioning of the body’s systems. Our program emphasizes nutrient absorption through the membrane ion channel to provide complete and balanced nutrients to improve cell health. Thus, ATP Zeta Super Health Program provides ionized and high zeta potential (high bioavailability) nutrients to enhance the absorption at the cellular level.
 
The ATP Zeta Super Health Program consists of ten products. None of these products are owned or produced by Agape ATP Corporation, nor do we have any agreements or arrangements with the third-party manufacturers of these products. In the event that any of these products are no longer produced, or are otherwise unavailable, we may have to devote significant effort to identifying and obtaining comparable replacement products. We will also evaluate adding additional products to the ATP Zeta Super Health Program as operations continue, but we have no plans to do so at present. The ten products that comprise the ATP Zeta Super Health Program are ATP1s Survivor Select, ATP2 Energized Mineral Concentrate, ATP3 Ionized Cal-Mag, ATP4 Omega Blend, ATP5 BetaMaxx, AGN-Vege Fruit Fiber, AGP1-Iron, YFA-Young Formula, Mitogize and ORYC-Organic Youth Care Cleansing Bar.
 
We plan to acquire products from third party manufacturers located in Australia, the United States, Germany and Malaysia. We do not have any existing contracts or agreements with any third party manufacturers. All products are acquired from unrelated third parties and rebranded by the Company. The Company plans to market and sell all products in Malaysia, and due to the contents and combination of the main ingredients in the products they are categorized as health food rather than medicines or drugs. As such, all products require authorization from the Food and Quality Division of Ministry of Health according to the Food Act of 1983 and Food Regulation 1985 in order to be sold in Malaysia. All of the products in the ATP Zeta Super Health Program have obtained the appropriate authorizations. Our health solution advisory services are mainly based on combining these ten products in order to eliminate the clients’ diseases. The combination of these ten products may vary based upon the disease(s) of each client.
 
Our salespeople, who we have yet to hire, will meet with prospective clients at their homes, public locations, or at office space which has not yet been obtained. Our salespeople will evaluate the condition of clients and based upon their health issues, will recommend a combination of the ten products that comprise the ATP Zeta Super Health Program. Agape ATP Corporation will purchase the products that make up the ATP Zeta Super Health Program from their manufacturers and will then directly sell these products to our future clients based upon their health conditions. Exact pricing for these advisory services have not been determined at this point in time, but will be based upon the cost of acquiring inventory. At present, we do not have storage space for any acquired inventory.

Future Plan
 
In the future, we plan to hire at least five to ten salespeople for every country in which we will operate. At present, we do not have any salesforce, and we will need to hire salespeople for our Malaysia market initially. It will also be necessary for us to acquire office space from which we can conduct operations, have meetings with potential clients, and store acquired inventory. We anticipate expanding into the Asian market, with a particular focus, at least initially, on expanding into Thailand, Indonesia and Taiwan. At present, we do not have any distinct timeline in place for expansion into these countries.
 
When we begin these efforts, we plan to hire more employees to support our operations in different countries. We believe that hiring fifteen to twenty employees will be sufficient in order to support our operations. We also plan to allocate funds to research new products for the ATP Zeta Super Health Program. However, such development will require intensive research, development and testing so we cannot accurately determine a concrete timeline at present nor have we determined an appropriate budget for these future activities. We may also evaluate potential acquisitions in the future which we feel may have some synergy with our current operations.
 
Marketing
 
Agape ATP Corporation plans to penetrate the marketplace and attract customers by building our brand image through print ads, and possibly online paid advertisements, in order to create brand awareness. We are developing a corporate website which will introduce the ATP Zeta Super Health Program. We will market our advisory services through this corporate website and utilize search engine marketing to improve the number of consumers who can find and view our website. Finally, we also have as of yet unidentified plans to market our health program through social networking websites. All of the above marketing plans have not yet been determined in sufficient detail to outline at this time, and remain under development.
Competition
 
Agape ATP Corporation plans to operate in a mature, competitive industry. We consider our focus to be on adults ranging in age from 18-65 years old. Competition in the health and wellness industry, with a focus on health supplements in particular, is very intense in Malaysia. We face competition from various retail health supplement providers, pharmacies, and Multi-Level Marketing Companies which supply health supplement products, such as Bio-Life Marketing Sdn Bhd, Elken Group, Usana Group, BMS Organics, NHF Group and their respective affiliates. These competitors generate significant traffic and have established brand recognition and financial resources.
 
We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include the quality of health supplements, the efficiency and effectiveness of the health supplements, strength and depth of relationships with clients, the ability to identify the changing needs and requirements of prospective clients, and the scope of service. Through utilizing our competitive strengths we believe that we have a competitive edge over other competitors due to the breadth of our product offerings, one stop convenience, pricing, our service, our reputation and product safety. We are confident we can develop and enlarge our market share in the Malaysian market and potentially further into the overseas market.
 
Customers
 
For the year ended June 30, 2018, the Company has generated $487,005 revenue from clients under the ordinary course of business of Agape. The revenue mainly derived from the sale of healthy food products.
Employees
 
We have no employees as of the date of this prospectus, with the exception of our sole officer and director, Mr. How Kok Choong. Mr. How currently devotes approximately 30 hours per week to the Company’s matters. After receiving funding, Mr. How Kok Choong plans to devote as much time as the Board of Directors determines is necessary for him to manage the affairs of the Company. As our business and operations increase, we plan to hire full time management and administrative support personnel.
 
Government regulation
 
We are subject to the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate, which may include business licensing requirements, income taxes and payroll taxes. In general, the development and operation of our business is not subject to special regulatory and supervisory requirements.
