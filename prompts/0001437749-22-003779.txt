Item 1. Business
Overview
 
Proto Labs, Inc. was incorporated in Minnesota in 1999. The terms “Proto Labs,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” as used herein refer to the business and operations of Proto Labs, Inc. and its subsidiaries. We are one of the world’s largest and fastest digital manufacturers of custom prototypes and on-demand production parts. Our mission is to empower companies to bring new ideas to market by offering the fastest and most comprehensive digital manufacturing service in the world. Our automated quoting and manufacturing systems allow us to produce commercial-grade plastic, metal, and liquid silicone rubber parts in as fast as one day. We manufacture prototype and low volume production parts for companies worldwide, who are under increasing pressure to bring their finished products to market faster than their competition. We utilize injection molding, computer numerical control (CNC) machining, 3D printing and sheet metal fabrication to manufacture custom parts for our customers. We have manufactured over 370 million parts for customers. For most of our offerings, our proprietary technology eliminates most of the time-consuming and expensive skilled labor conventionally required to quote and manufacture parts. Using our technology, we have analyzed over 7.4 million unique part designs. Our customers conduct nearly all of their business with us over the Internet. We target our products to the millions of product developers and engineers who use three-dimensional computer-aided design (3D CAD) software to design products across a diverse range of end-markets. In addition, we serve procurement and supply chain professionals seeking to manufacture custom parts on-demand. We have established in-house manufacturing facilities and offices in the United States, Europe and Japan, which we believe are three of the largest geographic markets where our customers are located. Through the acquisition of Hubs (formerly 3D Hubs, Inc.) (Hubs) in 2021, we are able to provide our customers access to a global network of premium manufacturing partners who reside across North America, Europe and Asia, complementing our in-house manufacturing. We believe our use of advanced technology enables us to offer significant advantages at competitive prices to many customers and is the primary reason we have become a leading supplier of custom parts.
 
We believe prototype and low volume custom parts manufacturing has historically been an underserved market due to the inefficiencies inherent in the quotation, equipment set-up and non-recurring engineering processes required to produce custom parts. Our customers typically order short run custom parts for a variety of reasons, including: 
 

● | they need a prototype to confirm the form, fit and function of one or more components of a product under development; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | they need an initial supply of parts to support pilot production for testing of a product; 
● | they need an initial supply of parts to support production while their tools for a high-volume production mold are prepared; 
● | they need to meet their customers' variable demand for parts in a competitive timeframe; 
● | their product will only be produced in a limited quantity and/or is highly customized; 
● | they need to support end-of-life production in a cost-effective manner; 
● | they want to avoid minimum order quantities or storing inventory; 
● | they need access to diverse, cost competitive manufacturing capabilities and value the convenience of working with a single supplier to match parts to the best producer; or
● | they need low- to mid-volumes of parts on an irregular schedule and prefer to order on-demand. 

 
    5 

  

In each of these instances, we believe our solution provides product developers, engineers, and production buyers with an exceptional combination of speed, quality, competitive pricing, ease of use and reliability that they typically cannot find among conventional custom parts manufacturers. Our technology enables us to ship parts as soon as the same day after receipt of a customer’s design submission.
 
Our primary manufacturing product lines currently include Injection Molding, CNC Machining, 3D Printing and Sheet Metal. We continually seek to expand the range of size and geometric complexity of the parts we can make with these processes, to extend the variety of materials we are able to support and to identify additional manufacturing processes to which we can apply our technology in order to better serve the evolving preferences and needs of product developers and production buyers. Through the acquisition of Hubs, and as we complete the integration of our offerings, we will be providing our customers access to a global network of premium manufacturing partners which significantly expands the breadth and depth of our manufacturing capabilities. The acquisition of Hubs also allows us to offer customers a wider variety of lead times and pricing options, and an expanded envelope of parts (complexity, size, etc.). 
 
We have experienced significant growth since our inception in 1999. We have grown our total revenue from $344.5 million in 2017 to $488.1 million in 2021.
 
Our increases in revenue can be attributed to expanding our customer base, broadening our parts envelope, and launching new manufacturing technologies. We were founded in 1999 with plastic injection molding, and have expanded our product lines over the years by the introduction of: 
 

● | CNC machining in 2007;

Industry Overview
 
We serve product developers and engineers worldwide who bring new ideas to market in the form of products containing one or more custom parts. Many of these product developers and engineers use 3D CAD software to create digital models representing their custom part designs that are then used to create physical parts for concept modeling, prototyping, functional testing, market evaluation or production. Custom prototype parts play a critical role in the product development process, as they provide product developers and engineers with the ability to test and confirm their intended performance requirements and explore design alternatives.
 
Our digital model supports the transition from prototyping to production and enables us to serve product developers and engineers through prototyping and product development. Our digital model also enables us to serve production buyers that are focused on bringing their end product to market in a scalable, cost-effective manner. Our internal manufacturing operations, augmented by external manufacturing partners through our acquisition of Hubs in 2021, allow us to provide solutions for the many customer use cases from prototyping to low-volume production in a broad range of lead time and pricing options.
 
We believe there are three significant trends disrupting the manufacturing industry today:
 

● | SKU Proliferation – The increase in the number of products launched has been dramatic across many sectors.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Shorter Product Life Cycles – New products are launching faster and more frequently than ever before, partially driven by the internet of things and other connected device trends, resulting in shorter lives in the market.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Shift to E-commerce Sourcing – The first two trends, SKU proliferation and shorter product life cycles, put pressure on traditional supply chains causing many to adopt digital solutions and begin to invest in digital supply ecosystems.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The impacts of these trends include increased volatility, reduced development time, increased variety to manage, higher pressure on development costs, shorter payback period in the market and reduced capital investment per product. Our digital thread makes us ideally suited to solve these challenges for many manufacturing companies by offering world-class speed, low upfront investment, no minimum order quantities, broad manufacturing capabilities, and flexibility to adapt to demand volatility.
 
    7 

  

Our Process 
 
Our digital thread, which is the combination of our proprietary software and the physical manufacturing process, has enabled us to reinvent manufacturing. Our digital thread ties together each aspect of the online ordering and manufacturing processes, including 3D CAD modeling and visualization tools, proprietary design for manufacturability analysis (DFM), computer aided manufacturing, the manufacturing equipment, and the shop floor data collection systems. Digital manufacturing, and the addition of the digital thread, results in automation that reduces manufacturing and labor costs and increases throughput, enabling us to differentiate ourselves as one of the world’s fastest and most effective solutions for prototype and low volume production use cases.
 
Our technology allows us to manufacture a broad range of parts and products, across multiple industries and processes and enables us to serve a diverse set of customers. We currently serve all manufacturing industry verticals, with our top industries being medical and healthcare, computer electronics, industrial machinery and equipment, aerospace and automotive.
 
The Aura Project, a project with our client, Aura, is one example of our broad ability to serve our customers’ use cases. Aura came to us in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic with a need for prototyping to rapidly bring to market a safe, high-quality ventilator that was also low in cost. Our automated analysis helped reduce their startup cost, and Protolabs’ quick turn sheet metal fabrication and 3D printing helped Aura move quickly through several rounds of iterations to prepare a final design. This product went to market in record time and their ability to rapidly prototype with us was key to their success.
 
Customer Order
 
The customer order process begins when the customer uploads one or more 3D CAD models representing the desired part geometry through our web-based customer interfaces. Our websites provide a straightforward means for our customers to submit 3D CAD part designs, including managing projects with multi-part orders, across multiple services and capabilities. Our proprietary software uses complex algorithms to analyze the 3D CAD geometry, analyze its DFM and support the creation of an interactive, web-based quotation containing pricing and manufacturability information. Using this technology, we have analyzed over 7.4 million unique part designs. The artificial intelligence and machine learning provided by each analysis allows us to continually improve our DFM technology. When the analysis is complete, a link to the quotation is then e-mailed to the customer, who can access the quotation, change a variety of order parameters and instantly see the effect on price before finalizing the order.
Digital Manufacturing Process
 
Our internal manufacturing operations produce parts in-house, while our outsourced manufacturing operations automatically route the parts for production by a global network of premium manufacturing partners.
Internal Manufacturing Operations
 


    8 

  

For our internal manufacturing operations, once the design is ready and the customer places the order, digital instructions are sent to the production floor where manufacturing can begin immediately. Our proprietary software and business process automates the non-recurring manufacturing engineering in many of our services, removing time and cost from the manufacture of the custom part. With the integrated digital thread, data is shared through the continuum of the manufacturing process, from product conception and design upload to manufacturing, inspection and delivery. This ensures consistency, quality and a high degree of automation. As a result of this automation, we are able to ship parts to customers with industry leading speed at scale.
Outsourced Manufacturing Operations to Network of Manufacturing Partners
 



Once a customer order is confirmed, Hubs’ proprietary software automatically routes the parts to the right manufacturing partner within minutes using a smart order routing system. Selected highlights of Hubs’ proprietary software platform are:

● | Majority of ordered parts are instantly quoted
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | 98% of orders are manufacturable and the design for manufacturability software developed in-house
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Majority of sourced orders are paired automatically using smart order routing system
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Machine learning on data of over 7 million parts produced 

Shipping Parts to Customers
 
Once parts are produced through our digital manufacturing process, either in-house or by one of our manufacturing partners, the parts are shipped to our customer. Parts are shipped in as little as one business day from design submission. We ship our parts via small parcel common carriers on standard terms and conditions.
Our Product Lines
 
Our suite of services falls under our four main product offerings — Injection Molding, CNC Machining, 3D Printing and Sheet Metal. These product lines offer many engineers and buyers the ability to quickly and efficiently outsource their quick-turn custom parts manufacturing. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for the historical revenue generated by each of Injection Molding, CNC Machining, 3D Printing and Sheet Metal. In 2021, we augmented our internal manufacturing operations through our acquisition of Hubs to expand the envelope of custom parts we can provide to our customers through a network of premium manufacturing partners in each of our product lines.
 
    9 

  

Injection Molding
 
Our Injection Molding product line uses our 3D CAD-to-CNC machining technology for the automated design and manufacture of molds, which are then used to produce custom plastic and liquid silicone rubber injection-molded parts and over-molded and insert-molded injection-molded parts on commercially available equipment. Our Injection Molding product line works best for on-demand production, bridge tooling, pilot runs and functional prototyping. Our affordable molds and quick turnaround times help reduce design risk and limit overall production costs for product developers and engineers. Because we retain possession of the molds, customers who need short-run production often come back to Proto Labs’ Injection Molding product line for additional quantities. They do so to support pilot production for product testing, while their tooling for high-volume production is being prepared, because they need on-demand manufacturing due to disruptions in their manufacturing process, because their product requires limited annual quantity or because they need end-of-life production support. In 2017, we launched an on-demand manufacturing injection molding service. This service utilizes our existing processes, but is designed to fulfill the needs of customers with on-going production needs.
 
CNC Machining
 
Our CNC Machining product line uses commercially available CNC machines to offer milling and turning. CNC milling is a manufacturing process that cuts plastic and metal blocks into one or more custom parts based on the 3D CAD model uploaded by the customer. CNC turning is a subtractive manufacturing process that rotates a metal rod while a cutting tool is used to remove material and create final parts. Quick-turn CNC machining works best for prototyping, form and fit testing, jigs and fixtures and functional components for end-use applications.
 
Industrial 3D Printing
 
Our Industrial 3D Printing product line includes SL, SLS, DMLS, MJF, PolyJet, Carbon DLS and fused deposition modeling (FDM) processes, which offers customers a wide-variety of high-quality, precision rapid prototyping and low volume production. These processes create parts with a high level of accuracy, detail, strength and durability. Industrial 3D Printing is best suited for functional prototypes, complex designs and end-use applications.
Sheet Metal
 
Our Sheet Metal product line includes quick-turn and e-commerce-enabled custom sheet metal parts, providing customers with prototype and low-volume production parts. The rapid prototype sheet metal process is most often used when form, fit and function are all a priority. Our manufacturing process uses customer 3D CAD models uploaded by the customer to fabricate rapid prototyping sheet metal or end-use production parts and assemblies.
Our Growth Strategy
 
We currently operate in a global custom contract manufacturing market which is a form of outsourcing where companies enter into an arrangement or formal agreement with another company or individual for the manufacture of complete parts, products, or components. Since our inception, we have focused on areas where we could automate the manufacturing process via our digital model. Our initial focus was on prototypes and simple parts and have added complexity over time. We have added product lines and expanded those product lines to meet the needs of our customers, which has ultimately driven our growth. Historically, we focused on speed, reliability and quality as key components of our differentiation, and customers used us for production where there was a good fit. We have positioned ourselves to avoid routine, low margin, high-volume commoditized manufacturing. We have evolved from serving primarily fast response prototypes to broader customer use cases including higher requirements, such as a tighter tolerance, broader ranges of lead times and price points and quality and process documentation to support production needs. We have further expanded our offering through the acquisition of Hubs to be able to serve our customers more holistically, augmenting our in-house manufacturing capabilities with a network of premium manufacturing partners to serve our customer needs that currently reside outside of our internal manufacturing capabilities. As we integrate with Hubs, our goal is to go from being one of the fastest and most reliable providers of custom parts to one of the most comprehensive in our four services. Combining our unprecedented in-house manufacturing with Hubs broad services offer and wide variety of price and lead time options expands our ability to provide value to our customers and differentiates us from competitors.
 
    10 

  

The principal elements of our growth strategy are to:
 
Establish Platform (2020-2023)

We serve nearly all of our customers over the internet using our e-commerce, digital model. The majority of customers upload CAD files through our secure e-commerce platform to receive a quote, and ultimately, place an order. The order is then processed through our digital model that is connected by our systems.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2020 in Europe and in the first quarter of 2021 in the United States, we launched Protolabs 2.0 (PL 2.0), a project designed to enhance the functionality and ease of use of our platform and expanded the capabilities of our customer-facing and back-end systems in order to further increase automation and meet the evolving needs of product developers and engineers worldwide.
 
In 2021, our e-commerce platform was recognized by the World Economic Forum’s Global Lighthouse Network, recognizing our industry leading efforts to implement Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) technologies at our Plymouth, MN injection molding facility. The Lighthouse Network serves as a platform for manufacturers showing leadership in using 4IR technologies to share and learn best practices, support new partnerships and help other manufacturers deploy technology, adopt sustainable solutions, and transform their workforces. By implementing manufacturing automation and industrial internet of things technologies like this, we are able to unlock new levels of sustainability and efficiency for ourselves and our customers.
 
We believe product developers and engineers have come to expect advanced web-based tools and a fully integrated Internet platform from their vendors. In the near term, PL 2.0 provides our customers a more simplified quoting and more intuitive user experience. It requires fewer clicks and provides a better overall buying experience. Further, it allows expanded production capabilities for our customers. In the long-term, we expect PL 2.0 will allow us to launch new services and capabilities faster, help integrate acquisitions more efficiently, and continue to improve the buying experience by monitoring customer feedback and how customers use the system.
 


Our integration of the Hubs platform will position us to be able to expand our offer to provide our customers with the broadest solution for custom parts and we will continue to deliver innovation through historic and future R&D investment. With the integration of the Protolabs and Hubs architectures into a united platform, we can provide customers a complete offer with a single e-commerce storefront. This combined architecture will connect customers to the right manufacturing solution based on their needs. We will provide a range of price and lead time options providing customers with the most comprehensive custom parts solution in the world.
 
Accelerate Growth (2022-2026) 
 
Our launch of PL 2.0 and acquisition of Hubs in 2021, will provide the foundation for us to accelerate growth in 2022 and beyond. The enhanced customer experience and expanded offering portfolio is expected to drive higher customer satisfaction, higher annual revenue per customer and improved customer retention. In addition, the new platform will allow us to continue to expand our parts offerings and serve a broader set of customer use cases. We serve a diverse set of customers from over a dozen industries. Accordingly, unlike most traditional manufacturers, we are not reliant on a single industry for growth. Our customers range from small start-ups to multi-national corporations. We continue to capitalize on the e-commerce revolution, as product developers and engineers move from sourcing parts traditionally to the e-commerce experience for sourcing custom parts.
 
    11 

  

We primarily focus on two types of customers: design engineers and production buyers. Our original customer, and still our largest type of customer, is the design engineer. Design engineers typically value, in order of importance, reliability, speed, quality, breadth of manufacturing capabilities, ease of use and price. Our first growth opportunity is to capture more wallet share by being a single provider for all their needs. The breadth and depth of our offering expanded with our acquisition of Hubs, allowing us to better serve our design engineers. Our enhanced offering is expected to lead to higher customer retention, greater customer satisfaction and increased revenue per customer as we serve more of their product needs.
 
Our second type of customer is the production buyer. Our ability to move quickly from prototyping to production enables us to serve the low volume, on-demand production needs of our customers. Shorter product life cycles, unpredictable demand, and the need to get products to market more quickly have increased the demand for our production offering. Production buyers typically value, in order of importance, quality, total cost of ownership, reliability, breadth of manufacturing capabilities, ease of use and speed. Transitioning with our customers to production has been a newer growth strategy for us and we historically captured only a portion of production business. Through our internal R&D road map and our acquisition of Hubs, we continue to expand our production capabilities to be able to serve more of our customers’ needs, including offering a variety of price points and lead times, quality documentation and 3D printing production for certain use cases.
 
Finally, we anticipate our new complete and comprehensive offering will be attractive to new customers. We expect to continue to acquire new customers from traditional shops by communicating the advantages of digital manufacturing.
 
Expand Profitability (2025 and beyond)
 
The market in which we play, the tremendous value we deliver to our customers and our ability to expand our capabilities to serve our customers, has allowed us to grow from revenue of $126.0 million in 2012, the year of our IPO, to revenue of $488.1 million in 2021. As we establish our platform and accelerate growth, we are positioned to serve customers more holistically, which we expect will drive continued, long-term sustainable revenue growth, and ultimately, expanded profitability.
 
In recent years, we have focused on expanding our capabilities and investing in building our base infrastructure to support our long-term growth. Our integrated offer and service expansion will provide the platform for accelerating our growth. Going forward, we aim to leverage scale and innovation to expand profitability and capture enhanced operational efficiencies.
 
Marketing
 
As a customer-centric organization, we continue to evolve our go-to-market strategy. We believe we have three marketing opportunities to capitalize on: 1) expanding business with existing customers, including engineers and buyers, 2) engaging buyers who are new to us and are increasing e-commerce spend as manufacturing digitalizes, and 3) capturing engineers who are new to us and are turning to digital manufacturing solutions. Our global marketing effort generates leads for our sales teams and seeks to strengthen our reputation as an industry leader in digital manufacturing services for custom prototyping and low-volume manufacturing. Since we are an agile, technology-based company, much of our marketing activities occur online. We use marketing automation software to enhance the productivity of our marketing and sales teams and continuously track the results of our campaigns to ensure our return on investment.
 
We maintain top-of-mind brand awareness with product developers and engineers through regular publication of technical information including design guidelines and helpful tips, engineering white papers, educational webinars, quick videos, and a quarterly journal focused on important industry topics. We also provide complimentary physical design aids to designers and engineers — as well as teachers and students — that highlight technical aspects of injection molding to help create efficient, well-designed parts. We believe these educational materials are key aspects of our lead generation efforts. 
 
    12 

  

Marketing represents the face of Proto Labs, so it is our goal to actively and intelligently engage buyers and engineers across multiple mediums — whether print, online, social media or in person. By doing this, we gain new customers, drive sales and build brand equity.
 
Sales and Customer Service
 
We maintain an internal sales team trained in the basics of part design and the capabilities of our manufacturing product lines, as well as the key advantages of our processes over alternate methods of custom parts manufacturing. We organize our sales team into complementary roles: business development, account management and strategic account management, with the former focused on selling to new customer companies within targeted market segments and the latter two focused on expanding sales within existing customer companies. 
 
We believe our sales staff is adept at researching customer companies and networking to find additional customers who may have a need for our products. We also have a team of customer service engineers who can support highly technical engineering discussions with product developers and engineers as required during the sales process. Our revenue is generated from a diverse customer base, with no single customer company representing more than 3% of our total revenue in 2021. We have served over 85% of the 2021 Fortune 500 companies in our target industries.
 

Competition
 
The market for custom parts manufacturing is fragmented, highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our potential competitors include:
 

● | Other custom parts manufacturers. There are thousands of alternative manufacturing machine shops, injection molding suppliers, sheet metal fabricators, and 3D printing service bureaus and vendors worldwide. The size and scale of these businesses range from very small specialty shops to large, high-volume production manufacturers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Brokers. There are an increasing number of digital brokers that provide product developers with a network of manufacturers, generally a subset of the other custom parts manufacturers described above, that can offer a diverse range of capabilities, capacity, competitive pricing and desired lead times to meet customer demand.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Captive in-house product manufacturing. Many larger companies undertaking product development have established additive rapid prototyping (3D printing), CNC machining, injection molding or sheet metal capabilities internally to support prototyping or manufacturing requirements of their product developers and engineers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe that the key competitive factors in our industry include:
 

● | Quality: dimensional accuracy, surface finish, color and cleanliness;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Speed: turnaround time for quotations and parts;
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | Reliability: highly reliable delivery with predictable lead times;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Service: overall customer experience, from web interface to post-sales support;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Capability: range of part sizes and dimensional complexities supported, variety of manufacturing processes offered, materials supported and post-processing provided;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Scale: ability to support thousands of part designs in parallel;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------

 
    13 

  


● | Capacity: ability to manage peaks in demand with very short lead times and no minimum order quantities; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Price: competitive mold and part pricing, including total cost of ownership.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe that our digital end-to-end manufacturing capability positions us favorably and has enabled us to become a leader in our markets. We also believe that substantially all of our current direct competitors are smaller than us in terms of size of operations, revenue, number of customers and volume of parts sold, and generally lack our technological capabilities, or where developed at scale, have yet to operate profitably. However, our industry is evolving rapidly and other companies, including potentially larger and more established companies with developed technological capabilities, may begin to focus on low volume, high mix custom parts manufacturing. These companies could more directly compete with us, along with our existing competitors, and could also launch new products and product lines that we do not offer that may quickly gain market acceptance. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our ability to attract customers.
 

Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability
 
Our corporate responsibility and sustainability practices are built on a foundation of shared fundamental values of teamwork, trust and achievement, and help us to deliver strong financial results that create value for our Company and our shareholders in a way that respects our communities and the environments in which we operate. The Company's three core values are embodied in everything we do.

• | Teamwork – We are dedicated to the idea that a diversity of minds is better than one. Through open communication, we strive to collaborate with and include all of our colleagues to maximize our creativity and to make our good ideas great. We respect each other’s opinions. We help colleagues who are struggling to improve, so our success is everyone’s success.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Trust – Our integrity is built on honest answers to our customers and colleagues. It is okay to make mistakes if we use them to learn. We navigate difficult situations with compassion. The success of our Company depends on the success of our people.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Achievement – Speed and innovation are the cornerstones of our success. We are committed to being a solution for getting things done quickly and sustainably and a catalyst for great ideas for our shareholders, customers, the environment and each other. We are responsible for our performance, our results and our future.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Workforce Demographics
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 2,663 full-time employees, including 1,826 full-time employees in the United States, 759 full-time employees in Europe and 78 full-time employees in Japan. We also regularly use independent contractors and other temporary employees across the organization to augment our regular staff. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified, diverse and inclusive personnel.
 
We are an equal opportunity employer, and we believe that a diverse workforce made up of people with different ideas, strengths, interests and cultural backgrounds drives employee and business success. Our workforce is composed of a diverse group of engineers, technicians and business professionals from around the world and every walk of life.
 
We believe our employees are critical to our success and continually seek employee feedback to enhance employee engagement. In 2021, our attrition rates were higher than normal. Our attrition rates were 17%, 20% and 8% in the United States, Europe and Japan, respectively.
 
    14 

  

Compensation
 
We believe our success depends in large measure on our ability to attract, retain and motivate a broad range of employees to be successful in a dynamic and changing business environment, and that a competitive compensation program is essential. In determining employee compensation, our executive leadership team reviews and considers several factors, including individual and corporate performance, input from managers, competitor market data from third party compensation surveys, our compensation philosophy and key principles, and the leadership’s collective experience and knowledge. Annually, our executive leadership team reviews input from managers throughout our organization, including recommendations as to compensation levels that the managers believe are commensurate with an individual’s job performance, skills, experience, qualifications, criticality to our company and development/career opportunities. We also award long-term equity-based compensation to high performing employees and managers who have the greatest impact on the creation of shareholder value to further align the interests of our employees and shareholders.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
 
At Protolabs, diversity, equity and inclusion matters. We are committed to nurturing a culture where we celebrate diversity, equity and inclusivity as a way of life. Our diversity and inclusion efforts start at the top with our board regularly reviewing initiatives. Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Leadership Council was established to promote honest conversations, influence best practices and educate our employees. Our DEI Leadership Council members are employee representatives chosen from various functions and locations to work directly with our leadership team to drive change in our work environment. As we continue to grow, we will continue to emphasize employee safety and having an inclusive work environment as top priorities. Our goal is to build diverse teams throughout the global organization and be a role model for the communities where we work and live. Uniqueness defines us as a company, from our custom products to our employees. Our pledge is to promote a global culture that invites, recognizes and embraces each individuals contributions to make a stronger “US”.
Health, Safety and Wellness
 
We strive to continuously improve our employees’ health, safety and wellness. Our “I Am” safety program teaches that safety is the responsibility of every individual in our organization. We believe this program is the basis for our excellent safety compliance record. We believe that our employees are our most valuable asset, and their safety and health is among our top priorities.
 
In addition to concentrating on employee safety in the workplace, we also focus on the overall wellbeing of our employees. We continue to invest in a variety of employee health and wellness programs, including gym membership discounts, on-site yoga classes at certain facilities, wellness newsletters and learning sessions, and providing various Employee Assistance Programs.
 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are closely monitoring infection rates to ensure appropriate safety measures are in place for the well-being of our employees, customers, and suppliers. Our goal is to minimize the spread of illness, while ensuring we can deliver on our customers' expectations. In accordance with the guidance provided by both the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we established safety measures, including social distancing and work-from-home guidelines for positions that can be performed remotely. In addition, we increased our focus on employee mental health during the pandemic by providing employees with mental health resources and enhanced Employee Assistance Programs.
 
Education
 
We firmly believe that investing in the education of our employees is critical to our success. Our employees are provided access to a robust learning management system that offers hundreds of courses on various topics ranging from compliance to leadership and for job-specific skills. In 2021, excluding Hubs, employees spent an average of 14 hours per employee in training sessions. We provide an Educational Assistance Program for employees, which offers financial assistance for both professional and personal development to inspire employees to continuously enhance their skills and knowledge. We have a customized leadership development program designed for current and aspiring managers in search of developing their leadership skills. The program provides training on topics that are aligned with our Leadership Principles and our Core Values.
 
In order to ensure our industry remains robust, we are committed to supporting Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) programs in the cities where we have facilities. Through the Protolabs Foundation, we provide STEM education grants to eligible organizations. In addition, we partner with schools, colleges and universities to provide various outreach opportunities and sponsorships.

Charitable Giving
 
We pride ourselves in being a responsible corporate citizen through our Protolabs Foundation. We support several charitable causes with our Employee Matching, Cool Ideas, and Major Gifts Programs. The Foundation’s efforts serve as a sustaining investment in the future of the communities where our employees live and work, and also a commitment to build talent to support the future employment needs of the manufacturing industry. ProtoGivers, our employee led community involvement team, organizes a wide variety of charitable activities, including blood drives, working for Habitat for Humanity projects, volunteering for Feed My Starving Children, and making financial contributions to charitable causes, many of which are matched through the Protolabs Foundation Employee Giving Program. Our financial support and our community outreach programs are intended to improve the quality of life in the communities where we have facilities.
Environment
 
We are committed to having a positive impact on the environment. In 2021, we were awarded a Manufacturing Leadership Award from the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) in the Sustainability Leadership category. This category recognizes companies embracing manufacturing processes that are non-polluting, conserve energy and natural resources, and are economically sound and safe for employees, communities, and consumers. In 2020, we installed nearly 1,900 solar panels on the roof of our facility in Plymouth, MN, one of our larger manufacturing facilities. The solar array will cover 20 percent of our future energy use and will offset the equivalent of 1.3 million pounds of CO2 and preserve 775 acres of forest annually.
 
We strive to maximize recycling in both our manufacturing and office facilities. In our manufacturing facilities, we recycle metal, plastic and water used throughout the manufacturing processes. Finally, the Green Team, an employee-led organization, educates our employees on how they can positively impact the environment, both at work and at home.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We regard our patents, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, trade secrets, copyrights, domain names and other intellectual property as valuable to our business and rely on patent, trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, vendors and others to protect our proprietary rights. We register our patents, trademarks and service marks in the United States and other jurisdictions as we deem appropriate. As of December 31, 2021, we owned and had applications pending for patents relating to various aspects of our quoting and manufacturing processes as follows:

Jurisdiction | Issued Patents | Applications Pending
---------------+----------------+---------------------
United States | 25 | 14 
United Kingdom | 2 | 0 



Our patents have expiration dates ranging from 2022 to 2038. We also owned approximately 27 registered United States trademarks or service marks as of December 31, 2021, with corresponding registered protection in Europe and Japan for the most important of these marks such as PROTO LABS, PROTOMOLD, FIRSTCUT, PROTOQUOTE, FIRSTQUOTE, PROTOFLOW and FINELINE, corresponding approved protection in Canada for PROTO LABS, FIRSTCUT and FINELINE, and corresponding registered protection in Australia, Canada and Mexico for PROTOMOLD. There can be no assurance that the steps we take to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate or that third parties will not infringe or misappropriate such rights. We have been subject to claims and expect to be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. In particular, we may face claims from third parties that we have infringed their patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights. Such claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.
