Item 1. Business
 We are a commercial-stage medical technology company focused on developing, manufacturing, and commercializing minimally invasive solutions to meet the distinct uterine healthcare needs of women. We have established a broad product line of commercially available, minimally invasive alternatives to hysterectomy, which are designed to address the most common causes of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in most uterine anatomies. Our solutions can be used in a variety of medical treatment settings and aim to address the drawbacks associated with alternative treatment methods and to preserve the uterus by avoiding unnecessary hysterectomies.
There is a significant body of peer reviewed literature that we believe validates the clinical performance of our solutions and supports the ability of our products to meaningfully improve the quality of life for women suffering from AUB. The short- and long-term safety and effectiveness of our endometrial ablation systems, which have obtained approval through the premarket approval application (PMA) process, have been evaluated in multiple clinical trials that had sites audited by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) estimates that one-third of women will seek treatment for AUB. This represents nearly 18 million women of the approximately 55 million women in the 25 to 50 age group in the United States. In addition to the existing patient population with AUB, we estimate that approximately 750,000 women in the United States suffering from AUB enter the 25 to 50 age group each year, representing a potential annual recurring market opportunity of over $900 million. We are well positioned to serve this patient population and we believe that our solutions have the potential to further change the treatment paradigm and become the standard of care for AUB.
AUB is caused by a variety of factors and is characterized by menstrual blood loss in excess of 80 milliliters (ml) per menstrual cycle, which is two to three times the average blood loss during a normal menstrual cycle. These factors include structural causes within the uterus, such as fibroids and polyps, and non-structural causes, such as hormonal imbalances. AUB can have a significant impact on a woman’s quality of life. Women suffering from AUB typically need to change their sanitary products every two hours or less and pass blood clots the size of a quarter or larger. When left untreated, AUB can stop women from engaging in ordinary daily activities during menstruation, which interferes with their family, social, personal, and professional lives. Prolonged bleeding can result in fatigue and, in extreme cases, anemia.
Treatment for AUB is dependent on a number of factors, including the underlying cause of AUB, the patient’s desire for future fertility, and the anatomy of the uterine cavity. The current treatment pathway for patients suffering from AUB typically begins with medical management or drug therapy, to help manage symptoms. When drug therapies are not effective or side effects are intolerable, patients may progress to surgical management, such as endometrial ablation for non-structural causes, or tissue resection for structural causes. If endometrial ablation or tissue resection fail or are contraindicated, physicians may recommend a hysterectomy. While tissue resection preserves fertility, endometrial ablation and hysterectomy are only an option for patients for whom childbearing is complete.
Our devices are designed to provide minimally invasive and clinically validated options for women suffering from AUB and significantly improve a woman’s quality of life, while avoiding unnecessary hysterectomies. Our acquisition of a suite of intrauterine health assets from Boston Scientific Corporation (BSC) in May 2020 enables us to offer a broad suite of products for procedures that address structural and non-structural causes of AUB in most uterine anatomies. Our devices are utilized by obstetrician-gynecologists (OB/GYNs) across a variety of medical treatment settings, including hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs), and physician offices.
Our broad suite of solutions is comprised of the following:
•Minerva ES Endometrial Ablation System (Minerva ES) is a PMA-approved endometrial ablation device that utilizes our proprietary PlasmaSense technology, which is designed to dynamically direct plasma energy with real-time power modulation and to enable complete and uniform depth of ablation. This device showed clinical performance that exceeded an Objective Performance Criteria (OPC) developed by the FDA using clinical trial efficacy data from five previously FDA-approved endometrial ablation systems; 
 •Genesys HTA Endometrial Ablation System (Genesys HTA) is a PMA-approved endometrial ablation device, complementary to our Minerva ES, that is designed to deliver heated saline ablation under continuous, real-time, direct hysteroscopic visualization, and to enable treatment of a wider range of uterine cavities, including those with irregular sizes or shapes; 
 •Symphion Tissue Removal System (Symphion) is a minimally invasive uterine tissue removal system, components of which were authorized through the 510(k) clearance or received de novoclassification from the FDA, that combines bladeless tissue resection and coagulation, continuous visualization, and intrauterine pressure monitoring. These features enable efficient tissue removal while reducing patient risk due to fluid intravasation overload by utilizing a self-contained, recirculating distension fluid management system; and 


•Resectr Tissue Resection Device (Resectr) is an FDA-cleared handheld surgical instrument designed to enable the hysteroscopic removal and diagnosis of endometrial polyps, utilizing an oscillating cutting blade, and be compatible with existing fluid management systems, wall suction and hysteroscopes. 
 
We believe our solutions can provide the following important benefits:
•Improved quality of life. Our solutions are designed to eliminate the pain and life disruption of unwanted, excessive menstrual bleeding;
 •Enhanced patient safety. Our proprietary safety enhancements are designed to reduce the potential complications associated with other endometrial ablation and tissue resection alternatives;
 •Favorable clinical outcomes. The clinical performance of our PMA-approved products has been evaluated in numerous clinical research studies, demonstrating high rates of procedural success driven by our continued technological innovation; 
 •Intuitive design and procedural ergonomics. Our products are designed to offer easy setup and intuitive operation, which we believe enables a rapid learning curve and fast adoption by physicians; and 
 •Increased patient comfort and convenience. Our minimally invasive solutions are engineered to maximize the patient’s experience by reducing procedure and recovery times. 
 The safety and effectiveness of our Minerva endometrial ablation system were evaluated in two clinical studies, the Minerva Single-Arm Study (Single-Arm Study) and the Minerva Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT), which collectively evaluated 263 patients enrolled at clinical centers in the United States, Canada, Hungary, and Mexico. The results from these two studies served as the basis for FDA approval of our PMA in July 2015 and the results of the Single-Arm Study and RCT were published in the Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology. The safety, effectiveness, and clinical benefits of the Genesys HTA were evaluated in a pivotal clinical trial, which included 276 patients enrolled in clinical centers in the United States. The results from this trial served as the basis for the FDA approval of this PMA in April 2001, with Genesys HTA having met all of its primary and secondary safety and effectiveness endpoints. Our Genesys HTA system has subsequently been evaluated in a large number of clinical research studies. The published results and decades of physician use have been consistent with, and we believe have supported, the validity of the data derived from the original PMA clinical study.
We market and sell our products through a direct sales force in the United States. Our target customer base includes approximately 19,000 OB/GYNs practicing in hospitals, ASCs, and physician offices. As of June December 31, 2021, our commercial team consisted of approximately 90 field-based personnel that call on OB/GYNs in all major U.S. markets. Our sales and marketing programs focus on educating physicians regarding the use of our products and on providing materials to help them educate their patients about our procedures. We also provide online patient-oriented educational materials about AUB and our products and procedures, which patients may use to consider and then discuss treatment options with their physicians.
Third-party coverage and reimbursement for endometrial ablation and tissue resection procedures performed in a hospital, ASC, or physician office setting are well established in the United States. These procedures are routinely covered and reimbursed by private healthcare insurance, managed care payors, and government healthcare programs. In the United States, the procedures using our products are billed by these healthcare facilities and providers using established Category I Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes.
Our research and development team evaluates new product opportunities, product enhancements, and alternative applications of our proprietary technology. For example, our team is currently focused on evaluating options to expand our Symphion product line in order to provide a broader set of compatible solutions for our Symphion controller that will provide additional procedure solutions at a number of different price points. We intend to leverage our core technologies to develop and expand our product offerings through development of new products and technologies, subject to marketing clearance or approval, as well as improvement of our existing portfolio of products and acquisition of complementary products.
Our success factors
We are focused on treating AUB with device-enabled solutions that are minimally invasive and designed to improve a woman’s quality of life, while avoiding unnecessary hysterectomies. We believe the continued growth of our company will be driven by the following success factors:
•Targeting a large and under-penetrated market opportunity. ACOG estimates that one-third of women will seek treatment for AUB. This represents nearly 18 million women of the approximately 55 million women in the 25 to 50 age group in the United States. In addition to the existing patient population with AUB, we estimate that approximately 750,000 women in the United States that will suffer from AUB enter the 25 to 50 age group each year, representing a potential annual recurring market opportunity of over $900 million. We are well-positioned to serve this patient population. 


•Broadening our suite of innovative and proprietary minimally invasive solutions focused on women’s intrauterine health. We have established a broad product line of commercially available, minimally invasive alternatives to hysterectomy, which are indicated for use in procedures that treat the most common causes of AUB in most uterine anatomies. Our products can be used in a variety of medical treatment settings and aim to address the major drawbacks associated with device-based alternatives, reduce risks of non-adherence to drug treatments, and preserve the uterus by avoiding unnecessary hysterectomies. We believe our solutions represent a significant competitive advantage and have the potential to further change the treatment paradigm and become the standard of care for AUB. 
 •Compelling body of clinical evidence. There is a significant body of peer-reviewed literature supporting the safety and effectiveness of endometrial ablation and hysteroscopic tissue resection as treatment modalities for AUB. Clinical performance of our products has been validated and the results have been published in approximately 100 peer-reviewed publications, including, among others, in the Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology. We believe that the short- and long-term safety and effectiveness of our PMA approved products have been validated through multiple randomized controlled clinical trials that have had sites audited by the FDA. We believe our body of high-quality clinical evidence demonstrates the strong value proposition of our products and will continue to support increased adoption of our entire suite of solutions. 
 •Comprehensive and targeted approach to market development and patient engagement. We have established a systematic approach to market development that centers on active engagement with hospitals, physicians, and patients. Our target customer base includes approximately 19,000 OB/GYNs practicing in hospitals, ASCs, and physician offices. Our direct sales organization is focused on prioritizing high volume OB/GYN centers and in building long-standing relationships with key physicians. Our sales force works closely with physicians to incorporate our solution as a new service by reiterating the clinical efficacy and procedural benefits of our products. We support these physicians through all aspects of education, surgical support, and patient follow-up. We further build upon this approach with patient-oriented marketing materials and direct-to-consumer marketing initiatives to help educate patients on AUB and our procedures. We believe that our approach to engagement across multiple constituents will drive increased awareness of, and demand for, our products. In addition, we believe that our broad product portfolio is naturally supportive of our marketing efforts, as we seek to continue to extend our relationships with hospitals and physicians. 
 •Continued favorable insurance coverage and established inpatient and outpatient reimbursement. In the United States, the procedures using our products are routinely covered and reimbursed by third-party payors, including private healthcare insurance, managed care payors and government healthcare programs. Healthcare facilities, including hospitals and ASCs, and physicians use established Category I CPT codes to bill for the procedures using our products. We believe that current reimbursement in the United States is generally sufficient to cover the costs of the procedure and related patient care, including the costs of our products. 
 •Robust technical and engineering expertise, supported by our broad strategic intellectual property portfolio. We believe our products incorporate significant technological advancements in gynecologic surgery over the prior generation of endometrial ablation products. Development of our solutions requires a unique combination of expertise in engineering, product and software design, and women’s health. Our technical capabilities and commitment to innovation support a compelling opportunity to advance new technologies and enhance our products, which we believe will continue to differentiate our position.

We believe our pipeline initiatives, if successfully developed and cleared or approved, will result in increased access to our products by physicians, who will be able to perform a broader range of procedures using our surgical products, thereby increasing the total number of procedures performed and growing our addressable market. 
 •Leveraging our clinical success to increase utilization and penetration among existing accounts and to expand into new international markets. We intend to leverage our clinical success to deepen and expand the relationships we have with our existing and newly acquired accounts. Our suite of minimally invasive devices has been designed to provide ease-of-use, which we believe offers a compelling value proposition for hospitals, physicians, and patients. While our current commercial focus is on the large opportunity within the United States, we plan to evaluate expanding into select international markets.
 Our market and industry
AUB is a prevalent and debilitating condition that significantly impacts the quality of life of millions of women in the United States. ACOG estimates that one-third of women will seek treatment for AUB, which would represent approximately 18 million women of the 55 million women between the ages of 25 to 50 in the U.S., as of 2019. In addition to the existing patient population with AUB, we estimate that approximately 750,000 women in the U.S. that will suffer from AUB enter the 25 to 50 age group each year, representing a potential annual recurring market opportunity of over $900 million. We believe we are well-positioned to serve this patient population and that our solutions have the potential to further change the treatment paradigm and become the standard of care for AUB in patients that are not contraindicated for endometrial ablation. The Minerva ES and Genesys HTA, like all endometrial ablation products, are contraindicated in certain patients, including, but not limited to, those who are pregnant or who want to become pregnant in the future.
Menstruation
Menstruation is the monthly shedding of the endometrium, or the lining of a woman’s uterus. The endometrium is made up of two layers, the functional layer and the basal layer, and each month in preparation for a possible pregnancy, the basal layer generates a new functional layer. If a woman is not pregnant, the functional layer sheds and the period during which the functional layer is shed is referred to as menstruation. The shedding of this functional layer results in menstrual bleeding, which normally lasts from four to seven days and results in average blood loss of 30 ml per menstrual cycle. The entire menstrual cycle normally occurs within a 21-to 35-day period and the basal layer begins to regenerate a new functional layer in preparation for the next menstrual cycle. The normal

menstrual cycle begins at the onset of menstruation, which typically occurs around the age of 12, and continues through the onset of menopause, which typically occurs around the age of 51.
Overview of AUB
AUB is characterized by menstrual blood loss in excess of 80 ml per menstrual cycle, which is two to three times the average blood loss during a normal menstrual cycle. Women who suffer from AUB typically experience a menstrual cycle that is shorter than the normal 21-to 35-day cycle, and often bleed for eight or more days during each menstrual cycle. AUB can have a significant impact on a woman’s quality of life. Women suffering from AUB typically need to change their sanitary products every two hours or less and pass blood clots the size of a quarter or larger. When left untreated, AUB can keep women from engaging in ordinary daily activities during menstruation, which interferes with their family, social, personal, and professional lives. Prolonged bleeding can result in fatigue and, in extreme cases, anemia. AUB is caused by a variety of factors, including hormone imbalances and the presence of pathologies in the uterus, such as fibroids and polyps.
We believe that while the prevalence of fibroids and polyps is known to vary as a function of patient age and race, during the span between ages 25 and 50, the overall distribution between structural and non-structural causes is approximately equal. In 2011, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) introduced the PALM-COEIN classification system to establish the causality behind AUB. This classification is based on clinical- and imaging-based stratification into the structural (PALM) and non-structural causes (COEIN) of AUB:
•PALM (Polyp, Adenomyosis, Leiomyoma, and Malignancy and hyperplasia): PALM describes the structural causes of AUB, which can be diagnosed by imaging or histopathological evaluation. Among the structural causes of AUB, endometrial polyps and leiomyomas, or uterine fibroids, are most common. Endometrial polyps are hyperplastic overgrowths of cells in the endometrium, which are typically noncancerous, and are often seen in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Uterine fibroids are noncancerous growths of the smooth muscle tissue of the uterus that often appear during childbearing years, and are the most common pelvic tumor in women.
 •COEIN (Coagulopathy, Ovulatory dysfunction, Endometrial dysfunction, Iatrogenic and Not yet classified): COEIN describes the non-structural causes of AUB, which cannot be diagnosed by imaging because identifiable structures that cause the bleeding are absent. As such, diagnosis depends on the patient’s medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. Endometrial dysfunction is prevalent among the non-structural causes of AUB and is considered after exclusion of structural causes.
 The diagram below depicts a woman’s reproductive system and possible structural causes of AUB:
    

Existing treatments and their limitations
 Treatment for AUB is dependent on a number of factors, including the underlying cause of AUB, the patient’s desire for future fertility, and the anatomy of the uterine cavity. The current treatment pathway for patients suffering from AUB typically begins with medical management or drug therapy, to help manage symptoms. When drug therapies are not effective or where the side effects are intolerable, patients may progress to surgical management, such as endometrial ablation for non-structural causes, or tissue resection for structural causes. If endometrial ablation or tissue resection fail, or are contraindicated, physicians may recommend a hysterectomy, where the uterus is surgically removed. While tissue resection preserves fertility, endometrial ablation and hysterectomy are only an option for patients for whom childbearing is complete.
 Drug therapy. Drug therapy has traditionally been the initial treatment for AUB. Hormonal drugs, such as estrogen-progestin oral contraceptives and drug eluting intrauterine devices (IUDs), are most commonly used to alter the normal menstrual cycle with the objective of reducing bleeding, menstrual pain, or cramps, and provide contraception, if needed. When effective, the patient is typically required to continue drug therapy until menopause. Use of drug therapy can present increased risks and is not recommended for women who smoke, have diabetes with vascular involvement, a history of cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, or an elevated risk of thrombosis. Many women being treated with hormonal drugs also experience side effects such as hot flashes, nausea,

weight gain, mood swings, and depression, as well as other longer-term side effects. For these reasons, we believe many women are reluctant to continue long-term drug therapy.
 Endometrial ablation. First-and second-generation endometrial ablation procedures are less invasive, surgical alternatives to a hysterectomy that ablate the endometrium and underlying basal layer.
 •First-generation procedures. Historically, these procedures have required pre-treatment to thin the endometrium, such as a drug treatment several weeks in advance of the treatment, or a surgical procedure the day of treatment. During treatment, the uterus is distended through the use of hypotonic fluid, a hysteroscope, and a resectoscopic electrosurgical instrument, such as a rollerball or wire loop, or a laser, to ablate the endometrium and underlying basal layer. This is a procedure that takes approximately thirty minutes, is typically performed under general anesthesia, and requires a high level of surgical skill; therefore, it is rarely performed today. First-generation procedures can result in significant adverse events, including uterine perforation, which can cause damage to the bowel and other organs, and hemorrhaging of uterine blood vessels. Other reported complications include infections, thermal injuries, and hyponatremia (an excessive absorption of fluids), any of which can lead to seizures, congestive heart failure, brain damage, or death.
 •Second-generation procedures. These procedures are non-resectoscopic treatments, including those performed with the Minerva ES and Genesys HTA, which were developed to address many of the limitations, complications, and costs related to drug and first-generation surgical therapies. In general, these treatments use a surgical device that is inserted trans-vaginally, and through the cervical canal into the uterus to deliver energy to the uterine cavity and concurrently ablate (destroy) the entire endometrium and the underlying basal layer in a single treatment cycle. Other than the Minerva ES, commercially available devices use a single energy source, such as radiofrequency energy, cryogenic, or direct thermal conduction, each of which have shortcomings that can limit their efficacy. The leading competitor utilizes a coarse metallic mesh to deliver energy to the endometrial wall. This material can present surgical complications, such as the metallic mesh sticking to the ablated uterine tissue. Second-generation procedures are faster, require less general anesthesia or pre-treatment and, in most cases, allow for reduced complication rates when compared to first-generation procedures. However, the potential for complications still exists, including perforation of the uterus, thermal injury to adjacent tissue and organs, hemorrhaging, and infection.
 •Hysteroscopic tissue removal. Hysteroscopic tissue removal is a mechanical approach for polyp or uterine fibroid resection performed under local or general anesthesia, using a hysteroscope and distension fluid for direct visualization inside the uterus. This procedure is frequently implemented as the first-line approach for the surgical management of structural causes of AUB; however, there are significant complications to this procedure, including uncontrolled bleeding, infection, fluid overload, and perforation of the uterus. These limitations are inherent to the fundamental design of hysteroscopic tissue removal systems, in which a “cold-knife” approach is used to mechanically resect the tissue without the capability to control bleeding, thereby compromising the procedure safety and extending the procedure and anesthesia time. In addition, older systems require the use of multiple three-liter bags of distension fluid as well as additional equipment for strict fluid deficit accountability and management. This latter requirement is necessary to avoid patient injury, can be difficult for adjunct nursing personnel, and can result in higher overall procedure cost.
 •Hysterectomy. Hysterectomy, or surgical removal of the uterus, is performed when a patient has not responded to drug therapy or less invasive surgical procedures, or the patient is not a candidate for such procedures. Hysterectomy surgery must be performed under general anesthesia and typically requires from 90 minutes to several hours to complete. Patients then typically require approximately three days of hospitalization and six to eight weeks of recovery time prior to resumption of normal activities. Hysterectomy can result in serious complications, including blood clots, excessive blood loss, damage to adjacent organs, infection, and death. Additionally, hysterectomy can also result in significant long-term complications, including urinary infections and incontinence, loss of sexual desire, chronic constipation, fatigue, and psychological depression.
 Our broad suite of endometrial ablation and tissue resection devices are utilized in procedures that address the most common causes of AUB in most uterine anatomies. We have commercialized advanced devices that we believe have the potential to reduce risks of non-adherence to drug therapies, address several of the limitations associated with other device-based alternatives and preserve the uterus by avoiding unnecessary hysterectomies. We believe our broad portfolio of products can be used in a variety of medical treatment settings and has the potential to further transform the treatment paradigm and become the standard of care for women suffering from AUB.

Key benefits for patients and healthcare providers
Our goal is to become the clinical leader in the treatment of AUB. We believe that our AUB solutions offer the following benefits:
•Improved quality of life. Our solutions are designed to improve the quality of life for millions of women suffering from AUB by eliminating the pain and life disruption of unwanted, excessive menstrual bleeding and reducing the rate of unnecessary hysterectomies. Our flagship product, the Minerva endometrial ablation system, has received noteworthy patient satisfaction scores, as compared to traditional rollerball treatment methods, as part of our clinical studies. In our Single-Arm Study, the overall patient satisfaction with the procedure was approximately 98%, 97%, and 99% at 12-, 24-, and 36-months follow-up, respectively. Nearly 99% of the patients stated that they maybe or definitely would recommend the Minerva procedure to a friend or a relative at 12 months, and 100% reported that they maybe or definitely would recommend the Minerva procedure at 24 and 36 months.
 •Enhanced patient safety. The proprietary safety enhancements of our solutions were designed to reduce the procedural risks associated with endometrial ablation and tissue resection. For example, our Symphion features bladeless resecting and on-demand spot coagulation designed to reduce risk of intra-operative bleeding. It also features an innovative fluid management system that is designed to detect a uterine perforation, prevent distension media overload, and automatically regulate the flow of fluid to help prevent uterine cavity collapse. In addition, our Minerva ES uses a patented two-stage uterine integrity test (UIT) featuring CO2 extension tubes that extend along the entire length of the soft, silicone array, enhancing detection of uterine perforations. 
 •Favorable clinical outcomes. Our PMA-approved products have been clinically evaluated for their potential to improve clinical outcomes in treating AUB. In our Single-Arm Study, the Minerva endometrial ablation system demonstrated a statistically significantly greater success rate at one-year follow-up, compared to the OPC. Additionally, in our Single-Arm Study, the Minerva endometrial ablation system resulted in a hysterectomy rate of 0.9% after 36 months. 
 •Intuitive design and procedural ergonomics. We believe the intuitive and ergonomic design of our solutions enables a rapid learning curve and fast adoption of our products across a wide range of medical treatment settings, including the hospital, ASCs, and physician offices. These attributes may also enable the acceleration of our minimally invasive solutions used in lower acuity treatment settings. 
 •Increased patient comfort and convenience. Our minimally invasive solutions are engineered to improve the patient’s experience by reducing procedure and recovery times. Our Minerva ES cervical sealing balloon produces a tight cervical seal that minimizes CO2 leakage, streamlining the treatment to reduce procedure time to approximately three minutes. It also features a soft, silicone array which minimizes the array sticking to uterine tissue and therefore reduces related discomfort 


during insertion and eases removal of the device. Procedures using our products are typically done on an outpatient basis with patients reporting that they are able to resume normal activities within a day.
Minerva ES
Our endometrial ablation system received PMA approval in July 2015 to ablate the endometrial lining of the uterus in pre-menopausal women with menorrhagia (excessive menstrual bleeding) due to benign causes for whom childbearing is complete. The Minerva ES features a disposable handpiece and a controller to deliver plasma energy to ablate the endometrial lining of the uterus. The Minerva ES treatment is a short procedure lasting approximately three minutes, which is performed on an outpatient basis or in-office setting, reducing the need for general anesthesia. Patients typically recover quickly and have reported that they are able to resume normal activities within a day.
The below image depicts our Minerva ES Endometrial Ablation System:


a.Minerva ES handpiece: Ergonomic and easy-to-use single-use handpiece.
 b.System controller: Continuously monitors tissue impedance (50 times per second), decreasing energy output in real time for a tailored ablation customized to each individual patient. 
 c.Cervical sealing balloon: Conforms to the cervix for a hands-free, reliable seal at the uterine opening.
 d.Plasma Formation Array (PFA): Soft silicone array opens without excessive manipulation or seating, and is designed to help prevent tissue from sticking to the array. 
 e.Activated PFA: Argon gas contained in the array is ionized to create plasma that seeks out least ablated tissue. 
 Our slender, single-use handpiece features an ergonomically designed handle, a cervical sealing balloon, a cervical sheath, and a PFA. The PFA is a soft and stretchable silicone membrane that allows easy insertion, deployment, and removal from the uterine cavity. It is designed to ablate uterine tissue to an appropriate and uniform depth, independent of the thickness of the endometrium. The Minerva ES is a low-power system and does not utilize a coarse metallic mesh, which we believe reduces potential for complications related to the array sticking to uterine tissue.
The Minerva ES controller uses our proprietary PlasmaSense technology to customize energy output and consistently deliver the optimal dose of power by continuously adjusting it during the procedure in real time as a function of the many variables unique to

each individual uterine cavity. This bi-polar RF system generates a high voltage electrical field to ionize high purity argon gas, which is a common element in our atmosphere, turning it into plasma energy. This hot plasma heats the PFA silicone membrane to both ablate the tissue it contacts and also heat any intra-cavitary fluids, that then ablate areas of the uterine cavity not in direct contact with the PFA. As tissue is ablated, resistance, or impedance, of the tissue increases. Our PlasmaSense technology continuously monitors impedance throughout the uterine cavity (50 times per second) to dynamically direct plasma energy to the least ablated tissue as measured by areas of lowest impedance. As the ablation cycle progresses, the area of tissue still requiring ablation becomes smaller. Our PlasmaSense technology dynamically reduces the total power dosage in an effort to prevent the uterine cavity from being overwhelmed with energy. This modulated power dosage allows for a uniform depth and complete ablation that is customized to each individual patient. The below images depict the modulated power dose from the plasma initiation phase to treatment completion:



Our PlasmaSense technology is able to respond in real-time to the ablation progression unique to each uterine cavity. Our leading competitor is a conventional RF energy-based endometrial ablation system, which use a fixed power level, calculated by multiplying the pre-measured surface area of the uterine cavity by 5.5 watts to determine the power level needed for patient of such cavity size. Once determined, this power level is constant and does not change during the length of the ablation procedure.
The Novasure device provides up to approximately 180 watts of RF energy, with the actual power determined by the size of the uterine cavity. The below images depict our power level and the real-time dynamic change in power level compared to the fixed, constant power employed by the Novasure device in a typical endometrial ablation procedure for a uterine cavity that is 6 cm in length and 4 cm in width.
   
Minerva ES—Dynamic Power | Novasure—Static Power

 
In addition to the real-time dynamic change in power level, use of our PlasmaSense technology results in much less total energy being delivered to the patient, where total energy is the product of power and time and is represented by the purple area under each of the power curves in the charts depicted above. In the case of these two graphs, as an example, the total amount of energy delivered to the patient during a Minerva ES procedure is approximately one-third of what is used by the leading competitor.
 Indications for use
The Minerva ES is indicated for ablation of the endometrial lining of the uterus in pre-menopausal women with menorrhagia (excessive uterine bleeding) due to benign causes for whom childbearing is complete.

Genesys HTA
Our time-tested Genesys HTA is a software-controlled hysteroscopic thermal endometrial ablation system that consists of an operational unit and a sterile procedure set. The Genesys HTA utilizes heated saline that is circulated throughout the interior of the uterus to ablate the endometrial lining. This method of ablation enables the treatment of non-structural causes of AUB in women, including those with a uterus of irregular shape or size, or with unusual anatomical features. The Genesys HTA treatment was designed to be quick, safe, and effective and provides the user with real-time visualization during the ablation cycle. Our Genesys HTA procedure is performed on an outpatient basis, reducing the need for general anesthesia. Patients typically recover quickly and have reported that they are able to resume normal activities within a day. The combination of our Minerva ES and Genesys HTA systems enables us to treat non-structural causes of AUB in a broad population of women.
The below image depicts our Genesys HTA Endometrial Ablation System:


a.Genesys HTA handpiece: Ergonomic and easy-to-use single-use handpiece. 
 b.ProCerva procedure sheath: Maintains a complete cervical seal, which is verified before procedure initiation and monitored during the ablation cycle. 
 c.Tapered “sieve” tip: Aids in debris handling and helps prevent clogging of device or tubing. 
 d.Controller: Displays step-by-step instructions and real-time procedure information, including time, temperature, and fluid loss monitoring.
 e.Cassette: Compact, disposable component that heats, filters, and controls fluid flow. 
 f.Hysteroscope*: Engineered for continuous direct visualization to enable treatment of a wider range of uterine cavities. *The hysteroscope is not included in the product offering, but available to physician offices. 


Our Genesys HTA was designed for direct visualization and intuitive operation to deliver a versatile treatment for AUB. This system features a controller, intuitive graphical user interface, an adjustable-height pedestal, and a fixed-length intravenous fluid pole. Information on the display screen guides the user through each step, allowing for rapid set-up and procedural efficiency. The disposable procedure set was designed for ease-of-use and includes a cassette, a procedure sheath, and a drainage bag.
The Genesys HTA features a proprietary method of ablation that utilizes free-flowing heated saline that conforms to each patient’s uniquely shaped uterine cavity, thereby providing consistent treatment across most uterine shapes and sizes. Fluid is circulated by an impeller pump at 50 to 60 mmHg of pressure. The motor speed is preset and not adjustable by the user to ensure consistency. Fluid heating is regulated by our microprocessor-based controller and occurs in the disposable cassette via a heater with temperature sensors. Fluid temperature in the cassette is shown on the user-friendly display screen during heating, ablation, and cooling phases of the procedure.
Indications for use
The Genesys HTA is a hysteroscopic thermal ablation device indicated for ablation of the endometrial lining of the uterus in premenopausal women with menorrhagia (excessive uterine bleeding) due to benign causes for whom childbearing is complete.
Symphion
The Symphion was designed to transform the way OB/GYNs remove uterine tissue. The Symphion consists of a controller, a disposable fluid management system, an endoscope, and a disposable resecting device. To our knowledge, the Symphion is the only minimally invasive solution to include three proprietary innovations that work as one. It combines bladeless resection and coagulation with novel recirculating fluid management and pressure monitoring technologies to provide OB/GYNs with what we believe is a differentiated surgical experience. The minimally invasive procedure performed with the Symphion requires no incisions. The procedure is performed on an outpatient basis, during which minimal anesthesia is administered, and patients have reported that they are able to resume normal activities within one to two days. The Symphion is a fully integrated solution for resection and coagulation of uterine tissue designed to facilitate viewing with a hysteroscope during diagnostic and operative hysteroscopy. It also provides fluid management through the closed loop, recirculation of filtered distension fluid, which reduces patient risk for fluid intravasation overload. Based on the clinical research efforts to date, the Symphion technologic and procedural features may allow for reduction of the risk of complications and shortening recovery time.
Our Symphion uses a proprietary radio-frequency (RF) plasma cutting technology instead of mechanical cutting blades. The device is designed with a rounded end to reduce the risk of uterine perforation and features spot coagulation, which is unique to the Symphion. This feature allows the OB/GYNs to control bleeding and maintain adequate visualization during the procedure thereby enhancing the safety profile of the procedure. To our knowledge, it is the only system to directly monitor intrauterine pressure from inside the uterus and automatically regulate the flow of fluid to help prevent cavity collapse and maintain visibility.

The below image depicts our Symphion Tissue Removal System:
   
a.Disposable saline bag: One 3-liter saline bag volumetrically limits fluid overload. The system is intuitively designed to use no more than 2,500 ml of saline to reduce the possibility of fluid overload via intravasation and facilitates improved surgical workflow for nurses. 
 b.Fluid management accessories: Closed loop system that filters saline using a 0.005 micron molecular filter, limits fluid absorption, and enables continuous, clear visualization of the cavity.
 c.Controller: Integrated controller combines seamless resection and fluid management control in one system. 
 d.Foot switch: Integrated foot switch designed for OB/GYN’s ease-of-use that features a button to turn on fluid circulation, a yellow pedal to activate resection, and a blue pedal to activate spot coagulation to control bleeding for a clear and consistent view throughout the procedure. 
 e.Resection device: 3.6 mm resection device designed to enhance resection rate and efficiency. The technology features a bi-polar energized blade to allow for seamless resection of a wide spectrum of tissue types independent of their size and hardness. Additionally, the resection device features coagulation technology designed to minimize blood loss. 
 f.Hysteroscope: 6.3 mm hysteroscope has four separate channels designed to address the common challenges of surgery: visibility, uterine cavity collapse, inadequate aspiration, and the ability to directly monitor uterine pressure. 


The below image depicts in more detail the key features of our proprietary resection device and hysteroscope:

 Indications for use
The Symphion is indicated to distend the uterus by filling it with saline to facilitate viewing with a hysteroscope during diagnostic and operating hysteroscopy and provide fluid management through the closed loop recirculation of filtered distension fluid. It is also intended for resection and coagulation of uterine tissue, such as intrauterine polyps and myomas, using a bipolar resecting device.
Resectr
 Resectr is an easy-to-use, minimally invasive surgical device used in hysteroscopic polypectomies providing OB/GYNs the ability to remove multiple polyps under direct visualization with one entry into the uterus. Resectr comes in two different sizes and provides the OB/GYN with a cost effective and highly functional tool for treating very common structural causes of AUB. Tissue removal with the Resectr device is a simple, minimally invasive surgical procedure that does not require hospitalization and, in many cases, can be completed in a doctor’s office for both comfort and convenience.
When using Resectr, OB/GYNs are able to both see and treat polyps that may need to be removed. Resectr is an oscillating resection device that works with existing fluid management systems, uterine wall suction, and hysteroscopes. Each resecting blade is bi-directional, internally rotating, and oscillating, to provide six rotations per handle squeeze and release cycle.

The below image depicts our Resectr Tissue Resection Device:


a.Ergonomic handle: Designed to alleviate tension and pressure on the user’s hands. 
 b.Rotating cannula: Ergonomic and intuitively designed to allow OB/GYNs the ability to position viewing window without rotating their hand. 
 c.Outflow port: Works with existing fluid management system, wall suction, and hysteroscopes. 
 d.Sheath: Available in 1.65 mm / 5 French OD (5Fr) and 3 mm / 9 French OD (9Fr) diameters for increased surgical flexibility. 
 e.Resection blade: Bi-directional blade, internally rotating and oscillating, to provide six rotations per handle squeeze and cycle release. Features drive-by-wire design to allow for continuous removal of tissue during resection. 
 Indication for use
The Resectr is indicated for intrauterine use by physicians trained in hysteroscopy to resect and remove tissue, including focal lesions such as endometrial polyps.
Our clinical results and studies
 OB/GYNs practice evidence-based medicine and rely on clinical data when making decisions to treat their patients suffering from AUB. We have developed a substantial body of clinical data, many of which have been published in peer-reviewed specialty journals. We believe our body of clinical evidence supports the safety and effectiveness of our PMA-approved products and strengthens our ability to facilitate adoption of our Minerva ES and Genesys HTA.
Minerva
The safety, effectiveness, and clinical benefits of our Minerva endometrial ablation system were evaluated in two Company-sponsored clinical studies, the Minerva Single-Arm Study and the Minerva RCT, which collectively evaluated 263 patients enrolled at clinical centers in the United States, Canada, Hungary, and Mexico. The results from these studies served as the basis for the FDA approval of our PMA in July 2015 and the results from the Single-Arm Study and RCT were published in the Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology. In addition, several other abstracts have been published on the safety and clinical benefits of our Minerva ES.
Summary of Minerva Single-Arm Study
Our Single-Arm Study was a Company-sponsored prospective, multi-center, single-arm, international clinical study of female patients between 25 and 50 years of age diagnosed with menorrhagia, or excessive menstrual bleeding. A total of 110 patients were enrolled across seven investigational centers in Canada, Hungary, and Mexico. Menstrual diary scores were collected pre-operatively and

monthly for 12 months post-procedure. Long-term safety and effectiveness outcomes at 24 and 36 months were also collected for this study.
This investigation was designed as a single-arm study comparing the effectiveness of the Minerva endometrial ablation system with that of the FDA established objective performance criteria (OPC). The OPC was developed with input from industry and members of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Devices Panel. The OPC incorporated data from the pivotal clinical trials of the five approved endometrial ablation systems, which we refer to below as the OPC comparison group. These five studies were randomized, controlled trials that used the same active control, which was rollerball ablation, and had similar patient populations. The study sizes ranged from 260 patients to 322 patients, with either a 1:1 randomization or a 2:1 (device:control) randomization scheme. The primary endpoint was reduction in menstrual blood loss as assessed by a Pictoral Blood Loss Assessment Chart (PBLAC). The inclusion criteria required either a baseline PBLAC score of greater than 150 (four studies) or greater than 185 (one study), and individual patient success was defined as a PBLAC score of 75 or less at 12 months post-procedure. The intent-to-treat population consisted of all patients randomized for either the endometrial ablation device or rollerball ablation. Patients with missing PBLAC scores at 12 months were treated as failures. A study was considered a success if the proportion of successes in the endometrial ablation device group met a pre-specified non-inferiority margin compared to the proportion of successes in the rollerball ablation control group.
The analysis of success rates for the five previously approved endometrial ablation devices was performed and provided by the FDA. Based on this success rate data (Her Option, 67.4%; Hydro ThermAblator, 68.4%; MEA, 87%; NovaSure, 77.7%; ThermaChoice, 80.2%), the average success rate for the OPC was 75.6%, with lower and upper 95% confidence bounds of 65.6% and 83.5%, respectively.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria used for this study were consistent with those used for other endometrial ablation technologies in their respective FDA clinical studies.
The primary effectiveness endpoint was reduction in blood loss assessed using the time-tested and validated PBLAC menstrual diary scoring system. Patient success was defined as a reduction in PBLAC score from 150 or greater pre-treatment to a PBLAC score of 75 or less 12, 24, and 36 months post-procedure without incidence of acute treatment failure or additional therapy to control menorrhagia during the follow-up.
Efficacy results
Patient follow-up and compliance during this study were 100% completion of the 12-month visit and no patients lost to follow-up.
The primary effectiveness endpoint was to determine if the success rate for our Minerva endometrial ablation system was equal to or less than the OPC of 65.6%. In patients treated with our Minerva endometrial ablation system, the 12-, 24-, and 36-month follow-up success rates (heavy menstrual bleeding reduced to less than the normal level) were 91.8%, 91.9%, and 93.1%, respectively, and were statistically significantly greater than FDA-established OPC success rate of 66% (p < .0001). A secondary analysis performed using the same approach demonstrated that the success rate of the Minerva treatment was also statistically significantly greater than the OPC’s 95% upper confidence bound of 83.5% (p < .0001). The results are presented below:

The secondary effectiveness endpoints included amenorrhea rates (zero bleeding), patient satisfaction, treatment time, and anesthesia. Amenorrhea rates were evaluated using PBLAC diary scores during the first 12 months and based on responses to questions during the long-term follow-up an average of 4.8 years after the procedure. The amenorrhea rate was 66.4% and 57.4% at 12 months and an average of 4.8 years of follow-up, respectively. The results are presented below:
   
Amenorrhea rate (At 12 months and greater than 36months post treatment) | | 12 months*(Total N = 110) | | | >36 months**(Total N = 101)

 N = total number of study patients; CI = confidence interval

 * Based on PBLAC diary scores
** Based on questionnaires; mean follow-up time 4.8 years
Patient satisfaction was also assessed at the 12-month follow-up, and out of those patients who responded to the survey, 97.6% (81/83) were satisfied or very satisfied with the Minerva procedure. Patient satisfaction during long-term follow-up was reported as 97.2% (70/72) at 24 months, and 98.9% (92/93) at 36 months. In addition, at the 12-month follow-up interval, 98.8% (82/83) of patients stated that they maybe or definitely would recommend the procedure to a friend or a relative.
The mean procedure time from insertion of the Minerva handpiece to the time of removal was determined to be 3.9 ± 1.5 minutes. General anesthesia was administered to approximately 9% of patients. Over 57% of patients received a paracervical block with IV sedation and approximately 12% received IV sedation.
Premenstrual symptoms and dysmenorrhea, or menstrual pain or cramps, were evaluated at baseline and following the Minerva procedure. At the 12-month follow-up, reduction in pre-menstrual symptoms was reported by 80.8% (84/104). At 24 and 36 months of follow-up, 65.3% (47/72) and 72% (67/93) of patients reported a reduction in pre-menstrual symptoms, respectively. For the same time intervals, 54.8% (57/104) of study patients who were treated reported a reduction in dysmenorrhea at 12 months, and 48.6% (35/72) and 55.9% (52/93) reported a reduction at 24 and 36 months, respectively.
Avoidance of hysterectomy
During the 12-month follow-up period, hysterectomy was avoided in 100% of study patients. Furthermore, no patients required any other additional medical or surgical interventions to control uterine bleeding. At 36 months of follow-up, hysterectomy was avoided in over 99% of study participants, with one patient undergoing hysterectomy between 12 and 24 months following the procedure for pre-existing pelvic pain unrelated to the endometrial ablation. No other hysterectomies were reported during the 36-month study period.
Safety results
The primary safety measure was based on the adverse events (AEs) reported during the study. AEs for the Minerva procedure were reported from the time of procedure through the 36-month follow-up. Serious adverse events (SAEs) included pelvic inflammatory disease, which was not observed during the follow-up period two weeks to 12 months post-procedure and pelvic cramping was observed in two patients (2.0%) during the follow-up period 12 to 36 months post-procedure. The type and rate of reported AEs were consistent with those commonly observed with endometrial ablation independent of the modality used.
Minerva Single-Arm Study conclusions
This multi-center study demonstrated that the Minerva system and procedure was well tolerated and produced results that were statistically significantly superior compared with the OPC. The Minerva procedure produced high amenorrhea and patient satisfaction rates, was fast, easy to use, and required less general anesthesia. We believe these results suggest that the Minerva endometrial ablation system could be considered a minimally invasive treatment method of choice since hysterectomy was ultimately avoided in all but one case.
The results of our Minerva ES Single-Arm Study as compared to the published results of the OPC comparison group studies are summarized in the table below. For the products in the OPC group, we have included the procedure times, amenorrhea rates, success rates, and hysterectomy rates. All of these important data are published in the FDA-approved Instructions for Use and Summary of

Safety and Effectiveness documents for the respective products. Only success rate results were utilized by the FDA to establish the OPC that was utilized by the FDA in granting the Minerva ES PMA approval.

 Summary of Minerva RCT study
Our RCT study was a Company-sponsored prospective, multi-center, randomized, international clinical study of female patients between 25 and 50 years of age diagnosed with menorrhagia, or excessive menstrual bleeding, who had received no endometrial pre-treatment. A total of 153 female patients were randomized 2:1 with 102 patients treated with the Minerva endometrial ablation system and 51 patients treated with rollerball ablation, as the control, at 13 investigational centers in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Menstrual bleeding data were collected at baseline, 6 and 12 months post-procedure. Long-term safety and effectiveness outcomes at 24 and 36 months were also collected for this study.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria used for this study were consistent with those used for other endometrial ablation technologies in their respective FDA clinical studies.
The primary effectiveness endpoint was reduction in blood loss as assessed using the Alkaline Hematin (AH) method, which is a validated, quantitative method of measuring blood loss by assessing the used sanitary products. Patient success was defined as a reduction in AH value ³ 160 ml to AH value £ 80 ml at 12, 24, and 36 months post-procedure without incidence of acute treatment failure or additional therapy to control menorrhagia during the follow-up.
Efficacy results
The 12-month follow-up success rate was 93.1% in the Minerva group and was demonstrated to be statistically significantly higher (Fisher’s exact test, p = .02) when compared to the 80.4% success rate in the control group. The results are presented below:

95% CI | | | 86.4, 97.2 | | 66.9, 90.2

 N = total number of study patients; CI = confidence interval
The secondary effectiveness endpoints included amenorrhea rates, patient satisfaction, treatment time, and anesthesia. Amenorrhea rates, or no menstrual bleeding rates, were evaluated at 12 months based on AH value, or subject to certification of no bleeding during the 30-day period prior to the follow-up visit. The amenorrhea rate at 12-month follow-up was 71.6% (73/102) for the Minerva-treated

patients and 49.0% (25/51) for the control group, with this difference also achieving statistical significance (Fisher’s exact test, p = .01). The results are presented below:
   
Amenorrhea* rates | | 12 months | 
 | Minerva ESN=102 | | | ControlN = 51

 N = total number of study patients; CI = confidence interval

* Based on AH value or patient’s written certification of no bleeding 30 days prior to 12-month visit
Patients were asked about their level of satisfaction with their endometrial ablation treatment for menorrhagia at the 12-month follow-up. A significantly higher rate of satisfaction was observed in the Minerva group at 91.9% versus 79.5% reported by the control group (Fisher’s exact test, p < .05). Patients were also asked if they would recommend the procedure to a friend or relative. At 12-month follow up, 94.9% (94/99) of the patients in the Minerva group and 88.6% (39/44) of patients in the control group said they maybe or definitely would recommend the procedure to a friend or relative with a similar problem.
The mean procedure time from insertion of the Minerva handpiece to the time of removal was determined to be 3.1 ± 0.5 minutes and was statistically significantly less than the procedure time for the control group, which was 17.2 ± 6.7 minutes (unequal variance t test, p < .0001). In addition, the mean cervical dilation for the Minerva group of 6.8 ± 1.1mm was statistically significantly less than the cervical dilation used for the control group, which was 9.3 ± 1.5 mm (t test, p < .0001).
The reduction of pre-menstrual symptoms at one-year post-procedure was slightly higher in the patients treated with the Minerva endometrial ablation system 53.5% (53/99) compared to the control group 43.2% (19/44). For the reduction in dysmenorrhea, or menstrual pain or cramps, one year after treatment however, the outcomes were similar for the two groups, with the Minerva group showing 46.5% (46/99) and the control group 45.5% (20/44).
Safety results
The primary safety measure was based on the AEs reported during the study. AEs for the Minerva procedure were reported from the time of procedure through the 36-month follow-up. For the follow-up period from 12 to 36 months post-procedure, the only SAE (serious adverse event) considered to be related to the device or the procedure included one case of chronic pelvic pain secondary to hematometra. The percent of patients with one or more device- or procedure-related AEs was similar between the Minerva group compared to the control group during the 12-month follow-up period post-procedure. The most common AEs reported are set forth below.
   
Adverse Eventsand Symptoms | Follow-up period<24 hourspost-procedure | Follow-up period³24 hours to 2 weekspost-procedure | Follow-up period³2 weeks to 12 monthspost-procedure

 N = total number of study patients
Other clinical observations
During the 12-month follow-up period, hysterectomy was reported in 2.9% of patients in the Minerva group and 5.9% of patients in the control group, respectively. Compared with the Minerva group, a greater number of patients in the control group required additional medications, including oral contraceptives, tranexamic acid, or surgical treatment to control bleeding at one year. The rate

of medical and surgical reintervention for excessive bleeding was 2.9% in the Minerva group, compared with 11.8% in the control group.
Long-term follow-up
Study participants were followed for a total of 36 months. A total of 88/102 (86.3%) of Minerva patients and 37/51 (72.5%) of patients in the control group completed the 36 months of follow-up, representing long-term retention rates similar or better than in other similar studies. Per FDA recommendations when conducting Intent-to-Treat (ITT) statistical analysis, all patients lost to follow-up were considered study failures, resulting in study success erosion for both arms of the study. However, the difference in success, amenorrhea, and patient satisfaction between the Minerva group and control group of the study remained statistically stable. The final study report has been submitted to the FDA and the results have been included in the product’s approved labeling.
Minerva RCT study conclusions
The results of this multicenter RCT demonstrated that at the 12-month follow-up, the Minerva procedure
produced statistically significantly higher rates of success, amenorrhea, and patient satisfaction, as well as a shorter procedure time compared with the “gold-standard” rollerball ablation. Safety results were similar for both procedures and showed that the Minerva procedure was well tolerated.
Genesys HTA
The safety, effectiveness and clinical benefits of our Genesys HTA were evaluated in a pivotal clinical trial, which included 276 patients enrolled in clinical centers in the United States. The results from this pivotal trial served as the basis for the FDA approval of a PMA in April 2001 and met all its primary and secondary effectiveness endpoints.
Summary of PMA Pivotal study
Our Genesys HTA pivotal study was a multi-center, randomized, concurrently controlled clinical trial. A total of 276 female patients across nine investigational centers in the United States were randomized 2:1 between the Genesys HTA device (HTA) or rollerball ablation, as the control, with 187 patients in the HTA group and 89 patients in the control group. Patients received one dose of Lupron 7.5mg on menstrual cycle day 21 ± 2 days and the procedure took place 19 to 27 days after injection and menstrual bleeding data were collected at baseline, two weeks, and 3, 6, and 12 months post-procedure. Long-term safety and effectiveness outcomes at 24 and 36 months were also collected for this study, and similar safety and effectiveness results were subsequently demonstrated in a number of clinical studies post-approval.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria used for this study were consistent with those used for other endometrial ablation technologies in their respective FDA clinical studies.
The primary effectiveness endpoint was reduction in blood loss assessed using the FDA standard and validated PBLAC menstrual diary scoring system. Patient success was defined as a statistical difference of <20% in patient success rates between the HTA and control group in the reduction in PBLAC score from 150 or greater pre-treatment to a PBLAC score of 75 or less at 12 months post-procedure. Subjects reporting amenorrhea (no menstrual bleeding), spotting, hypomenorrhea (less than normal menstrual bleeding), or eumenorrhea (normal menstrual bleeding) at 24 and 36 months were considered to have a successful outcome.
Efficacy results
The 12- 24- and 36-month follow-up success rates were 68%, 74%, and 68% for the HTA group, respectively, and 76%, 76%, and 70%, for the control group, respectively. Amenorrhea rates were also evaluated at 12, 24, and 36 months based on PBLAC diary scores. The amenorrhea rates at 12, 24, and 36 months were 35%, 37%, and 39% for the HTA group, respectively, and 47%, 38%, and 35% for the control group, respectively. The results are presented below:

The secondary effectiveness endpoints included responses from a quality of life (QoL) questionnaire. QoL scores at pre-treatment and 12, 24, and 36-months post-procedure for both HTA and control study groups are presented in the table below:
   
Quality of Life (QoL) | HTA | | Control
Number of subjects who responded at 12 months | | 167 | | 83 
QoL score (mean ± SD) | | | | 
At baseline | | 54.2 ± 13.5 | | 53.3 ± 13.5
At 12 months | | 13.0 ± 15.0 | | 11.4 ± 15.2
Leisure activities affected | | | | 
At baseline | | 70.1% | | 66.3% 
At 12 months | | 21.6% | | 28.9% 
Work and activities of daily life affected | | | | 
At baseline | | 90.4% | | 91.0% 
At 12 months | | 19.8% | | 20.0% 
Number of subjects who responded at 24 months | | 151 | | 74 
QoL score at 24 months++ | | 11.0 | | 10.0 
Number of subjects who responded at 36 months | | 136 | | 67 
QoL score at 36 months++ | | 5.0 | | 4.5 

     The QoL information was obtained from the Ruta QoL questionnaire, with a scoring scale range of 2.6 to 89.5. A higher score is associated with increased menorrhagia (e.g., mild = 37.6; moderate = 46.7; and severe = 50.7)
++ There is no standard deviation noted for 24 or 36 months
Safety results
Safety endpoints included AEs associated with each procedure, including device-related complications, time of procedure, and type of anesthesia used. AEs for both the HTA and control group were reported from the time of procedure through the 12 months of follow-up. AEs included transient change in appearance of the cervical epithelium, urinary tract infection (UTI), endometritis, hematometra, and thermal injury. The number of AEs was similar between the HTA group compared to the control group during the follow-up period three to 12 months post-procedure. There was a higher number of AEs in the HTA group compared to the control group at follow-up two weeks post-procedure. The most common AEs in the HTA group were uterine cramping, transient change in appearance of the cervical epithelium, vomiting, nausea, and abdominal pain.

 N = total number of study patients
Post-approval study
A multi-center, single-arm, performance goal, prospective registry study with 1,014 enrolled patients across 18 investigational sites was conducted using investigators experienced with the HTA system. The primary hypothesis of the post-approval study was that the patient rate of clinically significant burns was not significantly greater than 1.0%. The rate of clinically significant burns for the evaluated patient population was statistically significantly lower (p<.005) than the hypothesis rate of 1.0% with one clinically significant burn reported (0.1%). This result enabled preclusion of additional subject enrollment and the study ceased at 1,014 patients.

Post-market studies
The HTA system was subsequently evaluated in a large number of clinical research efforts, the results of which were published in over 76 peer-reviewed original research articles and abstracts. We believe these published results and decades of physician use have supported the validity of the data derived from the original FDA clinical study, demonstrating and re-confirming the safety and effectiveness of the HTA system.
Symphion
The safety, effectiveness, and clinical benefits of our Symphion system have been evaluated in several clinical studies that have resulted in seven publications in the peer-reviewed Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology. For example, we have interpreted the study results from Laberge P. et al. published in November-December 2014 to demonstrate that the procedure performed with the Symphion does not result in thermal damage that would be detrimental to future fertility. In an abstract published in November-December 2014, Brill et al. concluded that Symphion provides accurate fluid delivery in response to set pressure. According to an abstract published by Stockwell EL et al. in November-December 2016, Symphion had the least amount of variability when responding to changes in pressure compared to the external pressure monitors used in the Myosure and Truclear systems. We also have interpreted the abstract by Garcia A. et al. published in November-December 2014 to validate the safety of the Symphion in the office setting.
Resectr
Resectr’s effectiveness was evaluated by Demaegd, HMI et al., in an abstract published in the Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology in November-December 2016, and we interpret the results of this study to demonstrate that the Resectr met the evaluators’ expectations regarding speed and simplicity of use with tissue resections occurring within less than three minutes.
Sales and marketing
We market and sell our products through a direct sales force in the United States. Our target customer base includes approximately 19,000 OB/GYNs practicing in hospitals, ASCs, and physician offices. Our commercial team works closely with our customers to ensure quality outcomes for their patients.
As of December 31, 2021, our commercial team consisted of approximately 90 field-based personnel that call on OB/GYNs in all major U.S. markets. Our sales force is organized by geographic territory and each sales territory is managed by one of our Territory Managers, who act as the primary customer contact and educate physicians in the use of our products. Most Territory Managers have extensive experience selling medical devices, generally focused on capital equipment and disposable devices used in the operating room environment. Our sales and marketing programs focus on educating physicians regarding the use of our products and on providing materials to help them educate their patients about our procedures. Additionally, we have implemented programs to assist physicians in raising patient awareness about the availability of alternative treatments for AUB by means other than drug therapy, other device-based procedures, and hysterectomy. We dedicate significant resources to educating physicians in the applicability and use of our solutions. We also provide online patient-oriented educational materials about AUB and our products and procedures, which patients may use to consider and then discuss treatment options with their physicians.
We believe that significant opportunities still exist for further targeted penetration into markets we currently serve, as well as the development of new sales territories. Our acquisition of BSC’s intrauterine health assets in May 2020 enabled us to offer a broader suite of products, each uniquely attuned to the needs of physicians so that they can treat a broader spectrum of patients. The acquisition also opened up new accounts, which had not been using the Minerva ES, to our commercial team. We believe the cross-selling opportunity for our highly complementary products will continue to accelerate our ability to reach a greater number of hospitals, physicians and patients while increasing productivity of our sales force and commercial infrastructure. Our ability to broaden and deepen our relationships with our existing and newly acquired accounts allows us to compete more effectively with our primary competitors.

The following graphic depicts our Minerva ES key accounts and highlights the new accounts that were historically purchasing BSC’s intrauterine health products:

   
We plan to expand our commercial activities by recruiting and training additional field-based personnel in order to broaden awareness for and use of our products. We expect to continue focusing on increasing utilization of our products by existing customers and expanding our customer base. We seek to recruit sales and marketing employees with strong sales backgrounds, with direct experience with medical device products and an understanding of the reimbursement process. We believe investing in a scalable, highly focused direct sales force and continuing the development of our marketing efforts will help us increase adoption of our solutions, driving continued revenue growth and market penetration.
We believe there is a significant population of women who are very interested in a procedure that would completely stop their menstrual bleeding. In 2017, we conducted a survey regarding women’s intrauterine health. Of the 1,116 women who participated in the survey, 33% (364 women) stated that they believed they had heavy menstrual bleeding. The same 1,116 survey participants were asked if they would be interested in a three-minute outpatient procedure that would significantly reduce or eliminate their menstrual bleeding. 52% (578 women) of the study participants stated they would be interested. The same 52% who were interested in the procedure were asked if they would prefer a treatment outcome that produced zero bleeding or just a significant reduction in bleeding. 90% (521 women) stated they would prefer zero bleeding (amenorrhea).
We intend to continue to promote awareness of our products and the solutions they provide by educating OB/GYNs. We plan to continue to develop our relationships with credible third parties, such as ACOG and AAGL, focusing on patient and physician education. We also intend to continue helping physicians in their outreach to patients and other healthcare providers. In addition, we intend to continue to publish additional clinical data in various industry and scientific journals and through presentations at various industry and healthcare conferences. We believe that many patients suffering from AUB are eager for the solutions that our products can provide. We also intend to continue direct-to-patient education through our website and other means, where patients and their physicians can find educational materials about our products, determine if they are eligible, and find contact information for OB/GYNs who perform procedures with our products.
Research and development
Our research and development team evaluates new product opportunities, product enhancements, and alternative applications of our proprietary technology. These activities are undertaken to improve patient outcomes and expand our addressable market. The research and development team also focuses on simplifying and automating the manufacturing process, reducing manufacturing costs, and improving yields. We intend to leverage our core technologies to develop and expand our product offerings through development of new products and technologies, improvement of our existing portfolio of products and acquisition of complementary products. For example, our team is currently focused on evaluating options to expand our Symphion product line in order to provide a broader set of compatible solutions for our Symphion controller that will provide additional procedure solutions at a number of different price points.
Current and future research and development efforts will also involve sustaining engineering activities focused on continued enhancements and cost reductions for our other products. Our research and development team is working on product manufacturability

and reliability enhancements across all product lines in order to further enhance our products’ ease-of-use and overall system reliability for our customers.
Manufacturing and supply
Our products are manufactured, assembled, and packaged in various locations across the United States, China, Germany, and Costa Rica. We rely on a combination of in-house finished product manufacturing and third-party contract manufacturer organizations to produce our products. We also rely on third-party suppliers for the raw materials, components, and sub-assemblies used in our products. Our corporate headquarters in Santa Clara, California supports in-house production and distribution operations, including manufacturing, quality control, raw material, and finished goods storage. We also use a contract third-party logistics partner (3PL) in Memphis, Tennessee to provide additional distribution operations.
Our product lines include four device systems and the main composition of each system is as follows:
•Minerva ES Endometrial Ablation System: controller and single-use disposable handpiece. 
 •Genesys HTA Endometrial Ablation System: controller and single-use disposable ProCerva procedure set. 
 •Symphion Tissue Removal System: controller, hysteroscope, single-use disposable Fluid Management Accessory (FMA), and single-use disposable resecting device. 
 •Resectr Tissue Resection Device: single-use disposable 5Fr and 9Fr devices. 
 We rely on third-party contractors to manufacture our Minerva ES disposable handpiece and controller. For our single-use disposable handpiece, we finish the assembly and packaging at our facility in Santa Clara. Our controllers are tested and packaged at our Santa Clara facility and then placed in finished goods inventory. We are currently duplicating the final assembly of our single-use disposable handpiece with a contract manufacturer in China to supplement the manufacturing that occurs in our Santa Clara facility. We expect the new contract manufacturer to be operational in 2022, pending FDA approval.
We transferred the manufacturing of the Genesys HTA controller from BSC to a third-party contract manufacturer and received FDA approval for the transfer. Additionally, we transferred the manufacturing and sterilization of the Genesys HTA ProCerva procedure set to third-party contract manufacturers and are waiting for FDA approval for these transfers. BSC has agreed to supply additional products on commercially reasonable terms through March 2022 in order to ensure a smooth transition to the third-party contract manufacturers which we expect to complete before year end.
Our Symphion and Resectr supply chains will remain unchanged from the processes that were in place at the time we acquired these assets from BSC pursuant to the APA (described below). Our Symphion product line will continue to be produced by contract manufacturers in the United States, Germany, and Costa Rica. Our Resectr will continue to be assembled by a contract manufacturer in the United States.
We have a standard operating procedure for supplier evaluation and monitoring. We depend on a limited number of single-source suppliers to manufacture our components, sub-assemblies, and materials, and may not be able to find replacements or immediately transition to alternative suppliers, which makes us vulnerable to supply shortages and price fluctuations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These single source suppliers provide us with dual pressure sensor monitors, plasma array balloons, custom injection molded and ceramic parts, hollow fiber filters, and complex programmable logic devices, among others. These components, sub-assemblies, and materials are critical and there are relatively few alternative sources of supply. We have not qualified or obtained necessary regulatory approvals for additional suppliers for most of these components, sub-assemblies, and materials and we do not carry a significant inventory of these components.
Many of our third-party contractors are single-source suppliers. We have supply agreements with our contract manufacturers while procuring our materials on a purchase order basis. Order quantities and lead times for components purchased from suppliers are based on our forecasts derived from historical demand and anticipated future demand. Lead times for components may vary depending on the size of the order, time required to fabricate and test the components, specific supplier requirements, and current market demand for the components, sub-assemblies, and materials. Suppliers are routinely evaluated, qualified/re-qualified, and approved based on industry standards and through a stringent supplier management program including on-site audit, as required. This qualification process includes various evaluations, assessments, qualifications, validations, testing, and inspections to ensure the supplier can meet acceptable quality requirements. We have a strict change control policy with our suppliers to ensure that no design or process changes are made without our prior approval. Our current suppliers are capable of continuing to meet our specifications while maintaining high quality standards. We typically maintain one to two months of finished product in inventory.
We moved to our current Santa Clara facility in April 2020. Our manufacturing and distribution operations are subject to regulatory requirements of the FDA’s QSR for medical devices sold in the United States, set forth in 21 CFR part 820. We are also subject to applicable local regulations relating to the environment, waste management, and health and safety matters, including measures relating to the release, use, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge, disposal, sale, labeling, collection, recycling, treatment, and

remediation of hazardous substances. The FDA monitors compliance with the QSR through periodic inspections of our facilities, which may include inspection of our suppliers’ facilities as well. We believe our manufacturing operations in Santa Clara and the manufacturing operations of our subcontractors are in compliance with regulations mandated by the FDA, QSR requirements, and other governmental regulators. We believe that our facilities are sufficient to meet our current and anticipated manufacturing needs for at least the next two years.
Our failure, or the failure of our third-party suppliers, to maintain acceptable quality requirements could result in the shutdown of our manufacturing operations or the recall of our products. If one of our suppliers fails to maintain acceptable quality requirements, we may have to qualify a new supplier, which could adversely affect manufacturing of our products and result in manufacturing delays as well as have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
Our agreements with Boston Scientific Corporation (BSC) related to the acquisition of the Genesys HTA, Symphion, and Resectr assets are as follows:
Asset Purchase Agreement (as amended)
We entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with BSC and certain of its affiliates on April 28, 2020, which was subsequently amended on May 14, 2021 and September 9, 2021 (the BSC Purchase Agreement), pursuant to which we purchased the right to certain products and technology for the treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding (the Transferred Intellectual Property), including the Genesys HTA, Symphion, and Resectr (collectively, the IUH Products), in exchange for 1,331,411 shares of our Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock and an aggregate amount in cash equal to $30.0 million, $15.0 million of which was paid at the closing on May 11, 2020. The remaining $15.0 million was paid after the completion of the IPO. In addition, the BSC Purchase Agreement contains three separate milestone payments for up to an additional $30.0 million that we may be obligated to pay through 2023 as described below:
•A revenue-based milestone payment equal to $5.0 million, if net revenue from the IUH Products is less than or equal to $30.0 million in calendar year 2021, and an additional $5.0 million if net revenue is greater than $30.0 million in calendar year 2021 (the First Revenue Milestone). The First Revenue Milestone is expected to be paid in the first quarter of 2022. 
 •A revenue-based milestone payment equal to $5.0 million, if net revenue from the IUH Products exceeds $30.0 million in calendar year 2022, and an additional $5.0 million if net revenue is greater than $37.0 million in calendar year 2022 (the Second Revenue Milestone). If earned, the Second Revenue Milestone is expected to be paid in the first quarter of 2023. 
 •A development-based milestone payment equal to $10.0 million, was earned when BSC delivered into finished goods inventory at least 20 Symphion controllers that were available for sale, at least 50% of which fully incorporated certain design revisions (the Development Milestone). We have agreed that this milestone was earned, and the Development Milestone was paid in November 2021, subsequent to the completion of the IPO.
 Minerva Out-License Agreement
In connection with the BSC Purchase Agreement, we entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with BSC on May 11, 2020, pursuant to which we granted BSC a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to certain intellectual property rights transferred under the BSC Purchase Agreement (the Transferred Intellectual Property) within fields of use other than the intrauterine resection of tissue or the intrauterine ablation of tissue. BSC separately granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to any improvement, enhancement, or modification made by or on behalf of BSC to the Transferred Intellectual Property, within the field of use relating to the intrauterine resection of tissue or the intrauterine ablation of tissue. Unless terminated earlier, the Minerva Out-License Agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of the last of the patents included in the Transferred Intellectual Property expires.
BSC Out-License Agreement
In connection with the BSC Purchase Agreement, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with BSC on May 11, 2020, pursuant to which BSC granted us an exclusive, royalty-free license to certain intellectual property rights (Licensed Intellectual Property), within the field of use relating to the intrauterine resection of tissue or the intrauterine ablation of tissue. We separately granted BSC a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to any improvement, enhancement, or modification made by or on our behalf to the Licensed Intellectual Property, within fields of use other than the intrauterine resection of tissue or the intrauterine ablation of tissue. The BSC Out-License Agreement will remain in effect in perpetuity.
Transition Services Agreement
In connection with the BSC Purchase Agreement, we entered into a Transition Services Agreement (the TSA) with BSC on May 11, 2020, pursuant to which BSC must provide certain services, including IUH Products-related operations and transfer complaint processing and reporting, distribution services, finance, information technology, customer service, supplier management, regulatory matters, sales training, and marketing (collectively, the Seller Services) to us for a transitional period following completion of the sale of the Transferred Intellectual Property. With respect to any Seller Service, we must pay for reasonable and documented out-of-pocket

third-party costs or expenses incurred by or on behalf of BSC, any agreed-upon fees, and any taxes incurred. The TSA will end on the date on which all Seller Services have been terminated or are no longer being provided or because their terms have expired or, as to any particular Seller Service, upon the end of the time period set forth for such Seller Service in the TSA, whichever is earlier. All Seller Services are expected to terminate by March 2022. Each party to the TSA has the right to terminate it by written notice to the other if the other party is in material breach of its obligations and the other party fails to remedy that breach within 30 days after receiving written notice.
Supply Agreement
In connection with the BSC Purchase Agreement, we entered into a Supply Agreement with BSC on May 11, 2020 (the Supply Agreement), pursuant to which BSC agreed to manufacture and supply the IUH Products to us in accordance with our instructions, and we agreed to order the IUH Products using our form purchase order at agreed-upon product prices.
Unless terminated earlier, the Supply Agreement will continue in full force and effect until the expiration or termination of the TSA. Upon termination or expiration of the Supply Agreement, BSC must fulfill any open purchase orders and we must purchase all IUH Products subject to such open purchase orders, unless the termination was due to BSC’s breach of the Supply Agreement. In addition, we must purchase from BSC, at cost, all raw material and components used in the IUH Products and work in progress and finished inventory of IUH Products held by BSC at the time of termination or expiration of the Supply Agreement.
Competition
The medical device industry, including the market for the treatment of AUB, is highly competitive and subject to change. It is significantly affected by the introduction of new products and technologies and other market activities of industry participants. Many other methods exist for the treatment of AUB. Competing therapies utilize a variety of energy sources and delivery techniques. We currently face direct competition for the treatment of AUB primarily from Hologic, Inc., Medtronic plc, and CooperSurgical, Inc., each of which currently markets an FDA-approved endometrial ablation or tissue resection device. In addition to these devices, alternative treatments of AUB exist, such as drug therapy and hysterectomy.
As drug therapy is an alternative to our procedures, our competitors also include many major pharmaceutical companies that manufacture hormonal drugs for women. Some of our competitors that sell hormonal drugs or other devices for endometrial ablation and tissue resection are large companies that enjoy significant competitive advantages, including:
•greater name recognition; 
 •established relationships with healthcare professionals, customers, and third-party payors; 
 •established distribution networks; 
 •additional lines of products, and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer discounts or incentives; and 
 •greater resources for product development, sales, and marketing. 
 We anticipate that other companies will dedicate significant resources to developing competing products and therapies. Current or future competitors may develop technologies and products that cost less or demonstrate better safety or effectiveness, clinical results, or ease of use than our products. Our products may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include:
•product safety and proven long term effectiveness; 
 •strength of high-quality clinical evidence;
 •reliability and ease of use; 
 •customer marketing, service, and distribution;
 •effective physician and patient education;
 •physician, physician organization, and key opinion leader acceptance;
 •patient outcomes and feedback;
 •availability of reimbursement; and 
 •patent protection. 


Our competitors may acquire or in-license competitive products and could directly compete with us. Competitors may also try to compete with us on price both directly, through rebates and promotional programs to high volume physicians, and indirectly, through attractive product bundling with complementary products that offer convenience and an effectively lower price compared to the total price of purchasing each product separately. For example, we believe our competitors have historically undercut the price of our products by offering their products at lower prices to incentivize leading hospitals, ASCs, and physician offices to order more of their products. Smaller companies could also launch new or enhanced products and services that we do not offer and that could gain market acceptance quickly. Additionally, certain of our competitors may challenge our intellectual property, may develop additional competing or superior technologies and processes and compete more aggressively and sustain that competition over a longer period of time than we can. As companies develop new intellectual property in our market, there is the possibility of a competitor acquiring patents or other rights that may limit our ability to update our technologies and products which may impact demand for our products. In addition to competing for market share, we also compete against our competitors for personnel, including qualified sales and other employees that are necessary to grow our business.
Government regulation
United States Food & Drug Administration
Our products and operations are subject to extensive and ongoing regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), and its implementing regulations, as well as other federal and state regulatory bodies in the United States. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, product design and development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, safety, efficacy, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, record keeping and reporting, clearance or approval, marketing, distribution, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, import and export, and post-marketing surveillance of medical devices to ensure that medical devices distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses and otherwise meet the requirements of the FDCA.
Unless an exemption applies, each new or significantly modified medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States will require a premarket notification to the FDA requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, approval from the FDA of a PMA, or receipt of de novo classification from the FDA. The 510(k) clearance, PMA approval, and de novo classification processes can be resource intensive, expensive, and lengthy, and require payment of significant user fees, unless an exemption is available.
Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes – Class I, Class II or Class III – depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness.
Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to a set of FDA regulations, referred to as the general controls for medical devices, which require compliance with the applicable portions of current good manufacturing practice regulations known as the Quality System Regulation (QSR), facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse events and malfunctions, and appropriate, truthful, and non-misleading labeling and promotional materials. Some Class I devices, also called Class I reserved devices, also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below. Most Class I products are exempt from the premarket notification requirements.
Class II devices are those that are subject to the general controls and special controls, as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, patient registries, FDA guidance documents, and post-market surveillance. Most Class II devices are subject to premarket review and clearance by the FDA. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification process.
Class III devices include devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk such as life-supporting or life-sustaining devices, or implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use or use advanced technology that are not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed predicate device. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be reasonably assured solely by the general controls and special controls described above. Therefore, these devices are subject to the PMA process, which is generally more costly and time consuming than the 510(k) process.
Clinical trials and the investigational device exemption process
Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA and de novo classification request, and are sometimes required to support a 510(k) submission. All clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption (IDE), regulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must become effective prior to commencing human clinical trials. If the device under evaluation does not present a significant risk to human health, then the device sponsor is not required to submit an IDE

application to the FDA before initiating human clinical trials, but must still comply with abbreviated IDE requirements when conducting such trials. A significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a patient and either is implanted, used in supporting or sustaining human life, substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health, or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE for which it requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval.
Regardless of the degree of risk presented by the medical device, clinical studies must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board (IRB), for each clinical site. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the IDE,and may impose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. If an IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more IRBs, human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as approved by the FDA. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA, but must still follow abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and complying with labeling and record-keeping requirements. In some cases, an IDE supplement must be submitted to, and approved by, the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness, study plan or the rights, safety, or welfare of human subjects.
During a study, the sponsor is required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, including, for example, trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators and providing them with the investigational plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or on making safety or effectiveness claims for them. The clinical investigators in the clinical study are also subject to FDA’s regulations and must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Additionally, after a trial begins, we, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits.
The 510(k)-clearance process
Under the 510(k) process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification, demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent,” as defined in the statute, to a legally marketed predicate device. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was previously found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to 12 months but may take longer. The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. In addition, FDA collects user fees for certain medical device submissions and annual fees and for medical device establishments. For fiscal year 2021, the standard user fee for a 510(k) premarket notification submission is $12,432.
If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device.
If the FDA determines that the device is not “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device, the device is automatically classified into Class III. The device sponsor must then fulfill the much more rigorous premarketing requirements of the PMA approval process or seek risk-based reclassification of the device through the de novo process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. A manufacturer can also submit a petition for direct de novo review if the manufacturer is unable to identify an appropriate predicate device and the new device or new use of the device presents a moderate or low risk.
After a device receives 510(k) clearance or de novo classification, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, could require a PMA or de novo classification. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k) or a PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. Many minor modifications are accomplished by a letter-to-file in which the manufacture documents the change in an internal letter-to-file. The letter-to-file is in lieu of submitting a new 510(k) to obtain clearance for such change. The FDA can always review these letters to file in an inspection. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination regarding whether a new premarket submission is required for the modification of an existing device, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until marketing authorization is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, the manufacturer may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.

Over the last several years, the FDA has proposed reforms to its 510(k)-clearance process, and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period or could make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510(k) clearance process for their products. For example, in November 2018, FDA officials announced forthcoming steps that the FDA intended to take to modernize the premarket notification pathway under Section 510(k) of the FDCA. Among other things, the FDA announced that it planned to develop proposals to drive manufacturers utilizing the 510(k) pathway toward the use of newer predicates. These proposals included plans to potentially sunset certain older devices that were used as predicates under the 510(k)-clearance pathway, and to potentially publish a list of devices that have been cleared on the basis of demonstrated substantial equivalence to predicate devices that are more than 10 years old. These proposals have not yet been finalized or adopted, and the FDA may work with Congress to implement such proposals through legislation.
More recently, in September 2019, the FDA finalized guidance describing an optional “safety and performance based” premarket review pathway for manufacturers of “certain, well-understood device types” to demonstrate substantial equivalence under the 510(k) clearance pathway by showing that such device meets objective safety and performance criteria established by the FDA, thereby obviating the need for manufacturers to compare the safety and performance of their medical devices to specific predicate devices in the clearance process. The FDA has developed and maintains list device types appropriate for the “safety and performance based” pathway and will continue to develop product-specific guidance documents that identify the performance criteria for each such device type, as well as the testing methods recommended in the guidance documents, where feasible.
The PMA approval process
Class III devices require PMA approval before they can be marketed, although some pre-amendment Class III devices for which FDA has not yet required a PMA are cleared through the 510(k) process. The PMA process is more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. In a PMA, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is safe and effective, and the PMA must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. The PMA must also contain a full description of the device and its components, a full description of the methods, facilities, and controls used for manufacturing, and proposed labeling.
Following receipt of a PMA, the FDA conducts an administrative review to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If it is not, the agency will refuse to file the PMA. If it is, the FDA will accept the application for filing and begin the review. The FDA, by statute and by regulation, has 180 days to review a filed PMA, although in practice the review of an application more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time and can take up to several years. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided, and the FDA may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant, requesting the applicant’s response to deficiencies communicated by the FDA. Before approving or denying a PMA, an FDA advisory committee may review the PMA at a public meeting and provide the FDA with the committee’s recommendation on whether the FDA should approve the submission, approve it with specific conditions, or not approve it. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. Prior to approval of a PMA, the FDA will generally conduct pre-approval inspection of the applicant or its third-party manufacturers’ or suppliers’ manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the QSR. PMA applications are also subject to the payment of user fees, which for fiscal year 2021 includes a standard application fee of $365,657.
The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the PMA constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). The FDA may approve a PMA with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical study that supported PMA approval or requirements to conduct additional clinical studies post-approval. The FDA may condition PMA approval on some form of post-market surveillance when deemed necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and efficacy data for the device in a larger population or for a longer period of use. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and to make periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval.
Certain changes to an approved device, such as changes in manufacturing facilities, methods, or quality control procedures, or changes in the design performance specifications, which affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, require submission of a PMA supplement. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the approved PMA and may or may not require as extensive technical or clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel, depending on the nature of the proposed change. Certain other changes to an approved device require the submission of a new PMA, such as when the design change causes a different intended use, mode of operation, and technical basis of operation, or when the design change is so significant that a new generation of the device will be developed, and the data that were submitted with the original PMA are not applicable for the change in demonstrating a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.
De Novo classification

Medical device types that the FDA has not previously classified as Class I, II, or III are automatically classified into Class III regardless of the level of risk they pose. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a new route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, called the “Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” or the de novo classification procedure. This procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA. Prior to the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) in July 2012, a medical device could only be eligible for de novo classification if the manufacturer first submitted a 510(k) premarket notification and received a determination from the FDA that the device was not substantially equivalent. FDASIA streamlined the de novo classification pathway by permitting manufacturers to request de novo classification directly without first submitting a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA and receiving a not substantially equivalent determination.
Ongoing regulation by FDA
After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
•establishment registration and device listing with the FDA; 
 •the FDA’s QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, production, control, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process; 
 •labeling regulations, advertising and promotion requirements, restrictions on sale distribution or use of a device, each including the FDA general prohibition against the promotion of investigational products or promotion of approved or cleared products for any uses other than those authorized by the FDA, which are commonly known as “off label” uses; 
 •requirements related to promotional activities; 
 •clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices, or approval of certain modifications to PMA-approved devices;
 •medical device reporting (MDR) regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; 
 •FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulation; 
 •medical device corrections, recalls, and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufactures report to the FDA field corrections, recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by a device or to remedy a violation of the FD&C Act that may present a risk to health; 
 •device tracking requirements; and 
 •post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. Manufacturing processes for medical devices are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation, and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and complaint files. As a manufacturer, we are subject to periodic scheduled and unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of marketed products. The discovery of previously unknown problems with any marketed products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or approval, or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory clearance or approval of our products under development. 
 The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions:

•warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, and civil penalties; been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to various interpretations. Any action brought against us for violations of these laws or regulations, even successfully defended, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Also, we may be subject to private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers on behalf of the federal or state governments. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal, state and foreign laws described above or any other current or future fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, injunctions, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, and we could be required to curtail or cease our operations. Any of the foregoing consequences could seriously harm our business and our financial results.
 United States healthcare reform
Changes in healthcare policy could increase our costs and subject us to additional regulatory requirements that may interrupt commercialization of our current and future solutions. Changes in healthcare policy could increase our costs, decrease our revenue, and impact sales of and reimbursement for our current and future products. The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality, or expanding access. Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may limit coverage of or lower reimbursement for the procedures associated with the use of our products. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could impact our revenue from the sale of our products.
The implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (ACA) in the United States, for example, has changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers substantially, and affected medical device manufacturers significantly. The ACA, among other things, provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research, and implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians, and other providers to improve the coordination, quality, and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. Additionally, the ACA expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs and created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive, and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration or other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal and replace the ACA will impact the law or our business.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included reductions to CMS payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension implemented under various COVID-19 relief legislation from May 1, 2020 through the end of 2021, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced CMS payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
We believe that there will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators, and third-party payors to reduce costs while expanding individual healthcare benefits. Certain of these changes could impose additional limitations on the rates we will be able to charge for our current and future products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our current and future products from governmental agencies or third-party payors. Current and future healthcare reform legislation and policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.

 U.S. coverage and reimbursement
In the United States, our currently cleared products are not separately reimbursed by any third-party payors and if covered, are paid for as part of the surgical procedure. Our commercial success depends in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for the procedures during which our products are used. Because there is often no separate reimbursement for products used in surgical procedures, the additional cost associated with the use of our products can impact the profit margin of the hospital or ASC where the surgery is performed. As a result, failure by physicians, hospitals, ASCs, and other users of our products to obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures in which our products are used, or adverse changes in government and private third-party payors’ coverage and reimbursement policies, may adversely impact demand for our products.
The process for determining whether a third-party commercial payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. A third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be available. Additionally, in the United States there is no uniform policy among payors for coverage or reimbursement. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies, but also have their own methods and approval processes. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. If coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available, or are available only at limited levels, successful commercialization of, and obtaining a satisfactory financial return on, any product we develop may not be possible.
Third-party coverage and reimbursement for endometrial ablation and tissue resection procedures performed in the hospital, ASC or physician office setting is well established in the United States. These procedures are generally covered and reimbursed by private healthcare insurance and managed care payors. In general, the procedures using our products are generally billed by hospitals, ASCs and physicians using established Category I Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) billing codes. CPT codes are developed and maintained by the American Medical Association and used by physicians to report all professional services associated with the procedures using our products. CPT codes are also used by hospitals and ASCs to report the technical component associated with

these procedures. Procedures performed using our products are reimbursed differently depending on the place of service, as described in the following chart:
   
CPTCode* | Description* | Office-BasedProfessionalFee** | | Facility-BasedProfessionalFee** | | ASC FacilityFee** | HospitalOutpatientFacilityPayment**
58353 | Minerva ES – Endometrial ablation, thermal, without hysteroscopic guidance | | $1,057 | | $237 | | $1,863 | $4,410

Third-party payors regularly update reimbursement amounts and also from time to time revise the methodologies used to determine reimbursement amounts. This includes routine updates to payments to physicians, hospitals, and ASCs for procedures during which our products are used. These updates could directly impact the demand for our products. For example, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA), enacted on April 16, 2015, repealed the formula by which Medicare made annual payment adjustments to physicians and replaced the former formula with fixed annual updates and a new system of incentive payments that are based on various performance measures and physicians’ participation in alternative payment models such as accountable care organizations. While MACRA applies only to Medicare reimbursement, Medicaid and private payors often follow Medicare payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, and any reduction in Medicare reimbursement may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors, which may result in reduced demand for our products. However, there is no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement among payors in the United States. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for procedures can differ significantly from payor to payor.
We believe the overall escalating cost of medical products and services being paid for by the government and private health insurance has led to, and will continue to lead to, increased pressures on the healthcare and medical device industry to reduce the costs of products and services. Third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs through prospective reimbursement and capitation programs, group purchasing, redesign of benefits, and exploration of more cost-effective methods of delivering healthcare. In the United States, some insured individuals enroll in managed care programs, which monitor and often require pre-approval of the services that a member will receive. Some managed care programs pay their providers on a per capita

(patient) basis, which puts the providers at financial risk for the services provided to their patients by paying these providers a predetermined payment per member per month and, consequently, may limit the willingness of these providers to use our products. The marketability of our products may suffer if government and commercial third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
European Union medical devices landscape
The European Union (EU) has adopted numerous directives, regulations and standards regulating the design, manufacture, investigations, conformity assessment, labeling, and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Until recently, medical devices were regulated by Council Directive 93/42/EEC (the EU Medical Devices Directive). EU directives must be implemented into the national laws of the EU member states and national laws may vary from one member state to another. On May 25, 2017, Regulation 2017/745 (the EU Medical Devices Regulation), entered into force, which repeals and replaces the EU Medical Devices Directive. The Medical Devices Regulation was originally intended to become applicable three years after publication, but in April 2020 the transition period was extended by the European Parliament and the Council of the EU by an additional year—until May 26, 2021. Devices lawfully placed on the market pursuant to the EU Medical Devices Directive prior to May 26, 2021 may generally continue to be made available on the market or put into service until May 26, 2025. However, medical devices placed on the market after May 26, 2021 have to comply with the new requirements provided by the EU Medical Devices Regulation.
In the EU, there is currently no premarket government review of medical devices. However, the EU requires that all medical devices placed on the market in the EU must meet the relevant essential requirements laid down in Annex I of the EU Medical Devices Directive. The most fundamental essential requirement is that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that it will not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and others. In addition, the device must achieve the performances intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured, and packaged in a suitable manner. The European Commission has adopted various standards applicable to medical devices. These include standards governing common requirements, such as sterilization and safety of medical electrical equipment and product standards for certain types of medical devices. There are also harmonized standards relating to design and manufacture. While not mandatory, compliance with these standards is viewed as the easiest way to satisfy the essential requirements as a practical matter. Compliance with a standard developed to implement an essential requirement also creates a rebuttable presumption that the device satisfies that essential requirement.
To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements laid down in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Directive, medical device manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its (risk) classification. Conformity assessment procedures require an assessment of available clinical evidence, literature data for the product, and post-market experience in respect of similar products already marketed. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices), where the manufacturer can self-declare the conformity of its products with the essential requirements (except for any parts which relate to sterility or metrology), a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body. Notified bodies are independent organizations designated by EU member states to assess the conformity of devices before being placed on the market. A notified body would typically audit and examine a product’s technical dossiers and the manufacturers’ quality system (which must, in particular, comply with ISO 13485:2016 related to Medical Devices Quality Management Systems). If satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the relevant essential requirements, the notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the CE Mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EU.
Notified body certificates of conformity are valid for a fixed duration (which shall not exceed five years). Throughout the term of the certificate, the manufacturer will be subject to periodic surveillance audits to verify continued compliance with the applicable requirements. In particular, there will be a new audit by the notified body before it will renew the relevant certificate(s).
As a general rule, demonstration of conformity of medical devices and their manufacturers with the essential requirements must be based, among other things, on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use. Specifically, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use, that the known and foreseeable risks, and any adverse events, are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance, and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device are supported by suitable evidence. All manufacturers placing medical devices into the market in the EU must comply with the EU medical device vigilance system. Under this system, incidents must be reported to the relevant authorities of the EU member states, and manufacturers are required to take Field Safety Corrective Actions (FSCAs) to reduce a risk of death or serious deterioration in the state of health associated with the use of a medical device that is already placed on the market. An incident is defined as any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of a device, as well as any inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for use which, directly or indirectly, might lead to or might have led to the death of a patient or user or of other persons or to a serious deterioration in their state of health. An FSCA may include the recall, modification, exchange, destruction or retrofitting of the device.

FSCAs must be communicated by the manufacturer or its legal representative to its customers and/or to the end users of the device through Field Safety Notices.
The advertising and promotion of medical devices is subject to some general principles set forth by EU directives. According to the EU Medical Devices Directive, only devices that are CE-marked may be marketed and advertised in the EU in accordance with their intended purpose. Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, while not specific to the advertising of medical devices, also apply to the advertising thereof and contain general rules, for example requiring that advertisements are evidenced, balanced and not misleading. Specific requirements are defined at national level. EU member states laws related to the advertising and promotion of medical devices, which vary between jurisdictions, may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of products to the general public and may impose limitations on promotional activities with healthcare professionals.
On May 25, 2017, the EU Medical Devices Regulation entered into force and became applicable as of May 26, 2021. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EU member states, regulations are directly applicable, without the need for adoption of EU member state laws implementing them, in all EU member states and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EU member states. The EU Medical Devices Regulation, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EU for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation.
Among other things, the EU Medical Devices Regulation:
•strengthens the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available;
 •establishes explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance, and safety of devices placed on the market; 
 •improves the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number; 
 •sets up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals, and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU; and 
 •strengthens the rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market. 
 The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area (EEA), which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
Other international laws
In Europe, various countries have adopted anti-bribery laws providing for severe consequences in the form of criminal penalties and significant fines for individuals or companies committing a bribery offense. Violations of these anti-bribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation.
For instance, in the United Kingdom, under the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, a bribery occurs when a person offers, gives or promises to give a financial or other advantage to induce or reward another individual to improperly perform certain functions or activities, including any function of a public nature. Bribery of foreign public officials also falls within the scope of the U.K. Bribery Act 2010. An individual found in violation of the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, faces imprisonment of up to ten years. In addition, the individual can be subject to an unlimited fine, as can commercial organizations for failure to prevent bribery.
There are also international privacy laws that impose restrictions on the access, use, and disclosure of health information. All of these laws may impact our business. Our failure to comply with these privacy laws or significant changes in the laws restricting our ability to obtain required patient information could significantly impact our business and our future business plans.
Privacy and data protection laws
We are also subject to laws and regulations in non-U.S. countries covering data privacy and the protection of health-related and other personal information. EU member states and other jurisdictions have adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. Laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, disclosure, processing, and security of personal information that identifies or may be used to identify an individual, such as names, contact information, and sensitive personal data such as health data. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent revisions and differing interpretations and have generally become more stringent over time.
As of May 25, 2018, Regulation 2016/676, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaced the Data Protection Directive with respect to the processing of personal data in the European Union (the GDPR requirements are applicable in the EEA).

The GDPR imposes many requirements for controllers and processors of personal data. The GDPR allows EU member states to make additional laws and regulations further limiting the processing of genetic, biometric, or health data. Failure to comply with the requirements of GDPR and the applicable national data protection laws of the EU member states could subject us to regulatory sanctions, delays in investigations, criminal prosecution and/or civil fines or penalties (for certain violations of up to 4% of global annual revenue or €20 million, whichever is greater). Among other requirements, the GDPR regulates transfers of personal data subject to the GDPR to countries that have not been found to provide adequate protection to such personal data, including the United States, and the efficacy and longevity of current transfer mechanisms between the EU and the United States remains uncertain. For example, on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the EU, Europe’s highest court, held in the “Schrems II” case that the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, a mechanism for the transfer of personal data from the EU to the U.S., was invalid, and imposed additional obligations in connection with the use of standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission. Changes to the GDPR and applicable national data privacy laws, including with respect to how these laws should be applied in the context of investigations or other transactions from which we may gain access to personal data, could increase our compliance costs and exposure to potential liability.
Intellectual property
We actively seek to protect the intellectual property and proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, which includes seeking and maintaining patents covering our technology and products, proprietary processes and any other inventions that are commercially or strategically important to the development of our business. We also rely upon trademarks to build and maintain the integrity of our brand, and we seek to protect the confidentiality of our know how and trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business.
To protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, patent, and other intellectual property laws, employment, confidentiality and invention assignment agreements, and protective contractual provisions with our employees, contractors, consultants, advisors, suppliers, partners, and other third parties. We generally require out employees, contractors, consultants, and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment, consulting or advisory relationships with us. We also generally require our employees, contractors, consultants, and advisors who we work with on our products to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived during the scope of their work or services provided, using our property or resources or which related to our business. Despite any measures we take to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.

In May 2020, we acquired a portfolio of patents from BSC pursuant to the BSC Purchase Agreement. The patents acquired from BSC expire between March 2025 and October 2037. Some of the acquired patents were subject to a third-party license.
As part of the BSC Purchase Agreement, we also acquired licenses to patents that expire between June 2032 and March 2036. The patents and licenses acquired through the BSC Purchase Agreement cover our Symphion, Genesys HTA, and Resectr products.
We entered into a license agreement with Hermes Innovations, LLC (Hermes) in October 2008 (the Hermes License Agreement), pursuant to which Hermes has granted us a worldwide, exclusive, royalty-free license to certain of its patents related to tissue ablation to develop, manufacture, commercialize and otherwise exploit products covered by such patents, including our Minerva ES system, solely in the field of use of medical devices for treating a female patient’s uterus and fallopian tubes (Field of Use). Concurrently, we granted to Hermes a worldwide, perpetual, exclusive, irrevocable, paid-up, royalty-free license under all improvements we made between October 2008 and October 2011 relating to the licensed patent rights to develop, manufacture, commercialize, and otherwise exploit products covered by such improvements outside the Field of Use. In consideration for the license granted to us, we issued to Hermes 3,520,000 shares of our common stock. Hermes may terminate the Hermes License Agreement upon 60 days’ written notice to us in the event we materially breach any of our obligations thereunder and the breach remains uncured during such 60 days. The Hermes License Agreement will expire upon the cancellation or expiration of the last-to-expire patent licensed to us. The last to expire of these patents will expire in August 2029.
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 40 pending patent applications globally, including 21 in the United States and 19 outside the United States.
As of December 31, 2021, we had trademark registrations for “Minerva,” “Minerva ES”, “Symphion”, “Genesys HTA”, “Genesys HTA Procerva”, and “PlasmaSense” in the United States, and various other countries. Including these trademark registrations, our trademark portfolio contained 43 trademark registration applications.
The term of individual patents depends on the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a nonprovisional patent application in the applicable country. We cannot guarantee that patents will be issued from any of our pending applications or that, if patents are issued, they will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection for our technology. Notwithstanding the scope of the patent protection available to us, a competitor could develop treatment methods or devices that are not covered by our patents. Furthermore, numerous U.S. and foreign-issued patents and patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are developing products.
Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be applications unknown to us, which applications may later result in issued patents that our existing or future products or technologies may be alleged to infringe.
There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry. In the future, we may need to engage in litigation to enforce patents issued or licensed to us, to protect our trade secrets or know-how, to defend against claims of infringement of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. For example, we are in litigation with Hologic, Inc., involving one of our patents. Litigation could be costly and could divert our attention from other functions and responsibilities. Furthermore, even if our patents are found to be valid and infringed, a court may refuse to grant injunctive relief against the infringer and instead grant us monetary damages and/or ongoing royalties. Such monetary

compensation may be insufficient to adequately offset the damage to our business caused by the infringer’s competition in the market. For more information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” and “Item 3–Legal proceedings." below for more information on risks related to intellectual property litigation.
Adverse determinations in litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, could require us to seek licenses from third parties and could prevent us from manufacturing, selling, or using the product, any of which could severely harm our business.
We also seek to maintain certain intellectual property and proprietary know-how as trade secrets, and generally require our partners to execute non-disclosure agreements prior to any substantive discussions or disclosures of our technology or business plans. For more information, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Facilities
Our corporate headquarters, research and development facilities, and manufacturing and distribution centers are located at 4255 Burton Drive, Santa Clara, CA 95054. The facility is approximately 32,719 square feet and is compliant with all relevant state and federal requirements. Our lease on this facility runs through May 2023. We do not own any real property and believe that our current facilities are sufficient to meet our ongoing needs for at least the next two years and that, if we require additional space, we will be able to obtain additional facilities on commercially reasonable terms.
Human capital resources
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing, and integrating our existing and new employees and consultants into our company. As of December 31, 2021, we have 157 full-time employees in U.S. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good. We believe that our diverse backgrounds, unique strengths, talents, and viewpoints make up the fabric of a strong culture. We strive to maintain an environment which is collaborative, and provides for open communication and mutual respect.
Our people and culture objectives include identifying, recruiting, retaining, and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors, and consultants into our company and culture. We offer what we believe is an attractive mix of cash and stock-based compensation and benefit plans to support our employees and their families’ physical, mental, and financial well-being. Our compensation programs also help to increase stockholder value and contribute to the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our short- and long-term business goals. We have developed an equitable, merit-based total compensation and rewards program for our employees. Below are some of the benefits offered to employees, most of which become effective shortly following their start date:
•medical, dental and vision insurance; 
 •401K retirement plan; 
 •flexible spending accounts for medical expenses, childcare, parking, and transit; 
 •health savings accounts (with employer contribution); 
 •life insurance;
 •short & long-term disability; 
 •voluntary benefits; 
 •paid time off and leave of absences; 
 •employee assistance program; and 
 •wellness program. 
 We believe our personal and professional growth and development is key to our success. We invest in training, education and coaching for our employees. Our commercial team employees initially train for three weeks and subsequently continue ongoing professional development throughout their tenure to support our customers with high standards of quality and service.
We are also committed to providing a work environment that is free of discrimination and harassment. We are an equal-opportunity employer. We make employment decisions on the basis of a person’s qualifications, and our business needs. We believe in the richness and quality of a working environment that is diverse and inclusive.
Employee safety is a continuing priority. We provide assessment, identification, and implementation of measures to support the health and safety of our employees via our safety committee and external partners. We have maintained strict protocols and provided personal protective equipment during the pandemic to continue to successfully operate within the recommended CDC and local county health department guidelines.

Minerva Surgical, Inc.
Notes to Financial Statements
 1. Formation and Business of the Company
The Company
Minerva Surgical, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated in the state of Delaware on November 3, 2008. The Company's headquarters are in Santa Clara, California. The Company is a medical device company that develops therapeutic devices that treat abnormal uterine bleeding in a minimally invasive manner. The Company commenced commercial introduction of its products in the United States in 2015 following the clearance by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
In May 2020, the Company acquired certain assets from Boston Scientific Corporation (BSC) to broaden its product offerings to its customers. The Company derives all of its revenue from sales to customers in the United States through a direct sales force.
Initial Public Offering
On October 21, 2021, the Company's registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333- 259832) relating to its initial public offering (IPO) of common stock became effective. The Company issued and sold 6,250,000 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $12.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $75.0 million. The Company received $69.8 million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. The total IPO offering costs other than underwriting discounts and commissions were $3.2 million. All expenses incurred in connection with the Company's IPO had been paid as of December 31, 2021.
In connection with the completion of its IPO, on October 21, 2021, the Company's certificate of incorporation was amended and restated to provide for 100,000,000 authorized shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 per share and 5,000,000 authorized shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.001 per share.
Immediately prior to the IPO, $79.2 million in aggregate outstanding principal and accrued interest of the convertible notes converted into 7,006,228 shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock at a conversion price of $11.31 per share. Also, immediately prior to the closing, all outstanding shares of the Company's redeemable convertible preferred stock (including those issued upon conversion of the convertible notes) converted into 19,404,066 shares of common stock which resulted in the reclassification of the carrying value of the preferred stock to common stock and additional paid-in capital.
Liquidity
The Company incurred a net loss of $21.5 million and $18.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and had an accumulated deficit of $249.6 million as of December 31, 2021. The Company had cash and cash equivalents of $40.6 million as of December 31, 2021.
The Company has incurred significant operational losses since inception and expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. Historically, the Company’s activities have been financed through private placements of equity securities and debt. On October 21, 2021, the Company completed an IPO and received approximately $69.8 million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions.
Management believes that the Company’s existing cash and cash equivalents allow the Company to finance its operations for at least the next 12 months from the date of issuance of these financial statements.
Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic downturn have impacted business conditions in the industry in which the Company operates. Beginning in March 2020, the Company’s net sales were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs) delayed or canceled elective procedures. In response to the pandemic, many state and local governments in the U.S. issued orders that temporarily precluded elective procedures in order to conserve scarce health system resources. The decrease in hospital and ASCs admission rates and elective surgeries reduced both the number of patients being evaluated for treatment with and demand for elective procedures using the Company's products.
In March 2020, the governor of California, where the Company’s headquarters are located, issued “stay at home” orders limiting non-essential activities, travel and business operations. Such orders or restrictions have resulted in reduced operations at the Company’s headquarters (including manufacturing facility), work stoppages, slowdowns and delays, travel restrictions and cancellation of events and have restricted the efforts of the Company’s sales representatives, thereby significantly and negatively impacting the Company’s operations. These orders and restrictions have significantly decreased the number of procedures performed using the Company’s products and otherwise negatively impacted sales and operations.
 
The Company experienced a second wave of slower than expected revenue growth in the second half of 2021 when certain state governments responding to a second wave of COVID-19 infection rates, reinstated hospital and ASC closures for elective procedures.
The Company has taken necessary precautions to safeguard its employees, patients, customers, and other stakeholders from the COVID-19 pandemic, while maintaining business continuity to support its patients, customers and employees. The timing, extent and continuation of any increase in procedures, and any corresponding increase in sales of the Company’s products, and whether there could be a future decrease in the current level of procedures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, remain uncertain and are subject to a variety of factors.
The Company is continuing to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its employees and customers and on the markets in which it operates and will take further actions that the Company considers prudent to address the COVID-19 pandemic, while ensuring that it can support its customers and continue to develop its products.
The ultimate extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company is highly uncertain and subject to change. This impact may result in a material, adverse impact on liquidity, capital resources, supply chain, operations and revenue and may affect third parties in which the Company relies and could worsen over time. The extent of the continuing resurgence of COVID-19, the efficacy and extent of distribution of vaccines, and the impact of variants of COVID-19 is unpredictable.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of presentation
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).
Reverse Stock Split
On October 14, 2021, the Company effected a 1-for-6.046 reverse stock split of its outstanding common stock and redeemable convertible preferred stock. Upon the effectiveness of the reverse stock split, all issued and outstanding shares of common stock options to purchase common stock, warrants, instruments convertible to shares, redeemable convertible preferred stock and related share data and per share amounts contained in the accompanying financial statements were retroactively revised to reflect this reverse stock split for all periods presented. The par value of the authorized stock was not adjusted as a result of the reverse stock split.

Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Although these estimates are based on the Company’s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately materially differ from these estimates and assumptions.
Significant estimates and assumptions include accounts receivable allowances, inventory allowances, recoverability of long-term assets, valuation of equity instruments and equity-linked instruments, valuation of common stock, stock-based compensation, valuation of the redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability and derivative liabilities, valuation and estimated useful lives of intangible assets, deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances, and impact of contingencies.
Segments
The Company operates and manages its business as one reportable and operating segment, which is the business of research, development, and sale of therapeutic devices for abnormal uterine bleeding treatment. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer, who is the chief operating decision maker, reviews financial information on an aggregate basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance.

Fair value of financial instruments
The carrying amounts of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities, approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. Based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for debt with similar terms and consideration of default and credit risk, the carrying value of the term loans approximate their fair values and is classified as a Level 2 liability.

Concentration of credit risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of risk consist principally of cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents balances with established financial institutions and, at times, such balances with any one financial institution may be in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insured limits.
 
The Company earns revenue from sale of disposable devices and controllers to customers such as hospitals, ACS and physician offices. The Company’s accounts receivable are derived from revenue earned from customers. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and generally requires no collateral from its customers. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and for the years then ended, no customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable or revenue.
Concentration of suppliers
The Company purchases certain components of its products from a single or small number of suppliers. A change in or loss of these suppliers could cause a delay in filling customer orders and a possible loss of sales, which could adversely affect results of operations; however, management believes that suitable replacement suppliers could be obtained in such an event.

Cash and cash equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents, which include money market funds.

Restricted cash
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, cash of $7.8 million was restricted from withdrawal. Restricted cash consists of collateral for letters of credit issued in connection with litigation, real estate leases, and corporate credit cards (See Note 9).

Accounts receivable and allowances

Accounts receivable are generally from hospitals and ASCs and are stated at amounts billed less allowances for doubtful accounts. The Company continually monitors customer payments and maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from a customer’s inability to make required payments. The Company considers factors such as historical experience, credit quality, age of the accounts receivable balances, geographic-related risks and economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay. Accounts receivable are written off when the Company deems individual balances are no longer collectible. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, accounts receivable is presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $0.5 million and $0.4 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded a provision for bad debts of less than $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively.
Inventory
Inventory consist primarily of disposable devices, controllers, and components as raw materials and finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using standard cost based on the first-in, first-out method (FIFO) for all inventories. The Company periodically assesses the recoverability of all inventories to determine whether adjustments for impairment are required. The Company evaluates the related commercial mix of finished goods and other general obsolescence and impairment criteria in assessing the recoverability of the Company’s inventory and records a provision for excess, expired, and obsolete inventory based primarily on estimates of forecasted revenues. A significant change in the timing or level of demand for products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provision for excess, expired, and obsolete inventory in the future. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company did not record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory.

Property and equipment, net
Property and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets (two to seven years) or the lease term of the leasehold improvements, whichever is lower. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, and improvements and betterments are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the balance sheet and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the statements of operations in the period such gain or loss is realized.

Intangible assets
Intangible assets arising from business combinations, such as trade names, customer relationships and developed technology, are initially recorded at estimated fair value. Amortization is computed over the estimated useful life of each asset on a straight-line basis. The Company determines the useful lives of identifiable intangible assets after considering the facts and circumstances related to each intangible asset. Factors the Company considers when determining useful lives include the contractual term of any agreement related to the asset, the historical performance of the asset, the Company’s long-term strategy for using the asset, any laws or other local regulations which could impact the useful life of the asset and other economic factors, including competition and specific market conditions.
 
The useful lives of the major intangible asset classes are as follows:


Trademarks | 6.5
Developed technology | 10 
Customer relationships | 3 

Business combination
Business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method. The Company recognizes the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition. Contingent consideration is recorded at fair value as measured on the date of acquisition. The value recorded is based on estimates of future financial projections under various potential scenarios using a Monte Carlo simulation. These cash flow projections are discounted with an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability is remeasured at each reporting period with the change in the fair value recorded as a component of operating expenses in the statements of operations until the underlying contingency is resolved. The estimates used to determine the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are subject to significant judgment and actual results are likely to differ from the amounts originally recorded.
The Company assesses the fair value of assets acquired, including intangible assets, and liabilities assumed using a variety of methods. Each asset acquired and liability assumed is measured at fair value from the perspective of a market participant. The method used to estimate the fair values of intangible assets incorporates significant estimates and assumptions regarding the estimates a market participant would make in order to evaluate an asset, including a market participant’s use of the asset, future cash inflows and outflows, probabilities of success, asset lives, and the appropriate discount rates.
The Company uses the income approach to determine the fair value of developed technology acquired in a business combination. This approach determines fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to the respective asset over its useful life and then discounting these after-tax cash flows back to a present value. The Company bases its revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes, expected market growth rates, expected trends in technology and expected product introductions by competitors. Developed technology represents patented and unpatented technology and know-how.
The Company also uses the income approach, as described above, to determine the estimated fair value of certain other identifiable intangible assets including customer relationships and trade names. Customer relationships represent established relationships with customers, which provide a ready channel for the sale of additional products and services. Trade names represent acquired company and product names.
Any excess fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired over the purchase price is recorded as bargain purchase gain in the statements of operations at the acquisition closing date. During the measurement period, which extends no later than one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record certain adjustments to the carrying value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. After the measurement period, all adjustments are recorded in the statements of operations as operating expenses or income.
Transaction costs and restructuring costs associated with a business combination are expensed as incurred.

Impairment of long-lived assets
The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset or asset group to the future net cash flows which the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If such asset or asset group is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group. There has been no impairment of long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.

Leases
The Company leases its facilities and meets the requirements to account for these leases as operating leases. The Company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable lease term. Where leases contain escalation clauses, rent abatements or concessions, such as rent holidays and landlord or tenant incentives or allowances, the Company applies them in the determination of straight-line rent expense over the lease term.
The Company records the difference between the rent paid and the straight-line rent as a deferred rent liability.

Redeemable convertible preferred stock
The Company records all shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock at their respective fair values on the dates of issuance, net of issuance costs. The redeemable convertible preferred stock is recorded outside of permanent equity because while it is not mandatorily redeemable, in certain events considered not solely within the Company’s control, such as a merger, acquisition or sale of
 
all or substantially all of the Company’s assets (each, a deemed liquidation event), the redeemable convertible preferred stock will become redeemable at the option of the holders of at least a majority of the then-outstanding preferred shares. All outstanding shares of the convertible preferred stock converted into common stock upon effectiveness of the IPO.

Redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants and common stock warrants
Freestanding preferred stock warrants are accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) ASU Topic 480, Distiguishing Liabilities from Equity (ASC 480) and classified as liabilities on the balance sheet because the underlying preferred stock shares are redeemable upon occurrence of a deemed liquidation event.
Preferred stock warrants are subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date with the change in fair value, if any, recognized in other income (expense), net in the statements of operations.
All outstanding preferred stock warrants converted into common stock warrants upon effectiveness of the IPO. Upon closing of the IPO, the warrant liability was reclassified to additional paid-in capital as the common stock warrants meet all criteria for equity classification.

Derivative liabilities
Embedded derivatives that are required to be bifurcated from their host contract are evaluated and valued separately from the debt instrument. Under the Company’s Credit Agreement (the Ares Agreement) with Ares Capital Corporation and Ares Direct Finance I LP (collectively Ares) (Note 8), upon the occurrence of specified prepayment trigger events, including a default or a change in control, the Company may be required to make mandatory prepayments of the borrowings. The prepayment premium is considered an embedded derivative, as the holder of the loan may exercise the option to require prepayment by the Company. The mandatory prepayment derivative liability is recorded at fair value upon entering into the Ares Agreement and is subject to remeasurement to fair value at each balance sheet date, with any changes in fair value recognized in the statements of operations.
The Company’s convertible notes contain embedded features (Note 8)—a qualified financing put, non-qualified financing put, and change of control put features—that are bifurcated and accounted for as derivative liabilities and recorded as a debt discount on the note issuance date. Debt discount is reported as a direct deduction to the carrying amount of the convertible notes and amortized using the effective interest rate over the life of the convertible notes as interest expense. The embedded derivative features are recorded at fair value upon entering into the note purchase agreements and are subject to remeasurement to fair value at each balance sheet date, with any changes in fair values recognized in the statements of operations.
In connection with execution of the CIBC Agreement, the Company entered into a separate Success Fee Agreement with CIBC (see Note 8). In the event of a sale or other disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of its assets, a merger or consolidation, or an initial public offering (a Liquidity Event), before the termination of the agreement, the Company agreed to pay a fee to CIBC equal to $0.4 million (Success Fee). This agreement has been identified as a freestanding derivative and is subject to remeasurement to its fair value at each reporting date or repayment or expiration, with any changes in fair values recognized in the statements of operations. In connection with the IPO, the derivative liability was settled upon the Company paying the Success Fee of $0.4 million to CIBC pursuant to the Success Fee Agreement.

Debt discount
The Company records the value of original issuance discounts, issuance costs, and discounts attributable to warrants or bifurcated derivatives associated with debt on issuance, as a debt discount, which is presented net of the outstanding balance of debt on the balance sheet and amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the borrowing term using the effective interest method.

Revenue recognition
The Company generates revenue primarily from the sale of disposable devices and controllers that treat the root causes of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB). The Company invoices hospitals, ASCs, and physician offices for the sold products and pays commissions to the sales representatives.
The Company also provides controllers to customers under evaluation and long-term placement agreements. Under these agreements, the Company delivers the controller to the customer’s facility without a fee and the customer agrees to purchase disposable products at a stated price over the term of the agreement. The Company retains title to the controllers. The Company, in general, does not enforce a minimum purchase requirement under these agreements. Terms of the long-term placement agreements range from several months to multiple years and may be extended or terminated upon mutual agreement. These types of agreements include an embedded lease, which is generally a cancellable operating lease, for the right to use a controller. The Company also offers extended warranty agreements to customers for controller defects, malfunctions, or system failures.
 
In line with ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), revenue is recognized when the customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of Topic 606, the Company performs the following five steps:
(i)identify the contract(s) with a customer;
(ii)identify the performance obligations in the contract;
(iii)determine the transaction price;
(iv)allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
(v)recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies performance obligations.
A contract with a customer exists when (i) the Company enters into a legally enforceable contract with a customer that defines each party’s rights regarding the products to be transferred and identifies the payment terms related to these products, (ii) the contract has commercial substance and (iii) the Company determines that collection of substantially all consideration for products that are transferred is probable based on the customer’s intent and ability to pay the promised consideration. The Company identifies performance obligations in contracts with customers, which may include its products and implied promise to provide the free leased controller. The transaction price is determined based on the amount the Company is expected to be entitled to in exchange for transferring the promised products to the customer. The Company is entitled to the total consideration for the products ordered by customers, net of transaction price adjustments. The Company’s payment terms to customers are generally net 30 days. Payment terms fall within the guidance for the practical expedient which allows the Company to forgo adjustment of the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component. The Company excludes taxes assessed by governmental authorities on revenue-producing transactions from the measurement of the transaction price.
Assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, revenue is recognized when control of the Company’s products transfers to the customer. For sales where the Company’s sales representative hand delivers products directly to the hospital or ASC, control transfers to the customer upon such delivery. For sales where products are shipped, control is transferred either upon shipment or delivery of the products to the customer, depending on the shipping terms and conditions. The Company recognizes revenue that has been allocated to free leased controllers concurrent with the sale of disposable devices as the lease is cancellable by either party with 30 days’ notice. The amounts allocated to leased controllers are insignificant. As permitted under the practical expedient, the Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less.
The Company accepts product returns at its discretion or if the product is defective as manufactured. Historically, the actual product returns have been insignificant. However, if returns should be become material, the Company will use the expected-value method for estimating returns based on historical data. The Company elected to treat shipping and handling costs as a fulfillment cost and includes them in the cost of goods sold as incurred. In those cases where the Company bills shipping and handling costs to customers, it will classify the amounts billed as revenue.
Extended warranty arrangements are recognized ratably over the extended warranty period. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 warranty revenue was $0.1 million and less than $0.1 million, and considered insignificant.
The Company’s contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue for remaining performance obligations by the Company to the customer after delivery, which is $0.1 million as of December 31, 2021. Deferred revenue as of December 31, 2020 was $0.2 million, which was recognized as revenue in 2021.

Contract costs
The Company applies the practical expedient to recognize the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as expense when incurred because the expense is incurred at a point in time and the amortization period is less than one year, as the Company does not enter into long-term sales contracts. These incremental costs include sales commissions paid to the Company’s independent sales agents or internal sales representatives. Commissions are recorded as selling expenses.

Cost of goods sold
The Company manufactures certain products at its facility and purchases other products from third-party manufacturers. Cost of goods sold consists primarily of the third-party manufacturing costs, materials and assembly, direct labor, and charges for excess, obsolete, and non-sellable inventory. Cost of goods sold also includes allocated overhead for indirect labor, depreciation, rent, and information technology.

 
Product warranties
The Company generally offers a one-year warranty for its products. The Company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect the Company’s warranty reserves include the number of units sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty repairs and the cost per repair. The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of the warranty reserve and adjusts the amount as necessary. Costs to perform warranty obligations were less than $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.

Research and development
Research and development (R&D) expenses are charged to operations when incurred. Research and development costs include, but are not limited to, payroll and personnel expenses, laboratory supplies, consulting costs, and allocated overhead, including rent, equipment, depreciation, and utilities.

Income taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities used for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax reporting purposes and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in the provision for income taxes.
The Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company considers many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets, including recent earnings results, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods available and other relevant factors. The Company records changes in the required valuation allowance in the period that the determination is made.
The Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available as of the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company records the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50.0% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company does not recognize a tax benefit in the financial statements. The Company records interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions, if applicable, as a component of income tax expense (benefit).

Stock-based compensation
We have granted stock-based awards, consisting of stock options restricted stock units to employees and certain non-employee consultants and certain members of our board of directors.
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation arrangements with employees and non-employees using a fair value method which requires the recognition of compensation expense for costs related to all stock-based payments including stock options and restricted stock units. The fair value method requires the Company to estimate the fair value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. We use the fair value of our common stock to determine the fair value of restricted stock awards.
The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted that are expensed on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. Option valuation models, including the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, require the input of several assumptions. Changes in the assumptions used can materially affect the grant-date fair value of an award. These assumptions include the risk-free rate of interest, expected dividend yield, expected volatility and the expected life of the award.

Net loss per share attributable to common stockholders
Basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders, by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, without consideration for potentially dilutive securities. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares and potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the period. For purposes of the diluted net loss per share calculation, redeemable convertible preferred stock, redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants, convertible notes, common stock subject to repurchase, restricted stock units and common stock options are considered to be potentially dilutive securities. Basic and diluted net loss attributable to common stockholders per share is presented in conformity with the two-class method required for participating securities as the redeemable convertible preferred stock is considered a participating security because it participates in dividends with
 
common stock. The Company also considers the shares issued upon the early exercise of stock options subject to repurchase to be participating securities, because holders of such shares have non-forfeitable dividend rights in the event a dividend is paid on common stock. The holders of all series of redeemable convertible preferred stock do not have a contractual obligation to share in the Company’s losses. As such, the net loss was attributed entirely to common stockholders. Because the Company has reported a net loss for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, diluted net loss per common share is the same as basic net loss per common share for the periods presented.

JOBS Act accounting election
The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, (the JOBS Act) permits an “emerging growth company” to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. The Company has elected to use this extended transition period under the JOBS Act. As a result, its financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of issuers who are required to comply with the effective dates for new or revised accounting standards that are applicable to public companies, which may make comparison of our financials to those of other public companies more difficult.

3. Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework—Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, which modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. The new disclosure requirements include disclosure related to changes in unrealized gains or losses included in other comprehensive income (loss) for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements held at the end of each reporting period and the explicit requirement to disclose the range and weighted-average of significant unobservable inputs used for Level 3 fair value measurements. This ASU removes the requirement to disclose: the amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy; the policy for timing of transfers between levels; and the valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements. For all entities, this ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2018-13 as of January 1, 2020, and the adoption had no material impact on the Company’s financial statements.

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (ASC 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The standard eliminates the need for an organization to analyze whether the following apply in a given period: (1) the exception to the incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation; (2) the exceptions to accounting for basis differences when there are ownership changes in foreign investments; and (3) the exception in interim periods income tax accounting for year-to-date losses that exceed anticipated losses. The ASU also is designed to improve financial statement preparers’ application of income tax-related guidance and simplify U.S. GAAP for (1) franchise taxes that are partially based on income, (2) transactions with a government that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill, (3) separate financial statements of legal entities that are not subject to tax, (4) enacted changes in tax laws in interim periods and (5) certain income tax accounting for employee stock ownership plans and affordable housing projects. The Company adopted ASU 2019-12 on January 1, 2021 on a prospective basis. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.

Recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors). In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-10 Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases, which provides clarification to ASU 2016-02. In March 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-01, which provides clarification on implementation issues associated with adopting ASU 2016-02. These ASUs (collectively, the new leasing standard) requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, respectively. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Topic 842 provides a lessee with an option to not account for leases with a term of 12 month or less as leases in the scope of the new standard. Topic 842 supersedes the previous leases standard, Topic 840, Leases.
In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements, which allows entities to elect an optional transition practical expedient package where entities may continue to apply the existing lease guidance during the comparative periods and apply the new lease requirements through a cumulative effect adjustment in the period of adoption rather than in the earliest period presented. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2022, using the modified retrospective approach with a cumulative effect adjustment to the accumulated deficit at the beginning of the period of adoption. Topic 842 will impact the Company’s financial statements as the Company has certain operating lease arrangements for which the Company is the lessee. As permitted by the standard, the Company elected the transition practical expedient package, which among other things,
 
allows the carryforward of historical lease classifications. The adoption of this accounting standard update is also expected to impact the Company’s financial statement disclosures. While the Company is finalizing its evaluation of the impact of adopting this accounting standard update on its financial statements and related disclosures, the Company expects to recognize on its balance sheet for associated leases a new right of use (ROU) asset of approximately $0.9 million and a new operating lease liability of approximately $1.2 million.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost. This ASU replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected loss model. It also eliminates the concept of other-than-temporary impairment and requires credit losses related to available-for-sale debt securities to be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities. These changes will result in earlier recognition of credit losses. For public business entities that meet the definition of a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filer, excluding entities eligible to be smaller reporting companies as defined by the SEC, adoption is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For SEC filers that are eligible to be smaller reporting companies and for all other entities, this ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on its financial statements and related disclosures.
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity. This ASU simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts on an entity’s own equity. Specifically the ASU removes: (1) major separation models required under GAAP and (2) certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, which will permit more equity contract to qualify for the exception. For public business entities that meet the definition of an SEC filer, excluding entities eligible to be smaller reporting companies as defined by the SEC, this ASU is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2021. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU on the Company’s financial statements and related disclosures.

For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, approximately 99.0% of the Company’s revenue is subject to point-in-time recognition for single-use (disposable) products and capital equipment sales. Sale of extended warranties on capital equipment represents less than 1.0% of the Company’s revenue. In addition, more than 98.0% of the Company’s total revenue is derived from the sale of single-use (disposable) products; therefore, the Company did not include disaggregated revenue data to present the amounts attributed to capital equipment, associated warranties, and miscellaneous revenue separately.

5. Fair value measurements
ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best
115
 
information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC 820 are described below:
Level 1—Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access as of the measurement date.
Level 2—Inputs are observable, unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities.
Level 3—Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability only used when there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. This hierarchy requires the Company to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value.
Assets and Liabilities Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis—Financial assets held by the Company measured at fair value on a recurring basis include money market funds which are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy as the inputs used to measure fair value are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Derivative liabilities, contingent consideration liability and redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liabilities are remeasured at fair value as of each reporting period (See Notes 8 and 11).
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires management to make judgments and consider factors specific to the asset or liability.
Fair value of assets and liabilities
The following tables summarize the types of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):

Redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability | | — | | | — | | 42 | | 42 
Total financial liabilities | $ | — | | $ | — | $ | 61,716 | $ | 61,716

  
The redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because it is valued using the Black-Scholes pricing model, which requires subjective unobservable inputs (See Note 11).

Contingent consideration related to the BSC development and revenue milestones is recorded at fair value as measured on the date of acquisition. The value recorded is based on estimates of future financial projections under various potential scenarios using a Monte Carlo simulation, and is subject to remeasurement to fair value at each balance sheet date, with any changes in fair value recognized in general and administrative expense, in the statements of operations.
The fair value of the mandatory prepayment derivative liability, as a result of a change in control, was calculated using the “with and without” methodology at loan issuance. The “with and without” methodology involves valuing the term loan on an as-is basis and then valuing the term loan without the embedded derivatives. The difference between the value of the term loan with the embedded derivatives and the value without each individual embedded derivative equals the fair value of the embedded derivative. On the
116
 
subsequent dates, the Company used an income approach to value the term loan derivative liabilities, where the proceeds to the lenders were estimated, adjusted by the opportunity cost of the lenders for foregoing the debt portion of the instrument. Upon repayment of the Ares Loan in October 2021, the mandatory prepayment derivative liability had no value, because the Company assessed the probability of change in control event to be zero after the IPO (See Note 8).
The Company valued the convertible notes derivative liabilities using the income approach, where the proceeds to the convertible noteholders were estimated under different future scenarios, adjusted by the opportunity cost of the convertible noteholders for foregoing the debt portion of the instrument. Each outcome was probability-weighted based on future estimates.

The convertible notes derivative liabilities were determined using the following assumptions:


 | December 31,
 | 2020 
Expected exit date | 6/30/2022 
Discount rate | 21.0% 


Upon the closing of the IPO in October 2021, the 2018, 2019, and 2020 Notes converted into Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock pursuant to automatic conversion feature of the convertible notes (See Note 8). Due to the conversion of the 2018, 2019, and 2020 Notes, the associated derivative liabilities were revalued and extinguished with the change in fair value recorded as other income in the Company’s Statement of Operations.

As of December 31, 2020, the estimated fair value of the aggregate outstanding derivative instrument associated with the convertible notes was $33.5 million.
The change in fair value of the redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability, derivative liabilities and contingent consideration liability are summarized below (in thousands)

7. Business Combination
On May 11, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of certain Intrauterine Health products consisting of the Genesys HTA System, Symphion Tissue Removal System, and the Resectr Tissue Resection Device (the acquired IUH products) from BSC. This transaction was accounted for as a business combination.
The acquisition included transition services that were provided to Minerva by BSC—these services were to transition the processes necessary to conduct business activities including operating, management, and administrative activities. Also, the Company acquired all supply and consulting contracts relating to the acquired IUH products.
The Company accounted for the acquisition of the acquired IUH products under the acquisition method, that requires the assets and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition to be recorded in the financial statements at their respective fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of fair value of the acquired net assets over the purchase price reflected a bargain purchase gain of $0.6 million. The acquired IUH products results of operations are included in the 2020 financial statements from the date of acquisition. The revenue for the acquired IUH products contributed $16.9 million, or 44.7%, of the total revenue from the acquisition date of May 12, 2020 to December 31, 2020.
The determination of the estimated fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. The Company determined the fair value by applying established valuation techniques, based on information that management believed to be relevant to this determination. The Company assessed the fair values of acquired intangible assets, inventory, fixed assets, warranty liability, and purchase consideration including equity-based consideration and contingent consideration.
 
The summary of the purchase consideration is as follows (in thousands, except shares and per share amounts):

Closing stock consideration —1,331,411 shares of Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock at $2.06 per share | $ | 2,737 
Cash consideration | | 15,000
Delayed cash consideration | | 15,000
Development Milestone payment (a) | | 8,615 
Revenue Milestone payments (b) | | 15,227
Total purchase consideration | $ | 56,579

The Company estimated the fair value of shares of Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock as $2.06 per share, or $2.7 million, at the closing date. The Company used the market approach for guideline public companies, guideline transactions, and discounted cash flow methods equally weighted to estimate the total Company’s equity fair value and used the option pricing model to identify the fair value of the newly issued Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock.
Contingent consideration consists of the following:
(a)Development milestone payment—The Company is required to deliver a development-based milestone payment equal to $10.0 million, which was earned when BSC delivered into finished goods inventory the required amount of Symphion controllers, at least 50% of which fully incorporated certain design revisions (the Development Milestone). As of the acquisition date, the Company estimated that there was a 90.0% probability that the Development Milestone would be achieved within 16 months, and the earliest it would be achieved would be the end of March 2021, with May 2021 being the most likely timeframe when the Development Milestone would be achieved. The Company has agreed that this milestone was earned. The Company recorded its estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration liability for the Development Milestone payment utilizing a discounted cash flow model to determine the present value of the expected value of Development Milestone payment. The Development Milestone was paid in November 2021 upon the completion of the Company's IPO, together with the delayed cash purchase consideration. 
(b)Revenue milestone payments—The Company is required to make two revenue milestone payments to BSC, which are contingent on the achievement of certain revenue levels from the acquired product lines in 2021 and 2022. The first revenue milestone payment of $5.0 million is payable if net revenue from the acquired IUH products is less than or equal to $30.0 million in calendar year 2021, and an additional $5.0 million if net revenue is greater than $30.0 million in calendar year 2021 (the First Revenue Milestone). The First Revenue Milestone payment of $5.0 million will be paid within the first three months of 2022. The second revenue milestone payment of $5.0 million is payable if net revenue from the acquired IUH products exceeds $30.0 million in calendar year 2022 or $10.0 million if net revenue is greater than $37.0 million in calendar year 2022 (the Second Revenue Milestone). As of December 31, 2020, based on the revenue forecast of the acquired product lines through 2022, the Company ran a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate risk-neutral future revenue outcomes based on the estimated discount rate applicable to the revenue and the revenue volatility selected based on the guideline public companies. The Company recorded its estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration liability for revenue milestone payments utilizing the discounted cash flow model to determine the present value of the expected value of the future Revenue Milestone Payments. As of December 31, 2021, the Company recorded its fair value estimate of the contingent consideration liability utilizing the probability of achieving the defined Revenue milestone payments based primarily on updated revenue forecasts.
The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration was based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represented a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement. The fair value measurement for the revenue milestones is directly impacted by the Company’s estimate of future incremental revenue growth of the business. Accordingly, if actual revenue growth is higher or lower than the estimates within the fair value measurement, the Company would record additional charges or benefits, respectively. Each reporting period, the Company will be required to remeasure the fair value of the contingent consideration liability as assumptions change with the change in fair value recorded in general and administrative expenses in the statements of operations.
 
The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price based on the estimated fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities as of May 12, 2020 (in thousands):
   
Net assets acquired: | | 
Inventory | $ | 7,846 
Other receivable | | 271 
Property and equipment | | 999 
Trade names | | 3,969 
Customer relationships | | 13,466
Developed technology | | 30,819
Warranty liability | | (16) 
Deferred tax liability | | (132) 
Negative goodwill | | (643) 
Purchase price | $ | 56,579

Negative goodwill of $0.6 million represents the excess of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed over the purchase consideration. The Company recorded negative goodwill of $0.6 million as a bargain purchase gain in the statements of operations at the acquisition closing date. Before recognizing a gain on bargain purchase, the Company reassessed and concluded that it had identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed. In addition, the Company reviewed the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognized with respect to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as the aggregate consideration transferred. The objective of the review was to ensure that the measurements appropriately reflected all available information as of the acquisition date. Based on this review, the Company concluded that the fair value of the consideration transferred in the acquisition of IUH products was less than the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired, resulting in the $0.6 million gain recognized in connection with the acquisition. The bargain purchase gain resulted primarily from a favorable fair value at the date of acquisition as compared with the Company’s purchase price. The Company identified the following primary factors leading to the bargain purchase gain, which presented the Company with a favorable environment to negotiate pricing and purchase terms, which environment may not have been available had these factors not been present: (1) the Company believes it was the only party desiring to purchase the business; (2) BSC desired to sell the business as evidenced by their reduction in resources and staff dedicated to the business during the 12 months prior to the acquisition; and (3) overall economic environment around the uncertainty of when or if the business would recover from revenue declines resulting from hospital and ASCs restrictions due to COVID-19.
Negative goodwill is not taxable and acquired intangible assets are deductible for income tax purposes. Allocating the bargain purchase price to the assets acquired under the residual method results in a deferred tax liability of $0.1 million which represents the book to tax differences on other assets and liabilities acquired.
Acquired inventory included raw material and finished goods inventory. The fair value of finished goods inventory was measured by using a top-down approach, which starts with a market participant‘s estimated selling price, adjusted for both (1) the costs of the selling effort and (2) an approximately normal profit for the selling effort. The acquisition-date fair value of finished goods inventory was $4.3 million.
Raw materials inventory was measured at fair value as of the acquisition date applying a bottom-up approach, which uses a market method for valuation if observable market prices are available or a cost approach if they are not. It is assumed in the measurement of a raw material’s fair value that the transaction to sell the raw material occurs in the principal market or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market. The fair value of raw materials inventory was determined to be its replacement cost. The acquisition-date fair value of raw materials inventory was $3.6 million.
The fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired of $48.3 million was determined by the Company, with the assistance of a third-party appraiser, primarily using variations of the income valuation approaches, which is based on the present value of the future after-tax cash flows attributable to each identifiable intangible asset. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in the development of intangible asset fair values, from the perspective of a market participant, include, but are not limited to (i) the amount and timing of projected future cash flows (including revenue and expenses), (ii) the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows, (iii) the assessment of the asset’s life cycle, and (iv) the contributory asset charges.
The components of identifiable intangible assets acquired were as follows (in thousands):


 | Useful lives(in years)(4) | | Value as ofclosing dateof acquisition
Trademarks(1) | 6.5 | $ | 3,969 
Developed technology(2) | 10 | | 30,819 
Customer relationships(3) | 3 | | 13,466 
Total identifiable intangible assets acquired | | $ | 48,254 

(1)The relief from royalty method of the income approach was used to estimate the fair value of the trademarks.
 
(2)Developing technology was valued using the excess earnings method
(3)Customer relationship assets represent the expected profits to be generated from the customer contracts, incorporating estimated customer retention rates.
(4)The estimated useful lives were determined based on the future economic benefit expected to be received from the assets.
Transaction costs associated with the acquisition were $1.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 and were expensed as incurred in general and administrative expenses in the statements of operations.
In May and September 2021, the Company amended the Asset Purchase Agreement with BSC to modify the delayed consideration payment and contingent consideration due as follows: (1) the timing of the delayed $15.0 million payment was deferred from May 11, 2021 to the earlier of 15 days post-IPO or November 1, 2021; (2) the timing of the $10.0 million Development Milestone payment was changed to 15 days post-IPO or, if the IPO has not been completed by November 1, 2021, upon the earlier of the closing of the Company’s first financing after November 1, 2021 or the date that the first Revenue Milestone Payment is due and it was agreed that the Development Milestone payment was achieved; and (3) the first Revenue Milestone Payment was modified from either $5.0 million if net revenue from the acquired IUH products exceeds $26.0 million in 2021 or $10.0 million if net revenue exceeds $30.0 million in 2021, to either $5.0 million if revenue from acquired IUH products in 2021 is less than $30.0 million or $10.0 million if more than $30.0 million in 2021.
As a result, fair value of contingent consideration changed by $0.4 million which was recognized in general and administrative expense in the statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021.
In November 2021, the Company paid BSC $15.0 million and $10.0 million for the delayed cash purchase consideration and Development Milestone payment, respectively.

Pro-forma financial information (unaudited)
The unaudited pro forma revenue and net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 assuming the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2019 was $44.7 million and $17.3 million respectively.
The unaudited pro forma information was determined based on the historical GAAP results of the Company and abbreviated financial information of IUH products acquired from BSC. The unaudited pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of what the Company’s results of operations would have been if the acquisition was completed on January 1, 2019, nor do they give effect to synergies, cost savings, fair market value adjustments, and other changes expected to result from the acquisition. Accordingly, the pro forma financial results do not purport to be indicative of results of operations as of the date hereof, for any period ended on the date hereof, or for any other future date or period. The unaudited pro forma net loss for year ended December 31, 2020 includes pro forma adjustments of $3.1 million relating to the adjustment for the amortization of the intangible assets from January 1, 2020 through May 12, 2020 and the reduction of $1.0 million in transaction costs, which were assumed to have been incurred at the inception of the acquisition.
8. Debt
Ares term loan
On December 30, 2019, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the Ares Agreement) with Ares Capital Corporation and Ares Direct Finance I LP (collectively, Ares) to raise up to $40.0 million in debt financing (the Ares Loan) consisting of $30.0 million advanced at the closing of the agreement (Tranche A), with the option to draw up to an additional $10.0 million (Tranche B) on or before December 31, 2020, which was conditioned upon achieving a minimum of $30.0 million in net revenues in the prior 12-month period. The Ares Loan has a three-year term maturing on December 31, 2022, which includes eight quarters of interest-only payments followed by four quarters of equal payments of principal and interest. The interest-only period could be extended to ten quarters if the Company satisfied certain amortization period extension conditions prior to December 31, 2021. In May 2020, the Company satisfied one of the amortization period extension conditions and the interest-only period was extended to ten quarters.
Borrowings under the Ares Agreement, including the Ares Loan, bear interest at either the ABR plus 8.5% per annum or the Eurodollar Rate plus 9.5% per annum, as applicable. The ABR equals the greatest of (a) 3.0%, (b) the prime rate, (c) the federal funds rate plus 0.5% and (d) the three-month Eurodollar Rate plus 1.0%. The Eurodollar Rate equals the greater of (a) 2.0% and (b) the rate per annum appearing on Bloomberg Professional Service Page BBAM1 offered rate for deposits in U.S. dollars at approximately two business days prior to the first day of such interest period for a three (3) month term; multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate. The Statutory Reserve Rate is based on a fraction, the numerator of which is the number one and the denominator of which is the number one minus the applicable reserve percentage for that day. Payments of interest under Ares Loan are to be made quarterly commencing on March 31, 2020. Through December 31, 2021, the Company has the option to pay all accrued interest in cash or by paying up to 50.0% of accrued interest in kind (PIK interest) by increasing the principal amount of Ares Loan. On each payment date through June 30, 2021, the Company elected the PIK option, issuing PIK notes totaling $2.9 million. For three months ended September 30, 2021, the Company did not use PIK option and paid all interest in cash. As of October 8, 2021 (repayment date) the Ares Loan had an
 
annual effective interest rate of 24.9% per annum. As of December 31, 2020 the annual effective interest rate of was 22.7% per annum.
The Ares Loan is collateralized by substantially all of the Company’s assets. The Company may prepay the loan, subject to prepayment premium equal to 30.0% of the principal amount being prepaid less all interest payments and fees paid in cash on or prior to the date of such prepayment, provided that in no event shall the prepayment premium be less than zero.
The Ares Loan includes a fee upon repayment of the loan ranging from 4.0% to 10.0% of the aggregate principal amount being prepaid or repaid including all PIK notes added to the principal amount. The Ares Agreement includes customary restrictive covenants, financial covenants, events of default and other customary terms and conditions.
The financial covenants in the Ares Agreement require the Company to have revenue for the four consecutive fiscal quarters period ending on March 31, 2020, and the last day of each June, September, December and March thereafter, off not less than the minimum revenue amount specified in the Ares Agreement and maintain a minimum cash and cash equivalents balance of $5.0 million at any time.
In January 2021, the Company entered into a waiver and amendment agreement to the Ares Agreement to receive a waiver for certain reporting covenants for which the Company was not in compliance. Additionally, the amendment extended the Tranche B availability date to June 30, 2021. The amendment was accounted for as a debt modification and no gain or loss was recognized. In March 2021, the Company entered into a second amendment to the Ares Agreement to extend the compliance period for certain reporting covenants. The amendment was accounted for as a debt modification and no gain or loss was recognized.
In July 2021, the Company amended the terms of the Ares Agreement to waive a default in connection with the Company’s failure to satisfy a covenant relating to delivery of financial statements and modify that financial reporting covenant. The amendment also served to modify the fee due to Ares upon repayment of the loan from a variable amount based on equity value of the Company to a fixed exit fee of 6.25% of the principal amount of the Loans funded under the Ares Agreement. In addition, the timing for delivery of the Company’s annual audited financial statements was amended to 210 days from the end of the fiscal year for the year ended December 31, 2020. The amendment was accounted for as a debt modification and no gain or loss was recognized.
The Company may be required to make mandatory prepayments of the Ares Loan upon the occurrence of specified prepayment trigger events, including the occurrence of any event of default or the occurrence of a change in control event. Upon the prepayment of all or any of the outstanding principal balance, the Company shall pay, in addition to such prepayment, the prepayment premium noted above. As Ares may exercise the option to require prepayment by the Company, the prepayment premium is considered to be an embedded derivative which is required to be bifurcated from its host contract and accounted for as a separate financial instrument. The mandatory prepayment derivative liability had a fair value of $4.3 million upon entering into the Ares Agreement, which was accounted for as a debt discount.
On October 8, 2021, the Company repaid its entire obligation under the Ares Loan amounting to $35.5 million, including principal of $32.8 million, accrued interest of $0.1 million and fees of $2.6 million, using the proceeds from CIBC Term Loan (described below). The repayment of the obligation under the term loan agreement with ARES was accounted as a debt extinguishment and the Company recorded a loss on a debt extinguishment of $4.4 million accordingly in the statements of operations.
The Ares Loan consists of the following (in thousands):


 | | December 31,
 | | 2020 
Term loan principal | $ | 31,878 
Less: debt issuance cost and debt discount | | (4,120) 
Add: exit fee | | 312 
Term loan | $ | 28,070 

The Company paid $1.4 million in fees to the lender and third parties which is reflected as a discount on the Ares Loan and is being accreted over the life of the term loan using the effective interest method.
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded interest expense of $4.9 million and $5.6 million, respectively, which includes interest expense related to the accretion of debt discount, debt issuance costs and exit fee of the Ares Loan of $2.0 million and $1.9 million, respectively.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the estimated fair value of the aggregate outstanding derivative instrument associated with the Ares Loan was zero and $4.5 million, respectively.

Paycheck Protection Program
In April 2020, the Company received $3.0 million from a Federal Small Business Administration (SBA) loan under the Paycheck Protection Program (the PPP Loan). The PPP Loan bore interest at 1.0% per year on the outstanding principal amount and was scheduled to mature 24 months from the date of the note. No payments were due for initial six-month period of the PPP Loan. Afterwards, payments of principal and interest were due over the following 18 months. In June 2021, the Company received formal notification from the SBA that the Company’s PPP Loan and interest had been formally forgiven in the principal amount of $3.0 million, plus interest of less than $0.1 million. As a result, the Company recognized a $3.0 million gain on forgiveness of PPP loan in the statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021.
CIBC term loan

On October 8, 2021, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the CIBC Agreement) with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), which provides for a senior secured term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $40.0 million (the CIBC Loan), the full amount of which was funded at the closing of the CIBC Agreement. Most of the proceeds of the CIBC Loan were used to repay the Company’s entire obligation under its existing loan agreement with Ares, including the principal, interest, prepayment premium and fees, in a total amount of $35.5 million.

The CIBC Loan provides for 24 months of interest-only payments followed by 36 equal monthly payments of principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest, with the final obligations due and payable in full on October 8, 2026. The CIBC Loan accrues interest at a floating rate equal to 2.5% above the prime rate, and the interest is payable monthly in arrears. As of December 31, 2021, the CIBC Loan had an annual effective interest rate of 6.72% per annum.

Obligations under the CIBC Agreement are secured by substantially all of the Company’s assets. The CIBC Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other requirements, financial statement reporting requirements, limitations on the incurrence of certain indebtedness and liens, limitations on the disposition of assets, restrictions on certain transactions with affiliates, limitations on dividends and stock repurchases and a material adverse change event of default. The CIBC Agreement also contains financial covenants that require the Company to maintain minimum revenue and minimum cash thresholds.

The Company may prepay the CIBC Loan in whole or in part, subject to a prepayment premium ranging from 0.0% to 3.0% of the principal amount of the CIBC Loan that is prepaid, depending on the timing of the prepayment. In connection with issuance of the Loan, the Company entered into a Success Fee Agreement with CIBC on the same date. In the event of a sale or other disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of its assets, a merger or consolidation, or an initial public offering before the expiration of the Success Fee Agreement on October 8, 2026, the Company is required to pay to CIBC the Success Fee of up to $0.4 million. On October 26, 2021, in connection with the IPO, the Success Fee derivative liability was settled upon the Company paying $0.4 million Success Fee to CIBC pursuant to the Success Fee Agreement.

The CIBC Agreement contains customary events of default subject to customary cure periods for certain defaults that include, among others, non-payment defaults, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to certain other material indebtedness, bankruptcy, and insolvency events with respect to the Company, and material judgements. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, CIBC may accelerate the Company’s obligations under the CIBC Agreement, increase the applicable interest rate by 5.0% and exercise other remedies provided for under the CIBC Agreement and applicable law.

The CIBC Loan consists of the following (in thousands):


 | | December 31,
 | | 2021 
Term loan principal | $ | 40,000 
Less: Debt issuance cost and debt discount | | (915) 
Accrued interest | | 189 
Term loan | $ | 39,274 

The Company paid $1.0 million in fees to CIBC and third parties which is reflected as a debt discount and debt issuance costs, respectively, and are being accreted over the life of the term loan using the effective interest method.
During the year ended December 31, 2021 the Company recorded interest expense of $0.6 million, which includes interest expense related to accretion of debt discount and debt issuance costs of the CIBC Loan of $0.1 million.
Convertible notes
In March and December 2018, the Company entered into Second Lien Loan and Security Agreements (the 2018 Note Agreements) with certain investors, for up to $20.0 million and $10.0 million in convertible notes, respectively. The convertible notes under these 2018 Note Agreements are collateralized by assets, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and property and
 
equipment. Under the 2018 Note Agreements, the investors agreed to make one or more convertible notes (the 2018 Notes) to the Company during the period beginning in March and December 2018, respectively, and ending on the one-year anniversary of the 2018 Note Agreements, the maturity date.
In May and November 2019, the Company entered into additional Second Lien Loan and Security Agreements (the 2019 Note Agreements) with certain investors, each for up to $10.5 million in convertible notes. With the exception of the issuance date of offering and maturity date, all remaining contractual terms of the 2019 Note Agreement are similar to the 2018 Note Agreements. Under the 2019 Note Agreements, the investors agreed to make one or more convertible notes to the Company during the period beginning in May and November 2019 (the 2019 Notes) and ending on the one-year anniversary of the 2019 Note Agreement, the maturity date.
In December 2019, the Company and the investors entered into an amendment to the 2018 Notes and 2019 Notes (the Amendment), which extended the maturity of the 2018 Notes and 2019 Notes to June 2023. Moreover, the 2018 Notes and 2019 Notes were subordinated to the term loan with Ares Capital Corporation, and collateralized by assets, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and property and equipment.
In May 2020, the Company entered into another Second Lien Loan and Security Agreement (the 2020 Note Agreement) with certain investors, for up to $30.0 million in convertible notes. The convertible notes under the 2020 Note Agreement are subordinated to the term loan with Ares Capital Corporation and are also collateralized by assets, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and property and equipment. Under the 2020 Note Agreement, the investors agreed to make one or more convertible notes to the Company during the period beginning in May 2020 (the 2020 Notes), and ending on June 30, 2023, the maturity date.
On September 3, 2021, the Company amended the 2018 Note Agreements, 2019 Note Agreements, and 2020 Note Agreement to modify the maturity dates to December 31, 2026 and to add automatic conversion of these convertible notes’ outstanding principal and accrued interest into shares of common stock if either (i) the offering price per share of our IPO is greater than $5.61 and the aggregate gross proceeds to the Company from the IPO are greater than $50.0 million or (ii) the Company receives a written request from the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the redeemable convertible preferred stock to convert all outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock to common stock. The Amendment was accounted for as a debt extinguishment, and the Company recognized a $16.9 million extinguishment loss in other income (expense), net in the statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021.
The 2018 Notes, 2019 Notes, and 2020 Notes (collectively, the Convertible Notes) accrue interest at a fixed rate of 8.0% per annum. Interest accrues until the convertible notes are converted to equity shares or paid in full. Each convertible note is evidenced by a separate Secured Convertible Note.
The Company borrowed $29.2 million in 2018, $21.0 million in 2019, and $15.0 million in 2020 under the Second Lien Loan and Security Agreements with investors. At October 21, 2021 (prior to the closing of the IPO date), the Company retained the ability to draw up to an additional $15.0 million under the 2020 Note Agreement in order to satisfy certain deferred payment obligations due to BSC.
Immediately prior to the closing of the IPO, $79.2 million in aggregate outstanding principal and accrued interest of the convertible notes converted into 7,006,228 shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock at a conversion price of $11.31 per share. Upon conversion the carrying value of the debt, including the $79.2 million in aggregate outstanding principal and accrued interest and $10.1 million in unamortized premium, was reclassified to additional paid-in capital. Also immediately prior to the IPO closing, all outstanding shares of the Company's redeemable convertible preferred stock (including those issued upon conversion of the convertible notes) converted into 19,404,066 shares of common stock which resulted in the reclassification of the carrying value of the preferred stock to common stock and additional paid-in capital.
The convertible notes contained embedded features – a qualified financing put, non-qualified financing put, and change of control put features that were bifurcated and accounted as derivative liabilities and recorded as debt discount. Debt discount is reported as a direct deduction to the carrying amount of the convertible notes and amortized using the effective interest rate over the life of the convertible notes as interest expense. The embedded derivative features are recorded at fair value upon entering into the note purchase agreements and are subject to remeasurement to fair value at each balance sheet date, with any changes in fair values recognized in the statements of operations.
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company reported amortization of debt premium and discount of $1.3 million and $1.4 million, respectively.

    9. Commitments and Contingencies
Operating lease
The Company's corporate headquarters, research and development facilities, and manufacturing and distribution centers are located in Santa Clara, CA and are subject to a non-cancellable operating lease that terminates in 2023.
The future minimum rental obligations required under non-cancellable lease on December 31, 2021 are as follows (in thousands):
   
2022 | $ | 846 
2023 | | 358 
Total minimum lease payments | $ | 1,204

Total rent expense was approximately $0.7 million and $1.1 million, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Indemnification
The Company enters into indemnification provisions under its agreements with other companies in the ordinary course of business, including business partners and contractors. Pursuant to these arrangements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless, and agrees to reimburse the indemnified parties for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party as a result of the Company’s activities. The terms of these indemnification agreements are generally perpetual. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements is not determinable. The Company has never incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements. As a result, the Company believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal. The Company maintains commercial general liability insurance and products liability insurance to offset certain of its potential liabilities under these indemnification provisions.
Litigation
The Company regularly evaluates its exposure to threatened or pending litigation and other business contingencies. Because of the uncertainties related to the amount of loss from litigation and other business contingencies, the recording of losses relating to such exposures requires significant judgment about the potential range of outcomes. As additional information about current or future

litigation or other contingencies becomes available, the Company will assess whether such information warrants the recording of additional expense.

In November 2015, Hologic, Inc. and Cytyc Surgical Products, LLC (collectively Hologic) filed a complaint against the Company alleging infringement of four patents (two of the four asserted patents, one of which was invalidated by the Company, were dropped pre-trial by Hologic). Before trial, the court determined on summary judgment that the Company infringed the two remaining patents. At trial, Hologic sought approximately $16M in damages. On July 27, 2018, a Delaware jury returned a verdict finding the Company did not willfully infringe and awarded Hologic $4.8 million in damages for lost profits and for royalties not included in the lost profits. Based on the result of the trial in July 2018 with Hologic, the Company recorded an accrual for potential legal losses of $4.8 million as of December 31, 2017 with a corresponding expense within general and administrative expenses. Post-trial, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) affirmed the Patent Office’s determination that one of Hologic’s two remaining patents was also invalid, leaving one patent in dispute. After the completion of post-trial motions and after the final orders from the court, in July 2019, the Company filed a notice of its intent to appeal to the Federal Circuit. At the time the appeal was filed, the updated damages calculation totaled $7.1 million and the related cash balance was restricted from withdrawal. A surety bond was generated and filed along with the appeal documents and included in restricted cash in the balance sheet. The additional damages were accrued for as of December 31, 2018. On April 22, 2020, the Federal Circuit affirmed the verdict of the $7.1 million in total damages. In September 2020 the Company filed a petition for certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court appealing from the Federal Circuit’s affirmance. The Company’s petition was granted, was heard in late April 2021, and the Supreme Court issued its Opinion in June 2021 remanding back to the Federal Circuit for further consideration (see below). On remand, the Federal Circuit heard oral arguments on January 27, 2022. No opinion has been issued.
  On July 8, 2020, Hologic sued the Company for willful infringement of the same remaining Hologic patent in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging that the Company’s new ES Handpiece infringed the now expired patent (the one remaining patent in question expired in November of 2018 and therefore only past damages for approximately five months of sales remains at issue in the case). The Company has answered, denying infringement and willfulness and alleges that the patent was invalid prior to expiry. Due to COVID-19, the case was stayed twice for 60 days. On January 22, 2021, the Company filed a motion to stay this case until such time as all appeals of the first case have run their course (see above), and that motion was granted. On June 29, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court vacated and remanded the Federal Circuit’s decision that the Company cannot challenge the validity of the one remaining Hologic patent due to assignor estoppel. As noted above, a decision from the Federal Circuit following the January 27, 2022 oral argument is expected to be issued in the future.

In April 2017, the Company sued Hologic for willful infringement of a Company patent in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Hologic has answered, denying infringement and willfulness and alleging invalidity of the patent. The Company sought a preliminary injunction and that motion was denied. This matter was transferred to the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, where it has been assigned to the same judge presiding over the Hologic complaints. Due to COVID-19, the July 2020 trial date was delayed. On July 20, 2021, the district court granted Hologic’s Daubert motion excluding certain expert opinions regarding infringement. On July 23, 2021, the district court found on summary judgment that the Company’s patent is invalid, dismissed the case and entered judgment. On August 24, 2021, the Company filed its notice of appeal and has appealed to the Federal Circuit. The Company’s opening brief was filed on December 9, 2021. Hologic’s response brief was filed on March 4, 2022, The Company's response is due on March 25, 2022 and no date for oral argument has been set yet.

 10. Income Taxes
All losses before income taxes were generated in the United States. The Company recorded a deferred income tax benefit of $0.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 and a current income tax expense of less than $0.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021.
The reconciliation between the federal statutory rate and the Company’s effective tax rate is summarized below:


 | Years Ended December 31,
 | | 2021 | 2020 
Federal statutory rate | | 21.00% | 21.00% 
State blended rate | | 4.99% | 3.34% 
Stock-based compensation | | (3.61%) | (0.77%) 
Gain (loss) on debt extinguishment | | (8.53%) | —% 
Other permanent items | | (0.47%) | (0.13%) 
Change in valuation allowance | | (62.41%) | (25.48%)
Convertible debt embedded derivative | | 44.95% | 1.94% 
Other | | 4.02% | 0.82% 
Effective tax rate | | (0.06%) | 0.72%

The tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented below (in thousands):


 | December 31,
 | | 2021 | | 2020 
Deferred tax assets: | | | | 
Net operating loss carryforwards | $ | 50,494 | $ | 44,568 
Depreciation and amortization | | 4,656 | | 3,375 
Accruals and reserves | | 3,577 | | 2,666 
Interest expense limitation carryforward | | 2,229 | | — 
Research and development credits | | 2,250 | | 2,197 
Gross deferred tax assets | $ | 63,206 | $ | 52,806 
Less: valuation allowance | | (63,206) | | (49,817)
Net deferred tax assets | $ | — | $ | 2,989 
Deferred tax liability: | | | | 
Convertible debt embedded derivative | | — | | (2,989) 
Total | $ | — | $ | — 


The valuation allowance increased by $13.4 million and $4.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, if any, the timing of which are uncertain. Accordingly, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $188.1 million and $165.5 million, respectively, available to reduce future taxable income, if any. The net operating loss carry forwards will expire beginning in 2028 for both federal and California income tax purposes. Federal net operating losses generated beginning in 2018 are carried forward indefinitely.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had federal and state research credit carry forwards of $1.5 million and $1.5 million available to reduce future taxable income, if any, for both federal and California state income tax purposes, respectively. Federal tax credits begin to expire in 2029 and California credits carryforward indefinitely.
Utilization of the net operating loss carry forwards and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and similar state provisions. A Section 382 "ownership change" generally occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders, who own at least 5% of the Company's stock, increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. The Company performed the analysis in 2021 and determined that it has experienced an ownership change in February 2010 as a result of stock transfers and the issuance of preferred stock. This change in ownership does not significantly impact the Company’s federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credit carryovers as of December 31, 2021 pursuant to Section 382 and Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code and similar provisions under state law.
The Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC 740-10, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. ASC 740-10 prescribes a comprehensive model for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure in financial statements of any uncertain tax positions that have been taken or expected to be taken on a tax return.
The following table reflects changes in the unrecognized tax benefits since January 1, 2020 (in thousands):


 | December 31,
 | | 2021 | | 2020
Gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of the beginning of the period | $ | 447 | $ | 431 
Increases related to current year tax provisions | | 18 | | 16 
Gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of the end of the period | $ | 465 | $ | 447 


As of December 31, 2021, the Company has unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $0.5 million. It is unlikely that the amount of liability for unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change over the next 12 months. It is the Company's policy to include penalties and interest expense related to income taxes as a component of other expense and interest expense, respectively, as necessary. Due to the Company’s full valuation allowance, the unrecognized tax benefits would not materially impact the Company’s effective tax rate when recognized.
The Company's tax years 2008 through 2021 will remain open for examination by the federal and state authorities for three and four years, respectively, from the date of utilization of any net operating losses and tax credits.

The holders of Series A, B and C redeemable convertible preferred stock, voting as a separate classes, respectively, shall be each be entitled to elect one member of the Company’s Board of Directors.

If, upon the winding up of the Company, the assets legally available for distribution are insufficient to cover the amounts owed to the holders of redeemable convertible preferred stock, the assets shall be distributed with equal priority and pro rata among the holders of redeemable convertible preferred stock in proportion to the full amounts that they would have received had funds been sufficient. After the payment of the liquidation preference, all remaining assets available for distribution, if any, shall be distributed among the holders of common stock.

The original conversion price per share of Series A, Series B, Series C, and Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock shall be the original issue price, subject to adjustment, as described in the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

Vested and expected to vest, December 31, 2021 | 2,175,685 | $ | 9.27 | | 8.68 | | 2,856

The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying stock options and the fair value of the Company’s common stock for stock options that were in-the-money as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.
The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was $1.8 million and less than $0.1 million, respectively.
The total fair value of options that vested during the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was $6.0 million and $0.6 million, respectively. The options granted during the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 had a weighted-average per share grant-date fair value of $8.18 per share and $0.37 per share, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested stock options was $8.9 million, which is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of 2.6 years.
Early exercise of stock options
The terms of the Plan permit the exercise of certain options granted under the Plan prior to vesting, subject to required approvals. The shares are subject to the Company’s lapsing repurchase right upon termination of employment at the original purchase price. The proceeds initially are recorded in accrued current liabilities from the early exercise of stock options and are reclassified to additional paid-in capital as the Company’s repurchase right lapses. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company had no repurchases of common stock. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, there were 377,709 and 136,032 shares that were subject to repurchase, respectively. The aggregate exercise prices of early exercised shares as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively, which were recorded in other current liabilities on the balance sheets.
Stock-based compensation associated with awards to employees and non-employees
On April 9, 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the repricing of all outstanding stock options for employees, officers and consultants. The Company has treated the repricing as a modification of terms of the options outstanding. The fair value of the
132
 
modification was determined as the difference in the fair value of each option immediately before and after the repricing using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The repricing resulted in an incremental compensation cost of less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 2020.
Restricted Stock Units
In December 2021 the Company granted 394,750 restricted stock units under 2021 Plan, established by the Company in October 2021.

Risk-free interest rate | 0.6% - 1.3% | 0.3% - 0.7% 
Dividend yield | 0% | 0% 
Expected term | - years | 5 - 6 years 

 
The assumptions are as follows:
 
Expected volatility. The expected volatility was determined by examining the historical volatilities for comparable publicly traded companies within the medical device industry using an average of historical volatilities of the Company’s industry peers.
 
Risk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield with a maturity equal to the expected term of the option in effect at the time of grant.
 

Dividend yield. The expected dividend is assumed to be zero as dividends have never been paid and the Company has no current plans to pay dividends on its common stock.
 
Expected term. The expected term represents the period that the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. The expected term is calculated using the simplified method which is used when there is insufficient historical data about exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The simplified method is based on the vesting period and the contractual term for each grant, or for each vesting-tranche for awards with graded vesting. The mid-point between the vesting date and the maximum contractual expiration date is used as the expected term under this method. For awards with multiple vesting-tranches, the times from grant until the mid-points for each of the tranches may be averaged to provide an overall expected term.
 
Fair Value of Common Stock. Prior to the IPO the fair value of the Company’s common stock is determined by the board of directors with assistance from management and, in part, on input from an independent third-party valuation firm. The board of directors determines the fair value of common stock by considering a number of objective and subjective factors, including valuations of comparable companies, sales of convertible preferred stock, operating and financial performance, the lack of liquidity of the Company’s common stock and the general and industry-specific economic outlook. Subsequent to the Company’s IPO, the fair value of the Company’s common stock is determined based on its closing market price.
 
In addition to the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, the Company recognizes the actual forfeitures by reducing the employee stock-based compensation expense in the same period the forfeiture occurs.
 
The Company will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility, risk-free interest rates, dividend yield and expected term, utilized for stock-based compensation on a prospective basis.
 14. Net Loss Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders which is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. As the Company reported a net loss for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is the same as diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders as the inclusion of potentially dilutive shares would have been antidilutive if included in the calculation:

 | Years Ended December 31,
(in thousands, except share and per share amounts) | 2021 | | 2020
Numerator | | | | | 
Net loss attributable to common stockholders | $ | (21,464) | | $ | (18,263)
Denominator: | | | | | 
Weighted-average common shares outstanding | | 7,012,226 | | | 968,648 
Net loss per share attributable to common stockholders, basic and diluted | $ | (3.06) | | $ | (18.85) 


The following potentially dilutive securities outstanding in common stock equivalent shares have been excluded from the computation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding because such securities have an antidilutive impact due to the Company’s net loss:


 | Years Ended December 31,
 | 2021 | 2020 
Redeemable convertible preferred stock | — | 12,397,838
Redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants | — | 77,842 
Common stock warrants | 77,842 | — 
Unvested early exercised common stock options | 377,709 | 136,032 
Options to purchase common stock | 2,175,685 | 2,466,594 
Unvested restricted stock units | 394,750 | — 
Convertible notes* | — | — 


* At December 31, 2020, the conversion of the convertible notes into redeemable convertible preferred stock was dependent on the outstanding loan balance including accrued interest and the conversion stock per share price at the date of qualified equity financing, non-qualified equity financing, or a change of control event. These factors were not estimable and the number of redeemable convertible preferred stock was not determinable. There were no conversions of convertible notes to preferred stock for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
15. Employee Benefit Plan
In 2012, the Company implemented a tax deferred savings plan, commonly referred to as a 401(k) plan. Employee contributions are withheld from standard payroll checks and are automatically withdrawn from the Company checking account and deposited into individual employee retirement accounts a few days following each payroll period. There has been no Company matching of employee contributions to the plan through December 31, 2021.
16. Related Party Transactions
A former member of the Company’s Board of Directors owns 100% of Apical Instruments, Inc. (Apical). Apical was considered a related party until the beginning of May 2021. Apical supplies the Company with the RF Controllers used with its devices. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 fees charged by Apical for products purchased were less than $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, amounts owed to Apical were less than $0.1 million, respectively.
The Company has issued convertible notes to certain redeemable convertible preferred stockholders (see Note 8).
