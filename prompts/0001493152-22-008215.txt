Item 1. Business
General
 
Panacea Life Sciences Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”) is a seed to sale cannabinoid and nutraceutical manufacturer and research company that produces purposeful, natural pharmaceutical alternatives for consumers and pets. We manufacture and sell softgels, gummies, tinctures, sublingual tablets, cosmetics, and other topicals. The Company operates through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Panacea Life Sciences, Inc. (“PLS” or “Panacea”), which the Company acquired in a reverse merger in June 2021.  Panacea was founded by Leslie Buttorff in 2017 as a woman-owned business. Panacea was formed to own and engage in creating disruptive healthcare and veterinary solutions with a specific focus on hemp. In 2020 PLS also expanded into the Personal Protection Equipment (“PPE”) business on a temporary basis.
Recent Developments
 
Effective October 25, 2021 we completed the 1-for-28 reverse stock split as well as the name change from Exactus, Inc. to Panacea Life Sciences Holdings, Inc.
 
On October 25, 2021, of the 10,649,078 shares of EXDI Common Stock issued to Quintel-MC, Incorporated (an affiliate of our Chief Executive Officer) were exchanged for 100 shares of Series C-2 Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Parent C-2 Stock”) which are convertible into 7,321,429 shares of Parent Common Stock and are entitled to vote on an as-converted basis. Other than the conversion and voting rights, there are no other preferences for the Parent C-2 Stock.
 
On November 18, 2021, the Company and an institutional investor signed an agreement for a $1.1 million original issue discount convertible note (the “Note”) financing in which the investor is paying $1 million in gross proceeds. The one-year Note is convertible into common stock at $1.40 per share. We also issued the investor 785,715 warrants to purchase common stock at an exercise price of $1.40 per share. The warrants are exercisable over a five-year period beginning May 18, 2022. The parties also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement giving the investor certain demand registration rights. After payment of a 10% commission to a broker-dealer, the adjusted net proceeds received by us were $900,000 before expenses including legal fees of the investor.
 
On March 3, 2022, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement (the “Agreement”) with an institutional investor (the “Investor”) pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue a 10% original issue discount senior convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $385,000 (the “Note”) and five-year warrants to purchase 275,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share at an exercise price of $1.40 per share (the “Warrants”) in exchange for 350 shares of the Company’s 0% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series A”). The Agreement was entered into after the Investor exercised the most favored nation rights contained in Section 7(b) of the Company’s Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of the Series A in connection with the consummation of a private placement with an institutional investor (the “Purchaser”) on November 18, 2021.
 
Our Competitive Analysis
 
We believe that our competitive advantages are derived from being vertically integrated that allows for extraction, enrichment and manufacturing under a cGMP quality environment: 1) Using pharmaceutical formulation methods to optimize the delivery of various hemp products, 2) Developing both full spectrum and THC-free products, 3) Hemp supply, and 4) utilize Good Manufacturing Practice to produce goods that are safe and quality products that deliver consistent dosing. The ability to produce both full spectrum products (those that contain <0.3%) and THC-free products allows us to optimize dosage and delivery to various human conditions. Removal of the THC from products is a difficult and expensive process, but we believe this is essential for specific patient populations; such as, athletes where testing positive for THC would lead to disqualification, first responders who would be terminated for testing positive for THC, and in animal products where even a small amount of THC can lead to toxicity and potential lethality. Industrial hemp extracts are found to have particular application as neuroprotectants, for example in limiting neurological damage and increasing speed of recovery with traumatic brain injury. The cannabinoids have also been reported to treat human disease conditions where currently multiple pharmacologicals are needed to address, e.g., Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), or where there is no current cure such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s Disease, and age-related dementia, to name a few.

Although numerous reports describe cannabis/hemp extract health benefits the industry lacks sufficient clinical data and quality control to provide patient benefit. We are combining human and pet clinical studies with Good Manufacturing Process manufacturing to generate a panel of products. Our products are formulated with delivery methods for health benefits including an intellectual property portfolio enabling development of topical creams, sublinguals, oral soft gel capsules, patches, and sprays. Our products are derived from organic practices industrial hemp grown in Colorado.
 
We believe a multitude (hundreds) of companies, large and small, have launched or intend to launch retail brands and white label products containing cannabinoids like CBD, including retail and seed-to-sale companies that are larger and better capitalized than we are and/or which offer products similar to ours with a larger geographic scope of operations and a market presence. Many of these are dependent upon third parties to provide raw material inventory for sale. We believe this makes many of the participants in the industry vulnerable to shortages, quality issues, reliability, and pricing variability. Our industry relationships may allow us to build an efficient supply chain that will put us among the few companies that maintain a competitive pricing and supply advantage. The CBD-based consumer product industry is highly fragmented with numerous companies. There are also large, well-funded companies that currently do not offer hemp-based consumer products including large agribusiness companies but may do so in the future and become significant competitors. Our goal is to be a leader in wholesale and retail sales channels for end-products, such as nutraceuticals, supplements and pet and farm products. As government regulation of CBD and related products becomes more lenient in certain jurisdictions, and other barriers to entry decline, we anticipate experiencing an increase in competition and an intensifying competitive environment, including potentially the introduction of new seed-to-sale companies and/or the expansion of operations by current competitors. Further, numerous other factors are expected to be critical to our ability to be and remain competitive in our business and goals, including product quality and prices, brand strength, production and distribution capabilities and geographic scope of operations and market presence. Additionally, market conditions can shift demand for CBD products, such as competitive pricing, the effects of inflation, regulatory changes and economic or geopolitical turmoil.


Our Intellectual Property
 
We operate in every segment of the cannabinoid product value chain. From the hemp plant to finished goods, we ensure our products with stringent testing protocols employed at every stage of the supply chain. In year 2021 we obtained registration for three of our six brands and our mark. Panacea endeavors to offer pure natural remedies within product lines for every aspect of life, Our portfolio includes the following trademarks and registrations: PANA Health™, PANA Beauty®, PANA Sport™, PANA Pet®, PANA Life® and PANA Pure™ and our PANA logo mark™.
 
Research and Development
 
In October 2021, the Panacea Life Sciences Cannabinoid Lab at Colorado State University, or CSU, was opened. The cannabinoid research center is conducting numerous studies and clinical research with the goal of extending our knowledge of how cannabis extracts affect human and animal health. We will work through the center to form multiple research collaborations as well as perform our own studies in multiple therapeutic areas. The lab is housed in the Chemistry Building in the heart of the CSU campus. The objective is to develop the center into a leader in cannabinoid research nation- and world-wide as the industry continues to grow. Panacea and CSU will work collaboratively on new projects and clinical research studies.
Our Sales Strategy
 
As previously described, since our products contain little to no THC, we have the ability to sell our products across the United States and internationally. We have established a multi-faceted sales strategy targeting:

● | global ecommerce platform for fulfilling orders and shipping worldwide where legally permitted; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | direct pharmacy placement; 
● | direct placement in retail stores, salons, spas, athletic facilities, etc. 
● | Intelligent vending machines 
● | Kiosks in Denver International Airport 
● | E-commerce based systems and social media

In addition, we have established several other sales channels via sales representatives (“reps”), e-commerce (selling directly to customers), large bulk sales to suppliers and to dispensaries. We are working to establish a multi-tiered sales strategy focused on utilizing representatives for education and sales. The sales team is comprised of independent representatives (1099 consultants) that are compensated by commission only. We have over 20 sales reps that have signed up to be in the sales channel. The e-commerce sales platform also works with the commissioned based sales. All sales commissions are tracked and paid via our integrated systems.
 
We also manufacture products for several other companies for various white label and contract manufacturing deals. We specialize in bovine and vegan soft gel manufacturing. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, these business lines were approximately 30% of our revenue. We plan to reinitiate these product lines in 2022.
 
Marketing and Distribution
 
We distribute our products to various businesses across the United States through channels optimized to the individual needs of customers. Our business to business (B2B) as well as business to customer (B2C) approaches allow much flexibility for healthcare providers the ability to recommend specific treatment options using cannabinoids as a replacement for conventional pharmaceuticals.
 
We are recruiting key service providers to leverage the power of online sales and social media placement. We have placed products on various online cannabidiol (CBD) sales stores and has launched product sales on Amazon.com. As product ambassadors are secured, we intend to increase its online and social media exposure to advance a business-to-consumer and business to business distribution model.
 
In 2021, we engaged Karsh Hagan, an independent, multi-disciplined marketing, design and technology company in Denver, Colorado to assist with brand development and roll out strategies. Currently we sell over 60 different product SKUs of CBD and Cannabigerol (CBG) products. In addition, we offer “white label” licensing to retail businesses and contract manufacturing services to smaller CBD companies. We plan to continue to build an integrated healthcare organization by creating products and programs using emerging botanical extracts. We deliver these programs through managed agriculture, pharmaceutical production, physician education, distribution and social media networks. We use our intellectual property in extraction technology, proprietary compounds, delivery systems, and distribution to produce high-quality products in terms of control, consistency, accountability, and packaging.
 
All of our products are stored in a secure distribution area in preparation for delivery to various sales channels, healthcare providers and other retail locations. The laboratory and production facility have the capacity for domestic and international delivery fulfillment and for international export. All products are tracked and securely manifested for delivery to retail and medical offices for distribution.
 
In 2018, our operating subsidiary PLS, a Colorado corporation, entered into an agreement with Canna Software/Quintel-MC, Incorporated, a related party, to research and define Panacea Life Sciences business and manufacturing processes. The ERPCannabis system based on an SAP architecture was used to develop the base installation. All financial, human resource, payroll, procurement, production planning and materials management business processes are represented in this system. In addition, the system is linked to our e-Commerce web site. This system allows us to update product costing and determine inventory levels which will be critical as the company expands. In addition, sophisticated financial and payroll processing are inherent in the solution; thus, offering investors detailed accounting results related to company investments. (See Note 6 under related party transactions in Notes Payable.)
 
Our Industrial Hemp Supply
 
In 2019, Panacea Life Sciences acquired Needle Rock Farms (NRF) in Crawford, Colorado. Our 2020 hemp crop was grown at NeedleRock Farms. Also, in December, 2019 Twenty Second Century Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: XXII) (“XXII”) made a $14 million investment in Panacea which consisted of $7 million in preferred stock and $7 million in convertible debt. XXII also was to provide an additional $10 million in funding at a later point in time. On June 30, 2021 Panacea and XXII agreed to dissolve the agreement and agreed on the following: the preferred stock was converted to common stock; a $4.3 million loan was secured against the laboratory space owned by J&N Real Estate, LLC (owned by Panacea’s CEO), the NRF and equipment would be transferred to XXII in exchange for a reduction of $2.2 million in convertible debt, 10 acres of the farm would be sub platted to Panacea, $500,000 in hemp would be delivered from the 2021 crop yield, and a 15-year agreement for hemp supply would be finalized after the deal was completed. In 2021 XXII was the grower at NRF and used organic practices for the crop. As of the date of this Report, XXII has not delivered the $500,000 of hemp to Panacea, nor have we closed on the 10 acres. However, we also have the 2020 crop and several hemp tolling contracts in which the output of crude and or distillate is shared with the growers to process.
Biotechnology Goals
 
We seek to take advantage of an emerging worldwide trend to utilize the production of cannabinoids derived from industrial hemp, such as CBD, CBDA, CBG, and other minor cannabinoids, to produce consumer products. Hemp is being used in cosmetics, nutritional supplements, and animal feed, where we also intend to focus our efforts. The market for hemp-derived products is expected to increase substantially over the next five years.

The therapeutic potential of cannabinoids is attributable to the valuable overlap between phyto-cannabinoids (i.e., plant-derived cannabinoids) and the endogenous cannabinoid system in humans, termed a “therapeutic handshake”. Clinical trials demonstrate few adverse effects from oral CBD doses of up to 1,500 mg/day. The scientific understanding of the hemp plant’s clinical effects is based mostly on studies in specific indications, like epilepsy. One company, GW Pharmaceuticals pls, a company developing pharmaceutical drugs and cannabinoid-based medicines, has sought and obtained US and foreign approvals since 2018. EPIDIOLEX®/EPIDYOLEX® (cannabidiol), the first prescription, plant-derived cannabis-based medicine approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the U.S. and the European Commission (EC) for use in Europe, is an oral solution which contains highly purified CBD. In the U.S., EPIDIOLEX® is indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), Dravet syndrome or Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) in patients one year of age and older. Panacea has produced a similar product for sale.
 
Environmental Matters
 
Compliance with federal, state and local requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, has not had, nor is expected to have, any direct material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
Government Regulations
 
On December 20, 2018, the President of the United States signed the Farm Bill into law. Among other things, this new law changed certain federal laws relating to the production and marketing of hemp, defined as cannabis (Cannabis sativa L.), and hemp products containing less than 0.3 percent delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, including removing hemp and derivatives of hemp from the Controlled Substance Act. On January 15, 2021 the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) issued its final rule regarding the Establishment of a Domestic Hemp Production Program which authorized hemp to be grown and processed legally in the United States and made it legal to transport in interstate commerce.
 
The Farm Bill recognizes hemp as distinct from its genetic cousin, marijuana, and specifically industrial hemp has been excluded from U.S. federal drug laws. The Farm Bill allows for each individual state to regulate industrial hemp and industrial hemp-based products or accept the USDA rules. Although no longer a controlled substance under federal law, cannabinoids derived from industrial hemp (other than THC) are still subject to a patchwork of state regulations. We are actively monitoring the regulations and proposed regulations in each state to ensure our operations are compliant.
 
In conjunction with the enactment of the Farm Bill, the FDA released a statement about the status of CBD and the agency’s actions in the short term with regards to CBD are expected to continue to influence the industry. The statement noted that the Farm Bill explicitly preserved the FDA’s authority to regulate products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds under Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. This authority allows the FDA to continue enforcing the law to protect patients and the public while also providing potential regulatory pathways for products containing cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds. The statement also noted the growing public interest in cannabis and cannabis-derived products, including CBD, and informed the public that the FDA will treat products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds as it does any other FDA-regulated products — meaning the products will be subject to the same authorities and requirements as FDA-regulated products containing any other substance, regardless of the source of the substance, including whether the substance is derived from a plant that is classified as hemp under the Farm Bill.
 
As of the date of this Report, and based upon publicly available information, to our knowledge the FDA has not taken any enforcement actions against CBD companies. The FDA, however, has sent warning letters to companies demanding they cease and desist from the production, distribution, or advertising of CBD products, only relating to instances that such CBD companies have made misleading and unapproved label claims. We will continue to monitor the FDA’s position on CBD. In December 2020, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced it was going to seek penalties against companies making deceptive marketing claims and named 6 companies which it had targeted for making egregious and unsupported health claims. On March 5, 2021, the FTC approved the final administrative consent orders with all 6 companies. We are unaware of any further actions and we will continue to monitor the FTC’s position with regards to deceptive marketing claims.

We are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws, including laws protecting the privacy of customer non-public information and the handling of customer complaints and regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices. The growth and demand for online commerce has and may continue to result in more stringent consumer protection laws that impose additional compliance burdens on online companies. These laws may cover issues such as user privacy, spyware and the tracking of consumer activities, marketing e-mails and communications, other advertising and promotional practices, money transfers, pricing, product safety, content and quality of products and services, taxation, electronic contracts and other communications and information security.
 
There is also great uncertainty over whether or how existing laws governing issues such as sales and other taxes, auctions, libel, and personal privacy apply to the internet and commercial online services. These issues may take years to resolve. For example, tax authorities in a number of states, as well as a Congressional advisory commission, are currently reviewing the appropriate tax treatment of companies engaged in online commerce, and new state tax regulations may subject us to additional state sales and income taxes. New legislation or regulation, the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business or the application of existing laws and regulations to the internet and commercial online services or other contexts applicable to our operations could result in significant additional taxes or regulatory restrictions on our business. These taxes or restrictions could have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and overall financial condition. Furthermore, there is a possibility that we may be subject to significant fines or other payments for any past failures to comply with these requirements.
 
Potential Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Our Business Operations
 
As disclosed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a notable impact on general economic conditions, including but not limited to the temporary closures of many businesses, “shelter in place” and other governmental regulations, reduced business and consumer spending due to both job losses and reduced investing activity, among many other effects attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, and there continue to be many unknowns. During 2020, COVID-19 had a significant impact on our CBD operations. Recognizing the sudden need for personal protective equipment, we shifted our business to importing and selling PPE hand sanitizers and masks.
 
The Omicron variant which had a significant impact in the second half of 2021 and early 2022. While a new variant is replacing Omicron, the economy has substantially reopened and it is uncertain as the impact it may have. The duration and extent of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of the virus and its many variants, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions including vaccinations and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, customers, partners and vendors. If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively, our business will be harmed.
 
Potential Impacts of Certain Current and Proposed Regulations on Our Business and Operations
 
Recently, a bill titled the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act, put forward by Senate Majority leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, would amend the definition of a dietary supplement to remove the prohibition on marketing CBD as a dietary supplement. Management sees the bill, if enacted, as an opportunity for the FDA to accelerate their decision to classify CBD products as a dietary supplement. This would be a significant step for hemp/CBD companies as it would open the door to new selling opportunities, such as getting into retail stores, who have largely been hesitant to welcome CBD in their doors without a clear position from the FDA.
 
Many people are increasingly turning to CBD products for several reasons: CBD is non-psychoactive, so it does not produce a “high” like THC, there are few known contraindications, the properties of different cannabinoids can positively affect a wide range of ailments, and cannabinoids work directly and indirectly with the body’s endocannabinoid system to create balance known as homeostasis. As demand increases, we believe the FDA must provide more clarity about CBD’s legalization, and this bill is a promising first step.
 
Human Capital
 
On December 31, 2021 we had 35 employees, including 29 full-time employees. There are no collective bargaining agreements covering any of our employees. Panacea is registered as a Woman-Owned Business as its founder, majority shareholder and CEO is female.


We believe that our success depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel. We believe that the skills, experience and industry knowledge of our key employees significantly benefit our operations and performance.
 
Employee health and safety in the workplace is one of our core values. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored for us the importance of keeping our employees safe and healthy. In response to the pandemic, we have taken actions aligned with the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in an effort to protect our workforce so they can more safely and effectively perform their work. Panacea does not have a remote workforce.
 
Employee levels are managed to align with the pace of business and management believes it has sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully.
