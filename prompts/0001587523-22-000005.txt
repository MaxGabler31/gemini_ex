Market Trends
In our Audio segment, voice has been embraced as a primary user interface across consumer electronic devices. Voice assistants are proliferating throughout a variety of applications from mobile phones to headsets, and from smart speakers to household appliances. Across mobile, ear, and IoT markets, consumers want to engage with technology through natural, spoken commands, and OEMs are developing and deploying the technology to enable it. Our unique capabilities in MEMS microphones, balanced armature speakers, and digital signal processing place us in a competitive position to enhance audio performance and enable voice input. 
Within the hearing aid market, sales are largely driven by aging demographics, healthcare spending, increasing affluence in emerging markets, and government subsidies.
In our PD segment, we sell high reliability, high voltage and high temperature ceramic capacitors, and electromagnetic interference filters across diverse end markets. Portions of this segment face much greater exposure to capital investment cycles and government spending, both direct and indirect, as some of these end markets are largely dependent on project upgrades, expansion, and government contracts. We have been experiencing increased demand for our products driven by the upgrading of large rotary radars, deployment of communication satellites, build-out of 5G communication systems, and the rapid replacement of combustion engine vehicles with electric vehicles. In addition, demand has increased as a result of the expansion of small implantable devices to monitor and correct a host of chronic health issues.
Geographic Trends
We strive to maintain our manufacturing facilities in close proximity to our direct customers. In Audio, we currently operate 4 facilities in Asia to serve the contract manufacturers who build OEM equipment on behalf of our end-customers. These contract manufacturers are largely based in China, Taiwan, India, Singapore, Indonesia, and Vietnam. Although end-user demand for consumer electronics and hearing aids is global and marketing activities occur globally, the majority of our manufacturing is located in Asia, primarily in China, Malaysia, and the Philippines.
In PD, we operate 6 facilities in North America and 1 facility in Asia for the manufacturing of products that support our global customers, as well as their suppliers and contract manufacturers.
Competitive Landscape
Success in the electronic components industry is primarily driven by innovation and flexibility as customers compete to gain a share of the growing consumer device market. We compete across consumer platforms to deliver superior acoustic performance through customized products. Our investments in research and development enable us to capture new design wins across consumer OEMs. Our ability to balance and shift between full and semi-automation is key to our ability to optimize our operations and operating expenses. Additionally, it is important for suppliers to have flexibility and quick time-to-market to meet clients’ needs. Key competitors include:
•Audio - AAC Technologies, Goertek, Infineon, and Sonion; and
•PD - Kyocera Corporation, Yageo Corporation, and Murata.
In the Audio segment, our investments in research and development enable us to continually introduce new products with improved features and performance. Our customers are adopting these higher value microphones and balanced armature speakers to improve the overall audio performance of their devices which in turn improves the end user experience. Typically our new products have higher average selling prices than the products they are replacing. Once introduced, the pricing for these products trend lower, as is typical in the consumer electronics market.
For products that were introduced more than 18 months ago, we strive to offset anticipated price erosion through bill of material cost reductions, yield improvements, equipment efficiency, and movement to lower-cost manufacturing locations.
In the PD segment, the end markets tend to have less pricing pressure. We see a fragmented set of competitors across high end capacitors and filters for a diverse set of end markets including defense, medtech, industrial, electric vehicle, and communications.
Customers, Sales, and Distribution
We serve customers in the consumer electronics, medtech, defense, electric vehicle, industrial, and communications markets. Our customers include some of the largest OEMs and operators in these markets. In addition, many of our OEM customers outsource their manufacturing to Electronic Manufacturing Services (“EMS”) companies. Other customers include global mobile phone manufacturers, hearing aid manufacturers, and many of the largest global EMS companies, particularly in China.

For further detail and for additional disclosures regarding sales and long-lived assets by geographic location, see Note 18. Segment Information to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
Raw Materials
We use a wide variety of raw materials, primarily metals, ceramic powder, and semi-processed or finished components. Commodity pricing for various metals, such as palladium, gold, brass, stainless steel, and copper, fluctuates. As a result, our operating results are exposed to such fluctuations. Although some cost increases may be recovered through increased prices to customers, if commodity prices trend upward, we attempt to control such costs through fixed-price contracts with suppliers and various other programs.
We rely on highly specialized suppliers or foundries for critical materials, components, or subassemblies that are used in our products which, in some cases, may be sole sourced from such suppliers or foundries or, such suppliers or foundries may also be a strategic supplier to one of our competitors or a customer. The loss of any single supplier has not had a material impact on operating profits. However, should an event occur which affects the ability or willingness of any supplier or foundry to continue to deliver materials or components to us in a timely manner, we may not be able to identify or qualify an alternative supplier in a timely manner which, in any such period and future periods, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information regarding risks related to our business.
Research and Development
We concentrate our research and development efforts on the design and development of new products for each of our principal markets. We also fund certain other emerging product and technology opportunities. Our future success is highly dependent upon our ability to develop complex new products, transfer new products to volume production, introduce them into the marketplace in a timely fashion, and have them selected for design into our customers’ products at competitive prices. Our future success may also depend on increasing content in our customers’ products including assisting our customers with integration of our products and software into their new products and providing support from the concept stage through design, launch, and production ramp.
Intellectual Property and Intangible Assets
We rely on patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws to protect our intellectual property, products, and technology. Our U.S. patents expire in calendar years 2022 through 2041. While our patents are an important element of our success, our business as a whole is not dependent on any one patent or group of patents. We do not anticipate any material effect on our business due to any patents expiring in 2022, and we continue to obtain new patents through our ongoing research and development. We have maintained U.S. federal trademark registrations for KNOWLES and Knowles logo designs, along with various other trademarks. These U.S. registrations may be renewed as long as the marks continue to be used in interstate commerce. We have also filed or obtained foreign registration for these marks in other countries or jurisdictions where we conduct, or anticipate conducting, international business. To complement our own research and development efforts, we have also licensed and expect to continue to license, a variety of intellectual property and technologies important to our business from third parties. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information regarding risks related to our business.
Cybersecurity
We regularly perform risk assessments relating to cybersecurity and technology risks. We have a risk-based cybersecurity program, dedicated to protecting our data as well as data belonging to our customers and partners. We utilize a defensive in-depth strategy, with multiple layers of security controls to protect our data and solutions. We mitigate cybersecurity risks by employing extensive measures, including employee training, systems monitoring and testing, and maintenance of protective systems and contingency plans. We continually evaluate ourselves for appropriate business continuity and disaster recovery planning, with test scenarios that include simulations and penetration tests.
