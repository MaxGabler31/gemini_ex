Business Strategy
 
Eco Innovation Group, Inc. is a socially responsible and sustainability-focused technology incubator devoted to the commercialization of select intellectual property that, given the right business platform, has the potential to achieve high-value commercial success. Our value creation strategy is a strategic approach to environmental sustainability: we seek innovative socially responsible products and technologies with the potential to create globally important paradigm shifts in energy efficiency and environmental sustainability. Consistent with our strategy, we seek to license, develop and market environmentally sustainable and socially responsible technologies that have compelling market potential.
Market Opportunity 
 We believe our strategic approach to environmental sustainability and socially responsible technology development offers an attractive value proposition. Environmental sustainability and social responsibility are at the core of a rapidly growing target market recognized for its growth prospects, driven by consumer preference, competitive imperative, regulatory impacts, investor mandates and capital markets. Consumers, both individual and institutional, are core to the change.
 According to a report published by Deloitte in February 2020, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing is rapidly growing in major global economies and capital markets. As reported by Deloitte, ESG-mandated assets in the United States could grow almost three times as fast as non-ESG-mandated assets to comprise half of all professionally managed investments by 2025, and an estimated 200 new funds in the United States with an ESG investment mandate are expected to launch over the next three years, more than doubling the activity from the previous three years. Also, the Governance and Accountability Institute suggested that 86% of S&P 500 companies published sustainability reports in 2018 – up from 20% in 2011. Studies conducted by NYU Stern and Bank of America reported that consumers are also increasingly looking to align themselves with sustainable companies that serve a greater social purpose.
 In our approach to the Company’s market opportunity, we not only look for great people with great technology, as part of our nine-step “Evaluation to Market” discipline, we also look to choose scalable technology opportunities and to maximize profit margins

Business Model
 
As a technology incubator, Eco Innovation Group works to bring new technologies to consumers by providing the services needed to manufacture and distribute products incorporating the technology. We provide technology developers with strong commercialization support from concept and product development to marketing and promotion, as described in greater detail below. With a focus on socially responsible and sustainable technologies, we seek out innovative inventors developing technologies with socially responsible benefits in the areas of energy efficiency, carbon emissions reduction, environmentally sustainable housing, green foods, and clean water. We focus specifically on developing sustainable and socially responsible technologies for the U.S. and international markets.
    Our services are provided through a nine-step “Evaluation to Market” process, used to identify and develop scalable technology opportunities that will have market potential with the application of strong commercialization support. The Evaluation to Market process consists of the application of our capital and management expertise through our provision of the following services:

As part of the application of our capital and management expertise through this nine-step Evaluation to Market process, the Company works closely with our inventors and innovators to develop and test the product concepts and applications, to build application-ready prototypes, to develop the technology marketing strategies, and work with the independent distributors as well as the contract manufacturers to get final products to consumers. While the Company does not create or originate the technologies behind the products, we provide these valuable services to enable the inventors of the technologies to take their innovations from concept to market. The Company has identified and is working directly with several contract manufacturers to allow us to scale manufacturing capacity to meet expected product demand.
 
By employing a business plan purposefully designed to use leased employees, independent contractors and contract manufacturers to scale production and meet the demands of taking our products to market, the Company believes it will be able to accomplish its goals of delivering products at the lowest cost and greatest efficiency utilizing its limited infrastructure.

Our Technology Agreements
 
JouleBox® Power Station Contract Manufacturing Agreement
 
On August 25, 2020, the Company signed a Master Outsourcing Contract Manufacturing Agreement with Eco-Gen Energy, Inc. (“Eco-Gen”), pursuant to which the Company has contracted to manage the production and delivery of Eco-Gen’s JouleBox® Power Station. The Master Outsourcing Contract Manufacturing Agreement with Eco-Gen is a related party transaction insofar as our CEO and controlling Stockholder, Julia Otey-Raudes, is a shareholder of Eco-Gen.
 
Under the Eco-Gen agreement, the Company has contracted to provide material purchase and management services, supply base management services, final product and component production services, delivery services, inventory management services, and related financial services for the production and delivery of Eco-Gen’s JouleBox® Power Station. Pursuant to an addendum to this Eco-Gen agreement dated August 26, 2020, Eco-Gen is required to advance payment to the Company prior to the Company’s performance of these services with relation to Eco-Gen’s clients. The Company entered into this addendum to the agreement with Eco-Gen due to the credit risk that the Company perceived with relation to Eco-Gen’s clients, upon whose business Eco-Gen, and therefore the Company, are dependent.
 
To perform our obligations under the Eco-Gen agreement, the Company will engage contract manufacturers and other independent contractors to perform the services and charge the cost of goods and services through to Eco-Gen with a 15% margin. As the services will be outsourced by the Company using third parties, including (but not limited to) intellectual property legal counsel to register trademarks and patents, engineering and manufacturing firms to design and produce the Company’s products, and marketing and advertising firms, the Company plans to manufacture and source products under the Eco-Gen agreement with limited personnel resources.
 
Power Booster™ Licensing Agreement
 
On May 4, 2020, the Company signed a Master Exclusive Licensing, Marketing, Distribution and Sales Agreement with the Bellagio IP Trust for the Power Booster™ technology, giving the Company the exclusive right to market Power Booster™ products.
 
The Company licensed the Power Booster™ technology based on the Company’s belief that the technology has the potential to achieve high-value commercial success. Based on tests performed by the Company and the patent holder, the Power Booster™ technology can provide a saving in energy consumption, depending on multiple factors, including intended usage, quality of existing power source and overall system configuration, over standard generator technology. Actual energy savings will vary depending on overall application and other factors. The Company plans to engage third parties to market products using the Power Booster™ technology in the United States.
 
The Exclusive Global Licensing Agreement with the Bellagio IP Trust (“Bellagio”)(the “Bellagio Agreement”) grants rights to the Company to market the Power Booster™. In exchange for the Bellagio Agreement, the Company issued Bellagio a restricted stock grant of twenty-five million (25,000,000) restricted common shares in the Company and will pay to Bellagio a royalty of 11% of the net manufacturing price of all Power Booster™ products sold. The Company has thus far generated no revenue from the product. Since the signing date of the Exclusive Global Licensing Agreement with Bellagio, there has been no significant progress by the Company on this initiative. The Company cannot be sure if or when, under the current global climate, that manufacturing agreement will be signed. Additionally, bringing the Power Booster™ technology to market will require significant financial inputs on the Company’s part over the next 12 months.

 Corporate History
 
Eco Innovation Group, Inc., was originally incorporated on March 5, 2001 as Dig-It Underground, Inc., a Nevada corporation that initially operated as an underground cable contractor. On September 29, 2008, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement with Haydin Group Enterprises (“Haydin”), a sole proprietorship, and concurrently resolved to wind down its cable installation business. By virtue of the share exchange agreement, the Company acquired an interest in Haydin’s salon equipment, office equipment, lease assignments for salon locations, reception office equipment, salon stations, and remodeled salon facilities that included upgraded and permitted electrical, plumbing and signage. The Company’s business focused on the operation of a string of high-end beauty salons in the Cedar Hill, Texas area.
 
On September 1, 2011, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement with Get Down Art, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company. The consummation of the share exchange provided the Company with original art and agreements with artists with licensing agreements with businesses. The Company acquired art inventory, accounts receivable, office leasing and build out. The Company resolved to unwind its previous acquisition of Haydin dated September 29, 2008.
 On August 30, 2012, the Company acquired Haydin as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company through a share exchange agreement wherein the Company issued fifty million shares of its common stock in exchange for all of the legal right title and interest in the assets of Haydin, which owned a chain of high-end beauty salons that focused on skin and hair care and nail care. Haydin also promoted sales of beauty supplies and products and sold to other salons in Texas. The Haydin beauty salons retained highly trained experienced cosmetologists who had a long history with the business. Concurrently, the Company discontinued its business with Get Down Art, LLC and resolved to unwind that acquisition.
 On January 5, 2016, the Company acquired Expressions Property Limited, LP, a Texas limited partnership and Expressions Chiropractic and Rehab Center, PA in a share exchange agreement. This acquisition allowed the Company to enter into the natural healing and chiropractic business in Cedar Hill and North Richland Hills, Texas.

Effective June 30, 2018, the Company resolved and agreed to spin out Haydin Group Enterprises, Expressions Property Limited, LP and Expressions Chiropractic and Rehab Center, PA as private entities and thereby unwinding the share exchange agreements entered into on August 30, 2012 and January 5, 2016, respectively.
 The Company was subsequently an innovation incubator platform from 2018 until early 2020 that was devoted to globally important paradigm shifts in technology, sustainable products development, and research, will initially re introduce a more affordable, fire, hurricane and earthquake resilient steel framing system.
 On February 28, 2020, our current CEO and controlling Stockholder, Julia Otey-Raudes, took over management and control of the company and transferred all of the IP relating to the Company’s old business model back to John English. In the related change of control transaction, Ms. Otey acquired 30,000,000 shares of super-voting Preferred Series A stock on February 28, 2020, and launched the company into a new direction. The Company is now an innovation incubator platform devoted to globally important paradigm shifts in technology, sustainable and carbon negative products development and practical deployment worldwide. ECOX will initially introduce a revolutionary power booster for homes and offices that, when installed as directed, holds the potential to reduce energy consumption, depending on configuration by up to 60% and other energy saving related technologies.
