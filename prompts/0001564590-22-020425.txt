 We make available financial information, news releases and other information on our web site at www.voxxintl.com. There is a direct link from the web site to the Company’s Securities and Exchange Commission's ("SEC") filings, where our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such reports and amendments with, or furnish them to, the SEC. In addition, we have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics which is available free of charge upon request. Any such request should be directed to the attention of the Company's Human Resources Department, 180 Marcus Boulevard, Hauppauge, New York 11788, (631) 231-7750.
 The Company is monitoring the impacts COVID-19 has had, and continues to have, on its global supply chain, including the global chip shortage, and disruptions of product deliveries. The Company sources the majority of its merchandise outside the U.S. through arrangements with vendors primarily located in several Pacific Rim countries. The Company has been collaborating with its vendors to mitigate significant delays in delivery of product, as certain factories and ports have been required to close or limit capacity for periods of time during the pandemic due either to COVID-19 infection, or supply chain shortages.
 The Company entered this period of uncertainty with a healthy liquidity position and took immediate, aggressive, and prudent actions, including reevaluating all expenditures, to enhance the Company’s ability to meet the Company’s short-term liquidity needs in order to best position its business for its key stakeholders, including the Company’s employees, customers, and shareholders. The Company has utilized all of its supply chain financing arrangements to factor its accounts receivable balances, as necessary, which it had previously scaled back prior to the pandemic. The Company also renewed its credit facility with Wells Fargo in April 2021, and continues to partner with its vendors, landlords, and lenders to preserve liquidity and mitigate risk and has worked with its service providers to further reduce costs by negotiating lower rates. In addition, the Company has been actively monitoring and assessing the rapidly changing government policies and economic stimulus responses to COVID-19.

The Company has seen reductions in sales of certain products as a result of the effects of COVID-19. These reductions in revenue were not consistently offset by proportional decreases in expense, as the Company continues to incur overhead costs including depreciation expense, and certain other costs such as compensation and administrative expenses, resulting in a negative effect on the relationship between the Company’s costs and revenues.
 In addition, the Company could still experience other material impacts as a result of COVID-19, including, but not limited to, charges from potential adjustments of the carrying value of inventory, additional asset impairment charges, and deferred tax valuation allowances.
 Though the current circumstances are dynamic and the impacts of COVD-19 on the Company’s business operations, including the duration and impact on overall customer demand, cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, the Company anticipates COVID-19 may continue to have an impact on its business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows in Fiscal 2023.
 For further information about COVID-19, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," of this Form 10-K.
 Acquisitions and Dispositions
 The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis that has adversely affected the economies and financial markets worldwide, and potential target companies or potential buyers may defer or end discussions for a potential acquisition or disposition with us depending on whether or not COVID-19 affects their business operations. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our search for a business combination or a potential buyer for a business disposition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. We may be unable to complete a business combination or a disposition if continued concerns relating to COVID-19 restrict travel, limit the ability to have meetings with potential investors, or if a target company’s personnel, vendors, and service providers are unavailable to negotiate and consummate a transaction in a timely manner.
 Our most recent acquisition and disposition transactions are discussed below:
 On September 8, 2021, PAC acquired the home audio/video business of Onkyo Home Entertainment Corporation (“OHEC”) with its partner, Sharp Corporation (“Sharp”), through a newly formed joint venture, Onkyo Technology KK (“Onkyo”) via an asset purchase agreement.

 Strategy
 Our objective is to grow our business both organically and through strategic acquisitions.  We anticipate we will drive the business organically by continued product development in new and emerging technologies that should increase gross margins and improve operating income. We are focused on expanding sales both domestically and internationally and broadening our customer and partner base as we bring new products to our target markets.  In addition, we plan to continue to acquire synergistic companies that would allow us to leverage our overhead, penetrate new markets, and expand existing product categories. Notwithstanding the above, if the appropriate opportunity arises, the Company will explore the potential divestiture of a product line or business.
 Subject to our ongoing evaluation of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business (as further described elsewhere in this report), the key elements of our strategy are as follows:
 Continue to build and capitalize on the VOXX family of brands.  We believe the "VOXX" portfolio of brands is one of our greatest strengths and offers us significant opportunity for increased market penetration.  Today, VOXX International has over 30 global brands in its portfolio, which provides the Company with the ability to bring to market products under brands that consumers know to be quality.  In addition, with such a wide brand portfolio, we can manage channels and sell into multiple outlets as well as leverage relationships with distributors, retailers, aftermarket car dealers and expeditors, and global OEMs.  Finally, we are open to opportunities to license some of our brands as an additional use of the brands and as a growth strategy.
 Continue to maintain diversified, blue chip customer base. Voxx distributes products through a wide range of specialty and mass merchandise channels and has arrangements as a tier-1 and tier-2 auto OEM supplier. OEM products account for 10% of total net sales.
 Capitalize on niche product and distribution opportunities in our target markets.  Throughout our history, we have used our extensive distribution and supply networks to capitalize on niche product and distribution opportunities in the automotive electronics, consumer electronics, and biometrics categories. We will continue that focus as we remain committed to innovation, developing products internally and through our outsourced technology and manufacturing partners to provide our customers with products that are in demand by consumers.
 Combine new, internal manufacturing capabilities with our proven outsourced manufacturing with industry partners.  VOXX International employs an outsourced manufacturing strategy that enables the Company to deliver the latest technological advances without the fixed costs associated with manufacturing, and also has manufacturing capabilities to produce select product lines, such as rear-seat entertainment systems, security related products, and high-end speakers. This blend of internal and outsourced manufacturing enables the Company to drive innovation, control product quality and speed time-to-market.
 Use innovative technology generation capabilities to enable us to build a robust pipeline of new products. Voxx has invested significantly in R&D. The Company uses a mix of internal and external R&D, internal and external manufacturing, and has a number of valuable trademarks, copyrights, patents, domain names and other intellectual property. Through Voxx's focus on R&D, the Company has built a pipeline of new products across all three of its segments.
 Leverage our domestic and international distribution network.  VOXX International Corporation has a highly expansive distribution network. This network, which includes OEM's, car dealers, automotive manufacturers, various types of retailers and chain stores, mass merchandisers, distributors, e-commerce platforms, system integrators, communication network providers, smart grid manufacturers, banks, cinema operators, healthcare equipment manufacturers, and the U.S. military, should allow us to increase our market penetration.  We intend to 
 5

capitalize on new and existing distribution outlets to further grow our business across our three operating segments, both domestically and abroad.
 Grow our international presence.  We have an international presence through our local subsidiaries in Europe, as well as operations in Canada, Australia, and China.  We also continue to export from our domestic operations in the United States. Our strategy remains to diversify our geographic exposure, while expanding our product offerings and distribution touch points across the world.
 Pursue strategic and complementary acquisitions.  We continue to monitor economic and industry conditions in order to evaluate potential strategic and synergistic business acquisitions that are expected to allow us to leverage overhead, penetrate new markets and expand our existing business distribution. Over the past several years, the Company has employed an M&A strategy to build its brand portfolio and enhance its product offerings in higher margin product categories, while at the same time exiting lower margin and commoditized product lines, resulting in improved bottom-line performance. The Company is focused on continuing to grow organically, but may pursue opportunistic acquisitions to augment our Automotive Electronic (primarily with OEM accounts), Consumer Electronic, and Biometric segments.
 Maintain disciplined acquisition criteria. Virtually all of our acquisitions have been made to strengthen our product offerings, customer reach, and growth potential across our operating business segments. Our strategy remains to acquire complimentary businesses, products and/or assets in our Automotive Electronic, Consumer Electronic, and Biometric operating segments. Additionally, acquisitions should have a gross margin structure equal to or higher than our consolidated gross margins, and we will continue to look for acquisitions where we can leverage our corporate overhead and resources. Furthermore, it is important that management remains with Voxx as part of the acquisition, as their legacy expertise and knowledge of both the inner workings of their respective companies and the end-markets they serve are paramount to successfully running operations and achieving growth. We also pursue acquisitions that will be accretive for the Company and its shareholders in the first year such acquisitions are made.
 Rapidly integrate acquired businesses. One of the more compelling factors as to why acquired businesses choose VOXX International Corporation is that we are perceived as both a financial and strategic partner. We are operators, and companies view their association with us as a positive for the future of their businesses in that we can provide resources and support that others in our sector, or in the Private Equity community, cannot. Our strategy upon acquisition, and in the years that follow, is to leverage our corporate strengths and integrate acquisitions into our operations. We provide accounting, MIS, warehouse, and logistics support, as well as a host of value-added services that enable acquired companies to lower their cost basis and improve profitability. In recent years, we have consolidated facilities in our German operations and in Indiana, where we brought our RCA® and Klipsch operating groups together. We have also fully integrated our Rosen, VSM, and DEI acquisitions into our Florida operations.
 Improve bottom-line performance and generate sustainable shareholder returns.  The Company has instituted an aggressive strategy in recent years to shift its product mix to higher-margin product categories, while controlling costs and strategically investing in its infrastructure. Additionally, during Fiscal 2019, the Company began a comprehensive SKU rationalization program to discontinue certain product lines and streamline the Company’s consumer electronic product lines to focus on offerings with longer life cycles, more sustainable gross margins, and better growth potential. The Company remains focused on growing its business organically, continuing to enhance its gross profit margins and leveraging its fixed overhead structure to generate sustainable returns for its stockholders.
 Industry
 We participate in select product categories in the automotive, consumer, and biometric markets within the electronics industry. These markets are large and diverse, encompass a broad range of products and offer the ability to specialize in niche product groups. The introduction of new products and technological advancements are the major growth drivers in these markets.  Based on this, we continue to introduce new products across all segments, with an increased focus on niche product offerings.

We believe our segments have expanding market opportunities with certain levels of volatility related to domestic and international markets, new car sales, increased competition by manufacturers, private labels, technological advancements, discretionary consumer spending and general economic conditions.  Further, all of our products are subject to price fluctuations, which could affect the carrying value of inventories and gross margins in the future.
Within the industry our Biometrics segment operates in, technology is developing rapidly. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a greater interest for safe and touchless biometric systems. Widely used face readers are now being rendered ineffective by the use of facemasks and other protective facial gear, and fingerprint and palm reader secure access devices are now seen as infectious public surfaces. Iris biometric algorithms read the unique texture in the colored part of the eye, creating a unique identification for access, similar to that of a fingerprint or the geometric pattern of a face. This iris-based key, however, has the benefit of not only being touchless, but is also not hindered by the obstacles encountered by face recognition devices, such as facemasks or other devices that hide facial features. Iris biometrics can operate successfully without touching or mask removal, even through protective gear such as hazmat suits, if a person’s eyes are visible.
 Net sales by segment, gross profit and total assets are as follows (Refer to Item 7 and Note 13 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information):

Patents, Trademarks/Tradenames, Licensing and Royalties
 The Company regards its trademarks, copyrights, patents, domain names, and similar intellectual property as important to its operations. It relies on trademark, copyright and patent law, domain name regulations, and confidentiality or license agreements to protect its proprietary rights. The Company has registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of patents, trademarks, domain names and copyrights with U.S. and foreign governmental authorities. Additionally, the Company has filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of its proprietary technology. The Company renews its registrations, which vary in duration, as it deems appropriate from time to time.

The Company has licensed in the past, and expects that it may license in the future, certain of its proprietary rights to third parties. Some of the Company's products are designed to include intellectual property licensed, or otherwise obtained from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company's products, the Company believes, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms; however, there is no guarantee such licenses could be obtained at all. We intend to operate in a way that does not result in willful infringement of the patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights of other parties. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that a claim of infringement will not be asserted against us or that any such assertion will not result in a judgment or order requiring us to obtain a license in order to make, use, or sell our products.
 License and royalty programs offered to our manufacturers, customers and other electronic suppliers are structured using a fixed amount per unit or a percentage of net sales, depending on the terms of the agreement. Current license and royalty agreements have duration periods which range from 1 to 17 years or continue in perpetuity. Certain agreements may be renewed at termination of the agreement. The Company's license and royalty income is recorded upon sale and amounted to $1,716, $1,285 and $1,224 for the years ended February 28, 2022, February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020, respectively.

No one customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company's net sales for the years ended February 28, 2022 or February 29, 2020. One customer in the Company’s Consumer Electronics segment accounted for 12% of the Company’s consolidated net sales during the year ended February 28, 2021. Geographically, approximately 79.6% of our revenues were derived from our domestic operations within the United States, while approximately 15.3% was derived from our operations in Europe, and less than 5.1% was derived from other regions.

We have flexible shipping policies designed to meet customer needs. In the absence of specific customer instructions, we generally ship products within 24 to 48 hours from the receipt of an order from public warehouses, as well as owned and leased facilities throughout the United States, Canada, China, Hong Kong, the Netherlands, and Germany. The Company also employs a direct ship model from our suppliers for select customers upon their request.
 Product Development, Warranty and Customer Service
 Our product development cycle includes:
  
• | identifying consumer trends and potential demand,
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | responding to those trends through product design and feature integration, which includes software design, electrical engineering, industrial design, and pre-production testing. In the case of OEM customers, the product development cycle may also include product validation to customer quality standards, and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | evaluating and testing new products in our own facilities to ensure compliance with our design specifications and standards.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Utilizing our company-owned and third-party facilities in North America, Europe, and Asia, we work closely with our suppliers throughout the product design, testing and development process in an effort to meet the expectations of consumer demand for technologically advanced and high-quality products. Our Auburn Hills, Michigan and Orlando, Florida facilities are both IATF 16949:2016 certified, and our Orlando, Florida facility is ISO 14001:2015 and ISO 9001:2008 certified, all of which require the monitoring of quality standards in all facets of business.  The Orlando, Florida facility is also Ford Q1 certified, which is a certification awarded to Ford suppliers who demonstrate excellence beyond the ISO certifications in certain critical areas.
 We provide product warranties for all our product lines, which primarily range from 30 days to three years. The Company also provides limited lifetime warranties for certain products, which limit the end-user's remedy to the repair or replacement of the defective product during its lifetime, as well as warranties for certain vehicle security products for the life of the vehicle for the original owner. To support our warranties, we have independent warranty centers in the United States and Europe.  Our customer service group, along with our Company websites, provide product information, answer questions, and serve as a technical hotline for installation help for end-users and customers.
 Suppliers
 We work directly with our suppliers on industrial design, feature sets, product development, and testing in order to ensure that our products and component parts meet our design specifications.
 We purchase our products and component parts from manufacturers principally located in several Pacific Rim countries, including China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore, as well as the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Europe. In selecting our manufacturers, we consider quality, price, service, reputation, financial stability, as well as labor practices, disruptions, or shortages. In order to provide coordination and supervision of supplier performance, such as price negotiations, delivery, and quality control, we maintain buying and inspection offices in China and Hong Kong.  We consider relations with our suppliers to be good and alternative sources of supply are generally available within 180 days.  We have few long-term contracts with our suppliers, and we generally purchase our products under short-term purchase orders.  Although we believe that alternative sources of supply are currently available, an unplanned shift to a new supplier could result in product delays and increased cost, which may have a material impact on our operations.
 10

Competition
 The electronics industry is highly competitive across all product categories, and we compete with a number of well-established companies that manufacture and sell similar products.

Human Capital
 VOXX International Corporation believes the Company’s greatest asset is its employees. The Company’s emphasis on the health and safety of its employees is an important factor in maintaining its experienced workforce and attracting new talent. As of February 28, 2022, the Company employed 1,082 people, of which 692 were U.S. based and 390 were internationally based. 44 of our U.S. based employees were covered under collective bargaining agreements.  We consider our relations with employees to be good as of February 28, 2022. 
 The Company’s U.S. based full-time employees are all eligible to participate in the Company’s health and welfare plans, including health, vision, dental, life, short-term disability insurance plans, long-term disability insurance plans, flexible spending plans and/or health saving plans, pet insurance, critical care plans and identity theft protection plans. Many of these plans are fully paid for by the Company, while others are cost shared between the Company and the employees or are employee-paid at a discounted rate. To encourage our employees to save for the future and their retirement, the Company offers employees a 401(k) retirement plan which has options for traditional pre-tax deferrals, as well as Roth options. The 401(k) plan also includes a discretional Company match which encourages employees to participate and enhances the Company’s commitment to its employees and their families. Internationally based employees also receive health, welfare, and retirement plans that are statutory-based, and in some instances, employees may choose to participate in plans that supplement the statutory benefits and are funded by the employee. To further encourage employees to prioritize their health, the Company sponsors events and benefits such as on-site flu vaccinations, health fairs, mobile preventative screenings, on-site fitness centers at certain Company locations, gym membership reimbursements, weight loss programs, and periodic health and fitness competitions, which are often aligned with fundraising campaigns. The Company encourages all employees to give back to their communities and make a social impact through activities such as hosting on-site blood donation drives, donation drives for causes including cancer and autism, local holiday toy and giving drives, as well as food drives. The Company also participates in matching gift programs for certain charities. Additionally, we provide service awards to employees, which show appreciation and recognition to longstanding employees for certain service milestones. 
 Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, certain of the Company’s customers delayed or cancelled orders due to both uncertainty in the economy and health concerns. During this time, the Company attempted to keep as many of its employees working as possible by shifting work responsibilities when possible; however, due to the impacts of the pandemic, approximately 20% of our employees worldwide were furloughed in April 2020. The Company also worked closely to accommodate employees’ requests to use the Families First Coronavirus Relief Act and the Family Medical Leave Act. As of February 28, 2022, none of our employees remain on furlough.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations. This includes providing our office, support, and non-production staff the ability to work remotely from their homes. For our production staff, or for office and support staff who were unable to work remotely, we implemented several safety measures, including daily temperature checks, mandatory health questionnaire completion, social distancing, plexi-glass partitions between workstations, staggered lunch and break times, hand sanitizing stations throughout all buildings, mask/face coverings, and replaced air filters in all buildings to be complaint with COVID-19 standards.
