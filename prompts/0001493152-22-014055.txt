Overview
 
Vystar Corporation (“Vystar”, the “Company”, “we,” “us,” or “our”) is based in Worcester, Massachusetts. The Company uses patented technology to produce a line of innovative air purifiers, which destroy viruses and bacteria through the use of ultraviolet light. In addition, Vystar manufactures and sells reduced allergen natural rubber latex used primarily in various bedding products.
 
Vystar has a majority ownership in Murida Furniture Co., Inc. dba Rotmans Furniture, one of the largest independent furniture stores in the U.S.
 
Company Background
 
In May of 2018, Vystar acquired substantially all of the assets of UV Flu Technologies, Inc. (formerly traded on the OTC under the ticker UVFT), whose patented ViraTech™ UV light air purification technology destroys greater than 99% of airborne bacteria, viruses and other microorganisms and virtually eliminates concentrations of odors and volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”) and created the RxAir division.
 
The RxAir product line includes:
 

● | RXair™ Residential Filterless Air Purifier 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | RX400 ™ U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) cleared Class II Filterless Air Purifier 
● | RX3000™ Commercial FDA cleared Class II Air Purifier 

 
RxAir promotes a healthy lifestyle improving the quality of life of each and every customer. Independently tested by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and FDA-certified laboratories, the RxAir has been proven to destroy greater than 99% of bacteria and viruses and reduce concentrations of odors and VOCs. The RxAir uses high-intensity germicidal UV lamps that destroy bacteria and viruses instead of just trapping them, setting it apart from ordinary air filtration units. RxAir units are sold online at www.RxAir.com and are available through multiple third-party distributors. RxAir® and ViraTech ® are registered trademarks of Vystar Corporation.
 
Vystar is the exclusive creator of Vytex Natural Rubber Latex (“NRL”), a multi-patented, all-natural, raw material that contains significantly reduced levels of the proteins found in natural rubber latex and can be used in over 40,000 products. Vytex NRL is a 100% renewable resource, environmentally safe, “green” and fully biodegradable. Vystar is working with manufacturers across a broad range of consumer and medical products bringing Vytex NRL to market in adhesives, gloves, balloons, condoms, other medical devices and natural rubber latex foam mattresses, toppers, and pillows.
 
In April of 2018, Vystar acquired the assets of NHS Holdings, LLC (“NHS”) to move into direct product offerings made from Vytex® latex. NHS was the exclusive U.S. distributor of Vystar’s Vytex® natural rubber latex foam to manufacturers for use in over 200 home furnishings products, including mattresses, toppers, pillows and upholstery, sold through multiple channels.

In May of 2019, Vystar acquired the assets of Fluid Energy Conversion Inc. (“FEC”), primarily consisting of its patent on the Hughes Reactor, which has the ability to control, enhance, and focus energy in flowing liquids and gases. Vystar intends to use this technology to enhance the effectiveness of Vystar’s RxAir purification system to destroy airborne pathogens while decreasing the cost and size of Vystar’s RxAir units.
 
In July of 2019, Vystar acquired 58% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Murida Furniture Co., Inc. dba Rotmans Furniture (“Rotmans”), one of the largest independent furniture retailers in the U.S. Rotmans sells a broad line of residential furniture and decorative accessories and serves customers throughout the New England region. The acquisition enabled Vystar to capitalize on the infrastructure already in place at Rotmans for accounting, retail sales facilities and staff, customer service, warehousing, and delivery. In addition, Rotmans offers significant marketing and advertising opportunities for all of Vystar’s brands to Rotmans’ thousands of existing customers.
 
In December of 2020, Vystar selected Corrie MacColl Limited, a subsidiary of global natural rubber supply chain manager Halcyon Agri, as its exclusive global partner for all aspects of product market development and distribution of patented Vytex deproteinized latex.
 
Competition
 
RxAir
 
The residential air purification market is a highly fragmented competitive business. Vystar competes with a large number of companies on many factors including price, quality, innovation, reputation, distribution and promotion.
Furniture Store
 
The retail sale of home furnishings is a highly competitive business. There has been growth in the e-commerce channel both from internet only retailers and those with a brick-and-mortar presence. We also compete with numerous individual retail stores as well as chains in our immediate geographic area. Mass merchants and certain department stores also have limited furniture product offerings.
Natural Rubber Latex
 
Synthetic raw materials such as ethylene, propylene, styrene and butadiene compete with NRL. Currently, it is estimated that NRL processors have lost one-half of the overall latex market to synthetic latex. Despite the switch to non-latex alternatives, it is estimated that almost 70% of exam gloves and nearly 80% of surgical gloves used in U.S. hospitals are still made with NRL.
Intellectual Property
 
The Company currently holds a portfolio of patents and trademarks in the U.S. and other various foreign countries. No assurance can be given that such patent and trademark protection will provide substantial protection from competition. We are committed to aggressively challenging any infringements of our patents and/or trademarks.
Government Regulation
 
We are not subject to direct governmental regulation other than the laws and regulations generally applicable to businesses in the domestic and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate.
 
Our RxAir400 product was cleared by the FDA as a Class II medical device in November 2008. FDA clearance to sell our product as a Class II medical device provides invaluable credibility in the marketplace. By granting a listing, the FDA indicates it has reviewed all aspects of a product, including efficacy of the technology, independent test results and product safety to ensure that the product complies with our claims. Few air purification products are listed by the FDA, and it is extremely important that we expend the resources necessary to maintain this listing as a Class II medical device with the FDA.
