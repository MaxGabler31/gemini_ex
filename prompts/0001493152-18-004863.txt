Background

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued a report stating there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Summary
 
The Company operates a deep discount variety retail store under the name “Dollar Green Stores” (“dollar stores”) in Sacramento.


In September 2013, the Company’s management developed plans to open and operate two retail stores in Sacramento, California, under the named “Dollar Green Stores.” In February 2014, the Company opened its first dollar store in Sacramento, which consists of more than 2,200 square feet of retail store space. The Company opened its second dollar store in May 2014. In August 2014, the Company was forced to close its original store due to its landlord’s failure to comply with city building codes. The Company relocated the second store in December 2015 and settled the existing lease at that time. Therefore, the Company currently operates one retail store.
 
Additionally, the Company began trading precious metals in December 2014 with the purchase 100 ounces of silver. The Company has since purchased gold and is evaluating potentially expanding its ownership of additional precious metals. Though management has limited experience in the precious metals field they have solicited outside experts contribute to the Company’s investment strategies.

On April 18, 2017 the Company entered into a Letter of Intent to purchase a central California hotel for approximately $7,000,000 and entering escrow October, 2017 however with the escrow expired in December 2017 and the purchase did not close.

The Business: Hotel and Residential Properties
 
The Company believes the hotel industry accounts for a significant part of the overall economy. The industry is highly segmented with many different brands targeting a vast range of customer needs at various price points. Businesses in the hotel industry generally operate under one or more business models, including hotel management, brand franchising and hotel ownership. Hotels are categorized into three groups: full-service, select-service and limited-service. Full-service hotels typically offer a full range of amenities and facilities, including food and beverage facilities and meeting facilities. Select-service hotels furnish some of the amenities offered at full-service hotels but on a smaller scale and generally do not to have meeting facilities. Limited-service hotels usually offer only lodging, however some provide modest food and beverage facilities such as breakfast buffets or small meeting rooms.
 
Lodging demand growth is generally related to the strength of the overall economy. Additionally, local demand factors may stimulate business and leisure travel to specific locations. In particular, macroeconomic trends relating to GDP growth, corporate profits, capital investments and employment growth are some of the primary drivers of lodging demand. As the economy continues to improve, the ongoing trend of strong transient demand and growing group business will continue to drive demand for hotels and lodging and allow the industry to achieve increased growth.
 
The Market
 
The dollar channel is a $47 billion industry growing at a rate of 9% annually in the United States. The recent recession and post-recessionary shopping habits have made dollar stores a frequent channel for more consumers—of all incomes. Dollar stores appeal to primarily low- and fixed-income consumers; however, a growing segment of shoppers are high-income consumers, as the stigma of dollar stores seems to be waning. Across consumer segments, dollar-store shopping trips appear to be expanding from merely a fill-in or occasional targeted purchase to a grocery or mass merchandise substitute. To some extent, the growth of dollar stores—in particular multi-price-point dollar stores, where the price of most products exceeds one dollar—is at the expense of mass merchandisers and grocery channels.
 
This growth in dollar stores is faster than traditional channels, particularly in the sales of personal goods, household goods, food, and beverages. Dollar stores typically offer more variety in food and beverage (including national brands) and the consumer perception of store brand quality improves.
 
The hotel industry globally and in the United States has improved as the economy has recovered over the past few years. According to the STR Global Census, October 2013 (adjusted to September 2013), U.S. hotel demand has grown at a compound annual growth (“CAGR”) rate of 4.9% over the past three years. Hotel supply has lagged at a CAGR of just 0.9%. The Company believes there is ample room to enter this market and that barriers for entry remain relatively low.
 
The Company’s Presence in the Market
 
The Company has targeted strategic locations in northern California that are currently underserved by the dollar store channel. It currently operates one deep discount retail store location in Sacramento, California.
 
As of December 31, 2017, the Company has no presence in the hotel market.
 
Although the Company intends to begin trading precious metals and has begun acquiring and evaluating potential positions in the market, it does not currently have a presence in the trade of such metals. Likewise, the Company currently has no presence in the hotel or residential property marketplace. It intends to acquire such properties in the near future, thereby establishing a footprint in the market.

The Business: Precious Metals
 
Silver and other precious metals, may be used as an investment. A traditional way of investing in silver is by buying actual bullion bars. In some countries, like Switzerland and Liechtenstein, bullion bars can be bought or sold over the counter at major banks. Another means of buying and trading silver is through silver coins. Silver coins include the one ounce 99.99% pure Canadian Silver Maple Leaf and the one ounce 99.93% pure American Silver Eagle. Likewise, an increasing popular method of trading in silver and precious metals is through exchange-traded products, such as exchange-traded funds, exchange-traded notes and closed-end funds that aim to track the price of silver. Silver exchange-traded products are traded on the major stock exchanges including the London and New York Stock Exchanges.
 
The Company believes that stimulative monetary policies adopted by the United States, the European Union, China and Japan may cause an increase in inflation. Gold and silver have traditionally served as a hedge against economic uncertainty and high inflation.
 
At the present time, the Company does not anticipate or foresee a material effect on this line of its business from existing or probable governmental regulations.

Competition
 
The Company’s discount retail store is part of a highly competitive industry. The basic consumer packaged goods market encompasses discount stores and many other retailers, including mass merchandise, grocery, drug, convenience, variety and other specialty stores. The Company’s direct competitors will include retail companies such as ‘Dollar General’, ‘Family Dollar’, ‘Dollar Tree’, and ’99 Cent Only Store’ to the extent that these competitors are within a similar geographic area to the Company’s stores. These competitors may have greater financial and other resources than does the Company.
 
The Company intends to differentiate itself from other forms of discount retail stores by targeting low to middle-class consumers in strategic locations in northern California currently underserved by the dollar store channel.
 
If the Company does enter the hotel and or residential property industry, it will encounter significant competition from other hotel, residential and resort owners and operators. Primary competitors would include branded and independent hotel operating companies, national and international hotel brands and ownership companies.
 
Strategic Partners and Suppliers
