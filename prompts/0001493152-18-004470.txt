Corporate Overview – Formation, Corporate Changes and Material Mergers and Acquisitions
 
Organization
 
Cutaia Media Group, LLC (“CMG”) was a limited liability company formed on December 12, 2012 under the laws of the State of Nevada. On May 19, 2014, bBooth, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada. On May 19, 2014, CMG was merged into bBooth, Inc. and bBooth, Inc. changed its name to bBooth (USA), Inc. The operations of CMG and bBooth (USA), Inc. became known as, and are referred to in this Report as, “bBoothUSA”.
 
On October 16, 2014, bBoothUSA completed a Share Exchange Agreement with Global System Designs, Inc. (“GSD”) which was accounted for as a reverse merger transaction. In connection with the closing of the Share Exchange Agreement, GSD management was replaced by bBoothUSA management, and GSD changed its name to bBooth, Inc.
 
Effective April 21, 2017, we changed our corporate name from bBooth, Inc. to nFüsz, Inc. The name change was effected through a parent/subsidiary short-form merger of nFüsz, Inc., our wholly-owned Nevada subsidiary, formed solely for the purpose of the name change, with and into us. We were the surviving entity. To effectuate the merger, we filed Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada on April 4, 2017 and a Certificate of Correction with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada on April 17, 2017. The merger became effective on April 21, 2017. Our board of directors approved the merger, which resulted in the name change on that date. In accordance with Section 92A.180 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, stockholder approval of the merger was not required.
 
On the effective date of the name change merger, our name was changed to “nFüsz, Inc.” and our Articles of Incorporation, as amended (the “Articles”), were further amended to reflect our new legal name. With the exception of the name change, there were no other changes to our Articles.
 
Our Business
 
We have developed proprietary interactive video technology which serves as the basis for certain products and services that we market under the brand name “notifi”. Our notifiCRM, notifiADS, notifiLINKS, and notifiWEB products are cloud-based, software-as-a-service (“SaaS”), customer relationship management (“CRM”), sales lead generation, advertising and social engagement software, accessible on mobile and desktop platforms, that we license to individual consumers, sales-based organizations, consumer brands, marketing and advertising agencies, as well as to artists and social influencers. Our notifiCRM platform is an enterprise scalable, subscription-based customer relationship management program that incorporates proprietary, interactive audio/video messaging and interactive on-screen “virtual salesperson” communications technology. Our notifiCRM is distinguished from other CRM programs because it utilizes interactive video as the primary means of communication between our subscribers and their clients or prospects. Such clients and prospects can respond to notifiCRM subscribers’ calls to action in real time by clicking on links embedded in the video, all without leaving or stopping the video. Subscribers also have access to detailed analytics that reflect when the videos were viewed, by whom, how many times, for how long, and what items were clicked-on in the video to assist subscribers in determining the possible interest level of that particular client or prospect in the subject matter of the video. Our notifiTV and notifiLIVE products are also part of our proprietary interactive video platform that allows viewers to interact with pre-recorded as well as live broadcast video content by clicking on links embedded in on-screen people, objects, graphics or sponsors’ signage. Viewers can experience our notifiTV and notifiLIVE interactive content and capabilities on most devices available in the market today without the need to download special software or proprietary video players.

Marketing
 
We utilize our own proprietary interactive video platform as the foundation of our ongoing marketing initiatives. Our initiatives include daily, broad-based social media engagement by a dedicated team of full-time employees and outside consultants; management of our interactive video-based website; interactive video-based email campaigns, radio commercials, as well as our CEO’s weekly guest appearance on iHeart Radio’s CEO Money Radio Show, among many other ongoing initiatives designed to increase awareness of our products and services and drive conversion and adoption rates.
Competition
 
While we aware of numerous providers of customer relationship management software and related services, we are unaware of any offering products or services in the marketplace that incorporate interactive video technology or utilize customizable calls-to-action embedded in video as the primary means of communication between subscribers and their prospects and customers.
Intellectual Property
 
Our notifiCRM technology platform and associated applications, features and functionality are comprised of proprietary software, code and know-how that are of key importance to our plan of operations.
Research and Development
 
We spent $375,220 and $257,803 on research and development during the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 respectively. These funds were primarily used for development of our notifiCRM software.
 
Sources and Availability of Products and Names of Principal Suppliers
 
We currently rely on certain key suppliers and vendors in the coding and maintenance of its software. Management believes it has mitigated the associated risks of these single-source vendor relationships by ensuring that the Company has access to additional qualified vendors and suppliers to provide like or complementary services.
Dependence on Key Customers
 
Based on our business plan and anticipated future activities as described in this annual report, we do not expect to have any significant customer concentration and accordingly, we do not expect to be dependent on any key customers.
Government Regulation
 
Government regulation is not of significant concern for our business nor is government regulation expected to become an impediment to the business in the near or mid-term as management is currently unaware of any planned or anticipated government regulation that would have a material impact on the business. Our management believes it currently possesses all requisite authority to conduct its business as described in this annual report.
Employees
 
We currently operate with 7 full time employees. We also employ consultants on an as-needed-basis to provide specific expertise in areas of software design, development and coding, content creation, audio and video editing, video production services, and other business functions including marketing and accounting. None of our employees or consultants, all of whom work in North America, are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have had no labor-related work stoppages and we believe our relations with our employees and consultants are excellent.
Seasonality of Business
 
There is no seasonality with respect to our business or major fluctuations in monthly demand.
