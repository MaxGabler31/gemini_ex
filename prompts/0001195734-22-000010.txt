ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
The Neighborhood Sandwich Shop
Potbelly Corporation is a sandwich concept that has been feeding customers’ smiles with warm, toasty sandwiches, signature salads, hand-dipped shakes and other fresh menu items, customized just the way customers want them, for more than 40 years. Potbelly promises Fresh, Fast & Friendly service in an environment that reflects the local neighborhood. Our employees are trained to engage with our customers in a genuine way to provide a personalized experience. We believe the combination of our great food, people and atmosphere allows Potbelly to help people love lunch and creates a devoted base of Potbelly fans.
We believe that a key to our past and future success is our culture. It is embodied in The Potbelly Advantage, which is an expression of our Vision, Mission and Values, and the foundation of everything we do. Our Vision is to be your moment of escape, thanks to our relaxing shop, friendly faces, and toasty sandwiches. Our Mission is to help people love lunch. Our Values embody both how we lead and how we behave, and form the cornerstone of our culture. We use simple language that resonates from the frontline associate to the most senior levels of the organization, creating shared expectations and accountabilities in how we approach our day-to-day activities. We strive to be a fun, friendly and hardworking group of people who enjoy taking care of our customers, while at the same time taking care of each other.
As of December 26, 2021, we had 443 shops in 33 states and the District of Columbia. Of these, we operated 397 shops and franchisees operated 46 shops.
Our History
Potbelly started in 1977 as a small antique store on Lincoln Avenue in Chicago. To boost sales, the original owner began offering toasty warm sandwiches to customers. Soon, people who had no interest in antiques were stopping by to enjoy the delicious sandwiches, homemade desserts and live music featured in the shop. As time passed, Potbelly became a well-known neighborhood destination with a loyal following of regulars and frequent lines out the door.
Potbelly opened its second shop in 1997 and continued to open shops in more neighborhoods reaching 100 shops in 2005, 200 shops in 2008, 300 shops in 2013 and 400 shops in 2016. Throughout the growth, each new shop has maintained a similar look, vibe and experience that defines the Potbelly brand. Though our shops vary in size and shape, we maintain core elements in each new location, such as fast and efficient line flow, vintage décor customized with local details and exceptional customer focus.
Just like our first shop on Lincoln Avenue, we are committed to building community roots in all the neighborhoods we serve.
Our Business Strategy
We strive to be proactive and deliberate in our efforts to drive profitable growth in our existing business. Our “Traffic-Driven Profitability” 5-pillar strategic plan includes a prioritized set of low-cost strategic investments that we believe will deliver strong returns. The 5 pillars are: 
•Craveable Quality Food at a Great Value
•People Creating Good Vibes
•Customer Experiences that Drive Traffic Growth
•Digitally Driven Awareness, Connection and Traffic
•Franchise Focused Development
These initiatives include improvements to our overall customer experience, an updated, simplified menu and further enhanced Potbelly Perks program. They also include improvements to drive a better digital customer experience, payment technology and loyalty programs. 
Lastly, we are prioritizing low-cost, high-return traffic driving opportunities, as well as numerous initiatives that are focused on expanding shop level margins. While we cannot provide assurances that we will achieve and maintain these objectives, we consider each of them to be a core strategy of our business.

Shop Operations. We believe that continued excellence in shop-level execution is fundamental to our growth strategy. To maintain our operational standards, we use a Balanced Scorecard approach to measure People, Customers, Sales and Profits at each of our shops. Hiring the right people and maintaining optimal staffing levels enable us to run efficient operations. We track metrics such as peak hour throughput and Customer Satisfaction Survey Results. Shop sales and profitability are benchmarked against prior year periods and budget, and we focus on achieving targets on a shop-by-shop basis. To support our shop operators, we invest in systems and technology that can meaningfully improve shop-level execution. For example, we have applied technology to administrative activity to enable complete front-of-house, thereby maintaining customer focus. In addition, we are expanding our off-premise business, including catering, delivery and pickup, which we view as additional growth drivers.
Shop Development. Our company-operated shops are successful in diverse markets in 21 states and the District of Columbia. We evaluate a number of metrics to assess the optimal sites for our new shops, including neighborhood daytime population, site visibility, traffic and accessibility, along with an on-the-ground qualitative assessment of the characteristics of each unique trade area. This location-specific approach to development allows us to leverage our versatile shop format, which does not have standardized requirements with respect to size, shape or location, to achieve strong returns across a wide range of real estate settings. See “—Site Selection and Expansion—Shop Design” for more information about our shop requirements.
Marketing. We believe that our brand position, “Potbelly is the sandwich shop with the craveable quality and good vibes of a first-class dive” reflects our brand strength and competitive advantage and has broad appeal across a wide range of market types and geographies. We learn from the formal customer feedback we solicit, and from managers and employees who interact with customers in our shops, that many customers in new markets report positive recommendations from friends and family members who live in regions with established Potbelly shops. We believe that our positive brand perception helps drive interest in our shops in both existing and new markets. We enhance this with our social and digital interactions and complement our distinctive in-shop experience with online access, allowing customers to order ahead through both our website and Potbelly app, including catering, delivery or in-shop pick up.
Franchising. In 2010, we initiated a program to franchise shops in selected markets in the U.S. As of December 26, 2021, we had franchise shops in Arkansas, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Nevada. As we further develop our franchise program, we intend to expand the number of franchise shops on a disciplined basis. We focus on markets we believe have appropriate characteristics for our franchise shops and on franchisees that are compatible with the Potbelly culture. As of December 26, 2021, our franchisees operated 46 shops. See “—Franchising” for more information about our franchise programs. Although we do not expect franchise activities to result in significant revenue in the near term, we see the expansion of our franchising efforts to be a valuable potential growth opportunity over time.
Our Food
Our Menu
Each of our shops offers freshly-made food with high quality ingredients. The majority of our sales are generated during lunch, but other parts of the day are also important to our business. Our menu currently includes toasty warm sandwiches, signature salads, soups, chili, sides, desserts and, in our breakfast locations, breakfast sandwiches.
Overall, we believe our menu of high quality food at reasonable prices offers considerable value to our customers. In fiscal 2021, our system-wide average check per entree was approximately $9.81, up from $9.08 in 2020. 
We believe menu innovation is a way for us to grow our business, responding to consumer trends, listening to customer feedback, and understanding customer’s needs. This innovation includes the on-going development of bundling options, craveable add-ons, and premium protein sandwiches served toasty warm from our ovens, while continuing to encourage customization and personalization by each customer. 
Food Preparation and Safety
Food safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources, including our supply chain and quality assurance teams, to help ensure that our customers enjoy safe, quality food products. We have taken various steps to mitigate food safety and quality risks, including having personnel focused on this goal together with our supply chain team. We consider food safety and quality assurance when selecting our distributors and suppliers. The shops are provided the

training, processes and tools to serve safe, wholesome food to our customers. Our shops’ practices are validated by third-party food safety reviews, internal safety audits and routine health inspections.
Shop Operations and Management
We believe having an excellent manager in each shop is a critical factor in achieving continuous excellence in operations. Managers hire our employees, help ensure consistent execution of our menu items and strive to achieve specific targets that are evaluated on a quarterly basis. We devote significant time and resources to identifying, selecting and training our managers who plan, manage and operate their shops and who, along with our employees, provide a positive customer experience to our Potbelly fans. We believe our comprehensive processes for developing business leaders, such as our shop managers, are a key factor in driving our success.
Potbelly Operations
Our operations are structured around the elements of People, Customers, Sales and Profits. During our peak hours of 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., our employees greet our customers and take their orders (in some shops, we take their orders while they wait in line by using a proprietary tablet system to communicate with our preparation employees). We focus on effective communication, technology and management to provide a quick and seamless experience for our customers. In addition, each shop completes quarterly tactical plans designed to help the shop achieve its targets relative to each element. In order to better assess and improve the Potbelly experience, we track metrics such as sales and profitability, employee turnover and customer satisfaction. We review overall scores locally, regionally and nationally in order to assess our operational progress and identify areas of operational focus. Attaining sales and profit budgets and meeting Customer & People targets allows a shop to be eligible for quarterly incentive targets.
The Potbelly Experience
We seek to deliver a positive experience for every customer at every opportunity through our tasty food, unique atmosphere and outgoing and engaging employees. We seek to staff each shop with experienced teams to ensure consistent and attentive customer service. We look to hire employees who are friendly and responsive to the needs of our customers as they assist them in selecting menu items complementing individual preferences. We strive to staff appropriately during peak hours to ensure a fast yet personal Potbelly experience for each customer, with face-to-face interaction from start to finish. We also provide off-premise services, including catering, delivery and pick-up to serve our Potbelly fans.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 26, 2021, we employed approximately 5,500 persons, of which approximately 100 are corporate personnel, 1,500 are shop management personnel and the remainder are hourly shop personnel.
Potbelly actively creates and promotes an environment that is inclusive of all people and their unique abilities, strengths and differences. We respect and embrace diversity in each other, our customers, suppliers and all others with whom we interact as an essential component in the way we do business. We look to attract, hire and retain smart, talented and outgoing people who share and demonstrate our values. We value friendly employees who engage with our customers in a genuine way to provide a personalized experience. We believe we make expectations and accountabilities clear through our culture training and our Employee Handbook, including the Ethics Code of Conduct, which summarizes company information, policies and employee conduct guidelines and is required to be reviewed and signed by every employee upon hire and repeated annually. 
The Potbelly Advantage, outlined in our Employee Handbook, defines the Culture of our company and our employees. It is the recipe that motivates and inspires us to be the best at what we do. 
Our Vision – Your moment of escape, thanks to our relaxing shop, friendly faces and toasty sandwiches. 
Our Mission – Help people love lunch again.

◦Integrity: Act with dignity, honesty and respect
Our culture helps us to attract and retain employees and has contributed to our better-than-industry-average turnover rate for the year ended December 26, 2021. Employees are further encouraged to perform at their personal best through an ongoing scorecard measuring system that is tied directly to a pay for performance compensation program. We believe our sustainable process to hire, train and develop our people enables us to deliver a positive customer experience. A typical Potbelly shop consists of one manager, and as many as 5 to 14 employees during our peak hours.
Many of our managers live in the neighborhood in which their shop is located. We believe this allows them to get to know their customers, understand the unique character of each neighborhood and form deep roots within the community. The shop manager has primary responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the shop and is required to abide by Potbelly’s operating standards. Our Management Training Program provides new managers with five to nine weeks of training that emphasizes culture, standards, strategy and procedures to prepare them for success, and is followed by on-going, in-shop coaching with their District or Regional manager. Our shop managers report to District Managers who typically report to a Regional Director, and ultimately to our Chief Operations Officer. In addition, members of senior management visit shops regularly to help ensure that our culture, strategy and quality standards are being adhered to in all aspects of our operations.
Shop managers are responsible for selecting, hiring and training the employees for each new shop. The training period for new non-management employees lasts approximately eight weeks and is characterized by on-the-job supervision by an experienced employee. Ongoing employee training remains the responsibility of the shop manager, but, as noted above, we provide specific training for our employees around The Potbelly Advantage each year. Special emphasis is placed on the safety, consistency and quality of food preparation and service, which is monitored through ongoing coaching sessions and meetings with managers. In addition, we have other continuing communications with all of our employees on food safety and preparation standards.
At Potbelly, we believe rewards and recognition play an important role in retaining our employees. Our approach to reward talent is through a combination of competitive compensation and benefits. To foster a sense of ownership and align the interest of our team members with shareholders, stock options, restricted stock units and performance-based units are provided to eligible team members under our 2019 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Additionally, certain employees are eligible for performance-based cash incentive plans. These incentive plans reward individuals based on the achievement of predetermined company targets. 
Potbelly is committed to providing our employees with a benefits program that is both comprehensive and competitive. Our benefits program offers health care, dental and vision coverage, as well as financial security to our employees and their families. Potbelly provides an employee meal benefit program. Our Recognition Handbook outlines our programs that recognize employees’ contributions to the overall objectives and efficient operations of the Potbelly Nation. 
Restaurant Portfolio
As of December 26, 2021, we had 443 shops in 33 states and the District of Columbia. Of these, the company operates 397 shops and franchisees operate 46 shops. 
Table of Contents

In 2021, we did not open any new company shops. In 2020 and 2019, we opened 5 and 2, new company-operated shops, respectively, and expanded Boston, Chicago, and District of Colombia. In the near term we will continue to close underperforming shops and limit our rate of company-operated shop growth. In 2022, we do not expect to open any new company-operated shops. 
With an average new shop investment of approximately $600,000 and average unit volumes of approximately $1 million, which represent the average net sandwich shop sales for all shops on an annual basis (excluding periods when sales were adversely impacted by COVID-19), we strive to generate average shop-level profit margins, a non-GAAP measure, that range from the high teens to above 20%. However, we cannot provide any assurances that we will achieve and maintain similar profit margins or cash returns in the future. 
Site Selection and Expansion
We consider the location of a shop to be a critical variable in its long-term success and as such, we devote significant effort to the investigation and evaluation of potential locations. We seek new shop locations based on specific criteria, such as demographic characteristics, daytime population thresholds and traffic patterns, along with the potential visibility of, and accessibility to, the shop. New shops are built with only one purpose in mind: to generate cash flow that meets or exceeds those modeled in our return targets. In the near term we plan to limit our rate of company-operated shop growth.
Shop Design
We strive to create a unique customer experience that delivers a neighborhood feel for each shop. We typically design the interior of our shops in-house, utilizing outside architects when necessary. Our design team sources most furnishings and decorations for our shops. Each of our shops features vintage décor and shared design elements, such as the use of wood, wallpaper motifs and our signature Potbelly stove. Consistent with The Potbelly Advantage, our shops display locally-themed photos and other decorative items inspired by the neighborhood. Our shop size averages approximately 2,400 square feet; however, we currently target shop sizes between 1,800 and 2,500 square feet for new openings. The dining area of a typical shop can seat anywhere from 40 to 60 people. Some of our shops incorporate larger dining areas and outdoor patios. We believe the unique atmosphere creates a lively place where friends and family can get together, encourages repeat visits by our customers and drives increased sales. In response to COVID-19, we focused on improving our delivery and customer pickup experience. 
Construction
Construction of a new shop generally takes approximately 50 to 90 days from the date the location is leased or under contract, fully permitted and the landlord has delivered the space to Potbelly. Each new shop requires a total cash investment of approximately $600,000, but this figure could be materially higher or lower depending on the market, shop size and condition of the premises upon landlord delivery. We generally construct shops in third-party leased retail space but also construct free-standing buildings on leased properties. In the future, we intend to continue converting existing third-party leased retail space or constructing new shops in the majority of circumstances. For additional information regarding our leases, see “—Properties” in Item 2.
Franchising
We look for franchisees who love working with a team and have solid business experience, financial qualifications and personal motivation. Our franchise arrangements grant third parties a license to establish and operate a shop using our systems and our trademarks. The franchisee pays us for the ideas, strategy, marketing, operating system, training, purchasing power and brand recognition. All new U.S. franchisees participate in an eight to twelve-week training program consisting of real life experience in our company-operated shops. Franchised shops must be operated in compliance with our methods, standards and specifications, regarding menu items, ingredients, materials, supplies, services, fixtures, furnishings, décor and signs. Although we do not expect franchise activities to result in significant revenue in the near term, we see the expansion of our franchising efforts to be a valuable potential growth opportunity over time.

Advertising and Marketing
We believe our shops appeal to a broad base of loyal customers for our great food and fun environment staffed by friendly people. Under our current strategy we have devoted more resources to marketing, utilizing marketing and advertising tactics to promote the Potbelly brand and, among other things, generate awareness of shop locations, promotions and brand differentiation. 
Advertising
We promote our brand in all markets where we have shops. The use of digital media is the most common advertising vehicle. Additionally, we rely on in-shop materials to communicate and market to our customers.
Digital Marketing
We have increased our use of digital marketing tools, which enable us to reach a significant number of people in a timely and targeted fashion at a fraction of the cost of traditional media. We believe that our customers will use social media to make dining decisions or to share dining experiences, therefore we advertise on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and several other social media platforms. We also leverage our Potbelly App to communicate with our customers and personalize offers for them. These platforms allow them to transact with us digitally by ordering ahead, paying with their phone and earning tasty treats.
Potbelly Perks 
We offer a customer loyalty program for customers using the Potbelly Perks application at the point of sale. The customer will typically earn 10 points for every dollar spent, and the customer will earn a free entrée after earning 1,000 points. Once a customer earns a free entrée, that entrée reward will expire after 30 days. Any point in a customer’s account that does not go toward earning a full entrée will expire after the customer's account has been inactive for a year. 
Sourcing and Supply Chain
Our supply chain team sources, negotiates and purchases food supplies for our shops. We believe in using safe, high quality ingredients while maintaining our value position in the marketplace. We benchmark our products against the competition using consumer panels. We contract with Distribution Market Advantage, Inc. ("DMA"), a cooperative of multiple food distributors located throughout the nation. DMA is a broker through which we negotiate and gain access to third-party food distributors and suppliers. For fiscal year 2021, distributors through our DMA arrangement supplied us with more than 85% of our food supplies through six primary distributors: Reinhart FoodService, L.L.C., Ben E. Keith Company, Harbor Foodservice, Shamrock Foods, Gordon Food Service and Nicholas & Co. Our remaining food supplies are distributed by other distributors under separate contracts. Our distributors deliver inventory to our shops approximately two to three times per week.
We negotiate pricing and volume terms directly with certain of our suppliers and distributors or through DMA. Our supply chain team utilizes a mix of forward pricing protocols for certain items under which we agree with our supplier on fixed prices for deliveries at some time in the future, fixed pricing protocols under which we agree on a fixed price with our supplier for the duration of that protocol, and formula pricing protocols under which the prices we pay are based on a specified formula related to the prices of the goods, such as spot prices. Our use of any forward pricing arrangements varies substantially from time to time and these arrangements tend to cover relatively short periods (i.e., typically 12 months or less).
Currently we have pricing arrangements of varying lengths with our distributors and suppliers, including distributors and suppliers of meats, dairy, bread, cookie dough and other products. Meats represent about approximately 30% of our product purchasing composition. In fiscal year 2021, more than 90% of our meat products were sourced from 10 suppliers under non-exclusive contracts. We have a non-exclusive contract with Campagna-Turano Bakery, Inc. for our signature multigrain bread. Campagna-Turano Bakery, Inc. produces bread items in a primary and secondary production facility. We have secondary suppliers in place for many of our significant meats, and we believe we would be able to source our meat and bread requirements from different suppliers if doing so became necessary. However, changes in the price or availability of certain products may affect the profitability of certain items, our ability to maintain existing prices and our ability to purchase sufficient amounts of items to satisfy our customers’ demands.
Table of Contents

Many of our products, ingredients and supplies are currently sourced from multiple suppliers. Additionally, our supply chain team has established contingency plans for many key products. For example, manufacturers of certain products maintain alternative production facilities capable of satisfying our requirements should the primary facility experience interruptions. For other products, we believe we have identified alternate suppliers that could meet our requirements at competitive prices or, in some cases, have identified a product match that could be used in our shops. Our supply chain team regularly updates our procurement strategies to include contingency plans for new products and ingredients, as well as additional secondary and alternate suppliers. We believe these strategies would collectively enable us to obtain sufficient product quantities from other sources at competitive prices without material disruption should a current supplier be unable to fulfill its commitment to us.
Information Technology
Shop-level financial and accounting controls are handled through a point-of-sale and back-office system (“POS”) networked into a centralized data center. The POS system is used to process credit card sales transactions and manage the business, controlling costs such as inventory and labor. Our company-operated shops report all transaction data into our corporate data warehouse where business information is provided to corporate employees to aid in collaboration, communication, and training between shops and the corporate office. We believe our systems currently comply with all credit card industry security standards for processing of credit and gift cards.
Competition
We compete in the restaurant industry, primarily in the limited-service restaurant segment but also with restaurants in the full-service restaurant segment, and face significant competition from a wide variety of restaurants, convenience stores and other outlets on a national, regional and local level. We also face growing competition from meal delivery kit services. We believe that we compete primarily based on product quality, restaurant concept, service, convenience, value perception and price. Our competition continues to intensify as competitors increase the breadth and depth of their product offerings and open new units. We compete with limited-service restaurants, specialty restaurants and other retail concepts for prime shop locations. In recent years, competition has increased from food delivery services, which offer meals from a wide variety of restaurants, particularly during COVID-19.
Government Regulation
We and our franchisees are subject to various federal, state, and local laws affecting our business. Each of our shops is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which may include, among others, health and safety, nutritional menu labeling, health care, environmental and fire agencies in the state, or municipality in which the shop is located. Difficulty in obtaining or failing to obtain the required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the development of a new shop in a particular area. Additionally, difficulties or inabilities to retain or renew licenses, or increased compliance costs due to changed regulations, could adversely affect operations at existing shops.
Our shop operations are also subject to federal and state labor laws, including the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act and the U.S. Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, governing such matters as minimum wages, overtime and worker conditions. Significant numbers of our food service and preparation personnel are paid at rates related to the applicable minimum wage, and further increases in the minimum wage or other changes in these laws could increase our labor costs. Our ability to respond to minimum wage increases by increasing menu prices will depend on the responses of our competitors and customers. Our distributors and suppliers also may be affected by higher minimum wage and benefit standards, which could result in higher costs for goods and services supplied to us.
We and our franchisees may also be subject to lawsuits from our employees, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or others alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the “PPACA”) enacted in March 2010 requires chain restaurants with 20 or more locations in the United States to comply with federal nutritional disclosure requirements. The FDA issued final regulations with regard to restaurant menu labeling that became effective May 7, 2018. A number of states, counties and cities have also enacted menu labeling laws requiring multi-unit restaurant operators to disclose additional nutritional information to customers, or have enacted legislation restricting the use of certain types of ingredients in restaurants. While our ability to adapt to consumer preferences is a strength of our concepts, the effect of such labeling requirements on consumer choices, if any, is unclear at this time.
Table of Contents

We and our franchisees are subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act (the “ADA”), which, among other things, requires our shops to meet federally mandated requirements for the disabled. The ADA prohibits discrimination in employment and public accommodations on the basis of disability. Under the ADA, we and our franchisees could be required to expend funds to modify our shops to provide service to, or make reasonable accommodations for the employment of, disabled persons. In addition, our employment practices are subject to the requirements of the Immigration and Naturalization Service relating to citizenship and residency. Government regulations could affect and change the items we procure for resale. We and our franchisees may also become subject to legislation or regulation seeking to tax and/or regulate sugary beverages and high-fat and high-sodium foods, which could be costly to comply with. Our results can be impacted by tax legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate and by accounting standards or pronouncements.
We and our franchisees are also subject to laws and regulations relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments, gift cards and consumer credit, protection and fraud, and any failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our reputation or lead to litigation, which could adversely affect our financial condition.
Our franchising activities are subject to the rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. The FTC’s franchise rule and various state laws require that we furnish a franchise disclosure document (“FDD”) containing certain information to prospective franchisees and a number of states require registration of the FDD with state authorities. Substantive state laws that regulate the franchisor-franchisee relationship exist in a substantial number of states, and bills have been introduced in Congress from time to time that would provide for federal regulation of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. The state laws often limit, among other things, the duration and scope of non-competition provisions, the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise and the ability of a franchisor to designate sources of supply. 
See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A for a discussion of risks relating to federal, state, local and international regulation of our business.
Seasonality
Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Historically, customer spending patterns for our established shops are lowest in the first quarter of the year due to holidays, consumer habits and adverse weather. Our quarterly results have been and will continue to be affected by the timing of new shop openings and their associated pre-opening costs. As a result of these and other factors, our financial results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.
Intellectual Property and Trademarks
We regard our “Potbelly” and “Potbelly Sandwich Works” trademarks as having significant value and as being important factors in the marketing of our shops. We have also obtained trademarks for several of our other menu items, such as “A Wreck,” and for various advertising slogans, including “Good Vibes, Great Sandwiches,” “Feed Your Smile” and “A First Class Dive.” We are aware of names and marks similar to the trademarks of ours used by other persons in certain geographic areas in which we have shops. However, we believe such uses will not adversely affect us. Our policy is to pursue registration of our intellectual property whenever possible and to oppose vigorously any infringement thereof.
We license the use of our registered trademarks to franchisees through franchise arrangements. The franchise arrangements restrict franchisees’ activities with respect to the use of our trademarks and impose quality control standards in connection with goods and services offered in connection with the trademarks.
