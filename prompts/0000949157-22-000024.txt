Item 1.  Business
Overview
Century Aluminum Company is a global producer of primary aluminum and operates aluminum reduction facilities, or "smelters," in the United States and Iceland.  Aluminum is an internationally traded commodity, and its price is effectively determined on the London Metal Exchange (the "LME"), plus applicable regional and value-added product premiums. Our primary aluminum reduction facilities produce standard-grade and value-added primary aluminum products.  Our current annual production capacity is approximately 1,016,000 tonnes per year ("tpy"). We produced approximately 784,000 tonnes of primary aluminum in 2021.
In addition to our primary aluminum assets, we own a carbon anode production facility located in the Netherlands ("Vlissingen"). Carbon anodes are consumed in the production of primary aluminum. Vlissingen supplies carbon anodes to our aluminum smelter in Grundartangi, Iceland. Each of our aluminum smelters in the United States produces anodes at on-site facilities.
At Century, we strive to provide innovative and reliable aluminum products to our customers, best-in-class returns for our stakeholders and a safe and environmentally sustainable workplace for our people and the communities in which we operate. We seek to responsibly operate our businesses to maintain a strong balance sheet through commodity cycles, while investing to lower our cost structure, expand our production and increase our competitiveness. 
Century has invested significant capital in recent years to increase our production and grow our product portfolio to include more value-added aluminum products to better serve our customers in the U.S. and Europe. We believe that our focus on lowering costs and decommoditizing our product line will enable us to deliver profitable long-term growth and to differentiate ourselves from overseas competitors with longer supply lines into the markets in which we serve. 
Century conducts our business with a focus on sustainability, as well as the health and safety, and socioeconomics of our people and the communities in which we operate. Through our Natur-AlTM product line, we are able to provide our customers and communities with low-carbon aluminum products that enable the broader energy transition movement. 
We operate our business through one reportable segment, primary aluminum. Additional information about our segment reporting and certain geographic information is available in Note 17. Business Segments to the consolidated financial statements included herein.
Century Aluminum Company is a Delaware corporation with our principal executive offices located at One South Wacker Drive, Suite 1000, Chicago, Illinois 60606.
Primary Aluminum Facilities
Overview of Facilities
We operate three U.S. aluminum smelters, in Hawesville, Kentucky ("Hawesville"), Robards, Kentucky ("Sebree") and Goose Creek, South Carolina ("Mt. Holly"), and one aluminum smelter in Grundartangi, Iceland ("Grundartangi"). 
Grundartangi
The Grundartangi facility, located in Grundartangi, Iceland, is a primary aluminum reduction facility owned and operated by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Nordural Grundartangi ehf, and is our most modern facility. Grundartangi is currently in the process of a multi-year expansion project that has brought the annual primary aluminum production capacity to current capacity of approximately 317,000 tonnes and is expected to ultimately increase annual production capacity at Grundartangi to approximately 325,000 tonnes. Grundartangi produces standard-grade aluminum ingot and a primary foundry alloy product, which is a value-added product that is sold at a premium to standard-grade aluminum.
In addition, in late 2021 Century began construction of a new billet casthouse at Grundartangi (the “Casthouse Project”). The new value-added casthouse will have a capacity of 150,000 tonnes of billet production and is expected to start production in the first quarter of 2024. The Casthouse Project will also increase Grundartangi’s annual capacity to produce primary foundry alloys from its current 60,000 tonnes of capacity to 120,000 tonnes of capacity. This incremental billet and primary foundry alloy capacity displaces standard-grade ingot production, raising expected total value-added product premiums for Grundartangi products. The billet produced at the Grundartangi casthouse is expected to be low-carbon aluminum or Natur-AlTM.
Hawesville
Hawesville, located adjacent to the Ohio River near Hawesville, Kentucky, is a primary aluminum reduction facility owned and operated by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Century Kentucky, Inc. ("CAKY"). Hawesville has an annual production capacity of approximately 250,000 tonnes of primary aluminum.
Approximately 60% of Hawesville's capacity was curtailed in the fourth quarter of 2015 as a result of significant declines in the LME price for aluminum. We are currently in the process of a multi-year project that began in 2018 to restart Hawesville's previously curtailed capacity and return the plant to a production level of approximately 200,000 MT per annum (80% of capacity). Our Hawesville facility experienced several equipment issues in late December 2020 that partially reduced the plant’s production level; however, the process of returning to our planned operating level of 80% of capacity at Hawesville began in the second quarter of 2021 and is now complete. The rebuild of the fifth and final potline is expected to be completed over the next several years subject to market conditions.
Hawesville produces standard-grade and high purity aluminum that can be cast into sow or delivered directly to nearby customers as molten metal. 
Hawesville is our largest U.S. smelter and is the largest producer of high purity primary aluminum in North America. Four of Hawesville's five potlines are capable of producing high purity aluminum which is sold at a premium to standard-grade aluminum and is used extensively by the defense industry as well as for aerospace and other applications.  
Sebree
Sebree, located adjacent to the Green River near Robards, Kentucky, is a primary aluminum reduction facility owned and operated by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Century Aluminum Sebree LLC ("Century Sebree"). Sebree has an annual production capacity of approximately 220,000 tonnes of primary aluminum. Sebree produces standard-grade aluminum that can be cast into sow and value-added products, including billet, that are sold at a premium to standard-grade aluminum or delivered directly to nearby customers as molten metal. In 2019, we expanded the smelter’s overall output by adding 20,000 tonnes of additional secondary (scrap reprocessing) capacity.
Mt. Holly
Mt. Holly, located in Goose Creek, South Carolina, is a primary aluminum reduction facility owned and operated by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Century Aluminum of South Carolina, Inc. ("CASC"). Mt. Holly has an annual production capacity of approximately 229,000 tonnes of primary aluminum. In December 2020, we began a multi-year project to restore previously curtailed capacity at Mt. Holly. The initial phase, which will return Mt. Holly to approximately 170,000 MT per annum (75% of capacity), is progressing and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2022, subject to market conditions. See "Key Production Costs — Electrical Power Supply Agreements" below for further discussion of our power arrangements at Mt. Holly.
Mt. Holly produces standard-grade aluminum that is cast into sow as well as several value-added products, including billet and foundry products. These value-added primary aluminum products are sold at a premium to standard-grade aluminum. 
Primary Aluminum Production Capacity
Our primary aluminum smelters and their respective primary aluminum capacities are shown in the following table: 

Facility | Ownership Percentage | Operational | Annual Production Capacity (tpy) (1) | Actual 2021 Annual Production (tpy) 
Grundartangi, Iceland | 100% | 1998 | 317,000 | 315,000 
Hawesville, Kentucky, USA | 100% | 1970 | 250,000 | 172,000 
Sebree, Kentucky, USA | 100% | 1973 | 220,000 | 209,000 
Mt. Holly, South Carolina, USA | 100% | 1980 | 229,000 | 88,000 
 | | | 1,016,000 | 784,000 

(1)The tonnes per year (tpy) figures in this column reflect an estimate of the facility's total production capacity based on plant design, historical operating results and operating efficiencies and does not necessarily represent each facility’s maximum production capability.
Primary Aluminum Shipment Volume
The following table shows our primary aluminum shipment volumes since 2017.
Carbon Anode Production Facility 
Vlissingen    
In addition to our primary aluminum assets, we own a carbon anode production facility located in Vlissingen, Netherlands, which is owned and operated by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Century Aluminum Vlissingen B.V. Vlissingen has an annual carbon anode production capacity of approximately 163,000 tonnes. We acquired Vlissingen in 2012 and restarted the facility in late 2013 with an initial carbon anode production capacity of 75,000 tonnes. Since the acquisition, we have completed a variety of expansion projects and efficiency programs in order to more than double the plant's production capacity. With these expansion projects and efficiency programs in place, we expect Vlissingen will be able to supply approximately 93% to 98% of Grundartangi’s carbon anodes requirements at current production levels. Each of our smelters in the United States produces anodes at on-site facilities.
Pricing
Pricing for primary aluminum products is typically comprised of three components: (i) the base commodity price, which is based on quoted prices on the LME, plus (ii) any regional premium (e.g., the Midwest premium for metal sold in the United States and the European Duty Paid premium for metal sold into Europe) plus (iii) any value-added product premium. Our operating results are highly sensitive to changes in the LME price of primary aluminum and the amount of regional premiums and value-added product premiums.  As a result, from time to time, we assess the appropriateness of mitigating the effects of fluctuations in the aluminum price through the use of fixed-price commitments, LME-linked supply contracts and other financial instruments. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for further discussion of how we manage our exposure to market risk. 
Customer Base
We have historically derived substantially all of our consolidated net sales of primary aluminum from a small number of customers. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we derived approximately 60% of our consolidated sales from Glencore plc and its affiliates (together, "Glencore") and approximately 14% of our consolidated sales from Southwire Company ("Southwire"). We currently have agreements in place to sell a substantial portion of our 2022 production to these customers. We expect that the rest of our 2022 customer base will remain fairly concentrated among a small number of customers under short-term contracts.
Both Glencore and Southwire purchase aluminum produced at our U.S. smelters at prices based on the LME price for primary aluminum plus the Midwest premium plus any additional market-based product premiums. Glencore also purchases aluminum produced at our Grundartangi, Iceland smelter at prices based on the LME plus the European Duty Paid premium plus any additional market-based product premiums. Glencore beneficially owns 42.9% of our outstanding common stock (46.4% on a fully diluted basis). See Note 2. Related Party Transactions to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information concerning our relationship with Glencore. 
Key Production Costs
Alumina, electrical power, calcined petroleum coke and liquid pitch (the key raw materials for carbon anodes), and labor are the principal components of our cost of production.  These components together represented over 75% of our cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2021.  For a description of certain risks related to our raw materials, electrical power, labor and other key supplies, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(1) Under the terms of this agreement, the contract is automatically extended year-to-year unless either party gives notice at least one year before the end date.
Electrical power represents one of the largest components of our cost of goods sold. From time to time, we may enter into forward contracts or other hedging arrangements to mitigate our electrical power or natural gas price risk. The paragraphs below summarize the sources of power and the long-term power arrangements for each of our operations.
Grundartangi. Power is currently supplied to Grundartangi from hydroelectric and geothermal sources under long-term power purchase agreements with three separate power suppliers - HS, Landsvirkjun and OR. These power purchase agreements expire on various dates from 2026 through 2036 (subject to extension). In July 2021, Grundartangi reached an agreement with Landsvirkjun for an extension of its existing 161 MW power contract through December 31, 2026 and will increase the existing contract from 161 MW to 182 MW over time to provide the necessary flexibility to support the most recent capacity creep requirements and future growth opportunities for value-added products at the Grundartangi plant, including the Casthouse Project. Historically, all of the power supplied to Grundartangi has been delivered at prices indexed to the price of primary aluminum. Since November 2019, the price of approximately 30% of Grundartangi’s power requirements has been linked to the market price for power in the Nord Pool power market, the trading market for power in the Nordic countries and certain other areas of Europe. As of December 31, 2021, we had entered into financial contracts to fix the forward price of approximately 60% and 55% of Grundartangi's Nord Pool based power requirements for the years ending December 31, 2022 
and December 31, 2023, respectively. We continue to monitor power prices and may enter into further similar financial contracts in the future. Each power purchase agreement contains take-or-pay obligations with respect to a significant percentage of the total committed and available power under such agreement. 
Hawesville. CAKY is party to a power supply arrangement with Kenergy and EDF Trading North America, LLC ("EDF") which provides market-based power to the Hawesville smelter. Under this arrangement, the power companies purchase power on the open market and pass it through to Hawesville at Midcontinent Independent System Operator ("MISO") pricing plus transmission and other costs. The power supply arrangement with Kenergy has an effective term through December 2023. The arrangement with EDF to act as our market participant with MISO has an effective term through May 2023. Both of these agreements extend automatically year to year thereafter unless a one year notice of termination is given by either party.
Sebree. Century Sebree is party to a power supply arrangement with Kenergy and EDF which provides market-based power to the Sebree smelter. Similar to the arrangement at Hawesville, the power companies purchase power on the open market and pass it through to Sebree at MISO pricing plus transmission and other costs. The power supply arrangement with Kenergy has an effective term through December 2023. The arrangement with EDF to act as our market participant with MISO has an effective term through May 2023. Both of these agreements extend automatically year to year thereafter unless a one year notice of termination is given by either party.
Mt. Holly. CASC is party to an agreement with Santee Cooper for power to the Mt. Holly smelter. Under this contract, 100% of Mt. Holly's electrical power requirements are supplied from Santee Cooper's generation at cost of service based rates. This power agreement provides sufficient energy to allow the smelter to implement a restart project to increase its production to 75% of Mt. Holly's full production capacity. The agreement with Santee Cooper has a term through December 31, 2023. 
See Note 15. Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information concerning our power arrangements. 
Employees and Human Capital Resources
We believe our employees are key to achieving our business goals and growth strategy. As of December 31, 2021, we had 2,512 employees. Of these, 1,787 were domiciled in the United States, 71 in the Netherlands and 654 in Iceland. 

Health, Safety and Wellness. Nothing is more important than the health and safety of our employees and the members of the communities in which we do business. We continuously assess the risks our employees face at our facilities and we work to mitigate those risks through frequent training and other preventative safety and health programs and on the job training. We strive for zero injuries and accidents, to foster systems and processes aimed to continuously improve our health and safety performance and to integrate risk management relating to health and safety into all aspects of our operations. We emphasize the importance of safety goals by including safety performance as one of the metrics for determining payouts under our annual incentive awards to our executives.

Competition
The market for primary aluminum is global, and demand for aluminum varies widely from region to region. We compete with aluminum producers within the U.S. and internationally as well as with producers of alternative materials such as steel, copper, carbon fiber, composites, plastic and glass, each of which may be substituted for aluminum in certain applications. Our competitive position depends, in part, on the availability of electricity, alumina and our other key raw materials to our operations at competitive prices. We face global competition from companies who may have access to these key production costs at lower prices, and they may also receive various subsidies from local, state and federal governments. Many of our competitors are also larger than we are and have vertically integrated operations with superior cost positions. As a result, these companies may be better able to withstand reductions in price or other adverse industry or economic conditions.
Competitive Advantages 
While we face significant competition, we also have several competitive advantages. We believe our key competitive advantages are:
Focus on Primary Aluminum Business. We operate principally in the production of primary aluminum. By concentrating our activities in primary aluminum production, we are able to focus our resources on optimizing the cost effectiveness of our existing operations, minimizing overhead costs and maintaining a market position where our products are ultimately targeted toward a broad range of end uses.
Strong Internal Growth Opportunities. Over the past several years, we have undertaken various expansion programs at all of our operating facilities and continue to pursue additional internal growth opportunities. We are currently in the process of a multi-year project at Hawesville to restart previously curtailed capacity. Through December 31, 2021, we have rebuilt or restarted 200,000 tonnes of production (Hawesville's current production capacity) and can restart another 50,000 tonnes of production capacity in the future subject to market conditions. At Sebree, in 2019, we expanded the smelter’s overall output by adding 20,000 tonnes of additional secondary (scrap reprocessing) capacity. At Mt. Holly, a restart project is underway to increase its production to 75% of Mt. Holly's full production capacity which we expect to be completed in the second half of 2022, plus an additional 57,000 tonnes of production in the future provided we are able to obtain sufficient energy at competitive rates. 
At our Grundartangi, Iceland smelter, we are in the process of a multi-year project that is expected to ultimately increase annual production capacity to approximately 325,000 tonnes. In late 2021, Century began construction on the Casthouse Project. The new value-added casthouse will have a capacity of 150,000 tonnes of billet production and is expected to start production in the first quarter of 2024. The billet produced at the Grundartangi casthouse is expected to be low-carbon aluminum or Natur-AlTM. At Vlissingen, since our purchase of this facility, we have completed a variety of expansion projects and efficiency programs in order to more than double the plant's production capacity. With these expansion projects and efficiency programs in place, we expect Vlissingen to be able to supply approximately 93% to 98% of Grundartangi’s carbon anode requirements at current production levels. We continue to pursue additional internal growth opportunities to maximize efficiencies and improve overall performance.
 Sustainability. Our Natur-Al™ aluminum produced at our Grundartangi, Iceland smelter has one of the lowest carbon footprints in the industry due to Grundartangi’s access to clean hydroelectric and geothermal power sources and the operating expertise of our excellent workforce. Century Aluminum Company and our Grundartangi smelter have also been certified against the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI) Performance Standard for responsible production, sourcing and stewardship of aluminum. In addition to providing additional value to our customers, our low carbon footprint in Iceland mitigates our exposure to current or future carbon regulations. Century is also committed to exploring additional opportunities to reprocess and reuse scrap aluminum in its operations going forward and to reduce our carbon footprint across our operations. 
Duty Free Access to our Major Customer Markets. Our facilities benefit from international and national trade laws and regulations. For example, the European Union imposes import tariffs on primary aluminum from producers outside the European Economic Area (the "EEA"), which includes Iceland, and the U.S. currently imposes a 10% tariff on certain primary aluminum imports into the United States. Our U.S. and Icelandic businesses currently access these respective markets duty-free which provides us with an advantage over our competitors who sell into these markets under these tariff regimes.
 Close Proximity to our Major Customers in the Two Shortest Aluminum Markets in the World.  The U.S. and the E.U. are the second and third largest aluminum consuming regions in the world, but do not produce enough aluminum domestically to satisfy their own demand. Our production locations within these markets provide us with a significant competitive advantage over our foreign competitors by providing our customers with short, reliable supply chains, better technical service and opportunities for value added collaboration. Our U.S. facilities benefit from the proximity to our U.S. customer base, allowing us to capture the Midwest premium and providing a competitive advantage in freight costs over our foreign competitors. The proximity to our customers also allows us to deliver a portion of our Kentucky production in molten form, saving casting costs, and providing a competitive advantage over other potential suppliers. In Iceland, our proximity to European markets provides a competitive advantage for Grundartangi, allowing us to capture the European Duty Paid Premium and other logistical benefits compared to our competitors outside the EEA. 
 Diverse Value Added Product and Secondary Market Portfolio. We have the ability across our operations to cast a variety of aluminum products, both in terms of shapes and alloys. These high purity and value-added primary aluminum products are sold at a premium to standard-grade aluminum. Our Hawesville plant is the largest producer of high purity aluminum in North America. Four of Hawesville’s five potlines are capable of producing high purity aluminum, which is used extensively by the defense industry as well as for certain aerospace applications. Both Sebree and Mt. Holly have value-added casthouses that have the ability to produce large volumes of billet, slab and other value-added products. We have just started construction on the Grundartangi casthouse which will enable Grundartangi to produce Natur-Al™ billet and other value-added products and service the European market. 
 Access to Market Power. Our Kentucky operations benefit from market-based power contracts that provide electricity to these operations at competitive prices. 
Experienced Management Team. Our management team includes executives and managers with significant experience in the aluminum industry, the broader metals and mining sector, the development of large and complex projects and the functional disciplines we require to manage and grow our business. In addition, the managers of our production facilities have substantial backgrounds and expertise in the technical and operational aspects of these plants.
For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. We may be unable to continue to compete successfully in the highly competitive markets in which we operate.
Government Regulations 
Our facilities and operations are subject to various laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate, including, but not limited to, environmental laws and regulations.  We have spent, and expect to continue to spend, significant amounts for compliance with those various laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations.  In addition, some of our past manufacturing activities or those of our predecessors have resulted in environmental consequences that require remedial measures.  Under certain environmental laws, which may impose liability regardless of fault, we may be liable for the costs of remediation of contaminated property, including our current and formerly owned or operated properties or adjacent areas, or for the amelioration of damage to natural resources. We believe, based on currently available information, that compliance with existing laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings and our competitive position. Furthermore, we believe, based on currently available information, that our current liabilities are not likely to have a material adverse effect on Century. However, we cannot predict the requirements of future laws and future requirements at current or formerly owned or operated properties or adjacent areas or the outcome of certain existing litigation to which we are a party.  Such future requirements or events may result in unanticipated costs or liabilities that may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  More information concerning our contingencies can be found in Note 15. Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included herein.
There is also increasing focus and scrutiny from both the United States government, foreign governments and other regulatory authorities on greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions and potential impacts relating to climate change. We continuously review our own GHG and other emissions streams and seek to limit the impact of our operations on the communities in which we operate. Future laws, regulations, or policies that are enacted in response to concerns over GHG emissions and climate change, such as mandatory reporting and disclosure obligations, carbon tax, any "cap and trade" programs or similar regulatory measures, could significantly increase our operational and compliance burdens and costs. We continuously review and monitor climate change related proposed legislation for potential impacts on Century and our operations. For more information on the risk of climate change related legislation, laws and regulations, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Intellectual Property
We own or have rights to use a number of intellectual property rights relating to various aspects of our operations. We do not consider our business to be materially dependent on any of these intellectual property rights.
