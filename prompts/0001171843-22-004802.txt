Item 1. Business
Business and Organization
 
America’s Car-Mart, Inc., a Texas corporation initially formed in 1981 (the “Company”), is one of the largest publicly held automotive retailers in the United States focused exclusively on the “Integrated Auto Sales and Finance” segment of the used car market. References to the “Company” include the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries. The Company’s operations are principally conducted through its two operating subsidiaries, America’s Car Mart, Inc., an Arkansas corporation (“Car-Mart of Arkansas”), and Colonial Auto Finance, Inc., an Arkansas corporation (“Colonial”). Collectively, Car-Mart of Arkansas and Colonial are referred to herein as “Car-Mart.” The Company primarily sells older model used vehicles and provides financing for substantially all of its customers. Many of the Company’s customers have limited financial resources and would not qualify for conventional financing as a result of limited credit histories or past credit problems. As of April 30, 2022, the Company operated 154 dealerships located primarily in small cities throughout the South-Central United States.
 
Impact of COVID-19
 
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, and, throughout 2020 and 2021, many U.S. states and localities issued lockdown orders which impacted the operations of our stores and consumer demand. While our dealerships remained open and operated under all CDC recommendations, the fluidity of the resulting environment led to uncertainty in regard to consumer demand and ongoing changes in government mandates, as well as unpredictable risks and challenges stemming from COVID-19.
 
Although the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to evolve, and conditions have improved, we will continue to monitor the situation closely. The ultimate impact of this pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including, but not limited to, the duration of the pandemic, its severity, availability and effectiveness of vaccines, related restrictions on travel, additional federal stimulus measures and enhanced unemployment benefits, if any. An extended period of economic disruption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic has had and could continue to have a material impact on our business in regard to product supply and pricing, credit losses and consumer behavior. The COVID-19 pandemic may also intensify the risks described in the other risk factors disclosed in this Form 10-K. The COVID-19 pandemic, or any future outbreak of any contagious diseases or other public health emergency, could continue to, and may materially, adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.

Business Strategy
 
In general, it is the Company’s objective to continue to expand its business using the same business model that has been developed and used by Car-Mart for over 40 years. This business strategy focuses on:
Collecting Customer Accounts. Collecting customer accounts is perhaps the single most important aspect of operating an Integrated Auto Sales and Finance used car business and is a focal point for dealership level and corporate office personnel on a daily basis. The Company measures and monitors the collection results of its dealerships using internally developed delinquency and account loss standards. Substantially all associate incentive compensation is tied directly or indirectly to collection results. The Company has a vice president of collections and support staff at the corporate level to work with field operators to improve credit results. This team monitors efficiencies and the effectiveness of account representatives as they work to improve customer success rates. The Company has also implemented several collection efforts centrally at the corporate office through texting to supplement the field efforts. Over the last five fiscal years, the Company’s annual credit losses as a percentage of sales have ranged from a high of 27.7% in fiscal 2018 to a low of 20.3% in fiscal 2021 (average of 24.4%), with the fiscal year 2021 credit loss percentage reflecting a $15.1 million decrease to the Company’s allowance for credit losses primarily related to improved credit losses during fiscal 2021, following a $9.1 million increase to the allowance in fiscal 2020 primarily as a result of COVID-19. During fiscal 2022, credit losses began to normalize to pre-pandemic levels, with credit losses as a percentage of sales at 24.2%. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion.
Maintaining a Decentralized Operation. The Company’s dealerships operate on a decentralized basis. Each dealership is ultimately responsible for buying and selling its own vehicles, making credit decisions, and collecting the contracts it originates in accordance with established policies and procedures. Approximately 50% of customers make their payments in person at one of the Company’s dealerships. This decentralized structure is complemented by the oversight and involvement of corporate office management and the maintenance of centralized financial controls, including monitoring proprietary credit scoring, establishing standards for down-payments and contract terms, and an internal compliance function.
Expanding Through Controlled Organic Growth and Strategic Acquisitions. The Company grows by increasing revenues at existing dealerships and opening or acquiring new dealerships. The Company has historically viewed organic growth at its existing dealerships as its primary source for growth. The Company continues to make infrastructure investments in order to improve performance of existing dealerships and to support growth of its customer count. The Company added three new dealerships during the year, ending fiscal 2022 with 154 locations. The Company intends to continue to add new dealerships, subject to favorable operating performance and available general manager talent to run these dealerships, and pursue strategic acquisition opportunities that it believes will enhance its brand and maximize the return to its shareholders. The Company has successfully completed acquisitions in two of the last three fiscal years and anticipates that future acquisitions will likely contribute to its growth. These plans are subject to change based on both internal and external factors.
Selling Basic Transportation. The Company focuses on selling basic and affordable transportation to its customers. The Company’s average retail sales price was $16,649 per unit in fiscal 2022, compared to $13,621 in fiscal 2021. Used vehicle pricing continues to increase due to the high demand and tight supply of used vehicles. In general, the demand for quality, used vehicles has increased due to shortage of new vehicles and fewer available used vehicles on account of lower repossessions. The Company aims to keep the terms of its installment sales contracts relatively short (overall portfolio weighted average of 42.9 months), while balancing that with affordable payments.
Operating in Smaller Communities. The majority of the Company’s dealerships are located in cities and towns with a population of 50,000 or less. The Company believes that by operating in smaller communities it develops strong personal relationships, resulting in better collection results. Further, the Company believes that operating costs, such as salaries, rent and advertising, are lower in smaller communities than in major metropolitan areas. As the Company builds its infrastructure and certain aspects of the business become more centralized, we may expand and operate in larger cities.

Enhanced Management Talent and Experience. The Company seeks to hire honest and hardworking individuals to fill entry level positions, nurture and develop these associates, and promote them to managerial positions from within the Company. By promoting from within, the Company believes it is able to train its associates in the Car-Mart way of doing business, maintain the Company’s unique culture and develop the loyalty of its associates by providing opportunity for advancement. Due to growth, the Company has, to a larger extent, also had to look outside of the Company for associates possessing requisite skills and who share the values and appreciate the unique culture the Company has developed over the years. The Company has been able to attract quality individuals via its General Manager Recruitment and Advancement team as well as other key areas. Management has determined that it will be increasingly difficult to grow the Company without looking for outside talent. The Company’s operating success has been a benefit for recruiting outside talent; however, the Company expects the hiring environment to continue to be challenging as a result of increasing wages, competition for qualified workers and the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business and operations.
Cultivating Customer Relationships. The Company believes that developing and maintaining a relationship with its customers is critical to the success of the Company. A large percentage of sales at mature dealerships are made to repeat customers, and the Company estimates an additional 10% to 15% of sales result from customer referrals. By developing a personal relationship with its customers, the Company believes it is in a better position to assist a customer, and the customer is more likely to cooperate with the Company should the customer experience financial difficulty during the term of his or her installment contract. The Company is able to cultivate these relationships through a variety of communication channels and the fact that a high percentage of customers make their payments in person at one of the Company’s dealerships on a weekly or bi-weekly basis.
Business Strengths
 
The Company believes it possesses a number of strengths or advantages that distinguish it from most of its competitors. These business strengths include:
 
Experienced and Motivated Management. The Company’s senior management team has significant experience in the industry and an average tenure of nearly 20 years. Several of Car-Mart’s dealership managers have been with the Company for more than 10 years. Each dealership manager is compensated, at least in part, based upon the dealership’s profitability. A significant portion of the compensation of senior management is tied to stock performance.
Proven Business Practices. The Company’s operations are highly structured. While dealerships operate on a decentralized basis, the Company has established policies, procedures, and business practices for virtually every aspect of a dealership’s operations. Detailed online operating manuals are available to assist the dealership manager and office, sales and collections personnel in performing their daily tasks. As a result, each dealership is operated in a uniform manner. Further, corporate office personnel monitor the dealerships’ operations through weekly visits and a number of daily, weekly and monthly communications and reports.
Low Cost Operator. The Company has structured its dealership and corporate office operations to minimize operating costs. The number of associates employed at the dealership level is dictated by the number of active customer accounts each dealership services. Associate compensation is standardized for each dealership position and adjusted for various markets. Other operating costs are closely monitored and scrutinized. Technology is utilized to maximize efficiency. The Company monitors operating costs as a percentage of revenues, and per unit sold, and strives to provide excellent service at a low cost.

Well-Capitalized / Limited External Capital Required for Growth.  As of April 30, 2022, the Company’s debt to equity ratio (Revolving credit facilities and non-recourse notes payable divided by total equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet) was 0.94 to 1.0. Excluding the amount of debt equal to cash, the Company’s adjusted debt to equity ratio (a non-GAAP measure) as of April 30, 2022 was 0.85 to 1.0, which the Company believes is lower than many of its competitors. Further, the Company believes it can fund a significant amount of its planned growth from net income generated from operations. Of the external capital that will be needed to fund growth, the Company plans to draw on its existing credit facilities, or renewals or replacements of those facilities, and participate in the securitization market, when appropriate. For a reconciliation of adjusted debt to equity ratio to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measure” included in “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Significant Expansion Opportunities. The Company historically targets smaller communities in which to locate its dealerships (i.e., populations from 20,000 to 50,000), but is also operating in larger cities such as Tulsa, Oklahoma; Lexington, Kentucky; Springfield, Missouri; Chattanooga, Tennessee and Little Rock, Arkansas. The Company believes there are numerous suitable communities of various sizes within the twelve states in which the Company currently operates and other contiguous states to satisfy anticipated dealership growth for the next several years.
Operations
 
Operating Segment. Each dealership is an operating segment with its results regularly reviewed by the Company’s chief operating decision maker in an effort to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance. Individual dealerships meet the aggregation criteria for reporting purposes under the current accounting guidance. The Company operates in the Integrated Auto Sales and Finance segment of the used car market. In this industry, the nature of the sale and the financing of the transaction, financing processes, the type of customer and the methods used to distribute the Company’s products and services, including the actual servicing of the contracts as well as the regulatory environment in which the Company operates, all have similar characteristics. Each dealership is similar in nature and only engages in the selling and financing of used vehicles. All individual dealerships have similar operating characteristics. As such, individual dealerships have been aggregated into one reportable segment.
Dealership Organization. Dealerships operate on a decentralized basis with centralized support by the corporate office in many areas. Each dealership is primarily responsible for buying and selling vehicles, making credit decisions, and servicing and collecting the installment contracts it originates. Dealerships also maintain their own records and make daily deposits. Dealership-level financial statements are prepared by the corporate office on a monthly basis. Depending on the number of active customer accounts, a dealership may have as few as three or as many as twenty-five full-time associates employed at that location. Associate positions at a large dealership may include a general manager, assistant manager(s), office manager, office clerk(s), service manager, purchasing agent, collections personnel, sales personnel, inventory associates (detailers), and on-call drivers. Dealerships are generally open Monday through Saturday from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.

Dealerships are typically located in smaller communities. As of April 30, 2022, approximately 71% of the Company’s dealerships were located in cities with populations of less than 50,000. Dealerships are located on leased or owned property between one and three acres in size. When opening a new dealership, the Company will typically use an existing structure on the property to conduct business or purchase a modular facility while business at the new location develops. Dealership facilities typically range in size from 1,500 to 5,000 square feet.
 
Purchasing.  The Company purchases vehicles primarily from wholesalers, new car dealers, individuals and auctions. Vehicle purchasing is performed by the Company’s purchasing agents, although dealership managers are authorized to purchase vehicles as needed, as well as a purchasing agent will purchase vehicles for one to three dealerships depending on the size of the dealerships. Purchasing agents report to the dealership manager, or managers, for whom they make purchases. The Company centrally monitors the quantity and quality of vehicles purchased and continuously compares the cost of vehicles purchased to outside valuation sources and holds responsible parties accountable for results, including corporate level purchases from larger wholesale vendors that can supply a large quantity of high-quality vehicles. The Company has grown its preferred vendor network for used vehicles and plans to continue to leverage its industry partnerships.
 
Generally, the Company purchases vehicles between 5 and 12 years of age with 70,000 to 150,000 miles and pays between $5,000 and $20,000 per vehicle. The Company focuses on providing basic transportation to its customers. The Company sells a variety of vehicles, that include primarily, sport utility vehicles, trucks, and sedans. The Company typically does not purchase sports cars or luxury cars. The Company’s purchasing agents or general managers inspect and test-drive almost every vehicle prior to a sale. The Company strives to purchase vehicles that require little or no repair as the Company has limited facilities to repair or recondition vehicles. The Company has formed relationships with recondition facilities to recondition vehicles, in particular repossessions and trades, in order to have access to lower cost vehicles.
 
  7 



Selling, Marketing and Advertising. Dealerships generally maintain an inventory of 20 to 90 vehicles depending on the size and maturity of the dealership and the time of the year. Inventory turns over approximately 7 to 9 times each year. Selling is done predominantly by the dealership manager, assistant manager, manager trainee or sales associate. Sales associates are paid a commission for sales that they make in addition to an hourly wage. Sales are made on an “as is” basis; however, customers are given an option to purchase a service contract which covers certain vehicle components and assemblies. For covered components and assemblies, the Company coordinates service with third-party service centers with which the Company typically has previously negotiated labor rates. The vast majority of the Company’s customers elect to purchase a service contract when purchasing a vehicle. Additionally, the Company offers its customers to whom financing is extended an accident protection plan product. This product contractually obligates the Company to cancel the remaining amount owed on a contract where the vehicle has been totaled, as defined in the plan, or the vehicle has been stolen. This product is available in most of the states in which the Company operates and the vast majority of financed customers elect to purchase this product when purchasing a vehicle in those states.
 
The Company’s objective is to offer its customers basic transportation at a fair price and treat each customer in such a manner as to earn his or her repeat business. The Company attempts to build a positive reputation in each community where it operates and generate new business from such reputation as well as from customer referrals. The Company estimates that approximately 10% to 15% of the Company’s sales result from customer referrals. For mature dealerships, a large percentage of sales are to repeat customers.
 
The Company primarily advertises using television, radio, local publications, internet and social media. In addition, the Company periodically conducts promotional sales campaigns in an effort to increase sales. The Company uses an outside marketing firm and has a director of marketing overseeing the Company’s digital marketing efforts in order to broaden and increase the Company’s usage of digital and social media channels as a part of its marketing strategy.
 
Underwriting and Finance. The Company provides financing to substantially all of its customers who purchase a vehicle at one of its dealerships. The Company only provides financing to its customers for the purchase of its vehicles, and the Company does not provide any type of financing to non-customers. The Company’s installment sales contracts as of April 30, 2022, typically include down payments ranging from 0% to 20% (average of 6.4%), terms ranging from 18 months to 54 months (average of 42.9 months), and a fixed annual interest rate of 16.5% (19.5% to 21.5% in Illinois) (weighted average of 16.5%).
 
The Company requires that payments be made on a weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly or monthly basis, scheduled to coincide with the day the customer is paid by his or her employer. Upon the customer and the Company reaching a preliminary agreement as to financing terms, the Company obtains a credit application from the customer which includes information regarding employment, residence and credit history, personal references and a detailed budget itemizing the customer’s monthly income and expenses. Certain information is then verified by Company personnel. After the verification process, the dealership manager makes the decision to accept, reject or modify (perhaps obtain a greater down payment or suggest a lower priced vehicle) the proposed transaction. In general, the dealership manager attempts to assess the stability and character of the applicant. The dealership manager who makes the credit decision is ultimately responsible for collecting the contract, and his or her compensation is directly related to the collection results of his or her dealership. The Company provides centralized support to the dealership manager in the form of a proprietary credit scoring system used for monitoring and other supervisory assistance to assist with the credit decision. Credit quality is monitored centrally by corporate office personnel on a daily, weekly and monthly basis.
 
  8 



Collections. All of the Company’s retail installment contracts are serviced by Company personnel at the dealership level. A high percentage of the Company’s customers make their payments in person at the dealership where they purchased their vehicle; however, in an effort to make paying convenient for its customers, the Company offers a variety of payment options. Customers can send their payments through the mail, set up ACH auto draft, make mobile and online payments, and make payments at certain money service centers. Each dealership closely monitors its customer accounts using the Company’s proprietary receivables and collections software that stratifies past due accounts by the number of days past due. The vice presidents of operations and the area operations managers routinely review and monitor the status of customer collections to ensure collection activities are conducted in compliance with applicable policies and procedures. In addition, the vice president of collections oversees the collections department and provides timely oversight and additional accountability on a consistent basis. The Company believes that the timely response to past due accounts is critical to its collections success.
 
The Company has established standards with respect to the percentage of accounts one and two weeks past due, 15 or more days past due and 30 or more days past due (delinquency standards), and the percentage of accounts where the vehicle was repossessed or the account was charged off that month (account loss standard).
 
The Company works very hard to keep its delinquency percentages low and not to repossess vehicles. Accounts one to three days late are contacted by telephone or text message. Notes from each contact are electronically maintained in the Company’s computer system. The Company utilizes text messaging notifications which allows customers to elect to receive payment reminders and late notices via text message.
 
The Company attempts to resolve payment delinquencies amicably prior to repossessing a vehicle. If a customer becomes severely delinquent in his or her payments, and management determines that timely collection of future payments is not probable, the Company will take steps to repossess the vehicle. Periodically, the Company enters into contract modifications with its customers to extend or modify the payment terms. The Company only enters into a contract modification or extension if it believes such action will increase the amount of monies the Company will ultimately realize on the customer’s account and will increase the likelihood of the customer being able to pay off the vehicle contract. At the time of modification, the Company expects to collect amounts due including accrued interest at the contractual interest rate for the period of delay. No other concessions are granted to customers, beyond the extension of additional time, at the time of modification. Modifications are minor and are made for pay day changes, minor vehicle repairs and other reasons. For those vehicles that are repossessed, the majority are returned or surrendered by the customer on a voluntary basis. Other repossessions are performed by Company personnel or third-party repossession agents. Depending on the condition of a repossessed vehicle, it is either resold on a retail basis through a Company dealership or sold for cash on a wholesale basis, primarily through physical or online auctions.
 
New Dealership Openings. Senior management, with the assistance of the corporate office staff, will make decisions with respect to the communities in which to locate a new dealership and the specific sites within those communities. New dealerships have historically been located in the general proximity of existing dealerships to facilitate the corporate office’s oversight of the Company’s dealerships. The Company intends to add new dealerships, subject to favorable operating performance of existing dealerships and availability of qualified managers. Recently, the Company has opened new dealerships under experienced top performing general managers and may continue to do so in order to grow and leverage the talents of these experienced managers.
 
  9 



The Company’s approach with respect to new dealership openings has been one of gradual development. The manager in charge of a new dealership is normally a recently promoted associate who was an assistant manager at a larger dealership and in most cases participated in the formal manager-in-training program. The corporate office provides significant resources and support with pre-opening and initial operations of new dealerships. Historically, new dealerships have operated with a low level of inventory and personnel. As a result of the modest staffing level, the new dealership manager performs a variety of duties (i.e., selling, collecting and administrative tasks) during the early stages of his or her dealership’s operations. As the dealership develops and the customer base grows, additional staff are hired. Some of the recent dealership openings have been in markets that support a higher volume of sales and these dealerships have opened with a higher level of inventory and staffing to accommodate the higher volumes.
 
Monthly sales levels at new dealerships are typically substantially less than sales levels at mature dealerships. Over time, new dealerships gain recognition in their communities, and a combination of customer referrals and repeat business generally facilitates sales growth. Historically, sales growth at new dealerships could exceed 10% per year for a number of years, whereas mature dealerships typically experience annual sales growth but at a lower percentage than new dealerships. Due to continual operational initiatives, the Company is able to support higher sales levels, and recently the Company has raised its volume expectation level of new locations somewhat as infrastructure improvements related to new dealership openings have improved.
 
New dealerships are generally provided with approximately $1.5 million to $2.5 million in capital from the corporate office during the first few years of operation. These funds are used principally to fund receivables growth. After this start-up period, new dealerships can typically begin generating positive cash flow, allowing for some continuing growth in receivables without additional capital from the corporate office. As these dealerships become cash flow positive, a decision is made by senior management to either increase the investment due to favorable return rates on the invested capital, or to deploy capital elsewhere. This limitation of capital to new, as well as existing, dealerships serves as an important operating discipline. Dealerships must be profitable in order to grow and typically new dealerships can be profitable within the first year of opening.
 
In addition to opening new dealerships, the Company believes that strategic acquisitions of existing dealerships can complement the Company’s business and increase its profitability. In March 2020, the Company acquired the ongoing dealership assets of Taylor Motor Company and Auto Credit of Southern Illinois (collectively, “Taylor Motors”) based in Benton, Illinois, through which the Company acquired three dealerships located in Illinois. In January 2022, the Company purchased the ongoing dealership assets of Smart Auto Johnson City, Inc. in Johnson City, Tennessee and agreed to purchase ongoing dealership assets in Knoxville, TN by the end of calendar year 2022. These dealerships are established businesses with an expectation of sales levels similar to mature dealerships. As part of its growth strategy, the Company will continue to evaluate other acquisitions and intends to consider and pursue future strategic acquisition opportunities that the Company believes will enhance our franchise and maximize the return to our shareholders.
 
Corporate Office Oversight and Management. The corporate office, based in Rogers, Arkansas, consists of regional vice presidents, area operations managers, regional inventory purchasing directors, a sales director, a vice president of collections, a vice president inventory operations, a director of audit and compliance and compliance auditors, a vice president of human resources, a director of general manager recruitment and development, associate and management development personnel, accounting and management information systems personnel, administrative personnel and senior management. The corporate office monitors and oversees dealership operations. The corporate office has access to operating and financial information and reports on each dealership on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. This information includes cash receipts and disbursements, inventory and receivables levels and statistics, receivables aging and sales and account loss data. The corporate office uses this information to compile Company-wide reports, plan dealership visits and prepare monthly financial statements.
 
  10 



Periodically, area operations managers, regional vice presidents, compliance auditors and senior management visit the Company’s dealerships to inspect, review and comment on operations. The corporate office assists in training new managers and other dealership level associates. Compliance auditors visit dealerships to ensure policies and procedures are being followed and that the Company’s assets are being safe-guarded. In addition to financial results, the corporate office uses delinquency and account loss standards and a point system to evaluate a dealership’s performance. Also, bankrupt and legal action accounts and other accounts that have been written off at dealerships are handled by the corporate office in an effort to allow dealership personnel time to focus on more current accounts.
 
The Company’s dealership managers meet monthly on an area, regional or Company-wide basis. At these meetings, corporate office personnel provide training and recognize achievements of dealership managers. Near the end of every fiscal year, the respective area operations manager, regional vice president and senior management conduct “projection” meetings with each dealership manager. At these meetings, the year’s results are reviewed and ranked relative to other dealerships, and both quantitative and qualitative goals are established for the upcoming year. The qualitative goals may focus on staff development, effective delegation, and leadership and organization skills. Quantitatively, the Company establishes unit sales goals and profit goals based on invested capital and, depending on the circumstances, may establish delinquency, account loss or expense goals.
 
The corporate office is also responsible for establishing policy, maintaining the Company’s management information systems, conducting compliance audits, orchestrating new dealership openings and setting the strategic direction for the Company.
 
Industry
 
Used Car Sales. The market for used car sales in the United States is significant. Used car retail sales typically occur through franchised new car dealerships that sell used cars or independent used car dealerships. The Company operates in the Integrated Auto Sales and Finance segment of the independent used car sales and finance market. Integrated Auto Sales and Finance dealers sell and finance used cars to individuals with limited credit histories or past credit problems. Integrated Auto Sales and Finance dealers typically offer their customers certain advantages over more traditional financing sources, such as less restrictive underwriting guidelines, flexible payment terms (including scheduling payments on a weekly or bi-weekly basis to coincide with a customer’s payday), and the ability to make payments in person, an important feature to individuals who may not have a checking account.
Used Car Financing. The used automobile financing industry is served by traditional lending sources such as banks, savings and loans, and captive finance subsidiaries of automobile manufacturers, as well as by independent finance companies and Integrated Auto Sales and Finance dealers. Many loans that flow through the more traditional sources have historically ended up packaged in the securitization markets. Despite significant opportunities, many of the traditional lending sources have not historically been consistent in providing financing to individuals with limited credit histories or past credit problems. Management believes traditional lenders have historically avoided this market because of its high credit risk and the associated collections efforts. Management believes that there was constriction in the financing sources that existed for the deep sub-prime automobile market after the financial crisis in 2008. Since the Company did not rely on securitizations, at that time, as a financing source, it was largely unaffected by the credit constrictions during the crisis and was able to continue to grow its revenue level and receivable base. Beginning in 2012, funding for the deep subprime automobile market increased significantly. Management attributed the increase to the ultra-low interest rate environment combined with the historical credit performance of the used automobile financing market during and after the recession. At this time, it is unclear what long term impact COVID-19 will have on the availability of consumer credit; however management expects the availability of consumer credit within the automotive industry to continue to remain high when compared to historical trends.  
 
  11 



Competition
 
The used automotive retail industry is fragmented and highly competitive. The Company competes principally with other independent Integrated Auto Sales and Finance dealers, as well as with (i) the used vehicle retail operations of franchised automobile dealerships, (ii) independent used vehicle dealers, and (iii) individuals who sell used vehicles in private transactions. The Company competes for both the purchase and resale of used vehicles. The increased funding to the used automobile industry and the tight supply of used vehicles in our market has led to increased competitive pressures and higher purchase and retail prices which have been the primary contributors to the Company’s decision in recent periods to allow longer term lengths and slightly lower down payments in connection with our customer financing contracts.
 
Management believes the principal competitive factors in the sale of its used vehicles include (i) the availability of financing to consumers with limited credit histories or past credit problems, (ii) the breadth and quality of vehicle selection, (iii) pricing, (iv) the convenience of a dealership’s location, (v) the option to purchase a service contract and an accident protection plan, and (vi) customer service. Management believes that its dealerships are not only competitive in each of these areas, but have some distinct advantages, specifically related to the provision of strong customer service. The Company’s local face-to-face presence combined with some centralized support through digital and phone allows it to serve customers at a higher level by forming strong personal relationships.
 
Seasonality
 
Historically, the Company’s third fiscal quarter (November through January) has been the slowest period for vehicle sales. Conversely, the Company’s first and fourth fiscal quarters (May through July and February through April) have historically been the busiest times for vehicle sales. Therefore, the Company generally realizes a higher proportion of its revenue and operating profit during the first and fourth fiscal quarters. The Company expects this pattern to continue in future years.
 
If conditions arise that impair vehicle sales during the first or fourth fiscal quarters, the adverse effect on the Company’s revenues and operating results for the year could be disproportionately large.
 
Regulation and Licensing
 
The Company is committed to a culture of compliance by promoting and supporting efforts to design, implement, manage, and maintain compliance initiatives. The Company’s operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations pertaining to the sale and financing of vehicles. Under various state laws, the Company’s dealerships must obtain a license in order to operate or relocate. These laws also regulate advertising and sales practices. The Company’s financing activities are subject to federal laws such as truth-in-lending and equal credit opportunity laws and regulations as well as state and local motor vehicle finance laws, installment finance laws, usury laws and other installment sales laws. Among other things, these laws require that the Company limit or prescribe terms of the contracts it originates, require specified disclosures to customers, restrict collections practices, limit the Company’s right to repossess and sell collateral, and prohibit discrimination against customers on the basis of certain characteristics including age, race, gender and marital status.
 
The Company’s consumer financing and collection activities are also subject to oversight by the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), which has broad regulatory powers over consumer credit products and services such as those offered by the Company. Under a CFPB rule adopted in 2015, the Company’s finance subsidiary, Colonial, is deemed a “larger participant” in the automobile financing market and is therefore subject to examination and supervision by the CFPB.
 
The states in which the Company operates impose limits on interest rates the Company can charge on its installment contracts. These limits have generally been based on either (i) a specified margin above the federal primary credit rate, (ii) the age of the vehicle, or (iii) a fixed rate.

We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations that pertain to the environment, including compliance with regulations concerning the use, handing and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes.
 
Management believes the Company is in compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations; however, the adoption of additional laws, changes in the interpretation of existing laws, or the Company’s entrance into jurisdictions with more stringent regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s used vehicle sales and finance business.
 
Human Capital Resources
 
At America’s Car-Mart, Inc., our associates are the heart of our business. Our associates are committed to making a difference for customers, their communities and each other. As of April 30, 2022, the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, employed a diverse associate base of approximately 2,100 full time associates. None of the Company’s employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and the Company believes that its relations with its employees are positive.
Diversity and Inclusion
 
The Company’s culture is one that fosters diversity, equity and inclusion. We view diversity as an important factor in reflecting the values and cultures of all our associates. Each of our dealerships is a locally operated business, and our diversity must represent the communities in which we serve. The Company is an equal opportunity employer that strives to provide an inclusive environment, including associates that represent a wide range of backgrounds, cultures, and experiences. The Company’s hiring practices are designed to find and promote candidates reflecting the various communities in which we operate. As of April 30, 2022, 50% of the Company’s associates were women and 35% of our associates were racially or ethnically diverse.
Employee Safety and Health
 
Ensuring the safety of all associates is a critical priority for the Company. Associates are expected to stay informed about safety initiatives and to report unsafe conditions to their supervisor. Suppliers are expected to ensure that employees working on behalf of Car-Mart adhere to all of the Company’s health and safety policies, requirements and regulations. The Company’s specific annual safety goals are to eliminate all preventable work-related injuries, illnesses and property damage and achieve 100% compliance with all established safety procedures. Internally, we track workplace injuries among associates, customers and other third parties at our facilities. With our comprehensive safety and education program and attention to proper procedures at our dealerships, the number of incidents is below industry standards for all retail locations. Our Risk Manager is responsible for safety education and training, and regularly reviews indicators and areas where risks and injuries can occur, helping to eliminate hazards. General Managers at each dealership are responsible for safety at their location on a daily basis, and members of the safety committee at our corporate office are trained on CPR and other emergency procedures and regularly conduct drills for events such as a fire or tornado. Lastly, since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have enhanced our cleaning procedures and implemented additional sanitizing measures, and we continue to follow recommendations from the CDC to keep our facilities clean, safe and sanitized.
 
From a health perspective, the Company believes it is important to support the physical, mental, social, environmental and financial well-being of our Car-Mart associates at work and at home. The Company is committed to doing so with key initiatives that inspire associates to strive for long-term sustainable health and wellness for themselves and their families. We seek to educate and empower associates to improve and maintain their overall health. Further, we offer resources for preventive care, such as flu shots, vaccinations and other preventative health screenings. Associates have access to retirement investment plans and legal consultants to help them save for their future needs. The Company also offers professional resources that promote associates’ health and general well-being.

Talent and Development
 
The Company is committed to building a working environment and a culture that attracts, develops and retains motivated and high-performing associates. The Company strives to provide associates with broader challenging opportunities, an environment that encourages entrepreneurial thinking and the ability to develop their career. The success of our growth strategy and the operation of an organization that supports dealerships throughout 12 states requires that we continue to seek, attract, hire and retain top talent at all levels of the Company. We offer a competitive compensation and benefits program, and an opportunity for our associates to grow personally and professionally, with an eye toward retirement and financial planning.
 
The Company provides each associate with a comprehensive compensation package that is based on the role he or she fills. Our compensation philosophy is based on performance, both individually and as a company. Many of our associates have the opportunity to earn additional compensation through commissions, performance-based salary increases and bonuses. All associates earn above minimum wage requirements under both state and federal law requirements. In addition, associates have a menu of benefit options to choose from to meet their needs.
 
The Company offers multiple programs for associate training, mentoring and advancement. All associates are required complete orientation courses in culture, safety, discrimination, sexual harassment and other topics. Associates also have access to online training programs for the development of job-specific skills and leadership qualities. For example, the Company’s Future Managers training program allows associates to learn all facets of operating a Car-Mart store from vehicle inventory and facility management to profit and loss statements, while acquiring management techniques and soft leadership skills. In addition, the Company created its “Car-Mart U” training program to build on the foundation established in the Future Managers program by providing a series of classes that prepare Assistant Managers for a General Manager or other management role by introducing new curriculum focused on leadership training, business concepts and customer experience. We believe such programs demonstrate the Company’s commitment to the long-term growth, motivation and success of our associates.
