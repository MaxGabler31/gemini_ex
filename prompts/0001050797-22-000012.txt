ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

GENERAL
Founded in 1938 in Portland, Oregon, as a small, family-owned, regional hat distributor and incorporated in Oregon in 1961, Columbia Sportswear Company has grown to become a global leader in designing, developing, marketing, and distributing outdoor, active and everyday lifestyle apparel, footwear, accessories, and equipment products. 
Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms "we," "us," "our," "the Company," and "Columbia" refer to Columbia Sportswear Company, together with its wholly owned subsidiaries and entities in which it maintained a controlling financial interest.
BRANDS AND PRODUCTS

Across our diverse portfolio of brands, our products have gained recognition for their innovation, quality and performance. Our products incorporate the cumulative design, fabrication, fit, and construction technologies that we have pioneered over several decades and continue to innovate. Our apparel, accessories and equipment products are designed to be used during a wide variety of activities, such as skiing, snowboarding, hiking, climbing, mountaineering, camping, hunting, fishing, trail running, water sports, yoga, golf, and adventure travel. Our footwear products include durable, lightweight hiking boots, trail running shoes, rugged cold weather boots for activities on snow and ice, sandals and shoes for use in water activities, and function-first fashion footwear and casual shoes for everyday use. 
SALES AND DISTRIBUTION
We sell our products in approximately 90 countries and operate in four geographic segments: United States ("U.S."), Latin America and Asia Pacific ("LAAP"), Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"), and Canada. Each geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, sourcing, marketing, and distribution of outdoor, active and everyday lifestyle apparel, footwear, accessories, and equipment products.
We sell our products through a mix of distribution channels. Our wholesale distribution channel consists of small, independently operated specialty outdoor and sporting goods stores, regional, national and international sporting goods chains, large regional, national and international department store chains, internet retailers, and international distributors where we generally do not have our own direct operations. Our direct-to-consumer ("DTC") distribution channel consists of our own network of branded and outlet retail stores, brand-specific e-commerce sites, and concession or franchise based arrangements with third-parties at branded, outlet and shop-in-shop retail

SEASONALITY AND VARIABILITY OF BUSINESS

 COLUMBIA SPORTSWEAR COMPANY | 2021 FORM 10-K | 


PRODUCT DESIGN AND INNOVATION
We are committed to designing innovative and functional products for consumers who participate in a wide range of outdoor, active and everyday lifestyle activities, enabling them to enjoy those activities longer and in greater comfort. We distinguish our products in the marketplace by placing significant value in the design and fit, including the overall appearance and image, and technical performance features of our products.
Our team of specialists both lead our internal research and development efforts and work closely with independent suppliers to conceive, develop and commercialize innovative technologies and products to provide the unique performance benefits desired by consumers. We utilize our working relationships with specialists in the fields of chemistry, biochemistry, engineering, industrial design, materials research, graphic design, and other related fields, along with consumer insights and feedback, to develop and test innovative performance products, processes, packaging, and displays. These efforts, coupled with our drive for continuous improvement, represent key factors in the ongoing success of our products.
MANUFACTURING AND SOURCING
We seek to substantially limit our invested capital and avoid the costs and risks associated with large production facilities and the associated large labor forces; therefore, we do not own, operate or manage manufacturing facilities. The majority of our products are manufactured by contract manufacturers located outside the United States. We establish and maintain long-term relationships with key manufacturing partners, but generally do not maintain formal long-term manufacturing volume commitments. The use of contract manufacturers greatly increases our production capacity, maximizes our flexibility and improves our product pricing.
We value legal, ethical and fair treatment of people involved in manufacturing our products. Independent contractors manufacturing our products are subject to our standards of manufacturing practices to facilitate decent, safe and humane working conditions, as well as promote ethical business practices. We have programs in place to monitor manufacturer practices and assess alignment against these standards.
We maintain seven manufacturing liaison offices in six Asia Pacific countries. Our personnel in these offices monitor production at our contract manufacturers' facilities to ensure our products are manufactured to our specifications. The physical location of our employees in these regional offices enhances our ability to monitor contract manufacturers for compliance with our policies, procedures and standards regarding quality, delivery, pricing, and labor practices. The design of our quality assurance process seeks to ensure that our products meet and maintain our quality standards and product reputation.
In 2021, our apparel, accessories and equipment products were manufactured in 13 countries. In 2021, manufacturers in Vietnam, Bangladesh, and Indonesia produced approximately 45%, 15% and 15%, respectively, of these products. Five of the largest contract manufacturers account for approximately 35% of our apparel, accessories and equipment production, with the largest manufacturer accounting for nearly 10%.
In 2021, our footwear products were manufactured in six countries. In 2021, manufacturers in Vietnam and China produced approximately 85% and 10%, respectively, of these products. Five of the largest contract manufacturers account for approximately 85% of our footwear production, with the largest manufacturer accounting for approximately 30%, three manufacturers accounting for approximately 15% each and one manufacturer accounting for approximately 10%. 
Raw materials for the manufacturing of our apparel, accessories, equipment, and footwear products are primarily sourced from Asia and are purchased directly by our contract manufacturers.
MARKETING
Our portfolio of brands enables us to target a wide range of consumers with differentiated products. Our marketing supports and enhances our competitive position in the marketplace, drives global alignment through seasonal initiatives, builds brand equity, raises global brand relevance and awareness, infuses our brands with excitement, and, most importantly, stimulates worldwide consumer demand for our products.
Our integrated marketing efforts deliver consistent messages about the performance benefits, features and styles of our products within each of our brands and their different target consumers. We utilize a variety of means to deliver our marketing messages, including digital marketing, social media interactions, television and print publications, experiential events, brand ambassadors, enhanced product store displays, and consumer focused public relations efforts. In addition, we reinforce our brands' marketing messages with our key wholesale 
 COLUMBIA SPORTSWEAR COMPANY | 2021 FORM 10-K | 


customers by utilizing digital platforms, television, radio, print and advertising campaigns, as well as in-store branded visual merchandising display tools and favorable product presentation. 
We operate branded e-commerce and marketing sites and maintain an active presence on a variety of global social media platforms. We authorize and encourage our international distributors to connect with consumers by operating e-commerce and marketing sites and maintaining a presence on social media platforms. Digital marketing and social media engagement increase our brands' global ability to build strong emotional connections with consumers through consistent, brand-enhancing content. Our digital media connects our consumers to brand content and products, while facilitating their direct product purchases or directing them to nearby retail locations. 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Our trademarks create a market for our products, identify our company and differentiate our products from competitors' products. We own many trademarks, including Columbia Sportswear Company®, Columbia®, SOREL®, Mountain Hard Wear®, prAna®, the Columbia diamond shaped logo, the Mountain Hardwear nut logo, the SOREL polar bear logo, and the prAna sitting pose logo, as well as many other trademarks relating to our brands, products, styles, and technologies. 
Our design and utility patents describe the technologies, processes and designs incorporated into many of our most important products. We file applications for United States and foreign patents to protect inventions, designs and enhancements that we deem to have commercial value. We have design and utility patents, which expire at various times, as well as pending patent applications in the United States and other countries.
We vigorously protect these proprietary rights against counterfeit reproductions and other infringing activities.
COMPETITION
The markets for outdoor, active and everyday lifestyle apparel, footwear, accessories, and equipment products are highly competitive and we face significant competition from numerous companies. Our competition includes large companies with significant financial, marketing and operational resources, small companies with limited resources but deep entrenchment in their local markets, and other branded competitors. We also face competition from our wholesale customers who, under their own private brand names, produce and distribute similar products to our target consumers through their own retail stores and e-commerce businesses. We identify our primary competitive factors in the markets for outdoor, active and everyday lifestyle products to be brand strength, product innovation, design, functionality, durability, and price, as well as effective marketing and delivery of product in alignment with consumer expectations.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
As a company with global operations, we are, and our products are, subject to the laws of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions, including laws and regulations concerning product safety, environmental standards, trade, information security, privacy, labor and employment, health, marketing, competition, and safety.
See Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information of risks relating to these laws, rules, and regulations.
HUMAN CAPITAL
We believe that attracting and retaining exceptional talent strengthens our enterprise and propels us as a leader in product innovation. As part of these efforts, we strive to offer a competitive compensation and benefits program, foster a community where everyone feels included and empowered to do their best work and promote employee well-being. 
At December 31, 2021, our employee workforce of approximately 8,325 employees was comprised of approximately 4,500 full-time and part-time retail employees, 925 distribution center employees and 2,900 corporate employees. From December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021, we had an overall employee turnover rate of approximately 58%, impacted by approximately 87% and 61% turnover rate in our retail and distribution employee base, respectively. Approximately 31% of our workforce was located outside of the United States at December 31, 2021.
 COLUMBIA SPORTSWEAR COMPANY | 2021 FORM 10-K | 


Compensation and Benefits
Our compensation plans aim to reward performance. We offer competitive wages and, to align the interest of our management with those of our shareholders, shares of our common stock through a stock incentive plan. Globally, we offer employees affordable, competitive and comprehensive benefit programs. In the United States, for our largest employee base, we sponsor comprehensive medical, dental, vision and health savings or flexible spending account plans. We also provide 401(k) plan matching of employee contributions, paid time off, an employee assistance plan, life insurance, and short-term and long-term disability insurance.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
At December 31, 2021, our global workforce was self-disclosed as 42% male, 55% female, less than 1% non-binary and 2% undisclosed or chose not to identify. In the United States, the self-disclosed ethnicity of our workforce, including retail and distribution employees, was 60% White, 7% Asian, 19% Hispanic or Latino, 7% Black, less than 1% American Indian or Alaskan Native, less than 1% Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, 4% two or more races and 2% undisclosed or chose not to identify.

This team focuses on supporting strategies and efforts to advance progress in the following categories: listening and learning, diversifying talent, creating and sponsoring opportunities, and being a force for good.
Employee Well-Being
We align our employee programs to the five elements of well-being: physical health, career, social and emotional health, financial, and community.
