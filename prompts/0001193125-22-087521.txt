ITEM 1. | Business
--------+---------


Dave & Buster’s Entertainment, Inc. (“D&B Entertainment”) is a leading owner and operator of high-volume entertainment and dining venues (“stores”) that operate under the name “Dave & Buster’s.” We offer our customers the opportunity to “Eat Drink Play and Watch” all in one location. We provide our customers the most social, shareable fun, with high-quality food and beverages as well as interactive entertainment options for adults and families to enjoy together. We opened the first Dave & Buster’s store in Dallas, Texas in 1982, and as of January 30, 2022 (the last day of fiscal 2021), we owned and operated 144 stores located in 40 states, Puerto Rico and one Canadian province. Unless otherwise provided in this report, references to “Dave & Buster’s,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” refer to D&B Entertainment and its wholly owned subsidiaries and any predecessor entities. 
 Our fiscal year consists of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Sunday after the Saturday closest to January 31. Each quarterly period has 13 weeks, except in a 53-week year when the fourth quarter has 14 weeks. Fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 each contained 52 weeks. We refer to our fiscal years as 2021, 2020, and 2019 throughout this report. 
 COVID-19 Pandemic 
 In March 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) outbreak was declared a global pandemic and a National Public Health Emergency. Shortly after the national emergency declaration, state and local officials began placing restrictions on businesses, some of which allowed To-Go or curbside service only while others limited capacity in the dining room or arcade (“Midway”). By March 20, 2020, all our 137 operating stores were temporarily closed. On April 30, 2020, our first store re-opened to the public, and by the end of fiscal 2020, 107 of our 140 stores were open and operating in limited capacity. These stores were operating with a combination of limited menus, reduced dining room seating, reduced game availability in the Midway reduced operating hours and other restrictions referred to as “limited operations” or “operating in limited capacity.” The Company re-opened the remaining 33 stores that had been temporarily closed by August 1, 2021, the end of the second 
 
2 

  quarter of fiscal 2021. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, our two Canadian stores temporarily closed due to the resurgence, and shortly after the end of our fiscal year, these two stores re-opened with limited operations. These developments have had a material adverse impact on the Company’s revenues, results of operations and cash flows for fiscal 2020, and during fiscal 2021, continued to have a significant impact on our business and results of operations. The ongoing effects of COVID-19 and its variants, including, but not limited to, consumer behavior, capacity restrictions, mask and vaccination mandates, wage inflation, our ability to continue to staff our stores and disruptions in the supply chain, will impact our operating results and financial position. The impact to our operations has been most notable during the periods of greatest accelerating COVID-19 case counts. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to address government regulations and the safety of our team members and customers. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business are discussed in further detail throughout this Business section, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this report. 
 Eat Drink Play and Watch - All Under One Roof 
 We have developed a distinctive brand based on our customer value proposition: “Eat Drink Play and Watch.” The interaction between dining, enjoying our full-service bar, playing games, and watching sports and other entertainment is the defining feature of the Dave & Buster’s customer experience. We believe this combination creates an experience at a single location that cannot be easily replicated elsewhere. Our stores are also designed to accommodate premium sports viewing events, private parties, business functions and other corporate-sponsored events. We believe we appeal to a diverse customer base by creating a highly customizable experience in a dynamic and fun setting. 
Eat 
 We strive to differentiate our food with quality, flavorful offerings guided by an “Inspired American Kitchen” identity. This identity is rooted in enhanced flavors and quality ingredients across a condensed number of menu items that enables our customers to explore new flavors while offering a balanced selection of familiar dishes. Our menu also simplifies execution, and along with recent kitchen enhancements allows us to deliver dishes to customers hotter and faster to drive an improved customer experience. While our menu appeals to a broad spectrum of customers, we continue to evolve it to reflect the changing tastes of our customers, with options for full meals as well as grabbing an appetizer to share with friends. We deliver high-quality offerings, including a wide variety of starters, one-of-a-kind burgers and handhelds, choice-grade steaks, pasta, and low calorie, vegetarian, and gluten friendly options. We believe our broad menu offers something for everyone and is appropriate for many different occasions. To ensure that we stay on-trend, we update our menus regularly with new food items or limited time offers. Our food revenues, which include non-alcoholic beverages, accounted for approximately 68% of our food and beverage revenues and approximately 22.7% of our total revenues during fiscal 2021. 
 Drink 
 Each of our locations also offers full bar service, including a variety of beers, hand-crafted cocktails, and premium spirits. We are focused on maintaining a streamlined beverage menu for ease of execution, while using quality ingredients including fresh juices, purees and house-made mixers. Beverage service is typically available throughout the entire store, allowing for multiple point of sale opportunities. We believe that our high margin beverage offering is complementary to each of the Eat, Play and Watch aspects of our brand. Our alcoholic beverage revenues accounted for approximately 32% of our total food and beverage revenues and approximately 10.8% of our total revenues during fiscal 2021. 
Play 
 The games in our Midway are a key aspect of the Dave & Buster’s entertainment experience, which we believe is the core differentiating feature of our brand. The Midway in each of our stores is an area where we 
 
3 

  offer a wide array of amusement and entertainment options, some of which are exclusive to Dave & Buster’s on a permanent or temporary basis. Each of our stores typically has approximately 145 redemption and simulation games as well as our proprietary virtual reality platform. Most of our games are activated by game play credits on cards or other RFID devices (collectively, “Power Cards”). A customer purchases a Power Card with game play credits or “chips” at an automated kiosk, through our mobile application, or from one of our team members. Our amusement and other revenues accounted for approximately 66.5% of our total revenues during fiscal 2021. Redemption games, which represented approximately 72% of our amusement and other revenues in fiscal 2021, offer our customers the opportunity to win tickets that are redeemable at a retail-style space in our stores that we have branded WIN! with prizes ranging from branded novelty items to high-end electronics. We believe this “opportunity to win” creates a fun and highly energized social experience that is an important aspect of the Dave & Buster’s in-store experience and cannot be easily replicated at home. Many of our non-redemption games, which include our virtual reality, video, and simulation offerings, can be played by multiple customers simultaneously and include some of the latest high-tech games that are commercially available. These games represented approximately 26% of our amusement and other revenues in fiscal 2021. Other amusements, including billiards and bowling, represented the remainder of our amusement and other revenues in fiscal 2021. 
 Watch 
 Sports-viewing is another key component of the entertainment experience at Dave & Buster’s. All our stores have multiple large screen televisions and high-quality audio systems providing customers with a venue for watching live sports and other immersive programming. For 62 of our stores, we have an enhanced Watch experience with huge cutting-edge LED “Wow Walls”, that differentiates Dave & Buster’s by delivering an elevated viewing experience and providing a platform for broader programming and marketing opportunities. Our “D&B Sports” areas offer an immersive viewing environment that provides customers with large, high- definition televisions, to watch community-focused sports programming and enjoy our full bar and food menu. We believe that we have created an attractive and comfortable environment that includes a differentiated and interactive viewing experience for customers, and our goal is to build awareness of D&B Sports as “the best place to watch sports” and the “only place to watch the games and play the games.” 
Competitive Positioning 
 The out-of-home entertainment market is highly competitive. We compete for customers’ discretionary entertainment dollars with providers of out-of-home entertainment, including localized attraction facilities such as movie theaters, sporting events, bowling alleys, sports activity centers, arcades and entertainment centers, night clubs and restaurants as well as theme parks. We also face competition from local, regional, and national establishments that offer similar entertainment experiences and restaurants that are highly competitive with respect to price, quality of service, location, ambience and type and quality of food. Some of these establishments may exist in multiple locations, and we may also face competition on a national basis in the future from other concepts that are similar to our concept. We also face competition from increasingly sophisticated home-based forms of entertainment, such as internet and video gaming and home movie streaming and delivery. 
 The key elements that drive our total customer experience and help position us from a competitive standpoint include the following: 
 Strong, distinctive brand with broad customer appeal. We believe that the multi-faceted customer experience of “Eat Drink Play and Watch” at Dave & Buster’s, supported by our extensive marketing reach has helped us create a widely recognized brand. We have a high degree of awareness of our brand as a dining and entertainment venue, and a broad customer appeal with an attractive target demographic. Our primary target is adults 21-39, who make up over 60% of our customers. We focus primarily on the adult social occasion, which accounts for approximately 58% of our visits. We also appeal to families, who make up the remaining 42% of our visits. 
 
4 

  Multi-faceted customer experience highlights our value proposition. We believe that our combination of interactive games, attractive television viewing areas, high-quality dining, and full-service beverage offerings, delivered in a highly energized atmosphere, provides a multi-faceted customer experience that cannot be easily replicated at home or elsewhere without having to visit multiple destinations. We aim to offer our customers a value proposition comparable or superior to many of the separately available dining and entertainment options. We are continuously working with game manufacturers and others to create new games and attractions that include content that is exclusively available at Dave & Buster’s on a permanent or temporary basis. Our new games in combination with new food and beverage offerings and focused attention to the customer experience help us to retain and generate customer traffic. Our value proposition is enhanced by marketing initiatives, including free game play that often features the introduction of our new games, Power Card dollar volume discounts, and Half-Price Game Play (every Wednesday, from open to close, we reduce the price of games in the Midway by one-half). We believe these initiatives encourage customers to participate more fully across our broad range of food, beverage, and entertainment offerings. 
 Vibrant, contemporary store design that integrates entertainment and dining. We continue to enhance the Dave & Buster’s brand through our store design. Our core store design provides a contemporary, engaging atmosphere for our customers with clearly differentiated spaces designed to convey the components of our customer value proposition: “Eat Drink Play and Watch.” The oversized graphics and images throughout the store are intended to communicate our brand personality by being fun, contemporary, and larger-than-life. The dining room décor includes booth and table seating and colorful artwork, often featuring local landmarks. Our WIN! area provides a retail-like environment where customers can redeem their tickets for prizes. We believe our D&B Sports area provides an attractive opportunity to market our broader platform to new and existing customers through a year-round calendar of programming and promotions tied to popular sporting events and sport-related activities. The large television screens, comfortable seating, a full menu of food and beverages and artwork often featuring images of local sports teams and sports icons help create what we believe to be an exciting environment for watching sports and other programming. 
 Strong history of growth. We have a proven track record of improving operating results and expanding the footprint of our brand. While fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021 were unusual years due to the impact of COVID-19 on both revenues and margins, from fiscal 2015 to 2019, net income increased by $92.6 million, EBITDA margins increased by approximately 130 basis points and our Adjusted EBITDA Margins (both defined in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures”) increased by approximately 120 basis points. During times of normal operations, we expect our continued focus on operating performance and leveraging of expenses will positively impact operating margins and will partially offset pressure from wage inflation and occupancy costs, although there is no guarantee that our efforts will be successful. 
 Store model generates favorable store economics and strong returns. We believe our store model offering entertainment, food, and beverage provides certain benefits in comparison to traditional restaurant concepts, which is reflected in our historically higher revenue per store, higher comparable store operating income margins, and higher comparable Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization Margins (defined in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures”). 
 Our entertainment offerings have low variable costs, generating a gross margin of 90.1% for fiscal 2021. With approximately 66.5% of our revenues from entertainment, we have less exposure than traditional restaurant concepts to food costs, which represented approximately 7% of our total revenues in fiscal 2021. Our business model generates strong cash flow that we can use to execute our growth strategy. We believe the combination of our operating income margins, our Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization Margins, our refined new store formats and the fact that our stores typically open with high volumes that drive margins in year one will help us achieve one-year and five-year cash-on-cash return targets. Historically, our average one-year and five-year cash-on-cash returns were approximately 35% and 25%, respectively. We define and calculate 
 
5 

  cash-on-cash returns for an individual store as (a) Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization, excluding pre-opening expenses, national marketing expense allocation, non-cash charges related to asset disposals, currency transactions and changes in non-cash deferred amusement revenue, divided by (b) our net development costs. Net development costs include equipment, building, leaseholds and site costs, net of tenant improvement allowances and other landlord payments, excluding pre-opening costs and capitalized interest. 
 Commitment to customer satisfaction. We aim to enhance our combination of food, beverage, and entertainment offerings through our service philosophy of providing a high quality and consistent customer experience through dedicated training and development of our team members and a corporate culture that encourages employee engagement. 
 Strategy 
 During the first half of fiscal 2021, we focused on the re-opening of our remaining stores after mandated shutdowns related to COVID-19 during fiscal 2020, focusing on implementing our strategy to set us up for the next phase of growth in the latter half of the year. Our current strategy is built on the following key components: 
 Drive our comparable store sales. We intend to differentiate our brand from other food and entertainment alternatives and drive our comparable sales, in a competitive landscape, through the following strategies: 
 

• | Offer novel food & drink to bring people together. Our current menu offerings are designed to provide a differentiated food and beverage offering based on an “Inspired American Kitchen” identity. We aim to improve overall food quality, and to offer a wide variety of items including starters and shareable items, one-of-a-kind burgers and handhelds, choice-grade steaks, pasta, and low calorie, vegetarian, and gluten friendly options. We also plan to improve efficiency by simplifying execution, allowing us to deliver dishes hotter and faster to drive an improved customer experience. For our beverage offering, we plan to update the offering based on customer research, and plan to streamline the selection to improve execution efficiency. For both food and beverage, we aim to periodically introduce new items, and run limited time offers during key periods.

• | Offer the latest entertainment to enjoy together. We believe that our Midway games are the core differentiating feature of the Dave & Buster’s brand and staying current with the latest offerings promotes trial and provides an exciting environment to enjoy games with friends and family, especially with the latest multiplayer games and challenges. We plan to continually update our games each year through development of innovative and proprietary games and the purchase of new games that will resonate with our customers and drive brand relevance due to a variety of factors, including their large scale, eye-catching appearance, virtual reality features, association with recognizable brands or the fact that they cannot be easily replicated at home. We also intend to extend our programming capabilities by offering more curated content and creating a calendar of ongoing and one-time events leveraging our investments in the best and latest audio-visual technology.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Align team and integrated experience. We intend to consistently drive service excellence, including the use of technology to improve speed of service and to give our customers more control over their in-store experience. We will also refresh our commitment to serving customers through an improved hiring, training and service model, and our team will help create fun and bring our new strategies to life.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Drive customer engagement. We will focus on delivering personalized messaging that connects with the customer to drive incremental visitation and will focus our advertising on communicating the emotional side of our brand promise. In addition, we will continue to leverage our customer relationship management program and our growing loyalty database by delivering more targeted individualized offers and creative content.

  Invest in both our existing and new stores. Beginning in fiscal 2022, the Company expects to commence a more robust investment program in targeted existing stores, including stores that have not had a major remodel in recent years. We also believe that the Dave & Buster’s brand has significant growth opportunities, as internal studies and third-party research suggests a total store potential in the United States and Canada in excess of 230 stores (including our 144 stores as of the end of fiscal 2021). In fiscal 2021, we opened five new stores, including one store that was relocated. We will maintain a moderate pace of new store openings in fiscal 2022 as our business recovers from the impact of COVID-19. Longer term, the number of openings will depend on many factors, including our ability to locate appropriate sites, negotiate acceptable purchase or lease terms, generate sufficient operating cash flows or utilize available cash to finance construction of leasehold improvements and pre-opening costs, obtain necessary local governmental permits, and recruit and train management and hourly team members. 
 Regarding our long-term strategy of new store growth, we base new site selection on an analytical evaluation of a set of drivers we believe increase the probability of successful, high-volume stores, including site visibility, accessibility and traffic volume, and trade area demographics The experience and relationships of our current development team has enabled us to focus our attention on the most relevant network of real estate brokers, which has given us access to a larger pool of qualified potential store sites. In addition, we believe the more contemporary look of our stores has been one of the key drivers in attracting new developers and building our new store pipeline. 
 We currently operate stores varying in size from 16,000 to 70,000 square feet. To optimize sales per square foot and further enhance our store economics we currently utilize three basic formats when designing new stores. The target size of our future large format stores is expected to be between 30,001 and 45,000 square feet, the target size of our future medium format stores is expected to be between 25,001 and 30,000 square feet while our small format stores are below 25,001 square feet. As of January 30, 2022, we operated 112 large format stores, 21 medium format stores and 11 small format stores. 
 We believe that the smaller store format allows us to reduce capital investment risk per store. For the smaller format, we have reduced the back-of-house space and optimized the customer facing area dedicated to video and redemption games. We believe that the smaller format maintains the dynamic customer experience that is the foundation of our brand and allows us flexibility in our site selection process. 
 Human Capital Management 
 Our team members are the heart of our Company, and they help us run the fun in our stores every day. We depend on our team members to provide great service and maintain consistently strong operations. Our ability to attract and retain an engaged and experienced team is critical to successful execution of our business strategies. While we continue to operate in a competitive labor environment, we believe our culture, policies, and labor practices contribute to strong relations with our team members. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors, “Our success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain qualified store management and operating personnel while also controlling our labor costs.”) 
 Our Culture 
 In our stores and at our store support center, we are committed to being fun creators. Our team members share a deep commitment to four culture pillars that describe the relationships our team members have with our customers and each other. We are devoted to our “You Got It” service philosophy that calls us to provide exceptional service to our customers and to each other every day. Our “Play Your Heart Out” attitude encourages intensity, hard work, and having fun. We firmly believe we are “Better Together,” and through this culture pillar we encourage inclusivity, teamwork, and good judgment. Finally, we encourage all team members to be “Game Changers” committed to innovation, embracing change, and continuous learning and growth.

  Our Team 
 At January 30, 2022, we employed 13,783 team members, consisting of 197 store support, 102 dedicated special events sales force, 1,090 store management, and 12,394 store hourly. Included in our total team members are 186 store hourly team members on leave while the Company’s two Canadian stores were temporarily closed at the end of fiscal 2021. 
 Our Better Together culture pillar binds us to a shared commitment to attract, retain, engage, and develop a team that mirrors the diversity of the customers we serve. We strive to provide inclusive fun for all, and we believe our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion promotes teamwork to achieve our common goals, helps our team members reach their highest potential at work, enables our team members to make better decisions to serve all our stakeholders, and fuels innovation. Racial minorities make up over 61% of our U.S. workforce, and we are proud of our diversity, which is summarized below: 
 

 | Male | | | Female | | Total
White | | 19.7 | % | | 18.7 | % | 38.4 | %
Hispanic | | 15.8 | % | | 13.3 | % | 29.1 | %
Black or African American | | 14.8 | % | | 13.0 | % | 27.8 | %
Asian/American Indian/Pacific Islander | | 2.3 | % | | 1.8 | % | 4.1 | %
Two or more races | | 0.4 | % | | 0.2 | % | 0.6 | %
Total | | 53.0 | % | | 47.0 | % | 100.0 | %


In fiscal 2021, we strengthened our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Among other key accomplishments, we: 
 

• | progressed on our goals to improve representation of women and team members who are black, indigenous or people of color (BIPOC) in our corporate and field leadership each by 33% before the end of FY2025;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | completed system-wide diversity, equity, and inclusion training;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | emphasized our commitment to diversity and belonging throughout the year in internal and external communications, including social media;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | achieved scores for overall engagement, diversity, inclusion, and fair treatment on our semi-annual Gallup Engagement Survey that exceeded the average for our industry and for all U.S. employers; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | were named to Forbes’ 2021 lists of America’s Best Large Employer, Best Employers for Diversity, and Best Employers for Women.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In addition to our focus on improving diversity, equity, and inclusion, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continued to demand heightened focus on health and safety for our team members and our customers throughout fiscal 2021. Health and safety have always been a top priority for our Company, but in response to the pandemic, we implemented several changes for the protection of our team members and our customers that have included, among other precautions, installing multiple sanitation stations in all stores, dedicating staff to cleaning stores, requiring face masks during surges in case counts, and requiring vaccinations where required by state or local law. Our cross-functional COVID-19 response team continues to assess the latest guidance from local, state and federal health agencies, and we update our safety protocols in real time as government mandates change in the various jurisdictions where we have operations. 
 We believe our culture, policies, and labor practices contribute to strong engagement with our team members. In particular, our leaders work to develop and maintain strong communications and relationships with our team members.

  Our Leadership Team 
 We are led by a strong senior management team averaging over 20 years of experience with national brands spanning casual dining, entertainment, and other consumer-centric industries. We believe that our management team’s prior experience, combined with its experience at Dave & Buster’s provides us with insights into our customer base and enables us to create the dynamic environment that is core to our brand. 
Our Store Teams 
 Our typical store team consists of a General Manager supported by an average of six to seven additional management positions per store. Management team members handle various departments within the store including responsibility for hourly team members. A typical store employs approximately 86 hourly team members, most of whom work part-time. This is less than our pre-COVID store average of 110 due in part to an increase in average weekly hours worked by our team members as well as a new but still-evolving labor model that leverages our technology investments and requires slightly less management and/or hourly positions than historical levels. 
 The General Manager and the management team are responsible for the day-to-day operation of the store, including the hiring, training, and development of team members, as well as financial and operational performance. There is a defined structure of development and progression of job responsibilities within the supporting management positions to ensure that an adequate succession plan exists within each store. Each store is overseen by a Regional Operations Manager, Regional Operations Director, Senior Regional Operations Director or Vice President of Operations (collectively, “Regional Management”) who directly or indirectly report to our Chief Operating Officer. We are proud of our store leadership teams’ experience and carefully monitor store management team retention rates, which for us has consistently tracked in the top quartile of the upscale casual dining industry. 
 During the COVID-19 pandemic recovery period, to comply with various federal, state and local guidelines and in response to changing customer levels, our stores operated with reduced hours of operation. Generally, our stores have returned to pre-pandemic operating hours and are open seven days a week, typically from 11:00 a.m. to midnight, with some stores open for extended hours on weekends. 
 Attracting Talent 
 We seek to hire experienced leaders and team members and offer competitive wage and benefit programs. We offer performance-based compensation programs to our store management and store support center employees. In addition to salaries, these programs (which vary by employee level) include, among other items, bonuses, stock awards, and various employee assistance programs. In addition, our salaried and hourly team members are also eligible to participate in a 401(k) plan, medical/dental/vision insurance plans and receive vacation/paid time off based on tenure. 
Developing Talent 
 We motivate and develop our team members by providing them with opportunities for increased responsibilities and advancement. Throughout the year, we provide numerous training opportunities for our team members, with a focus on continuous learning and development. With hundreds of leadership positions across our stores, we provide a pathway and training for individuals across the organization to advance from entry-level jobs into management roles. In addition, our geographic footprint often allows us to offer our store team members relocation options. 
 We strive to maintain quality and consistency in each of our stores through the careful training and supervision of our team members and the establishment of, and adherence to, high standards relating to personnel 
 
9 

  performance, food and beverage preparation, safety protocols, game playability and maintenance of our stores. We provide new team members with comprehensive orientation and one-on-one training for their positions to help ensure they meet our high standards. New team members are trained by partnering with a trainer to assure that the training and information they receive is complete and accurate. Team members are certified for their positions by passing a series of tests, including alcohol awareness and responsibility training for service team members. 
 We require our new store managers to complete an eight-week training program that includes front-of-house service, kitchen, amusements, and management responsibilities. Newly trained managers are then assigned to their home store, where they receive additional training with their General Manager. Their last two weeks of training include a comprehensive validation of new skills. We place a high priority on our continuing management development programs to ensure that qualified managers are available for our future openings. We conduct regular evaluations with each manager to discuss prior performance and future performance goals. We hold an annual General Manager conference in which our General Managers share best practices and receive an update on our business strategies. 
 When we open a new store, we provide varying levels of training to team members in each position to ensure the smooth and efficient operation of the store from the first day it opens to the public. Prior to opening a new store, our dedicated training and opening team travels to the store to deliver an intensive training program for all team members. We believe this additional investment in our new stores is important because it helps us provide our customers with a quality experience from day one. After a store has been opened and is operating smoothly, the store managers supervise the training of new team members. 
 Corporate Responsibility 
 Our core value of “Better Together” calls each of our team members to care for each other, our customers, and the communities we serve. We will not do business with organizations that employ or condone unfair labor practices anywhere in the world. We partner with suppliers who share our commitment to ethical business conduct, fair labor practices, proven environmental, health, and safety practices, and environmental sustainability. We also specifically condemn human trafficking and abuse of child labor. We understand that supporting our communities includes being good environmental stewards and striving to conduct business in a sustainable and environmentally responsible manner. 
 In addition, we strongly encourage team members to give back to the communities we serve. Although our Company invests time and resources in many charitable causes, we have two main causes we focus our efforts to support. The first is our long-standing partnership with Make-A-Wish, which we have proudly supported in a national partnership since April 2012. To date, we have given over $15.0 million to this worthy cause, and we participate in several events throughout the year both in our stores and at our store support center to raise money for Make-A-Wish. We also volunteer our time and talents. 
 In addition, we invest in helping our own team members during their times of greatest need. The D&B H.E.A.R.T. (Helping Employees at Rough Times) Fund is an independent non-profit established to create an employee assistance fund for the benefit of team members who suffer catastrophic events resulting in severe economic hardship. The D&B H.E.A.R.T. Fund is financed by contributions from our employees, customers, and business partners. 
 Advertising and Marketing 
 We use advertising and marketing to build awareness and strengthen our brand relevance. We spent approximately $32.2 million in marketing efforts in fiscal 2021, $21.1 million in fiscal 2020, and $44.8 million in fiscal 2019. During fiscal 2020, due to the temporary closures, capacity restrictions and other operating limitations imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we substantially curtailed national cable television 
 
10 

 
    media, which continues to be the largest portion of our advertising and marketing spend. In the future, we plan to shift some funding to other forms of media, including investments in social and digital video, and test new types of programmatic display and digital audio. To enhance our marketing efforts, we also conduct digital initiatives including search engine marketing and optimization, mobile campaigns, and website improvements. We also execute periodic promotions, create in-store point-of-purchase materials and execute local marketing plans to address specific objectives in individual stores or markets. We work with external advertising, digital, media and design agencies in the development and execution of these programs. 
 We have recently invested in developing and implementing new technology platforms that will allow us to digitally engage with our customers and team members and strengthen our marketing and analytics capabilities in an increasingly connected society. While our investment efforts were significantly curtailed during fiscal 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our efforts were renewed during the second half of fiscal 2021. Central to this effort is continued investment in our mobile application platform, which is used to enhance existing customer satisfaction and attract new customers by providing periodic exclusive offers and discounts and providing a convenient way to purchase Power Cards. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we launched an enhanced loyalty program. The Dave & Buster’s Rewards Program is a customer recognition program that rewards members primarily for their game chips played. Eligible members have the ability to level-up by playing game chips, and members are rewarded with free game play or food offers based on their level. We expect that as our loyalty program grows it will be an important method of maintaining customers’ connection with our brand and further drive customer satisfaction. 
 We utilize a number of other initiatives to continually improve our market effectiveness, including refining our marketing strategy to better reach both young adults and families, creating new advertising campaigns, investing in menu research and development to differentiate our food offerings from our competition and improve key product attributes (quality, consistency, value and overall customer satisfaction) and execution, developing product/promotional strategies to attract new customers and increase spending/length of stay, and reflecting a consistent brand identity that represents our positioning and commitment to quality. 
 Our special event marketing programs are managed by our sales department, which provides direction, training, and support to our special events team consisting of district sales managers and sales managers. Our special events programs are supported by targeted print and online media plans, as well as promotional incentives at appropriate times during the year. In addition, we have online booking for social parties to provide additional convenience in booking events for our customers. 
 Information Technology and Cyber Security 
 We utilize several proprietary and third-party management information systems. These systems are designed to enable our games’ functionality, improve operating efficiencies, provide us with timely access to financial and marketing data and reduce store and corporate administrative time and expense. We believe our management information systems are sufficient to support our business plans. Information systems projects are prioritized based upon strategic, financial, regulatory and other business advantage criteria. 
 Our managers have daily routines focused on driving consistent execution in food, beverage, and amusements. We utilize a customized food and beverage analysis program that determines the theoretical food and beverage costs for each store and provides additional tools and reports to help us identify opportunities, including waste management. In addition to our own routines, we leverage a third-party vendor to help ensure quality beverage operations, responsible alcohol service and loss prevention. Our workforce management platform also allows management to quickly add or reduce labor based on real-time business needs and historically assisted our managers in optimizing hourly labor based on anticipated sales volumes. Our amusement team uses a proprietary system that is supported by a mobile application that identifies amusement issues and needed repairs to help ensure our games are operational and meeting our ideal playing standard. Complementing this program is our routine preventative maintenance program, designed to prevent game failure and extend the

  functionality of our games. Consolidated reporting tools for the key drivers of our business are provided to our Regional Management to identify and troubleshoot any systemic issues. 
 During 2019, we invested in connectivity and data infrastructure to modernize and upgrade the capacity of our store systems, continued work on new, customer-facing digital experiences, such as the launch of our new mobile application that supports in-store and off premise amusement entertainment, and deployed hand-held point-of-sale devices to a limited group of stores. Our investment efforts were significantly curtailed during fiscal 2020 due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, but we renewed our investment in fiscal 2021, deploying hand-held point-of-sale devices to the remainder of our stores. 
 We accept electronic payment cards from our customers for payment in our stores. We also receive and maintain certain personal information about our customers and team members. We have systems and processes in place that focus on the protection of our customers’ credit card information and other private information we are required to protect, such as our employees’ personal information. Our existing cyber security policy includes cyber security techniques, tactics, and procedures, including continuous monitoring and detection programs, network protections, employee training and awareness and incident response preparedness. In addition, we periodically scan our environment for any vulnerability, perform penetration testing and engage third parties to assess effectiveness of our data security practices. We utilize a voluntary tool to help manage privacy risk by independently benchmarking our cyber security program to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, using an independent third party, and we share the results of our annual audit with our Audit Committee. 
 Food Preparation, Quality Control and Purchasing 
 We strive to maintain high food quality standards. To ensure our quality standards are met, we negotiate directly with independent producers of food products. We provide detailed quality and yield specifications to suppliers for our purchases. Our systems are designed to protect the safety and quality of our food supply throughout the procurement and preparation process. Within each store, the Kitchen Manager is primarily responsible for ensuring the timely and correct preparation of food products per the recipes we specify. We provide each of our stores with various tools and training to facilitate these activities. 
Foreign Operations 
 We own and operate two stores outside of the United States in the Canadian province of Ontario. These stores generated revenues of approximately $6.9 million, $2.9 million, and $18.6 million in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, representing approximately 0.5%, 0.7%, and 1.4%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. During fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, our Canadian stores were only able to operate a combined 48 and 39 weeks, respectively. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Canada’s health restrictions have consistently been more stringent than the United States. These restrictions include closure, capacity limits, vaccination mandates, and face mask requirements, among others. At January 30, 2022, less than 2.0% of our long-lived assets were located outside of the United States. 
 The foreign activities of these stores are subject to various risks of doing business in a foreign country, including currency fluctuations, changes in laws and regulations and economic and political stability. We do not believe there is any material risk associated with the Canadian operations or any dependence by the domestic business upon the Canadian operations. 
 Store-Level Quarterly Fluctuations and Seasonality 
 Our revenues are influenced by seasonal shifts in consumer spending. Typically, we have higher revenues associated with the spring and year-end holidays, which will continue to be susceptible to the impact of severe or unseasonably mild weather on customer traffic and sales during that period. Our third quarter, which encompasses the back-to-school fall season, has historically had lower revenues as compared to other quarters.

  During fiscal 2020 and the first half of fiscal 2021, results also fluctuated due to the timing and frequency of temporary closures and operating restrictions as a result of state and local guidelines imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 Suppliers 
 The principal goods used by us are redemption game prizes and food and beverage products, which are available from a number of suppliers. We currently purchase a significant amount of our amusement merchandise through a direct import program, a program in which we purchase WIN! merchandise and certain furniture directly from offshore manufacturers. We are a large buyer of traditional and amusement games and as a result believe we receive discounted pricing arrangements. Federal and state health care mandates and mandated increases in the minimum wage and other macro-economic pressures could have the repercussion of increasing expenses, as suppliers may be adversely impacted and seek to pass on higher costs to us. 
Intellectual Property 
 We have registered the trademarks Dave & Buster’s®, Power Card®, Eat & Play Combo®, Eat Drink Play®, and Eat Drink Play Watch®, and have registered or applied to register certain additional trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in various foreign countries. We consider our tradename and our logo to be important features of our operations and seek to actively monitor and protect our interest in this property in the various jurisdictions where we operate. We also have certain trade secrets, such as our recipes, processes, proprietary information and certain software programs that we protect by requiring all of our employees to sign a code of ethics, which includes an agreement to keep trade secrets confidential. 
Government Regulation 
 We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws affecting our business. For a discussion of the risks and potential impact on our business of a failure by us to comply with applicable laws and regulations, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Each of our stores is subject to permitting and licensing requirements and regulations by a number of government authorities, which may include, among others, alcoholic beverage control, health and safety, sanitation, environmental, labor and zoning. The development and construction of new stores is subject to compliance with applicable zoning, land use and environmental regulations. We must comply with laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, fair trade practices, and the preparation and sale of food, including regulations regarding product safety, nutritional content and menu labeling. We are also subject to federal, state, and local laws that govern health benefits, employment practices and working conditions, including minimum wage rates, wage and hour practices, gratuities, overtime, various family leave mandates, discrimination and harassment, immigration, workplace safety and other areas. In California, we are subject to the Private Attorneys General Act, which authorizes employees to file lawsuits to recover civil penalties on behalf of themselves, other employees, and the State of California for labor code violations. We must comply with laws relating to information security, consumer credit protection and fraud, and data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal and health information.
