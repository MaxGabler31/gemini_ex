COVID-19
 
In the first quarter of 2020, we took a number of precautionary measures designed to help minimize the risk of the spread of COVID-19 among our employees, including suspending all non-essential employee travel worldwide, temporarily closing the majority of our domestic and foreign offices, extensively and frequently disinfecting our offices that remained open, enforcing social distancing to the extent possible and requiring the majority of our employees to work remotely.  While portion of our workforce has started to return to the office, many of our employees will continue to work remotely on a more permanent basis.  
 
We continue to closely monitor the impact of the pandemic on all aspects of our business, including the impact on our customers, employees, suppliers, supply-chain, freight costs, vendors and business partners, as well as how it has impacted our liquidity and ability to comply with covenants in our credit agreement. The continuous emergence of variants of the virus increases uncertainties surrounding the impact of the virus and the global economy, in general, and our business, in particular.
 
In connection with the pandemic, some of our customers have reduced the amount of work we provide to them while other customers have requested accommodations including extensions of payment or restructuring of agreements.  However, due to pandemic-related changes, including an increased need for contact center services, our Customer Care solutions services secured new contracts as well as increased volume for existing customers.  While the pandemic has not had a material effect on our business, liquidity or ability to comply with covenants to date, given the dynamic nature of the pandemic, we may experience material impacts in the future.  We recommend that you review “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on this Form 10-K for a further discussion on COVID-19.

Restructuring Activities
 
Our management team continuously reviews and adjusts our cost structure and operating footprint, optimize our operations, and invest in improved technology.  During 2020, in an effort to right-size our operating footprint, we terminated leases in Wilkes Barre (PA) and Grand Prairie (TX) and exited our last direct mail facility in Jacksonville (FL). We completed the migration of our fulfillment business from the Grand Prairie TX) operations into a new 400,000 square foot facility in Kansas City (KS) in December 2020. In 2020, we also successfully reduced the footprint of our Customer Care business by reducing our Austin (TX) office location by approximately 50,000 square feet in addition to exiting one of our two Manila (Philippines) offices since the business is operating effectively in a work-from-home environment.  In the first quarter of 2021, we completed the migration of our Shawnee (KS) operations to Kansas City (KS).  The Shawnee (KS) facility lease expired on April 30, 2021.  The new Kansas City (KS) location is now our primary facility in the Midwest. 
 
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded restructuring charges of $6.4 million and $9.4 million respectively.  Restructuring charges in 2021 included $2.5 million of severance charges, $0.9 million in lease impairment expense and $3.0 million of facility related and other expenses. Restructuring charges in 2020 included lease impairment charges related to the exit from our direct mail facilities, severance charges, capital losses from the asset disposal associated with the deal with Summit Direct Mail Inc. (“Summit”), facility related and other expenses.  
 
We do not expect to incur any additional restructuring expenses after December 31, 2021.

Our clients include large multinational enterprises, small and medium-sized businesses and government organizations.  Our largest client (measured in revenue) generated 15.1% of total revenues in 2021. Our largest 25 clients in terms of revenue generated 72.6% of total revenue in 2021.

Most of our contracts do not require our customers to purchase a minimum amount of services from us. In general, our contracts with our customers are terminable on short notice with little or no penalty payable on termination.

Competition
 
Our competition comes from local, national, and international marketing and advertising companies, and internal client resources, against whom we compete for individual projects, entire client relationships, and marketing expenditures. Competitive factors in our industry include the quality and scope of services, technical and strategic expertise, the perceived value of the services provided, reputation, pricing and brand recognition. We also compete against social, mobile, web-based, email, print, broadcast, and other forms of advertising for marketing and advertising dollars in general.  During 2021, we continued to see an increase in the insourcing of capabilities among our clients.  
 
Seasonality
 
Our revenues tend to be higher in the fourth quarter than in other quarters during a given year. This increased revenue is a result of overall increased marketing activity prior to and during the holiday season, and is primarily derived from our retail vertical.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION  
 
As a company conducting varied business activities for clients across diverse industries around the world, we are subject to a variety of domestic and international legal and regulatory requirements that impact our business, including, for example, regulations governing consumer protection, and unfair business practices, contracts, e-commerce, intellectual property, labor, and employment (especially wage and hour laws), securities, tax, and other laws that are generally applicable to commercial activities.  We do not expect to need to make significant capital expenditures to maintain compliance with government regulations.  
 
We are also subject to, or affected by, numerous local, national, and international laws, regulations, and industry standards that regulate direct marketing activities, including those that address privacy, data security, and unsolicited marketing communications. Examples of some of these laws and regulations that may be applied to, or affect, our business or the businesses of our clients include the following:
 

• | The Federal Trade Commission’s positions regarding the processing of personal information and consumer protection consumers as expressed through its Protecting Consumer Privacy in an Era of Rapid Change, Data Brokers, Big Data and Cross-Device Tracking reports (each of which seek to address consumer privacy, data protection, and technological advancements related to the collection or use of personal information for marketing purposes).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Data protection laws in the United States (which are generally State specific) and in the European Union (“EU”), including the General Data Protection Regulation (EU Regulation 679/2016), each which imposes a number of obligations with respect to the processing of personal data, and with respect to EU Regulation 679/2016 also imposes prohibitions related to the transfer of personal information from the EU to other countries, including the U.S., that do not provide data subjects with an “adequate” level of privacy or security, and applies to all of our products in Europe.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, or Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLB”), which, among other things, regulates the use for marketing purposes of non-public personal financial information of consumers that is held by financial institutions. Although Harte Hanks is not considered a financial institution, many of our clients are subject to the GLB. The GLB also includes rules relating to the physical, administrative, and technological protection of non-public personal financial information.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which regulates the use of protected health information for marketing purposes and requires reasonable safeguards designed to prevent intentional or unintentional use or disclosure of protected health information.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”), which governs, among other things, the sharing of consumer report information, access to credit scores, and requirements for users of consumer report information.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (“FACT Act”), which amended the FCRA and requires, among other things, consumer credit report notice requirements for creditors that use consumer credit report information in connection with risk-based credit pricing actions and also prohibits a business that receives consumer information from an affiliate from using that information for marketing purposes unless the consumer is first provided a notice and an opportunity to direct the business not to use the information for such marketing purposes, subject to certain exceptions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Federal and state laws governing the use of email for marketing purposes, including the U.S. Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (“CAN-SPAM”), Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (“CASL”) and similar e-Privacy laws in Europe (in support of Directive 2002/58/EC).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Federal and state laws governing the use of telephones for unsolicited marketing purposes, including the Federal Trade Commission’s Telemarketing Sales Rule (“TSR”), the Federal Communications Commission’s Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”), various U.S. state do-not-call laws, Canada’s National Do Not Call laws and rules (“Telecommunications Act”) and similar e-Privacy laws in Europe (in support of Directive 2002/58/EC).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Federal and state laws governing the collection and use of personal data online and via mobile devices, including but not limited to the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, which seek to address consumer privacy and protection.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Federal and state laws in the U.S., Canada, and Europe specific to data security and breach notification, which include required standards for data security and generally require timely notifications to affected persons in the event of data security breaches or other unauthorized access to certain types of protected personal data.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
There are additional consumer protection, privacy, and data security regulations in locations where we or our clients do business. These laws regulate the collection, use, disclosure, and retention of personal data and may require consent from consumers and grant consumers other rights, such as the ability to access their personal data and to correct information in the possession of data controllers.  We and many of our clients also belong to trade associations that impose guidelines that regulate direct marketing activities, such as the Direct Marketing Association’s Commitment to Consumer Choice.
 
    6 

  

As a result of increasing public awareness and interest in individual privacy rights, data protection, information security, and environmental and other concerns regarding marketing communications, federal, state, and foreign governmental and industry organizations continue to consider new legislative and regulatory proposals that would impose additional restrictions on direct marketing services and products. Examples include data encryption standards, data breach notification requirements, consumer choice and consent restrictions, and increased penalties against offending parties, among others.
 
In addition, our business, in general, and the way we do business in particular, may be affected by the impact of these restrictions on our clients and their marketing activities. These additional regulations could increase compliance requirements and restrict or prevent the collection, management, aggregation, transfer, use, or dissemination of information or data that is currently legally available. Additional regulations may also restrict or prevent current practices regarding unsolicited marketing communications. For example, many states have considered implementing “do-not-mail” legislation that could impact our business and the businesses of our clients and customers. In addition, continued public interest in individual privacy rights and data security may result in the adoption of further voluntary industry guidelines that could impact our direct marketing activities and business practices.
 
We cannot predict the scope of any new legislation, regulations, or industry guidelines or how courts may interpret existing and new laws. Additionally, enforcement priorities by governmental authorities may change and impact our business either directly or through requiring our customers to alter their practices. Compliance with regulations is costly and time-consuming for us and our clients, and we may encounter difficulties, delays, or significant expenses in connection with our compliance. We may also be exposed to significant penalties, liabilities, reputational harm, and loss of business if we fail to comply with applicable regulations. There could be a material adverse impact on our business due to the enactment or enforcement of legislation or industry regulations, the issuance of judicial or governmental interpretations, enforcement priorities of governmental agencies, or a change in customs arising from public concern over consumer privacy and data security issues.
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
 
Our intellectual property assets include trademarks and service marks that identify our company and our services, know-how, software, and other technology that we develop for our internal use and for license to clients and data and intellectual property licensed from third parties, such as commercial software and data providers. We generally seek to protect our intellectual property through a combination of license agreements and trademark, service mark, copyright, patent and trade secret laws as well as through domain name registrations and enforcement procedures. We also enter into confidentiality agreements with many of our employees, vendors, and clients and seek to limit access to and distribution of intellectual property and other proprietary information. We pursue the protection of our trademarks and other intellectual property in the U.S. and internationally. Although we from time to time evaluate inventions for patentability, we do not own any patents, and patents are not core to our intellectual property strategy (other than as may be incidental to commercially available technology or software we license).
 
We have developed proprietary software including NexTOUCH and Allink®360, each of which are integral to our business. NexTOUCH is key to the success of our mail and product fulfillment business while Allink®360 ensures customers' products are delivered on-time and on-budget.
 
HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
As of December 31, 2021, Harte Hanks employed 1,937 full-time employees and 1,155 part-time employees, of which approximately 1,909 are based outside of the U.S., primarily in the Philippines. A portion of our workforce is provided to us through staffing companies. None of our workforce is represented by labor unions. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
 
Harte Hanks believes that its employees are the key to its success. Our human capital strategy focuses on:
 
COVID-19 Health Measures:  Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the health and safety of Harte Hanks’s employees has been our highest priority. Upon the onset of the pandemic, Harte Hanks immediately implemented several changes to enhance COVID-19 safety and mitigate related work environment health risks including enhancing remote working capabilities as well as other arrangements. We will continue to enhance our COVID-19 response as the pandemic unfolds by dynamically adjusting protocols currently in place to address the then current state of the pandemic.
Diversity and Inclusion:  Harte Hanks recognizes the value of diversity and inclusion within its organization and strives to ensure that its workplace reflects the diverse communities in which it operates in  order to promote collaboration, innovation, creativity and belonging. Harte Hanks is proud of its diverse workforce and cross-cultural competency and, as of December 31, 2021, employed individuals from six different countries. As of December 31, 2021, 61% of Harte Hanks’ workforce was female. Harte Hanks is committed to continue to recruit and employ qualified candidates regardless of their gender or cultural background.
 Employee Benefits: Harte Hanks believes in the importance of offering its employees competitive salaries and wages, together with comprehensive insurance options. Harte Hanks recognizes the importance of comprehensive healthcare benefits, including medical, prescription drug, vision and dental, and employees and their family members are provided with tools and resources to assist in adopting and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Harte Hanks pays the cost of basic life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance, and short-term disability for its employees. Additionally, employees may purchase supplemental life, dependent life, and long-term disability insurance.
