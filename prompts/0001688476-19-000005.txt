Item 1. Business
General description of the business
Founded in 1973, Keane Group, Inc. is one of the largest pure-play providers of integrated well completion services in the U.S., with a focus on complex, technically demanding completion solutions. We provide our services in conjunction with onshore well development, in addition to stimulation operations on existing wells, to exploration and production (“E&P”) customers with some of the highest quality and safety standards in the industry. Through organic growth and five opportunistic acquisitions between 2013 and 2018, we operate in the most active unconventional oil and natural gas basins in the U.S., including the Permian Basin, the Marcellus Shale/Utica Shale, the Eagle Ford Formation and the Bakken Formation, with approximately 1.4 million hydraulic horsepower spread across 29 hydraulic fracturing fleets, 34 wireline trucks, 24 cementing pumps and other ancillary assets. We distinguish ourselves through three key principles: (i) our partnerships with high-quality customers, (ii) our intense focus on safety and efficiency and (iii) a track record of creating value for all stakeholders.
In April 2013, we acquired the wireline technologies division of Calmena Energy Services, which provided us with a platform to commence wireline operations in the U.S. In December 2013, we acquired the assets of Ultra Tech Frac Services to establish a presence in the Permian Basin. In March 2016, we acquired the majority of the U.S. assets and assumed certain liabilities of Trican U.S. (the “Acquired Trican Operations”), resulting in the expansion of our hydraulic fracturing operations to include approximately 950,000 hydraulic horsepower, increased scale in key operating basins, an expansion in our customer base and significant cost reduction opportunities. The Trican transaction also enhanced our access to proprietary technology and engineering capabilities that have improved our ability to provide engineering solutions. In July 2017, we acquired RockPile, resulting in an increase in our pumping capacity by more than 25% and an expansion of our presence in the Permian Basin and Bakken Formation. We also acquired a high-quality customer base, expanded our service offerings and capabilities within our Other Services segment and integrated certain members of RockPile’s high caliber management team. In 2018, we acquired approximately 90,000 hydraulic horsepower from RSI. Additionally, in 2018, we completed the purchase of approximately 150,000 newbuild hydraulic horsepower, representing three additional hydraulic fracturing fleets. 
In December 2018, we completed the wind-down of Keane Completions CN Corp, which was formed when we acquired the wireline technologies division of Calmena Energy Services. 
We are organized into two reportable segments, consisting of Completion Services, including our hydraulic fracturing and wireline divisions and ancillary services; and Other Services, including our cementing division and ancillary services.

Completion Services segment
Our completion services are designed in partnership with our customers to enhance both initial production rates and estimated ultimate recovery from new and existing wells.
Hydraulic Fracturing.    Hydraulic fracturing services are performed to enhance production of oil and natural gas from formations with low permeability and restricted flow of hydrocarbons. The process of hydraulic fracturing involves pumping a highly viscous, pressurized fracturing fluid, typically a mixture of water, chemicals and proppant, into a well casing or tubing in order to fracture underground mineral formations. These fractures release trapped hydrocarbon particles and free a channel for the oil or natural gas to flow freely to the wellbore for collection. Fracturing fluid mixtures include proppant that becomes lodged in the cracks created by the hydraulic fracturing process, “propping” them open to facilitate the flow of hydrocarbons upward through the well.
Wireline Technologies.    Our wireline services involve the use of a single truck equipped with a spool of wireline that is unwound and lowered into oil and natural gas wells to convey specialized tools or equipment for well completion, well intervention, pipe recovery and reservoir evaluation purposes. We typically provide our wireline services in conjunction with our hydraulic fracturing services in “plug-and-perf” well completions to maximize efficiency for our customers. “Plug-and-perf” is a multi-stage well completion technique for cased-hole wells that consists of pumping a plug and perforating guns to a specified depth. Once the plug is set, the zone is perforated and the tools are removed from the well, a ball is pumped down to isolate the zones below the plug and the hydraulic fracturing treatment is applied. 
Other Services segment
Cementing.    Our cementing services incorporate custom engineered mixing and blending equipment to ensure precision and accuracy in providing annulus isolation and hydraulic seal, while protecting fresh water zones of our customers’ zone of interest. Our cement division has the expertise to cement shallow to complex high temperature, high pressure wells. We also offer engineering software and technical guidance for remedial cementing applications and acidizing to optimize the performance of our customers’ wells. 
Ancillary services in the Other Services segment include our idled drilling services. 
Business strategy
Our principal business objective is helping our customers maximize production, while delivering safe, high quality and efficient services. We believe that by successfully deploying this strategy, we can deliver industry leading returns and increase shareholder value. We maintain a strict focus on health, safety and environmental stewardship and cost-effective customer-centric solutions. We expect to achieve this objective through:

• | developing and expanding our relationships with existing and new customers;


• | continuing our industry leading safety performance and focus on the environment;


• | investing further in driving efficiencies, including our robust maintenance program;


• | maintaining a conservative balance sheet to preserve operational and strategic flexibility; and


• | continuing to evaluate potential consolidation opportunities that strengthen our capabilities, increase our scale and create shareholder value.

For further discussion on the business strategies we plan to continue executing in 2019, see Part II, “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Customers
Our customers primarily include major integrated and large independent oil and natural gas E&P companies. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we had three customers who individually represented more than 10% of our consolidated revenue. These three customers collectively represented 39% of our consolidated revenue and 45% of our total accounts receivable for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2017, no customer individually represented more than 10% of our consolidated revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we had three customers who individually represented more than 10% of our consolidated revenue. These three customers collectively represented 48% of our consolidated revenue and 42% of our total accounts receivable for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. 
Competition
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We provide services in various geographic regions across the U.S., and the competitive landscape varies in each. Our major competitors for hydraulic fracturing services, which make up the majority of our revenues, include C&J Energy Services, Inc., FTS International, Inc., Halliburton Company, Liberty Oilfield Services Inc., Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc., ProPetro Services, Inc., RPC, Inc., Schlumberger Limited, Superior Energy Services, Inc. and U.S. Well Services. We also compete regionally with a significant number of smaller service providers. 
We believe the principal competitive factors in the markets we serve are our multi-basin service capability and close proximity to our customers, technical expertise, equipment reliability, work force competency, efficiency, safety record, reputation, experience and prices. Additionally, projects are often awarded on a bid basis, which tends to create a highly competitive environment. While we seek to be competitive in our pricing, we believe many of our customers elect to work with us based on our customer-tailored partnership approach, our safety record, the performance and competency of our crews and the quality of our equipment and our services. We seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by delivering the highest-quality services and equipment possible, coupled with superior execution and operating efficiency in a safe working environment. 
Raw materials
We purchase a wide variety of raw materials, parts and components that are manufactured and supplied for our operations. We are not dependent on any single source of supply for those parts, supplies or materials. To date, we have generally been able to obtain the equipment, parts and supplies necessary to support our operations on a timely basis. While we believe we will be able to make satisfactory alternative arrangements in the event of any interruption in the supply of these materials and/or products by one of our suppliers, this may not always be the case. In addition, certain materials for which we do not currently have long-term supply agreements could experience shortages and significant price increases in the future.
Intellectual property
We own a number of patents and have pending certain patent applications covering various products and services. We are also licensed to utilize technology covered by patents owned by others. Furthermore, we believe the information regarding our customer and supplier relationships are valuable proprietary assets, and we have pending applications and registered trademarks for various names under which our entities conduct business or provide products or services. We do not own or license any patents, trademarks or other intellectual property that we believe to be material to the success of our business. 
6

Seasonality
Our results of operations have historically reflected seasonal tendencies, generally in the first and fourth quarters, related to the conclusion and restart of our customers’ annual capital expenditure budgets, the holidays and inclement winter weather, during which we may experience declines in our operating results. Our operations in North Dakota and Pennsylvania are particularly affected by seasonality due to inclement winter weather. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 2,833 employees, of which, approximately 79% were compensated on an hourly basis. Our employees are not covered by collective bargaining agreements, nor are they members of labor unions. While we consider our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory, disputes may arise over certain classifications of employees that are customary in the oilfield services industry. We are not aware of any other potentially adverse matters involving our employment practices on a company-wide level. 
Environmental regulation 
Our operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations relating to the oil and natural gas industry, including the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to health and safety or the protection of the environment. Numerous governmental agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), issue regulations to implement and enforce these laws, which often require costly compliance measures. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, expenditures associated with exposure to hazardous materials, remediation of contamination, property damage and personal injuries, imposition of bond requirements, as well as the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting our activities. In addition, some laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment may, in certain circumstances, impose strict liability for environmental contamination, rendering a person liable for environmental damages and clean-up costs without regard to negligence or fault on the part of that person. Strict adherence with these regulatory requirements increases our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability. However, environmental laws and regulations have been subject to frequent changes over the years, and the imposition of more stringent requirements, including those that result in any limitation, suspension or moratorium on the services we provide, whether or not short-term in nature, by federal, state, regional or local governmental authority, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA” or the “Superfund law”), and comparable state laws impose liability on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of hazardous or other state-regulated substances into the environment. These persons include the current owner or operator of the site and the owner or operator of the site at the time of the release and the parties that disposed or arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or other state-regulated substances that have been released at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to strict liability, joint and several liability, or both, for the costs of investigating and cleaning up hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, damages to natural resources and health studies without regard to fault. In addition, companies that incur a CERCLA liability frequently confront claims by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous or other regulated substances or pollutants into the environment. 
The federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, (“RCRA”) and analogous state law generally excludes oil and gas exploration and production wastes (e.g., drilling fluids, produced waters) from regulation as hazardous wastes. However, these wastes remain subject to potential regulation as solid wastes under RCRA and as hazardous waste under other state and local laws. Moreover, wastes from some of our operations (such as, but not limited to, our chemical development, blending and distribution operations, as well as some maintenance and manufacturing operations) are or may be regulated under RCRA and analogous state law under certain circumstances. Further, any exemption or regulation under RCRA does not alter treatment of the substance under CERCLA. 
7

From time to time, releases of materials or wastes have occurred at locations we own or at which we have operations. These properties and the materials or wastes released thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA, the federal Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act (the “SDWA”) and analogous state laws. Under these laws or other laws and regulations, we have been and may be required to remove or remediate these materials or wastes and make expenditures associated with personal injury or property damage. At this time, with respect to any properties where materials or wastes may have been released, it is not possible to estimate the potential costs that may arise from unknown, latent liability risks. 
There has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids, impacts on drinking water supplies, use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water, groundwater and the general environment. Companion bills entitled the Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness Chemicals Act (“FRAC Act”) were reintroduced in the House of Representatives in May 2013 and in the United States Senate in June 2013. If the FRAC Act and other similar legislation pass, the legislation could significantly alter regulatory oversight of hydraulic fracturing. Currently, unless the fracturing fluid used in the hydraulic fracturing process contains diesel fuel, hydraulic fracturing operations are exempt from permitting under the Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) program in the SDWA. The FRAC Act would remove this exemption and subject hydraulic fracturing operations to permitting requirements under the UIC program. The FRAC Act and other similar bills propose to also require persons conducting hydraulic fracturing to disclose the chemical constituents of their fracturing fluids to a regulatory agency, although they would not require the disclosure of the proprietary formulas except in cases of emergency. Currently, several states already require public disclosure of non-proprietary chemicals on FracFocus.org and other equivalent Internet sites. Disclosure of our proprietary chemical formulas to third parties or to the public, even if inadvertent, could diminish the value of those formulas and could result in competitive harm to our business. At this time, it is not clear what action, if any, the United States Congress will take on the FRAC Act or other related federal and state bills, or the ultimate impact of any such legislation. 
If the FRAC Act or similar legislation becomes law, or the Department of the Interior or another federal agency asserts jurisdiction over certain aspects of hydraulic fracturing operations, additional regulatory requirements could be established at the federal level that could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs, making it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increasing the costs of compliance and doing business for us and our customers. States in which we operate have considered and may again consider legislation that could impose additional regulations and/or restrictions on hydraulic fracturing operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the potential impact on our business of these state actions or the enactment of additional federal or state legislation or regulations affecting hydraulic fracturing.
In addition, at the direction of Congress, the EPA undertook a study of the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater and issued its report in December 2016. The EPA report states that there is scientific evidence that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking resources under some circumstances and identifies certain conditions in which the EPA believes the impact of such activities on drinking water and groundwater can be more frequent or severe. The EPA study could spur further initiatives to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or otherwise. Similarly, other federal and state studies, such as those currently being conducted by, for example, the Secretary of Energy’s Advisory Board and the New York Department of Environmental Conservation, may recommend additional requirements or restrictions on hydraulic fracturing operations. 
The federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed and continues to develop stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants from specified sources. We are or may be required to obtain federal and state permits in connection with certain operations of our manufacturing and maintenance facilities. These permits impose certain conditions and restrictions on our operations, some of which require significant expenditures for filtering or other emissions control devices at each of our manufacturing and maintenance facilities. Changes in these requirements, or in the permits we operate under, could increase our costs or limit certain activities. Additionally, the EPA’s Transition Program for Equipment Manufacturers regulations apply to certain off-road diesel engines used by us to power equipment in the field. Under these regulations, we are 
8

subject to certain requirements with respect to retrofitting or retiring certain engines, and we are limited in the number of new non-compliant off-road diesel engines we can purchase. Engines that are compliant with the current emissions standards can be costlier and can be subject to limited availability. It is possible that these regulations could limit our ability to acquire a sufficient number of diesel engines to expand our fleet and/or upgrade our existing equipment by replacing older engines as they are taken out of service. 
Exploration and production activities on federal lands may be subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”). NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of Interior, to evaluate major agency actions that have the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an environmental assessment of the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed environmental impact statement that may be made available for public review and comment. All of our activities and our customers’ current E&P activities, as well as proposed exploration and development plans, on federal lands require governmental permits that are subject to the requirements of NEPA. This process has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. 
Various state and federal statutes prohibit certain actions that adversely affect endangered or threatened species and their habitat, migratory birds, wetlands and natural resources. These statutes include the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Clean Water Act and CERCLA. Government entities or private parties may act to prevent oil and gas exploration activities or seek damages where harm to species, habitat or natural resources may result from the filling of jurisdictional streams or wetlands or the construction or release of oil, wastes, hazardous substances or other regulated materials. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the potential impact on our business of these speculative federal, state or private actions or the enactment of additional federal or state legislation or regulations with respect to these matters. 
The EPA has proposed and finalized a number of rules requiring various industry sectors to track and report, and, in some cases, control greenhouse gas emissions. The EPA’s Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule was published in October 2009. This rule requires large sources and suppliers in the U.S. to track and report greenhouse gas emissions. In June 2010, the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule became effective. For this rule to apply initially, the source must already be subject to the Clean Air Act Prevention of Significant Deterioration program or Title V permit program; we are not currently subject to either Clean Air Act program. On November 8, 2010, the EPA finalized a rule that sets forth reporting requirements for the petroleum and natural gas industry. Among other things, this final rule requires persons that hold state permits for onshore oil and gas exploration and production and that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent per year to annually report carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide combustion emissions from (i) stationary and portable equipment and (ii) flaring. Under the final rule, our customers may be required to include calculated emissions from our hydraulic fracturing equipment located on their well sites in their emission inventory. 
The trajectory of future greenhouse regulations remains unsettled. In March 2014, the White House announced its intention to consider further regulation of methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. It is unclear whether Congress will take further action on greenhouse gases, for example, to further regulate greenhouse gas emissions or alternatively to statutorily limit the EPA’s authority over greenhouse gases. Even without federal legislation or regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, states may pursue the issue either directly or indirectly. Restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed in various states could adversely affect the oil and natural gas industry and, therefore, could reduce the demand for our products and services. 
Climate change regulation may also impact our business positively by increasing demand for natural gas for use in producing electricity and as a transportation fuel. Currently, our operations are not materially adversely impacted by existing state and local climate change initiatives. At this time, we cannot accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business. 
We seek to minimize the possibility of a pollution event through equipment and job design, as well as through training employees. We also maintain a pollution risk management program in the event a pollution event occurs. This program includes an internal emergency response plan that provides specific procedures for our employees to follow in the event of a chemical release or spill. In addition, we have contracted with several third-
9

party emergency responders in our various operating areas that are available on a 24-hour basis to handle the remediation and clean-up of any chemical release or spill. We carry insurance designed to respond to fortuitous environmental pollution events. This insurance portfolio has been structured in an effort to address pollution incidents that result in bodily injury or property damage and any ensuing clean up required at our owned facilities, as a result of the mobilization and utilization of our fleets, as well as any environmental claims resulting from our operations. 
We also seek to manage environmental liability risks through provisions in our contracts with our customers that generally allocate risks relating to surface activities associated with the fracturing process, other than water disposal, to us and risks relating to “down-hole” liabilities to our customers. Our customers are responsible for the disposal of the fracturing fluid that flows back out of the well as waste water, for which they use a controlled flow-back process. We are not involved in that process or the disposal of the fluid. Our contracts generally require our customers to indemnify us against pollution and environmental damages originating below the surface of the ground or arising out of water disposal, or otherwise caused by the customer, other contractors or other third parties. In turn, we generally indemnify our customers for pollution and environmental damages originating at or above the surface caused solely by us. We seek to maintain consistent risk-allocation and indemnification provisions in our customer agreements to the extent possible. Some of our contracts, however, contain less explicit indemnification provisions, which typically provide that each party will indemnify the other against liabilities to third parties resulting from the indemnifying party’s actions, except to the extent such liability results from the indemnified party’s gross negligence, willful misconduct or intentional act. 
Safety and health regulation 
Safety is our highest priority, and we believe we are among the safest service providers in the industry. For example, we achieved a total recordable incident rate of 0.37 in 2018, which is substantially less than the industry average of 1.54 from 2013 to 2017. We believe total recordable incident rate is a reliable measure of safety performance.
We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, which is administered and enforced by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, commonly referred to as OSHA, and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with the OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances. OSHA continues to evaluate worker safety and to propose new regulations, such as but not limited to, the new rule regarding respirable silica sand. 
Although it is not possible to estimate the financial and compliance impact of proposed rules, the imposition of more stringent requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
Insurance 
Our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, including accidents, blowouts, explosions, craterings, fires, oil spills and hazardous materials spills. These conditions can cause personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, equipment, the environment and wildlife, and interruption or suspension of operations, among other adverse effects. In addition, claims for loss of oil and natural gas production and damage to formations can occur in the well services industry. If a serious accident were to occur at a location where our equipment and services are being used, it could result in our being named as a defendant to a lawsuit asserting significant claims.
Despite our efforts to maintain high safety standards, we from time to time have suffered accidents in the past, and we anticipate that we could experience accidents in the future. In addition to the property and personal 
10

losses from these accidents, the frequency and severity of these incidents affect our operating costs and insurability, as well as our relationships with customers, employees and regulatory agencies. Any significant increase in the frequency or severity of these incidents, or the general level of compensation awards, could adversely affect the cost of, or our ability to obtain, workers’ compensation and other forms of insurance, and could have other adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations.
We carry a variety of insurance coverages for our operations, and we are partially self-insured for certain claims, in amounts that we believe to be customary and reasonable. However, our insurance may not be sufficient to cover any particular loss or may not cover all losses. Historically, insurance rates have been subject to various market fluctuations that may result in less coverage, increased premium costs, or higher deductibles or self-insured retentions.
