Industry Background 
 
The EMS sector is the outsourced portion of the worldwide electronics assembly industry. EMS has experienced significant change and growth as an increasing number of companies elect to outsource some or all of their design, manufacturing, and after-market services requirements. There is currently considerable outsourcing of manufacturing by traditional OEMs and more recent market entrants in response to rapidly changing markets, technologies and accelerating product life cycles as well as the need to lower total costs and convert typical fixed costs into a variable cost model.
 
Historically, OEMs were vertically integrated manufacturers that invested significantly in manufacturing assets and facilities around the world to manufacture, service and distribute their products. EMS originated as labor intensive functions that OEMs outsourced to obtain additional capacity during periods of high demand. Early EMS providers were essentially subcontractors, providing production capacity on a transactional basis. However, with significant advances in manufacturing process technology, EMS providers developed additional capabilities and were able to improve quality and dramatically reduce OEMs’ costs. Furthermore, as the capabilities of EMS companies expanded, an increasing number of OEMs adopted and relied upon EMS outsourcing strategies. Over time, OEMs engaged EMS providers to perform a broader array of manufacturing services, including design and development activities. In recent years, EMS providers have further expanded their range of services to include advanced manufacturing, configuration, packaging and distribution and overall supply chain management. In addition, many OEMs are reducing the number of vendors from which outsourced services are purchased and are partnering with EMS suppliers that offer broader expertise. The EMS industry has also seen an increased level of diversification by many companies, primarily in the technology sector. Companies that have historically identified themselves as software providers, internet service providers, or e-commerce retailers are entering the highly competitive and rapidly evolving mass hardware markets, with products including mobile devices, home entertainment products, and wearable devices.
 
By outsourcing manufacturing, OEMs take advantage of the technology and manufacturing expertise of EMS companies and focus on their core business, while leveraging the manufacturing efficiency of and capital investment made by EMS providers. OEMs use EMS providers to enhance their competitive position by:
 

• | Lowering Product Costs. EMS providers are better able to reduce total product costs due to electronic manufacturing expertise and higher utilization of manufacturing capacity spread over a wider range of product types. Due to their scale of operations as well as their established and ongoing relationships with suppliers, EMS providers are able to achieve better pricing and better working capital management. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reducing Time to Market. Electronic products are experiencing shorter product life cycles, requiring OEMs to continually reduce the time required to bring new products to market. OEMs can significantly improve product development cycles and reduce time to market by benefiting from the expertise and infrastructure of EMS providers. This expertise includes capabilities relating to design, quick-turn prototype development and rapid ramp-up of new products to high volume production, with the critical support of worldwide supply chain management. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ability to focus on core branding and R&D initiatives. Through outsourcing, OEMs are able to focus on marketing and product development initiatives which have taken on more prominence as product life cycles have shortened, and as electronic products have become more sophisticated and complex, while at the same time many end markets have become more competitive with companies that have historically identified themselves as software providers, internet service providers, or e-commerce retailers entering the highly competitive and rapidly evolving hardware markets.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Improving Supply Chain and Inventory Management. OEMs that manufacture internally are faced with greater complexities in planning, sourcing, procurement and inventory management due to frequent design changes, short product life cycles and product demand fluctuations. OEMs can address these complexities by outsourcing to EMS providers that possess sophisticated supply chain management capabilities and can leverage significant component procurement advantages to lower product costs.

• | Accessing Advanced Manufacturing Capabilities and Process Technologies. Electronic products and electronic manufacturing technology have become increasingly sophisticated and complex, making it difficult for many OEMs to maintain the necessary technological expertise and focus required to efficiently manufacture products internally. By working closely with EMS providers, OEMs gain access to high-quality manufacturing expertise and capabilities in the areas of advanced process, interconnect and test technologies. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improving Access to Global Markets. OEMs are generally increasing their international activities in an effort to expand sales through access to foreign markets. EMS companies with worldwide capabilities are able to offer those OEMs global manufacturing solutions enabling them to meet local content requirements and to distribute products efficiently around the world at lower costs. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reducing Capital Investments. OEMs are able to reduce their capital investments in inventory, facilities and equipment by outsourcing their manufacturing to EMS providers and allocating their resources towards their core business activities. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Shift from a Fixed to Variable Cost Model. Through outsourcing, OEMs are able to shed substantial fixed costs of manufacturing and take advantage of EMS providers’ efficient facilities, resulting in a highly variable and efficient cost structure.

Kinaxis RapidResponse provides a single view of inventory across all of our facilities and inventory hub locations as well as a view of materials supply. Custom reports can be automatically emailed within our Company and to our customers on regular intervals. This inventory and supply base liabilities dashboard has proven to be a valuable tool for both our Company and our customers. Visibility solutions include intercompany processes and multi-node supply chains.
 
We have a global commodity manager in Kowloon, Hong Kong who serves to improve access to the broad base of component suppliers in the Asia region and provides us with competitive pricing. The Hong Kong office manages component sourcing to support our global operations.  During 2018, a supply chain center was opened in Phoenix, Arizona.  The Phoenix, Arizona location serves as an office for supply chain staff and other members of management.
 
Our Suppliers 
 
RapidResponse works hand-in-hand with custom electronical data interchange (“EDI”), business-to-business process that provides real-time and daily information exchange and transactions with suppliers. Through EDI programs, we have an ongoing view into supplier on-hand inventories and are able to more effectively plan factory capacities and provide customer delivery commitments.
 
With our web-based collaborative planning systems, our customers’ needs are integrated with our suppliers in a more efficient and cost-effective manner than is achievable through traditional EDI. We believe our volume of procurement enhances our ability to obtain better pricing, influence component packaging and design and obtain supply of components in constrained markets.
 
We generally order materials and components under our agreements with customers only to the extent necessary to satisfy existing customer orders or forecasts. We have implemented specific inventory management strategies with certain suppliers via vendor managed inventory programs into our supply chain programs. Fluctuations in material costs typically are passed through to customers. We may agree, upon request from our customers, to temporarily delay shipments, which causes a corresponding delay in our revenue recognition and an increase in inventory. Ultimately, however, our customers generally are responsible for all materials purchased and goods manufactured on their behalf.

To remain competitive, we believe we must continue to provide technologically advanced manufacturing services and solutions, maintain quality levels, offer flexible delivery schedules, deliver finished products and services on time and compete favorably on price. 
 
Environmental and Social Commitment
 
Our commitment is to conduct our business in such a way that protects and preserves the environment, health and safety of our employees, our customers and the communities where we live and operate. Our commitment to this responsibility includes compliance to the European Directives (“EU”): Waste Electronic and Electrical Equipment (“WEEE”), Restriction of Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”), as well as assisting customers with conflict minerals and complying with the human trafficking resolutions passed in the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010. Our commitment goes beyond merely compliance. For example, our MCA acquisition reduced its annual water consumption by more than 74 percent by investing in the implementation of a Closed Loop Process Water Recycling System at our Melbourne manufacturing facility.

Our Structure and Our History 
 
We were established in Toronto, Canada in 1985. We are a Delaware Corporation incorporated in July 1998. Our present corporate structure resulted from the July 1999 combination of predecessor companies Surface Mount Technology Centre Inc., an Ontario, Canada corporation (“Surface Mount”) and HTM Holdings Inc.,, a Delaware corporation (“HTM”). Subsequent to the combination, all of Surface Mount’s operating subsidiaries, other than SMTC Canada and Qualtron, Inc., became subsidiaries of HTM. In 2011, we expanded our operations in San Jose, California with the acquisition of ZF Array Technology, Inc. (“ZF Array”), a privately held electronics manufacturing services provider. In 2012, the Asian entities of SMTC Electronics Dongguan Company Limited and SMTC Electronics (Suzhou) Company Limited were established. Our SMTC Electronics (Suzhou) Company Limited, China facility was closed in accordance with the restructuring plan as announced on May 15, 2017. The closure of the SMTC Electronics (Suzhou) Company Limited, China facility was substantially completed by the end of 2017. In November 2018 we also acquired MCA, a privately held electronics manufacturing services provider.
Our Leadership Team
 
In May 2017 Ed Smith was appointed as our Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Smith’s EMS career spans over three decades and has served as President of AVNET Inc., a multibillion-dollar electronic components distributor, and as President and Chief Executive Officer at SMTEK International Inc., a Tier III EMS manufacture. Following Mr. Smith’s appointment, we added several experienced leaders to our senior management team with strong industry backgrounds, including previous success in building businesses together as a team.
Order Backlog 
 
Our order backlog is typically a combination of purchase orders and forecasts. Our customers typically provide purchase orders for delivery of products due within 30 to 90 days. We are also provided additional demand beyond 90 days to drive material demand and perform resources and capacity planning. We do not believe that the order backlog of expected product sales covered only by purchase orders is a meaningful measure of future sales since additional orders may be added, or orders rescheduled or cancelled.
Employees 
 
As of December 30, 2018, we had 3,291 employees of which 2,758 were full time and contract employees. In addition, we employ varying levels of temporary employees as our production demands. Given the variable nature of our project flow and the quick response time required by our customers, it is critical that we are able to quickly adjust our production levels to maximize efficiency. To achieve this, our strategy has been to employ a skilled temporary labor force, as required. We use outside contractors to qualify our temporary employees on a site-by-site basis. Our production level temporary employees are compensated by the hour. We believe we are team-oriented, dynamic and results-oriented with an emphasis on customer service and quality at all levels. We believe this environment is a critical factor for us to be able to fully utilize the intellectual capital of our employees. Because of the surplus of available talent on the market, and the strength of our total compensation packages, to date we have not experienced any issues attracting skilled employees.
 
As of December 30, 2018, our only unionized employees were at our Chihuahua Mexico facility, representing a portion of our Mexican labor force. We have never experienced a work stoppage or strike and believe we have good employee relations.
