Item 1. Business
Overview
Our mission is to power women to feel their best every day.
Since our founding in November 2009, we have built the world’s first and largest shared designer closet with over 19,000 styles by over 780 brand partners. We give customers access to our “unlimited closet” through our Subscription offering or the ability to rent a-la-carte through our reserve offering (“Reserve”). We also give our subscribers and customers the ability to buy our products through our Resale offering. Our Closet in the Cloud offers a wide assortment of items for every occasion, from evening wear and accessories to ready-to-wear, workwear, denim, casual, maternity, outerwear, blouses, knitwear, loungewear, jewelry, handbags, activewear, ski wear, home goods and kidswear. We have served over 2.5 million lifetime customers across all of our offerings and we had 159,544 total subscribers (active and paused) as of January 31, 2022. In fiscal year 2021, 84% of our total revenue was generated by subscribers, compared to 89% in fiscal year 2020.
We have created a two-sided discovery engine: customers are finding new brands they love and brand partners are finding new customers they need. For customers, we unlock freedom of self-expression through access to our “Unlimited Closet” that has a constantly rotating supply of styles for all occasions, seasons, moods and price points. This leads to deep engagement with our platform as customers discover new brands they love. Brand partners are able to tap into our large, engaged community to discover new customers and get unparalleled data insights. All of this helps them grow their businesses and encourages them to partner more closely with us over time.
When our customers use Rent the Runway, they experience the magic of accessing an “Unlimited Closet” while saving money and time and reducing clothing waste. We deliver significant financial value to customers, with our average subscriber wearing clothes worth more than 20 times what she pays for a monthly RTR subscription on an annualized basis (more than $40,000 in designer retail value in fiscal year 20211). We have become an everyday utility; our average subscriber wears Rent the Runway around 80 days per year. 
Our tremendous selection is enabled by our designer brand partnerships. We source our products directly from our brand partners that include many of the most renowned and relevant names in the fashion industry. The transformative nature of our customer value proposition means our customers are typically younger and different from other audiences our brands are exposed to. According to our June 2021 Rent the Runway Brand Survey, approximately 91% of our brand partners work with us because we introduce them to new, desirable customers and deepen awareness of their brands. Over the last 12 years, we have fostered strong relationships with and have retained nearly 100% of our brand partners. Our Closet in the Cloud connects our deeply engaged customers and our differentiated brand partners on a powerful platform built around our brand, data, logistics and technology advantages.
•Brand Partner Advantage. Our assortment contains thousands of new, current season styles that luxury competitors simultaneously carry - all available for subscription, Reserve, and Resale at much lower prices. We believe our engaged and loyal customer base paired with the data that we provide to our brand partners makes us an essential destination for many of the world’s most important brands. In addition, as of June 2021, 67% of our brand partners believe that RTR is an important part of their business’s sustainability strategy. As we have grown, our commercial relationships with our brand partners have evolved towards more capital efficient forms of rental product acquisition. 
•Data Advantage. We capture a vast amount of unique, actionable data on our customers and products. We leverage this data to create benefits for our customers (deep personalization of styles and fit), brand partners (understanding of customer demand patterns and garment lifecycle) and our business (higher subscriber lifetime value and better product return on investment).
1 We calculate designer retail values using original retail and/or comparable value prices. An original retail price is the price at which the manufacturer suggested that retailers in the marketplace, including department stores and specialty retailers, sell the item in new condition. A comparable value price is used for our Exclusive Designs and is based on an evaluation of prices for new comparable merchandise sold elsewhere in the marketplace.

•Technology and Logistics Advantage. We have developed a proprietary operating system for the sharing economy of physical goods that pairs proprietary intelligent software with differentiated infrastructure and hardware. Our expertise in vertically integrated just-in-time reverse logistics and garment science allows us to achieve multi-year monetization on our garments. We have also built a custom front-end platform that supports all of our offerings in one easy experience for the customer.
How It Works
We offer customers three ways to access our closet: monthly subscription, a-la-carte rentals or “Reserve” and purchasing through our Resale offering. 
Subscription
Pick a Plan. When customers subscribe, they select from a menu of entry plans. Each plan starts with four items, or “spots,” per shipment, and varies based on how often the subscriber wishes to receive new shipments, each a “swap.” Today, the majority of our subscribers onboard into plans that offer one, two or four shipments per month for $94, $144 or $235 per month, respectively. 
Customize. Subscribers can customize their plans to adapt to their changing lifestyles, needs and budgets by adding or removing spots for $27 or $31 per item per month and shipments for $39 - $50 per shipment per month, as they see fit.
Choose Items. After picking a plan, subscribers browse our broad assortment of items to build their first shipment.
Wear, Repeat. When subscribers place an order, we aim to deliver their order within two days of shipping from our fulfillment centers in our patented, reusable garment bags, cleaned and ready to wear.
Subscribers wear items for as long as they would like and choose to return some or all of their items with each new shipment. When subscribers select the items they want to return on our app, we allow them to immediately start building their next shipment, maximizing their time with items at home. Our subscribers typically visit our app five times per week.
Subscribers are asked to give us real-time feedback on the size, fit and quality of the items they rent. The structured data we collect through our “happiness survey” allows us to both improve her experience as well as optimize our care and therefore return on investment of the items returned. Once subscribers confirm their new shipment, they return their items to the nearest preferred shipping partner location or any Rent the Runway drop-off point in RTR’s reusable garment bag. In select markets, subscribers also have the option to schedule an at-home pick-up. To maximize convenience, all shipments arrive with a prepaid return label, allowing subscribers to easily send their rentals back.
Reserve
When customers want to rent items a-la-carte for an upcoming event, they book styles for four or eight days through our Reserve offering. After selecting pieces, they typically select a delivery date one to two days before their event. We provide a free backup size of the customer’s choosing and the option to rent a backup style at a discount. At the end of the four- or eight-day rental period, customers simply return their items in the reusable garment bag using the prepaid shipping label included with their rental. Just like our Subscription offering, we clean and care for items on behalf of our customers when they are returned.

Resale
In addition to renting, customers also shop pre-loved styles from our closet at a discount to retail price, ranging from 10-85% off of designer retail value (which we calculate using original retail and/or comparable value prices). Customers can purchase any styles they love; no subscription is required. Our subscribers have the option to purchase items they already have at home, opening a spot in their next shipment. Prices for our resale items are dynamically calculated by our pricing algorithm which takes in data on rental history, customer trends and the impact of removing an item from rental circulation to optimize for lifetime return on investment on each product.
Our Customer Value Proposition 
Through our platform, we have helped over 2.5 million lifetime customers discover the transformative power of utilizing our Closet in the Cloud across all of our offerings. Our customer base is diverse and spans age, household income distribution and U.S. geography. 
Subscribers are customers who have ongoing access to our Closet in the Cloud via our monthly Subscription offering. The portion of our customers who are subscribers accounted for 84% of our revenue in fiscal year 2021. As of January 31, 2022, we had 115,240 Active Subscribers on Rent the Runway and 159,544 total subscribers including paused subscribers. Many of our subscribers started as customers in Reserve and Resale and we continue to see activation from Reserve and Resale customers into subscribers for many years.
•Variety and Discovery. With over 19,000 styles across over 780 brands in our Closet in the Cloud, Rent the Runway gives customers the ability to always wear something new to them and inspires customers to expand their fashion tastes without risk of buyer’s remorse. 
•Value. Rent the Runway makes thousands of designer styles accessible through our Subscription offering for a flat monthly price or through our Reserve offering on a per item basis. We deliver significant financial value to customers, with our average subscriber wearing clothes worth more than 20 times what she pays for a monthly RTR subscription on an annualized basis.
•Self-Confidence. According to our April 2021 Subscriber Survey, 83% of our subscribers say RTR makes them the most confident version of themselves at work or in social settings. Because there is no commitment to keep an item rented from RTR, we fuel greater self-expression for our customers.
•Personalization and Convenience. We use our rich customer data to create a personalized storefront for customers based on their style preferences, browsing history and past rentals. Our understanding of our customer improves with each interaction, and we use our personalization algorithm to provide personalized size recommendations to each customer at the item level. By showing customers designs they will love and items that are likely to fit, we continue to drive strong loyalty and monetization. 
•Customer Experience and Community. Our customers are deeply engaged, as evidenced by the 24.5 million customer reviews submitted through January 2022. Our customers use the millions of reviews posted by our community to make smarter choices and feel good about their selections. As our community has grown, Rent the Runway has also benefited from powerful virality and word-of-mouth marketing. 81% of subscribers have shared RTR with at least five people; 32% have shared with over 20 people and 78% of our customers posted themselves wearing Rent the Runway on social media, as indicated by our April 2021 Subscriber Survey.
•Sustainability. Renting on the RTR platform results in net environmental savings across water, energy and carbon emissions when compared to purchasing new garments even when accounting for two-way shipping, cleaning and other operations.2 See “Our ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) Impact Strategy” below for additional detail. Our business model aims for customers to substitute purchases with rentals and we have been successful in doing so, as 83% of our subscribers have bought less fast fashion since using RTR and 89% buy fewer clothes than they used to prior to joining RTR, as indicated by our April 2021 Subscriber Survey.
2 According to the Life Cycle Assessment Study (the “LCA Study”) we commissioned in 2021 with Green Story and SgT, third-party consultants specializing in apparel life cycle assessments.

Our Unique Brand Partner Approach
We acquire our products through three channels: Wholesale, Share by RTR and Exclusive Designs. The portion of our products sourced through Share by RTR and Exclusive Designs - our more capital-efficient sources - has grown from approximately 26% in fiscal year 2019 to approximately 55% in fiscal year 2021. We procure virtually 100% of our products directly from or in collaboration with brand partners and our business model has been built on shared success with brands. As they deepen their relationship with us, they get access to more data and more customers. Our partnerships with brands have created a significant product and cost advantage. Because we source directly from brands, we can control our assortment and acquire styles in the volumes and sizes we want, we have access to current season items and all of our items are guaranteed authentic without the cost or infrastructure of traditional authentication platforms.
Wholesale
Wholesale includes products we acquire directly from our brand partners, typically at a discount to wholesale price based on our scale. We have observed that the original retail prices set by the brands are often at a 2.5x mark-up to the wholesale price. As we continue to expand our selection and grow the share of our assortment acquired from a designer, we benefit from greater discounts on product acquisition. Wholesale represented 45% of our product acquisition in fiscal year 2021.
Share by RTR
Through Share by RTR, we acquire items directly from brand partners on consignment, at zero to low upfront cost and revenue share with our brands each time an item is rented. Brands also pay us a logistics expense for each rental. If a piece is in greater demand, it will drive higher revenue, which could result in brands earning more on the item than if it had been sold through Wholesale. Share by RTR aligns incentives between brands and RTR and alleviates product risk as it is largely a pay-for-performance model. Share by RTR represented 33% of our product acquisition in fiscal year 2021. Increases (or decreases) in the proportion of total items acquired via Share by RTR as well as the usage of Share by RTR items will increase (or decrease) variable expenses recorded in the rental product depreciation and revenue share line item on our consolidated statement of operations. See Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Our Product Acquisition Strategy.”
Exclusive Designs
We leverage our data to create highly desirable Exclusive Designs in collaboration with select brand partners that we manufacture through third-party partners to be more durable and at approximately 50% lower cost than wholesale. We provide a data blueprint to brands and, based on this data, they design new collections for us that carry their brand name.
Our Exclusive Designs collections enable our brand partners to innovate their businesses and enter into new product lines at reduced cost to them. All of the styles are exclusive to RTR for a period of time, after which brands may monetize these exclusive designs through other channels, typically subject to a royalty fee payment to Rent the Runway, which we have not begun to earn to date. Increases (or decreases) in the proportion of total items acquired via Exclusive Designs as well as the usage of Exclusive Designs items may increase (or decrease) variable expenses recorded in the rental product depreciation and revenue share line item on our consolidated statement of operations. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Our Business Model—Our Product Acquisition Strategy.” We also have a small number of products bearing our trademarks, which are non-exclusive designs produced by third party partners at a significantly lower average cost than Wholesale to strategically fill assortment gaps, or our owned brands. Exclusive Designs accounted for 22% of our product acquisition in fiscal year 2021.

Rent the Runway Virality and Marketing Strategy
Our brand and deeply engaged consumer base have allowed us to acquire customers efficiently. Since our founding, we have spent less than 10% of total revenue on marketing, and our growth has been mostly organic. Over 80% of our customers over the last 12 years have been acquired organically. As of January 2022, we have had over three trillion earned media impressions since 2018. As we have scaled, we have seen the value of the Rent the Runway brand grow and increasingly become a significant point of differentiation with consumers and brand partners. We have an opportunity to continue to increase brand awareness and as of June 2021, our unaided brand awareness was 20% among U.S. women ages 18 - 45 with a household income of $50,000 or more.
Many of our customers share a love of the Rent the Runway experience and value proposition, which starts conversations both online and offline and leads to word of mouth adoption. Because of how customers use Rent the Runway, renting bold dynamic pieces, our clothing becomes a visual billboard and advertisement for our platform. When women wear Rent the Runway, they feel confident and often want to share their experience on social media and in their personal lives, which drives brand awareness. This means that when our customers are wearing RTR and someone compliments them or asks about what they are wearing, 96% of our customers share that it’s Rent the Runway as opposed to the designer brand name. The majority of our subscribers have posted themselves wearing RTR on their social media over five times. Renting from us is an inherently social behavior: 86% of our subscribers rent along with a friend or colleague. Our high level of continued organic growth has also been driven by the strong press coverage that we have generated.
While a majority of our new customers have historically come to Rent the Runway organically, we view paid marketing as a way to supplement our organic growth. Our paid efforts have included both middle-of-the-funnel prospecting and bottom-of-the-funnel direct response campaigns which also benefit from our top-of-the-funnel brand marketing efforts that drive awareness. To date, our primary channels for paid marketing have been focused on social media marketing, influencers and our brand ambassadors, programmatic directed spend and affiliate marketing.
Our Data Advantage
One of our significant differentiators is the vast amount of quality, actionable data that we are able to collect on our customers and our products. We leverage this data to create benefits for our customers, our brand partners and our business.
We capture more than 5,200 unique data points per subscriber per year and up to 27 unique data points per item each time it is rented across four channels including website data, post-wear data, operations data and customer data. We also identify and tag over 70 detailed attributes per style. By mapping our interactions with our products’ inherent attributes, we create a strong feedback loop which allows us to optimize the supply of products in ways we believe that would be difficult for traditional retailers to achieve or replicate. This is one of our biggest competitive advantages.
Our differentiated business model enables us to collect substantially more data than others in our space and we use this data to continuously improve the customer experience. Customers learn that providing data enhances their experience on the platform over time, which enables us to collect even more data from them. This flywheel helps propel the exponential growth of our post-wear, customer and operations data. We use our data to create what we believe are the most relevant assortments and personalized experiences for our customers, which in turn drives loyalty. As we learn more about a customer, our personalized features give us greater ability to direct her towards the items that optimize both customer lifetime value and rental product return on investment for us.

Our data advantage benefits brand partners in numerous ways: 
•Understanding the Garment Life Cycle: We help partners grow their business through the data we provide. Product longevity data often help our brands increase the life of their garments, which can support their sustainability goals. 
•Understanding Customer Demand: As our customers wear (or don’t wear) and review items, we can assess demand due to our robust attribution of products (over 70 attributes) paired with customer interaction data. This data highlights growth opportunities for brands as well as areas for improvement.
Our data also allows us to continually optimize the return on investment on products and customer lifetime value, which are dependent on the following inputs, all of which continuously improve as our business scales.
•Scientific Product Acquisition: Our data provides a comprehensive picture of our products by bringing together customer feedback, operations data and inherent product attributes. Our analytics teams utilize this data to optimize the styles we need and the quantity per style. 
•Price Optimization: Our dynamic pricing algorithm optimizes how our products are consumed across Subscription, Reserve rentals and Resale by taking into account demand signals and the expected useful life and turns of each item. We have the flexibility to optimize prices for revenue, gross margin and product return on investment based on the business needs.
•Lower Cost Product: We leverage our data to create highly desirable Exclusive Designs in collaboration with our brand partners that we manufacture to be more durable at significantly lower cost.
•Longer Product Life: Our feedback to brands helps us customize for higher longevity of our products - we understand how to clean and care for garments to maximize multi-year monetization and incremental turns per unit.
Data Science Capabilities and Algorithms
Data is the fabric of Rent the Runway and powers our technology, logistics and data science efforts across all parts of our business, from recommender systems to pricing algorithms and forecasting. Experimentation and algorithm development are deeply embedded in all parts of our business. We have created 40+ data science algorithms that help us continuously achieve better outcomes for the business including in two of our biggest levers: customer lifetime value and product monetization. As our data sets grow, our algorithms become more powerful and gain leverage.
Some of our most impactful proprietary algorithms include:
•Deep 1:1 Personalization: For each customer and item, we compute several scores that measure the affinity of item and customer through factorization machines and deep learning. We leverage these personalization scores across the business to: rank products on our subscriber personalized storefront and in search results, recommend a specific size within a style on product pages, compute general product relevance at the subscriber level and inform product acquisition, inform sizing of new apparel designs with our brand partners and more.     
•Retention Predictive Model: We leverage a retention predictive model to understand the relative importance of more than 200 drivers of loyalty and long-term value, at the single customer level to understand which interventions have the highest probability of improving customer retention. We regularly leverage this data to experiment with different approaches to retain customers based on this model in a targeted and personalized way.
•Computer Vision for Products: For each style in our assortment, we generate over 2,000 visual style embeddings using deep learning that capture color, pattern shape, sleeve length, etc. We leverage this data as a feature in our recommender systems, to cluster styles to inform product acquisition and provide product attributes in our product catalog amongst other uses.
Our Technology and Logistics Advantage
We have built a cohesive platform that pairs proprietary and third-party intelligent software with differentiated infrastructure and hardware all tailored to the sharing economy of physical goods. Our proprietary software leverages our vast and unique dataset to optimize key outcomes for RTR.
Table of Contents

Proprietary Software and Systems
Because our product offering is highly innovative, we have purpose-built a technology stack to support three key areas of our business:
•2-Way e-commerce
•Rental Reverse Logistics
•Merchandising & Products Control
2-Way e-commerce
We have a 2-way relationship with our customers — in that nearly every item is returned and the customer provides feedback. We have built a custom frontend platform that supports Subscription, Reserve and Resale in one easy experience for the customer. This allows us to optimize the product offering for the customer based on her needs.
Rental Reverse Logistics
We designed our patented technology to support the processes in our fulfillment centers and ensure that we can process orders efficiently and extend the useful life of our products.
•Garment Science:
◦Cleaning Intelligence: We have over a decade of data and expertise in optimizing the life of a garment by leveraging different cleaning and care methods. 
◦Cleaning Automation: Automation supports dynamic sorting of items into as many as 26 different cleaning programs.
◦Garment Care and Restoration: All units undergo one or more quality audits before being available to rent for the next customer. 
•Intelligent Fulfillment Network: Our unified booking engine, the “brain” of our distribution capabilities, dynamically manages decisions such as which fulfillment center to ship a unit from or which transportation type to select to reduce cost. We are therefore able to maintain uptime throughout the year, such as during snowstorms or power outages by moving demand to another facility.
•Optimized Storage: Garments and accessories are stored in multi-story pick modules that utilize both on-hanger and flat pack storage solutions. All items are stored randomly, maximizing the utilization of cubic storage space. Random storage allows for efficient putaway of garments and dynamically created pick paths that save labor cost.
•RFID: We tag each unit and all reusable garment bags with RFID tags, which increases throughput, reduces cost, improves inventory control and enables new forms of automation.
•Fulfillment Efficiency: We have automated various parts of the fulfillment process including picking, order consolidation and packing. Our fulfillment engine dynamically prioritizes customer orders based on promised delivery date, transportation departure schedules and available capacity.
•Transportation Innovation: Convenient places to return rentals are an important part of our customer experience. We have invested in an inbound network that allows our customers to return their items via national returns logistics providers and Rent the Runway-specific return methods, such as physical drop-off points, at-home pickup, and RTR drop-off boxes in retail stores or corporate offices.
Merchandising and Product Control
Our proprietary product catalog system is the backbone of our inventory management. A flexible taxonomy supports myriad types of products which goes well beyond women’s fashion, and allows us to ingest and manage items at the SKU level, functionality that does not typically exist in off-the-shelf inventory management systems. This system uses a combination of manual and dynamic image algorithm driven attribution to assign product attributes per style, making the ingestion of new styles into the Rent the Runway catalog fast and easy without sacrificing valuable data collection. The catalog serves as the starting point for products at RTR, and drives many areas of the Rent the Runway website and operation including quality control, search, navigation, and filtering.
Table of Contents

While we have built the majority of our circular platform, we strategically leverage third-party software for commodity functionality where our problems are not unique. These include pieces of the customer experience, customer service tools and enterprise resource planning capabilities.
Logistics Infrastructure
Within our warehouses, we have integrated best-in-class garment care equipment, internally and externally developed software and proprietary cleaning programs to deliver high-end garment processing at massive scale. We have also built large-scale, innovative automation and other processes for garment storage, picking, shipping, receiving and restoration of garments to excellent condition. These processes result in labor and other cost savings, while increasing our total shipment capacity and increasing the total lifetime of products, our biggest asset.
•Strategic Distribution: We have two fulfillment centers, in Arlington, Texas and Secaucus, New Jersey totaling 540,000 square feet. We have the capacity to store more than two million garments and accessories on multiple floors across our fulfillment centers. We aim to deliver industry leading fulfillment promises with a goal of delivering orders within two business days in most markets. 
•Garment Care Hardware: Our facilities are equipped with a curated set of over 430 pieces of digitally integrated garment care hardware including wet cleaning, dry cleaning and spray cleaning machines; dryers, steam tunnels, pressers, spotting boards, auto-baggers and commercial sewing machines.
•Processing: Garments flow through the facility on both rail and belt-driven conveyance guided by RFID tags linked to a massive array of cleaning instructions set by our proprietary operating system. A variety of item types are sorted based on cleaning, storage and repair methods. After discrete processing, they fall back into continuous flow and random storage, which drives labor efficiency and maximizes use of physical space.
•Proven Scalability: Our infrastructure is highly scalable and we expect our weekly processing capacity to increase over time. We believe that the process improvements we have made enable us to expand our capacity to handle over 4x our active subscriber count at the end of fiscal year 2021 in our two current facilities with minimal investment.
•Transportation Management: We partner with a wide variety of national, regional and local last mile service providers in order to close the loop between our fulfillment centers and our customers. Our transportation management system allows us to rate shop across these providers and opt into the best shipping method based upon cost and capacity.
Our ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) Impact Strategy
Our mission has remained the same since our founding: powering women to feel their best every day. We believe our platform is powering a new frontier for fashion, one in which women buy less and wear more, disrupting a centuries old industry and contributing to a more sustainable future.
We believe that shared access to fashion has the power to curb the negative environmental and social impacts that stem from excess related to the fashion industry. Driving positive impact is core to our business model: buying less and wearing more. As such, we are focused on expanding and deepening our positive impact, both from within our business as well as through engagement with a wider ecosystem of partners who play critical roles in driving change.
We believe our Impact Strategy is a holistic approach to tackling pressing environmental and social issues, while advancing and complementing our business strategy. We have specific and measurable short-term goals to tackle pressing environmental and social issues that we believe we – as a rental subscription model – are uniquely equipped to address.
We plan to report against the following goals annually, starting with our Form 10-K for fiscal year 2022.

Ambition 1: Harness the power of our business model to set the standard for sustainable fashion.
Priority 1: Reduce carbon emissions from our business so that we operate with net zero emissions by 2040
•Displace the need for new production of 500,000 garments by fiscal year end 2026.
•Power our owned and operated facilities (stores, offices, and warehouses) with 100% renewable electricity by fiscal year end 2026.
•Quantify our supply chain emissions (i.e. Scope 3 baseline) by fiscal year end 2024.

Priority 2: Minimize waste from our business
•Divert 90% of waste from our warehouse operations from landfill by fiscal year end 2026.
•Eliminate unnecessary single use plastic packaging to customers and only utilize reusable, compostable or 100% recycled content for necessary plastic packaging to customers by fiscal year end 2023.
Ambition 2: Create a culture and cultivate a community where all people are inspired, empowered and thrive.
Priority 1: Ensure our workforce remains diverse and for leadership to reflect the population of individual contributors
•Maintain on average 40% representation of racial and ethnic minorities for the US corporate workforce through fiscal year end 2026.
•Maintain on average 50% representation of individuals identifying as women and non-binary in the US workforce through fiscal year end 2026.

Priority 2: Use our platform to support and amplify diversity in fashion
•$10 million cumulative spend with Black designers between fiscal year 2022 and fiscal year end 2026.
•Ensure at least 40% representation of racial and ethnic minorities in our marketing materials and imagery by fiscal year end 2026.
Our Impact Strategy is not the start of our ESG efforts; we believe that we have a strong track record of programs and initiatives that have yielded notable accomplishments, including: 
Environmental
•In 2021, we commissioned a Life Cycle Assessment to understand the environmental impact of our platform, which confirmed that renting from RTR results in net environmental savings compared to purchasing new clothing. We estimate, on a weighted average basis per rental garment, a net:
◦24% reduction in water usage,
◦6% reduction in kWh of energy usage, and 
◦3% reduction in pounds of CO2 emissions.
 American Indian or Alaskan Native, Asian, Black or African American, Hispanic/Latino, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, Middle Eastern or North African, or two or more races. While we recognize that these racial and ethnic categories do not reflect the complexities of an individual's identity nor do they acknowledge the systemic and historical exclusion of these communities, we use these categories for reporting as required by the U.S. Equal Opportunity Commission.
 Percentage of savings are based on (a) the calculation of individual environmental impact of each category as presented in the LCA Study, weighted by (b) the percentage of estimated total wears for each of the 12 categories, as measured from 2010 through 2021.

The Nominating and ESG Committee of the Board of Directors oversees our ESG strategy and progress and receives regular updates from management. Our President and Chief Operating Officer directs the development and implementation of our sustainability strategy and initiatives and is supported by our Senior Director of Sustainability, who manages the program. 
Seasonality 
Historically, our business has been subject to seasonal fluctuation. We typically realize a higher portion of revenue from our Reserve rentals during our third and fourth fiscal quarter as a result of increased wedding and holiday events. However, in 2020 and 2021 we saw fewer large-scale holiday and special events due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For Subscription, we typically acquire the highest number of subscribers in March through May and September through November, as these are the times customers naturally think about changing over their wardrobes. We generally see a higher rate of subscribers pause in the summer, and in mid-December through the end of January.
We also experience seasonality in the timing of expenses and capital outlays. Transportation expense, and therefore fulfillment cost, is typically highest in the fiscal fourth quarter, given higher service levels and competition during holidays. Our most significant product capital expenditures typically occur in the first fiscal quarter and the third fiscal quarter, when we acquire product for the upcoming fall and spring seasons, though impact on cash is dependent on timing of receipt of product.
5 Displacement by category was calculated by the total amount of wears of RTR products (or “Rental Wears”), then estimating how many garments otherwise would have been bought and worn in the traditional manner (which is not a rental model, known here as “Linear Wears”) had the RTR Rental Wears not taken place. Specifically, this displacement is calculated by (Rental Wears - Linear Wears) / Linear Wears. The displacement per category was then multiplied by the estimated number of units across all product categories from 2010 to 2021. Environmental savings are based on results of the LCA Study and specifically the net upstream production impact across 12 product categories assessed in the LCA Study: blouses, sweaters, skirts, jeans, pants, jumpsuits, daytime dresses, maxi dresses, gowns, cocktail dresses, jackets and coats. These categories represented approximately 85% of our 2019 product assortment. Examples of categories not included in our calculations include accessories and home goods. These savings calculations reflect the difference between the rental model and the full environmental cost of purchasing under the linear model, while the savings referenced below under “Environmental Savings”, reflect the difference in environmental savings between purchasing under a rental model as opposed to a linear model.

Competition
The fashion industry is highly fragmented and competitive. Our competitors include other fashion rental companies and also a range of traditional and online retail and resale fashion companies. Our ability to remain competitive depends on the continued shift from an ownership to an access model. While other competitors may change their business models and endeavor to expand into the rental and resale space, online fashion rental and resale presents unique operational and technical challenges.
We compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition, customer and brand partner experience, product mix and quality, quality of our e-commerce experiences and services and price. Additionally, we experience competition for consumer discretionary spending from other product and experiential categories. We believe we are able to compete effectively because there are numerous trends in our favor that support the continued growth and success of online fashion rental. For example, key trends include consumers prioritizing access over ownership, consumers increasingly seeking variety and newness, growth in online shopping, an increasingly female workforce, and consumers valuing sustainability as it relates to fashion choices. See the section of Part I, Item 1A titled “Risk Factors — Risks Relating To Our Business and Industry — The global fashion industry is highly competitive and rapidly changing, and we may not be able to compete effectively.”
Government Regulation
We are subject to a wide variety of complex laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate. The laws and regulations govern many issues related to our business practices, including those regarding consumer protection, worker classification, wage and hour, sick pay and leaves of absence, anti-discrimination and harassment, whistleblower protections, background checks, privacy, data security, intellectual property, health and safety, environmental, competition, fees and payments, pricing, product liability and disclosures, property damage, communications, employee benefits, taxation, unionization and collective bargaining, contracts, arbitration agreements, class action waivers, terms of service, and accessibility of our mobile app or website.
These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, superseded, or amended in a manner that could harm our business. These changes may occur immediately or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state and local administrative agencies. As we expand our business into new markets or introduce new features or offerings into existing markets, regulatory bodies or courts may claim that we are subject to additional requirements, or that we are prohibited from conducting business in certain jurisdictions.
Additionally, because we receive, use, store, transmit, and disclose personal data relating to customers on our platform, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations in the United States and other countries where we do business, as well as industry standards, relating to privacy, data security and data protection, direct marketing, and online advertising. Such laws, regulations, and industry standards include, but are not limited to, Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 and all regulations promulgated thereunder, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography And Marketing Act of 2003, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, the California Online Privacy Protection Act, and the Payment Card Industry (“PCI”) Data Security Standard.

Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property is an important component of our business. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and other legal and contractual rights, and policies and procedures, to establish and protect our proprietary rights.
Table of Contents

As of January 31, 2022, we had five issued patents in the United States that expire between 2031 and 2038, no allowed patent applications in the United States, and one patent application (including active PCT applications) pending in the United States and globally. While we believe our patents and patent applications in the aggregate enhance our competitive position, no single patent or patent application is material to us as a whole.
We register our brand names and product names, taglines and logos in the United States to the extent we determine appropriate and cost-effective. As of January 31, 2022, we had a total of 26 registered trademarks in the United States and 49 registered trademarks in non-U.S. jurisdictions. As of January 31, 2022, we had also registered a total of 11 copyrights. We also register domain names for certain websites that we use in our business, such as www.renttherunway.com, as well as similar variations to protect our brands and marks from cybersquatters.
We control access to and use of our proprietary technology and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, and partners. It is our practice to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements (or similar agreements) with our employees, consultants, and contractors involved in the development of intellectual property on our behalf. We also enter into confidentiality agreements with other third parties in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our confidential information and proprietary information. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in our terms of service. We intend to pursue additional actions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
As of January 31, 2022, we had a total of 958 full-time employees and 138 part-time employees in the United States and Ireland. As of January 31, 2022, our technology team consisted of 206 employees, across engineering, data analytics, IT, product, software quality assurance, user experience and design, including a team of 55 in Galway, Ireland, primarily in engineering and data analytics. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements and we have not experienced any work stoppages.
