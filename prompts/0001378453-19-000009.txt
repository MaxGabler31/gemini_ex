Item 1. Business
Business Overview
TravelCenters of America LLC, which we refer to as the Company or we, us and our, is a Delaware limited liability company. As of December 31, 2018, we operated or franchised 301 travel centers and standalone restaurants. Our customers include trucking fleets and their drivers, independent truck drivers, highway and local motorists and casual diners. We also collect rents, royalties and other fees from our tenants and franchisees. 
As of December 31, 2018, our business included 258 travel centers in 43 states in the United States, primarily along the U.S. interstate highway system, and the province of Ontario, Canada, operated primarily under the "TravelCenters of America," "TA," "TA Express," "Petro Stopping Centers" and "Petro" brand names. Of our 258 travel centers at December 31, 2018, we owned 32, we leased 201, we operated two for a joint venture in which we own a noncontrolling interest and 23 were owned or leased from others by our franchisees. We operated 233 of our travel centers and franchisees operated 25 travel centers, including two we leased to franchisees. Our travel centers offer a broad range of products and services, including diesel fuel and gasoline, as well as nonfuel products and services such as truck repair and maintenance services, full service restaurants, quick service restaurants, or QSRs, and various customer amenities. 
As of December 31, 2018, our business included 43 standalone restaurants in 14 states in the United States operated primarily under the "Quaker Steak & Lube," or QSL, brand name. Of our 43 standalone restaurants at December 31, 2018, we operated 16 restaurants (seven we owned, eight we leased and one we operated for a joint venture in which we own a noncontrolling interest) and 27 were owned or leased from others and operated by our franchisees. 
We manage our business as one segment. We make specific disclosures concerning fuel and nonfuel products and services because it facilitates our discussion of trends and operational initiatives within our business and industry. We have a single travel center located in a foreign country, Canada, that we do not consider material to our operations. 
As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 13,861 people on a full time basis and 6,884 people on a part time basis at our travel centers and standalone restaurants and we employed an additional 974 people in field management, corporate and other roles to support our locations. Thirty-six of our employees at two travel centers are represented by unions.
Recent Significant Transactions
Sale of Convenience Stores Business
On December 5, 2018, we sold 225 convenience stores, one standalone restaurant and certain related assets, or the convenience stores business, for an aggregate sale price of $330.6 million. We received net proceeds of $319.9 million, after transaction related costs of $9.7 million, from this sale. In connection with the sale of our convenience stores business, we recognized a loss on disposal of $79.6 million and a goodwill impairment charge of $17.8 million. 
Lease Amendments and Travel Center Purchases
In January 2019, we acquired from HPT 20 travel centers we previously leased from HPT for $308.2 million and amended our existing leases with HPT such that:

• | the 20 purchased travel centers were removed from the applicable leases and our annual minimum rent was reduced by $43.1 million;


• | the term of each of the leases was extended by three years;


• | the amount of deferred rent obligation to be paid to HPT was reduced from $150.0 million to $70.5 million and we agreed to pay that amount in 16 equal quarterly installments beginning April 1, 2019; and


• | commencing with the year ended December 31, 2020, we will be obligated to pay to HPT an additional amount of percentage rent equal to one-half percent (0.5%) of the excess of the annual nonfuel revenues at leased sites over the nonfuel revenues for each respective site for the year ending December 31, 2019.

The lease amendments are further described in Note 9 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report.

Our Growth Strategy
Our growth strategy is focused on both extending our travel center network and on expanding our scope of products and services as well as the customer segments we serve in a way that enhances and compliments our travel center product and service offerings. 
We intend to extend our travel center network by adding travel centers to our network through acquisitions, franchising and new build development. While we have not actively pursued expansion of our franchised sites in the last several years, during 2018 we began actively promoting our brands to existing travel center operators. We expect that we will add a number of sites to our network through franchising beginning in 2019. In 2019, we have entered a franchise agreement for an independently operated travel center that will convert to our TA Express brand and an agreement to add up to five additional TA Express sites to our network, three by February 2020, one within five years and one within 10 years. 
We also intend to expand our scope of products and services and our customer segments through investments of capital and human resources in our truck service business, particularly our RoadSquad®, RoadSquad OnSite® and Commercial Tire Dealer Network™ programs. Each of these programs, as further described below under the heading "TA Truck Service," can service our traditional long haul trucking customers as well as other truck owner customers we historically have not served.
Our recent travel center, standalone restaurant and other acquisition, development and franchising activities are summarized as follows:
Travel Centers. During the three years ended December 31, 2018, we acquired five travel centers for an aggregate investment of $31.6 million, including costs of renovations. In 2016 we completed construction of three travel centers and in 2017 we completed the construction of an additional travel center. These four new travel centers were developed on land we owned for an aggregate investment of $97.9 million and were subsequently sold to, and leased back from, HPT. In 2016 we added one new franchised travel center with a new franchisee (during 2018 we acquired this travel center from our former franchisee).
Typical improvements we make at acquired travel centers include adding truck repair facilities and nationally branded QSRs, paving parking lots, rebranding gasoline offerings, replacing outdated fuel dispensers, installing diesel exhaust fluid, or DEF, dispensing systems, changing signage, installing point of sale and other information technology, or IT, systems and general building and cosmetic upgrades. The cost of capital improvements to recently purchased travel centers and the development of new travel centers are often substantial and require a long period of time to plan, design, permit and complete; and, after being completed, the improved, or new, travel centers require a period of time to become part of our customers' supply networks and produce stabilized financial results. We estimate that the travel centers we acquire or develop generally will reach financial stabilization approximately three years after completion of improvements or development, but actual results can vary widely from this estimate due to many factors, some of which are outside our control, and we cannot be sure that acquired or developed locations will operate profitably. 
Standalone Restaurants. During the three years ended December 31, 2018, we acquired 51, and developed one, standalone restaurants for an aggregate investment, including costs of renovations, of $42.2 million; 27 of these restaurants were owned and operated by franchisees as of December 31, 2018. Of the 51 standalone restaurants acquired, as of December 31, 2018, 11 are no longer part of our business. In addition, one standalone restaurant was developed by a joint venture in which we own a noncontrolling interest.
Other Acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we acquired a tire retread facility that is part of the Goodyear Authorized Retread Network for a total investment of $4.1 million, including costs of renovations and equipment. 
See Note 3 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report for more information about our acquisitions during 2018 and 2017.
Our Travel Centers
Our typical TA or Petro branded travel center includes:

• | over 25 acres of land with parking for approximately 200 tractor trailers and 100 cars;


• | a full service restaurant and one or more QSRs that we operate as a franchisee under various brands;


• | a truck repair facility and parts store;


• | multiple diesel and gasoline fueling points, including DEF at the diesel lanes; and

8


• | a travel store, game room, lounge and other amenities for professional truck drivers and motorists.

Our typical TA Express branded travel center includes:

• | approximately eight acres of land with parking for approximately 40 tractor trailers and 40 cars;


• | one or more QSRs that we operate as a franchisee under various brands;


• | multiple diesel and gasoline fueling points; and


• | a travel store and other amenities for professional truck drivers and motorists.

Substantially all of our travel centers are full service sites located on or near an interstate highway exit and offer fuel and nonfuel products and services 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.
Our travel center locations offer a broad range of products and services designed to appeal to our customers, including:

• | Fuel. We sell unbranded diesel fuel at separate truck fueling lanes and we sell gasoline and diesel fuel at motorist fuel islands. As of December 31, 2018, we offered branded gasoline at 244 of our 258 locations and unbranded gasoline at six of our travel centers operated by our franchisees.


• | Diesel Exhaust Fluid. DEF is an additive that is required by most truck engines manufactured after 2010. As of December 31, 2018, we offered DEF from dispensers on the diesel fueling island at 253 of our travel centers.


• | Full Service Restaurants and QSRs. Most of our TA and Petro branded travel centers have both full service restaurants and QSRs, and our TA Express branded travel centers have one or more QSRs that offer customers a wide variety of nationally recognized branded food choices. The substantial majority of our full service restaurants within travel centers are operated under our Iron Skillet® and Country Pride® brands and offer menu table service and buffets. At certain travel centers we have converted the full service restaurant to a franchised brand, such as Fuddruckers®, Black Bear Diner® and Bob Evans®. We also operate approximately 39 different brands of QSRs, including Popeye's Chicken & Biscuits®, Subway®, Taco Bell®, Burger King®, Pizza Hut®, Dunkin' Donuts®, Starbuck's Coffee® and Arby's®. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 194 of our travel centers included a full service restaurant, approximately 177 of our travel centers offered at least one QSR and there were a total of approximately 463 QSRs in our 258 travel centers.


• | Truck Service. Most of our travel centers have truck repair and maintenance facilities. Our 244 truck repair and maintenance facilities typically have between three and eight service bays and are staffed by service technicians employed by us or our franchisees. These shops generally operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year and offer extensive maintenance and emergency repair and road services, ranging from basic services such as oil changes, wheel alignments and tire repair to specialty services such as diagnostics and repair of air conditioning, brakes and electrical systems and diesel filter cleaning. Our repair and maintenance services are generally covered by our warranty. Most of our truck repair and maintenance facilities provide some warranty work on Daimler Trucks North America, or Daimler, brand trucks through our participation in the Freightliner ServicePoint® and Western Star ServicePoint® programs, as described under the heading "Operations - Daimler Agreement" below. In addition to work we perform at our facilities, we also provide roadside emergency truck repair, call center and off site truck repair and maintenance services, as described under the heading "TA Truck Service" below.


• | Travel Stores. Travel stores located at our travel centers typically have a selection of over 5,000 items, including packaged food and snack items, beverages, non-prescription drug and beauty supplies, batteries, automobile accessories, and music and video products. Each travel store also has a "to go" bar offering fresh brewed coffee, hot dogs, prepared sandwiches and other prepared foods. The travel stores in our travel centers also sell items specifically designed for the truck driver's "on the road" lifestyle, including laundry supplies, clothing, truck accessories and a variety of electronics.


• | Parking. Our travel centers offer the Reserve-It!® parking program, which allows drivers to reserve for a fee a parking space in advance of arriving at a travel center. As of December 31, 2018, we offered Reserve-It!® parking at 241 of our travel centers and had deployed a total of approximately 5,824 reserved parking spaces. These reserved parking spaces comprise an average percentage of the total parking spaces per site of approximately 12%.

9


• | Additional Driver Services. We believe that trucking fleets can improve the retention and recruitment of truck drivers by directing them to visit large, high quality, full service travel centers with plentiful overnight parking. We offer commercial trucker and other customer loyalty programs, the principal program being the UltraOne® Club, that are similar to the frequent shopper programs offered by other retailers. Drivers receive points for diesel fuel purchases and for spending on selected nonfuel products and services. These points may be redeemed for discounts on nonfuel products and services at our travel centers. In addition, we publish a magazine called RoadKing® which includes articles and advertising of interest to professional truck drivers. Some of our travel centers offer casino gaming. We strive to provide a consistently high level of service and amenities to professional truck drivers at all of our travel centers, making our travel centers an attractive choice for trucking fleets. Most of our travel centers provide truck drivers the amenities listed below:


• | specialized business services, including an information center where drivers can send and receive faxes, overnight mail and other communications;


• | a banking desk where drivers can cash checks and receive funds transfers from fleet operators;


• | wi-fi internet access;


• | a laundry area with washers and dryers;


• | private showers;


• | free exercise facilities; and


• | areas designated for truck drivers only, including a theater or big screen television room with a video player and comfortable seating.

Operations
Fuel. We sell fuel to our customers at prices that we establish daily or are indexed to market prices and reset daily. For the year ended December 31, 2018, diesel fuel and gasoline revenue represented approximately 84.7% and 15.3%, respectively, of our total fuel revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 80.6% of our diesel fuel was sold at discounts to posted prices under pricing arrangements with customers. We have numerous sources for our diesel fuel and gasoline supply, including nearly all of the large oil companies operating in the United States. We purchase diesel fuel from various suppliers at rates that fluctuate with market prices and generally are reset daily. By establishing diesel fuel supply relationships with several alternate suppliers for most locations, we believe we are able to effectively create competition for our purchases among various diesel fuel suppliers. We also believe that purchasing arrangements with multiple diesel fuel suppliers may help us avoid product outages during times of diesel fuel supply disruptions. At some locations, however, there are few suppliers for diesel fuel in that market and we may have only one viable supplier. Generally we have single sources of supply for gasoline at each of our locations. We offer biodiesel at a number of our travel centers and have a limited number of suppliers for this product at those sites. 
A large majority of truck drivers use a payment method known as truck "fuel cards" that allow truck drivers to purchase fuel and other goods and services, and permits trucking companies to track fuel and other purchases made by their drivers throughout the United States. Most of our trucking customers transact business with us by use of fuel cards, most of which are issued by third party fuel card companies. The fuel card industry has only two significant participants, FleetCor Technologies, Inc., the parent of Comdata Inc., or Comdata, and its subsidiaries, or FleetCor, and WEX Inc., and its subsidiaries, or WEX. We believe almost all trucking companies use only a single fuel card provider and have become increasingly dependent upon the data, reports and other services provided by their respective sole fuel card provider to manage their fleets and simplify their data processing.
Generally our fuel purchases are delivered directly from suppliers' terminals to our locations and we do not contract to purchase substantial quantities of fuel to hold as inventory. We generally have only a few days of diesel fuel and gasoline inventory at our travel centers. We believe our exposure to market price increases for diesel fuel and gasoline is partially mitigated by the significant amount of our diesel fuel and gasoline sales that are sold under arrangements that include pricing formulae that reset daily and are indexed to market prices and by us generally not purchasing fuel for delivery other than on the date of purchase. We historically have not engaged in any fixed or hedged price fuel contracts.
10

Nonfuel Products. We have many sources for the large variety of nonfuel products that we sell. We have developed supply relationships with several suppliers of certain nonfuel products, including Daimler for truck parts, Bridgestone Corporation, Continental AG, Cooper Tire and Rubber Company, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, Michelin North America, Inc. and Yokohama Tire Corporation for truck tires, Core-Mark Holding Company Inc. for tobacco and other travel stores products, U.S. Foods for restaurant food products and ExxonMobil Oil Corporation, Equilon Enterprises LLC doing business as Shell Oil Products U.S., or Shell, and Chevron Corporation for lubricants. We maintain two distribution centers to distribute certain nonfuel and nonperishable products to our locations using a combination of contract carriers and our fleet of trucks and trailers. We believe these distribution centers allow us to purchase, maintain and transport inventory and supplies at lower costs.
TA Truck Service. In addition to the truck repair and maintenance services provided at our travel centers, we also provide customers a wide variety of "off site" repair and maintenance services, as described below. 

• | RoadSquad® is a roadside truck service program that operates 24 hours per day, seven days per week. As of December 31, 2018, this program included a fleet of approximately 573 heavy duty professionally maintained emergency vehicles equipped with GPS technology at our travel center and other sites and third party roadside service providers in 50 U.S. states and 10 Canadian provinces with a total of approximately 1,643 locations. We centrally dispatch our service trucks and third party service providers from our call center to assist customers with comprehensive repair services when they are unable to bring their trucks to our travel centers due to a break down. We also provide outsourced call center services to trucking fleets and other truck owners in place of their internal call centers, which customers may use on a full-time basis or for only a portion of a day, on certain days of the week or for certain designated periods. As of December 31, 2018, we provided outsourced call center services to 100 customers, including 72 on a full time basis.


• | RoadSquad OnSite® offers truck and trailer mobile maintenance and repair services performed by certified technicians at customer facilities, with a fleet of approximately 198 trucks in service as of December 31, 2018. RoadSquad OnSite® is designed to be a "bay on wheels" fully stocked with standard and specialty parts and state of the art technology that offers various services such as pre-trip truck inspections, U.S. Department of Transportation required inspections, tire repair and replacement, marker light operation checks, brake inspections, truck refurbishings and complete lubrication services.


• | TA Commercial Tire Network™ is a commercial tire program we began in late 2016 through which we sell a variety of branded tires at our truck repair and maintenance facilities, on customers' lots, distribution centers, through direct sales and under tire manufacturers' national fleet account programs. The TA Commercial Tire Network™ includes a tire retread facility that is part of the Goodyear Authorized Retread Network, providing a full line of Goodyear commercial tire retread products to fleets, local industries and tire dealers within a 150 mile radius of its location in Bowling Green, Ohio. Many of our truck service facilities have access to the retread tires produced at this plant. We believe the TA Commercial Tire Network™ is the most comprehensive commercial tire purchasing, monitoring and maintenance program in the United States.

Daimler Agreement. We are party to an agreement with Daimler that extends to July 2019. Daimler is a leading manufacturer of large trucks and truck engines in North America under the Freightliner, Western Star and Detroit Diesel brand names. Except for locations in Texas, our TA and Petro truck repair and maintenance facilities are authorized providers of repair work and specified warranty repairs to Daimler's customers. This is accomplished through the Freightliner ServicePoint® program at TA locations and through the Freightliner and/or Western Star ServicePoint® programs at our Petro locations. Our TA and Petro truck maintenance and repair facilities are also part of Freightliner's 24 hour customer assistance database for emergency and roadside repair referrals and we have access generally to Daimler's parts distribution, service and technical information systems.
Competition
Fuel and nonfuel products and services can be obtained by trucking companies and truck drivers from a variety of sources, including national and regional full service travel centers and pumper only truck stops, some of which are owned or franchised by large chains and some of which are independently owned and operated, and some large service stations. In addition, some trucking companies operate their own terminals to provide fuel and services to their own trucking fleets and drivers. Some of our competitors may have more resources than we do and vertically integrated fuel and other businesses which may provide them competitive advantages. For all of these reasons and others, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully.
11

We believe that although the travel center and truck stop industry is highly fragmented, with approximately 7,000 travel centers and truck stops in the United States, the largest trucking fleets tend to purchase the majority of their fuel from us and our two largest competitors. We believe that large trucking fleets and long haul trucking fleets tend to purchase the large majority of their fuel at the approximately 1,900 travel centers and truck stops that are located at or near interstate highway exits. Based on the number of locations, Pilot Travel Centers LLC, or Pilot, Love's Travel Stops and Country Stores, Inc., or Love's, and TA are the three largest companies focused principally on the travel center industry. We believe that, during 2018, both of our principal competitors, Pilot and Love's, added significantly more travel centers to their networks than we added to our network, and in some cases competition from new sites added by Pilot and Love's has negatively impacted our unit results. Nevertheless, we believe we are able to compete successfully in part because many of our travel centers were originally developed years ago when prime real estate locations along the interstate highway system were more readily available than they are today, which we believe would make it difficult to fully replicate our travel center business, and also in part because of our full service offerings and larger locations that are not often replicated by our principal competitors. 
We compete with other travel center and truck stop chains based primarily on diesel fuel prices and the quality, variety and pricing of our nonfuel products, services and amenities. Our truck repair and maintenance facilities compete with other providers of truck repair and maintenance facilities, including some at Pilot and Love's locations. These two competitors have increased their respective numbers of truck repair and maintenance facilities and service offerings over the past few years. For truck maintenance and repair services, we also compete with regional full service travel center and smaller truck stop chains, full service independently owned and operated travel centers and truck stops, fleet maintenance terminals, independent garages, truck and commercial tire dealerships, truck quick lube facilities and other parts and service centers. We also compete with other full service restaurants, QSRs, mass merchandisers, electronics stores, drugstores, gasoline stations and convenience stores. Some truck fleets own their own fuel and repair and maintenance facilities; however, we believe the long term trend has been toward a reduction in these facilities in favor of obtaining fuel and repair and maintenance services from third parties like us. We believe that we are able to compete successfully because we offer consistent, high quality products and services, and our nationwide travel centers provide an advantage to large trucking fleets, particularly long haul trucking fleets, by enabling them to (i) take advantage of efficiencies afforded by the wide array of products and services our travel centers provide for their equipment and their drivers and (ii) reduce the number of their suppliers by routing their trucks through our travel centers nationwide.
An additional source of competition in the future could result from commercialization of state owned interstate highway rest areas. Some state governments have historically requested that the federal government allow these rest areas to offer fuel and nonfuel products and services similar to that offered at a travel center and certain congressional leaders have historically supported such legislation. If commercialized, these rest areas may increase the number of locations competing with us and these rest areas may have significant competitive advantages over existing travel centers, including ours, because they are generally located on restricted (i.e., toll) roads and have dedicated ingress and egress.
Our Leases with HPT
We have five leases with HPT, four of which we refer to as the TA Leases and one of which we refer to as the Petro Lease, and which we refer to collectively as the HPT Leases. 
HPT Leases. Pursuant to the amended leases, we lease 144 properties under the TA Leases and 35 properties under the Petro Lease. One of our subsidiaries is a tenant under the leases, and we, and in the case of our TA Leases certain of our subsidiaries, guarantee the tenants' obligations under the leases. 
Term. The TA Leases, as amended, expire on December 31, 2029, 2031, 2032 and 2033, respectively. The Petro Lease, as amended, expires on June 30, 2035. We may extend each of these leases for up to two additional periods of 15 years.
Annual Minimum Rent. As of January 31, 2019, our aggregate annual minimum rent payable to HPT under the HPT Leases was $243.9 million. We may request that HPT purchase approved renovations, improvements and equipment additions we make at the leased properties, in return for an increase in our annual minimum rent equal to the amount paid by HPT times the greater of (i) 8.5% or (ii) a benchmark U.S. Treasury interest rate plus 3.5%. HPT is not required to purchase any improvements and we are not required to sell any improvements to HPT.
12

Percentage Rent. Under the HPT Leases, we incur percentage rent payable to HPT. The percentage rent is 3% of the excess of nonfuel revenues for any particular year over the percentage rent base year amount. HPT had agreed to waive payment of the first $2.5 million of percentage rent that may become due under our Petro Lease, and as of June 30, 2016, HPT had waived, in aggregate, all of the $2.5 million of percentage rent to be waived. Beginning with the year ended December 31, 2020, the percentage rent payable by us to HPT will increase by an amount equal to 0.5% of the excess of annual nonfuel revenues at leased sites over the nonfuel revenues for each respective site for the year ending December 31, 2019.
Deferred Rent. We owe deferred rent to HPT in an aggregate amount of $70.5 million, which is payable in 16 equal quarterly installments beginning April 1, 2019. Interest does not accrue on this deferred rent obligation, subject to exceptions. This deferred rent obligation may be accelerated by HPT and become due on an earlier date and interest shall begin to accrue thereon upon the occurrence of certain events, including a change of control of us.
Maintenance and Alterations. We must maintain, at our expense, the leased properties, including maintenance of structural and non-structural components. At the end of each lease we must surrender the leased properties in substantially the same condition as existed at the commencement of the lease subject to any permitted alterations and reasonable wear and tear.
Assignment and Subletting. HPT's consent is required for any direct or indirect assignment or sublease of any of the leased properties. We remain liable under the leases for subleased properties.
Indemnification and Insurance. With limited exceptions, we indemnify HPT for certain environmental matters and for liabilities that arise during the terms of the leases from ownership or operation of the leased properties. We generally must maintain commercially reasonable insurance. Our insurance coverage requirements include:

• | property insurance in an amount equal to the full replacement cost of at risk improvements at our leased properties;


• | business interruption insurance;


• | general liability insurance, including bodily injury and property damage, in amounts that are generally maintained by companies operating travel centers;


• | flood insurance for any property located in whole or in part in a flood plain;


• | workers' compensation insurance if required by law; and


• | such additional insurance as may be generally maintained by companies operating travel centers, including certain environmental insurance.

The HPT Leases generally require that HPT be named as an additional insured under our insurance policies.
Damage, Destruction or Condemnation. If any leased property is damaged by fire or other casualty or taken by eminent domain, we are generally obligated to rebuild. If the leased property cannot be restored, (a) HPT will generally receive all insurance or taking proceeds, (b) in the case of a casualty loss, we are liable to HPT for any deductible or difference between the replacement cost and the amount of any insurance proceeds, and (c) the annual minimum rent will be reduced by (i) in the case of the TA Leases, at HPT's option, either 8.5% of the net proceeds paid to HPT or the fair market rental of the damaged, destroyed or condemned property, or portion thereof, as of the commencement date of the TA Leases; (ii) in the case of a casualty loss under the Petro Lease, 8.5% of the net proceeds paid to HPT plus the fair market value of the land; and (iii) in the case of a taking under the Petro Lease, 8.5% of the amount of the net proceeds paid to HPT.
Events of Default. Events of default under each lease include the following:

• | our failure to pay rent or any other amounts when due;


• | our failure to maintain the insurance required under the lease;


• | the occurrence of certain events with respect to our insolvency;


• | the institution of a proceeding for our bankruptcy or dissolution;


• | our failure to continuously operate any leased properties without HPT's consent;


• | the acquisition by any person or group of beneficial ownership of 9.8% or more of our voting shares or the power to direct the management and policies of us or any of our subsidiary tenants or guarantors; the sale of a material part of the assets of us or any such tenant or guarantor; or the cessation of certain continuing directors constituting a majority of the board of directors of us or any such tenant or guarantor; in each case without the consent of HPT;


• | our default under any indebtedness of $10.0 million or more for the TA Leases, or $20.0 million or more for the Petro Lease, that gives the holder the right to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness; and

13


• | our failure to perform certain other covenants or agreements of the lease and the continuance thereof for a specified period of time after written notice.

Remedies. Following the occurrence of any event of default, each lease provides that, among other things, HPT may, to the extent legally permitted:

• | accelerate the rent;


• | terminate the lease; and/or


• | make any payment or perform any act required to be performed by us under the lease and receive from us, on demand, an amount equal to the amount so expended by HPT plus interest.

We are also obligated to reimburse HPT for all costs and expenses incurred in connection with any exercise of the foregoing remedies.
Lease Subordination. Each lease may be subordinated to any mortgages of the leased properties by HPT, but HPT is required to obtain nondisturbance agreements for our benefit.
Financing Limitations; Security. Without HPT's prior written consent, our tenant subsidiaries may not incur debt secured by any of their assets used in the operation of the leased properties; provided, however, our tenant subsidiaries may incur purchase money debt to acquire assets used in these operations and we may encumber such assets to obtain a line of credit secured by our tenant subsidiaries' receivables, inventory or certain other assets used in these operations.
Lease Termination. When a lease terminates, any equipment, furniture, fixtures, inventory and supplies at the leased properties that we own may be purchased by HPT at its then fair market value. Also at termination of the TA Leases, HPT has the right to license any of our software used in the operation of the leased properties at its then fair market value and to offer employment to employees at the leased properties; and under the HPT Leases we have agreed to cooperate in the transfer of permits, agreements and the like necessary for the operation of the leased properties.
Territorial Restrictions. Under the terms of each lease, without the consent of HPT, we generally cannot own, franchise, finance, operate, lease or manage any travel center or similar property within 75 miles in either direction along the primary interstate on which a travel center owned by HPT is located.
Right of First Refusal. We have granted to HPT in the HPT Leases a right of first refusal to acquire or finance certain properties that we determine to acquire.
Non-Economic Properties. If during a lease term the continued operation of any leased property becomes non-economic in our reasonable determination and we and HPT cannot agree on an alternative use for the property, we may offer that property for sale, including the sale of HPT's interest in the property, free and clear of our leasehold interests. No sale of a property leased from HPT, however, may be completed without HPT's consent. In the event we obtain a bona-fide offer to purchase the property and HPT consents to the sale, the net sale proceeds received will be paid to HPT, exclusive of amounts associated with our personal property, which we can elect to sell to the buyers or keep, and the annual minimum rent payable shall be reduced. In the case of the TA Leases, this rent reduction will be, at HPT's option, either the amount of such proceeds times 8.5% or the fair market rental for such property as of the commencement date of the lease; in the case of the Petro Lease, this reduction will be the amount of such proceeds times 8.5%. If we obtain a bona-fide offer to purchase the property but HPT does not consent to the sale of the property, that property will no longer be part of the lease and the minimum rent will be reduced as if the sale had been completed at the amount offered. No more than a total of 15 properties subject to the TA Leases and no more than five properties subject to the Petro Lease may be offered for sale as non-economic properties during the applicable lease term.
Arbitration. Our leases with HPT also include arbitration provisions for the resolution of disputes, claims and controversies.
See Note 9 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report for more information about the terms of the HPT Leases and related amounts.

TA, TA Express and Petro Franchise Agreements 
The following is a summary of the material provisions typically included in our TA, TA Express and Petro travel center franchise agreements.
Initial Franchise Fee. The initial franchise fee for a new TA or Petro franchise is $150.0 thousand. The initial franchise fee for a new TA Express franchise is $100.0 thousand.
Term of Agreement. The initial term of a franchise agreement is generally 10 years. Our TA and TA Express franchise agreements generally provide for two five year renewals on the terms then being offered to prospective franchisees at the time of the franchise renewal and our Petro franchise agreements generally provide for two five year renewals on the same terms as the expiring agreements. As of December 31, 2018, our franchise agreements had an average remaining term excluding renewal options of four years and an average remaining term including renewal options of nine years.
Protected Territory. Under the terms of our franchise agreements for TA and TA Express travel centers, generally we have agreed not to operate, or allow another person to operate, a travel center or travel center business that uses the TA or TA Express brand in a specified territory for that TA or TA Express branded franchise travel center.

15

Restrictive Covenants. Generally our franchisees may not operate any travel center or truck stop related business under a franchise agreement, licensing agreement or marketing plan or system of another person or entity. If the franchisee owns the franchised premises, generally for a two year period after expiration or earlier termination of our franchise agreement the franchisee may not operate the premises under a competitive brand.
Nonfuel Product Offerings. Franchisees are required to operate their travel centers in conformity with guidelines that we establish and offer any products and services that we deem to be a standard product or service in our travel centers.
Fuel Purchases and Royalties. Our franchise agreements require the franchisee to pay us a royalty fee of $0.003 per gallon of fuel sold based on sales of certain fuels at the franchised travel center. We also purchase receivables generated by some of our franchisees in connection with sales to common trucking fleet customers through our proprietary billing system on a non-recourse basis in return for a fee.
Royalty Payments on Nonfuel Revenues. Franchisees are required to pay us a royalty fee generally equal to between 2.0% and 4.0% of nonfuel revenues, including on revenues from branded QSRs, in some cases up to a threshold amount, with a lower percentage fee payable on amounts in excess of the threshold amount. 
Advertising, Promotion and Image Enhancement. Our franchisees are required to make additional payments to us as contributions to the applicable brand wide advertising, marketing and promotional expenses we incur.
Termination/Nonrenewal. Generally, we may terminate or refuse to renew a franchise agreement for default by the franchisee. Generally, we may also refuse to renew if we determine that renewal would not be in our economic interest or, in the case of TA franchisees, TA Express franchisees and Petro franchisees under our current form of franchise agreement, if the franchisee will not agree to the terms in our then current form of franchise agreement.
Rights of First Refusal. During the term of each franchise agreement, we generally have a right of first refusal to purchase the franchised travel center at the price the franchisee is willing to accept from a third party. In addition, some of our agreements give us a right to purchase the franchised travel center for fair market value, as determined by the parties or an independent appraiser, upon expiration or earlier termination of the franchise agreement.
Franchisee Lease Agreements
In addition to franchise fees, we also collect rent from franchisees who lease their travel centers from us. At December 31, 2018, there were two such leased franchised travel centers. These franchisees exercised their final renewal term options and renewed their lease agreements during 2017; the terms of these lease agreements expire in June 2022.
QSL Franchise Agreements 
Material provisions of our QSL franchise agreements typically include the following:
Initial Franchise Fee. The initial franchise fee for a new QSL franchise is $40.0 thousand. If a franchisee develops a QSL, the franchisee also is required to sign an area development agreement and is required to pay an initial development fee of $20.0 thousand per restaurant.
Term of Agreement. The initial term of a QSL franchise agreement is generally 10 to 20 years. Our QSL franchise agreements generally provide for a 10 year renewal on the terms then being offered to prospective franchisees at the time of the franchise renewal. As of December 31, 2018, our franchise agreements had an average remaining term excluding renewal options of 10 years and an average remaining term including renewal options of 18 years.
Protected Territory. Under the terms of our QSL franchise agreements, generally we have agreed not to operate, or allow another person to operate, a restaurant that uses the QSL brand in a specified territory. In addition, the franchisees have agreed not to operate a similar restaurant within a specified territory during the term and for a minimum of two years commencing on the effective date of termination or expiration of the franchise agreement.
Restaurant Offerings. Franchisees are required to operate their restaurants in conformity with the image of QSL and agree to prepare, sell and offer only those menu items that have been approved by us. 
Royalty Payments on Gross Sales. QSL franchisees are required to pay us a royalty fee on gross sales, which includes revenues of all goods and merchandise, or services, equal to between 4.0% to 5.0%. 
16

Advertising, Promotion and Image Enhancement. Our franchisees are required to make additional payments to us as contributions to the applicable brand wide advertising, marketing and promotional expenses we incur. In addition, franchisees are required to spend an agreed upon percentage of net revenues on local advertising.
Termination/Nonrenewal. Generally, we may terminate or refuse to renew a franchise agreement for default by the franchisee. 
Rights of First Refusal. During the term of each franchise agreement, we generally have a right of first refusal to purchase that restaurant at the price the franchisee is willing to accept from a third party.
Regulatory Environment
Environmental Regulation
Extensive environmental laws regulate our operations and properties. These laws may require us to investigate and clean up hazardous substances, including petroleum or natural gas products, released at our owned and leased properties. Governmental entities or third parties may hold us liable for property damage and personal injuries, and for investigation, remediation and monitoring costs incurred in connection with any contamination and regulatory compliance at our locations. We use both underground storage tanks and above ground storage tanks to store petroleum products, natural gas and other hazardous substances at our locations. We must comply with environmental laws regarding tank construction, integrity testing, leak detection and monitoring, overfill and spill control, release reporting and financial assurance for corrective action in the event of a release. At some locations we must also comply with environmental laws relative to vapor recovery or discharges to water. Under the terms of the HPT Leases, we generally have agreed to indemnify HPT for any environmental liabilities related to properties that we lease from HPT and we are required to pay all environmental related expenses incurred in the operation of the leased properties. Under an agreement with Shell, we have agreed to indemnify Shell and its affiliates from certain environmental liabilities incurred with respect to our travel centers where Shell has installed natural gas fueling lanes.
For further information about these and other environmental and climate change matters, see the disclosure under the heading "Environmental Contingencies" in Note 15 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report. In addition, for more information about these environmental and climate change matters and about the risks which may arise as a result, see elsewhere in this Annual Report, including "Warning Concerning Forward Looking Statements," Item 1A, "Risk Factors," and Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis - Environmental and Climate Change Matters."
Franchise Regulation
Subject to certain exemptions, the Federal Trade Commission regulations require that we make extensive disclosure to prospective franchisees and some states require state registration and delivery of specified disclosure documentation to potential franchisees. Some state laws also impose restrictions on our ability to terminate or not renew franchises and impose other limitations on the terms of our franchise relationships or the conduct of our franchise business. The Petroleum Marketing Practices Act imposes special regulations on franchises where petroleum products are offered for sale. Also, a number of states include, within the scope of their petroleum franchising statutes, prohibitions against price discrimination and other allegedly anticompetitive conduct. These provisions supplement applicable federal and state antitrust laws. We believe that we are in compliance with all franchise laws applicable to our business.
Gaming Regulation
Because we have gaming operations at some of our travel centers, we and our concerned subsidiaries are currently subject to gaming regulations in Illinois, Louisiana, Montana and Nevada. Requirements under gaming regulations vary by jurisdiction but include, among other things:

• | findings of suitability by the relevant gaming authorities with respect to, or licensure of, certain of our and our licensed subsidiaries' directors, officers and key employees and certain individuals having a material relationship with us or our licensed subsidiaries;


• | findings of suitability by the relevant gaming authorities with respect to certain of our security holders and restrictions on ownership of certain of our securities;


• | prior approval in certain circumstances by the relevant gaming authorities of offerings of our securities;


• | prior approval by the relevant gaming authorities of changes in control of us; and

17


• | specified reporting requirements.

Holders of beneficial interests in our voting securities are subject to licensing or suitability investigations by the relevant gaming authorities under various circumstances including, generally, service on our Board of Directors, the attainment of certain levels of ownership of a class of our voting securities, or involvement in the gaming operations of or influence over us or our licensed subsidiaries. Persons or entities seeking to acquire control of us or our operation of the license are subject to prior investigation by and approval from the relevant gaming authorities. Any beneficial owner of our voting securities, regardless of the number of shares owned, may be required by a relevant gaming authority to file an application and have their suitability reviewed in certain circumstances, including if the gaming authority has reason to believe that such ownership of our voting securities would otherwise be inconsistent with its state's gaming laws. In some jurisdictions, the applicant must pay all costs of investigations incurred in connection with such investigations. Additionally, in the event of a finding by a relevant gaming authority that a person or entity is unsuitable to be an owner of our securities, such person would be prohibited from, among other things, receiving any dividend or interest upon such securities, exercising any voting right conferred through such securities or continuing to hold our securities beyond such period of time as may be prescribed by such gaming authority, managing the licensed business and, in some cases, the shareholder may be required to divest himself or itself of our voting securities.
Certain of our and our subsidiaries' directors and officers must also file applications, be investigated and be licensed or found suitable by the relevant gaming authorities in order to hold such positions. In the event of a finding by a relevant gaming authority that a director, officer, key employee or individual with whom we or our licensed subsidiary have a material relationship is unsuitable, we or our licensed subsidiary, as applicable, may be required to sever our relationships with such individual or such individual may be prohibited from serving as our director or officer.
Any violations by us or any of our licensed subsidiaries of the gaming regulations to which we are subject could result in fines, penalties (including the limiting, conditioning, suspension or revocation of any licenses held) and criminal actions. Additionally, certain jurisdictions, such as Nevada, empower their regulators to investigate participation by licensees in gaming outside their jurisdiction and require access to periodic reports regarding those gaming activities. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions.
We have a Gaming Compliance Plan, or the Compliance Plan, as required by the Nevada Gaming Commission in connection with our gaming operations at certain of our travel center locations. In connection with the Compliance Plan we have a Gaming Compliance Committee, or the Compliance Committee, on which a member of our Audit Committee of the Board of Directors serves as the Board of Directors' liaison to the Compliance Committee pursuant to the terms of the Compliance Plan. The Compliance Committee assists us in monitoring activities relating to our continuing qualifications under applicable gaming laws.
Seasonality
Our sales volumes are generally lower in the first and fourth quarters than the second and third quarters of each year. In the first quarter, the movement of freight by professional truck drivers as well as motorist travel are usually at their lowest levels of each calendar year. In the fourth quarter, freight movement is typically lower due to the holiday season. While our revenues are modestly seasonal, the quarterly variations in our operating results may reflect greater seasonal differences as our rent and certain other costs do not vary seasonally.
Intellectual Property
We own the "Petro Stopping Center" and "Quaker Steak & Lube" names and related trademarks and various trade names used in our business including RoadSquad®, RoadSquad OnSite®, TA Commercial Tire Network™, UltraOne®, Iron Skillet®, Reserve-It!®, eShop® and others. We have the right to use the "TA," "TA Express," "TravelCenters of America," Country Pride® and certain other trademarks, which are owned by HPT, during the term of each TA Lease. We also license certain trademarks used in the operation of certain of our restaurants. We believe that these trademarks are important to our business, but that they could be replaced with alternative trademarks without significant disruption in our business except for the cost of such changes, which may be significant.
