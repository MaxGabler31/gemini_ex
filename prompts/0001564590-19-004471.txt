--------+---------

Overview
 Nutrisystem, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “Nutrisystem,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a provider of weight management products and services, including nutritionally balanced weight loss programs sold primarily online and over the telephone and multi-day kits and single items available at select retail locations. The Company’s multi-brand approach includes Nutrisystem and the South Beach Diet. Typically, our program customers purchase monthly food packages containing a four-week meal plan consisting of breakfasts, lunches, dinners, snacks and flex meals, which they supplement, depending on the program they are following, with items such as fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, lean protein and dairy. Most of our customers order on an auto-delivery basis (“Auto-Delivery”), which means we send a four-week meal plan on an ongoing basis until notified of a customer’s cancellation. Auto-Delivery customers are offered savings off of our regular one-time rate with each order. Monthly notifications are also sent to remind customers to update order preferences. We offer pre-selected favorites or customers may personalize their meal plan by selecting their entire menu or customizing plans to their specific tastes or dietary preference. In total, our plans feature approximately 250 food options including frozen and ready-to-go entrees, snacks and shakes, at different price points. Additionally, we offer unlimited counseling from our trained weight loss counselors, registered dietitians and certified diabetes educators at no cost. Counselors are available as needed, seven days a week throughout an extended day, with further support provided through our digital tools.  
 In December 2018, the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Tivity Health, Inc. (“Tivity Health”). Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Nutrisystem will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tivity Health (the “Merger”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each share of Nutrisystem common stock (“Nutrisystem Shares”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares as to which dissenter’s rights have been properly exercised and certain other excluded shares) will be converted into the right to receive (i) $38.75 in cash, without interest (the “Cash Consideration”), and (ii) 0.2141 (the “Exchange Ratio”) shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Tivity Health (“Tivity Health Shares,” and together with the Cash Consideration, the “Merger Consideration”), with cash payable in lieu of fractional Tivity Health Shares.
 Completion of the merger is subject to certain customary closing conditions, including (1) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Nutrisystem Shares entitled to vote thereon at a meeting duly called and held for such purpose, (2) absence of any order or law that has the effect of enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the completion of the Merger and (3) the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to the other party. The Merger is expected to close in the first quarter of 2019. 
 The Company and Tivity Health have made customary representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement also contains customary covenants and agreements, including covenants and agreements relating to (a) the conduct of each of the Company’s and Tivity Health’s respective businesses between the date of the signing of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger, and (b) the efforts of the parties to cause the Merger to be completed.
 The Merger Agreement also provides that under specified circumstances, including a termination by the Company to enter into a definitive agreement for an acquisition proposal that constitutes a superior proposal or a termination by Tivity Health as a result of the Company’s Board of Directors changing its recommendation with respect to the Merger Agreement, the Company will pay Tivity Health a termination fee of $45.0 million.
 
Our programs are based on the following cornerstones that represent who we are to our customers:
  
• | Real Results. Our programs have helped millions of people lose weight for more than 45 years. Our programs are nutritionally balanced and portioned for weight loss. We also offer transition and maintenance plans, which include personalized menu options (e.g., only dinner entrees) as well as continued counseling support and access to apps that provide easy-to-use, interactive and personalized weight loss tracking tools. These digital products integrate with wearable fitness devices and health platforms and are available at no cost to customers, as well as the general population of do-it-yourself dieters.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sound Science. The Nutrisystem® program provides a balanced approach to weight loss. The program delivers a reduced calorie meal plan that is high in protein, low in fat and focuses on the right amount of “smart” carbohydrates like whole grains and fiber. The Nutrisystem program offers portion-controlled items that are incorporated into a meal plan. The South Beach Diet® program is a high-protein, low-carb, low in added sugar weight loss program. Our programs offer customers a variety of meal choices, including approximately 250 foods with no artificial flavors or sweeteners, colors from artificial sources, high-fructose corn syrup, MSG, or artificial trans fats (partially hydrogenated oils), and more than 195 foods with no artificial preservatives.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Complete Convenience. Our weight loss programs are primarily sold through a direct-to-consumer sales and distribution approach using the Internet and telephone. Our customers can place orders 24 hours a day, seven days a week, on our websites and the food is shipped directly to our customers’ door. Our customers can either choose our pre-selected favorites meal plan or customers may personalize the plan by selecting their entire menu or customizing plans to their specific tastes or dietary preference. The entrees are individually packaged, and food preparation time is minimal. The direct-to-consumer approach using the Internet and telephone provides the convenience and privacy that our customers value. Additionally, we offer unlimited counseling from our trained weight loss counselors, registered dietitians and certified diabetes educators at no cost. Counselors are available as needed, seven days a week, throughout an extended day, with further support provided through our digital tools. Our programs do not require customers to visit centers, measure foods or count calories.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Value. We believe our products and programs are very competitively priced within the weight management industry and provide a compelling value proposition to our customers, which includes approximately 250 menu items, expert guides and unlimited counseling from our trained weight loss counselors, registered dietitians and certified diabetes educators and apps, available at no cost. We do not charge membership fees. Various promotional offers and pricing are offered throughout the year.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competitive Strengths
 We believe our programs, meal kits and digital tools offer a sensible approach to losing weight while also educating customers about proper portion size, as well as the appropriate combinations of fiber, protein, good carbohydrates and fat. 
 
We intend to capitalize on the following competitive strengths:
  
• | Product Efficacy. We believe most of our customers are very satisfied with our products and believe they have lost weight while using one of our programs. Our customer research has found that customers tend to stay on the program for 11 to 12 weeks. We have sponsored clinical trials at leading academic centers, including in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Studies on our Nutrisystem® D® (diabetes) plan (in combination with counseling sessions) showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful weight loss and improvements in HbA1c (a key measure of blood glucose control), in addition to improvements in secondary endpoints such as waist circumference, total plasma cholesterol and blood pressure.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strong Brand Recognition. We believe that our brands are well recognized in the weight management industry. The Nutrisystem name has been in the weight management industry for more than 45 years, and we estimate that our Company and our predecessors have spent hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising over that time period. The South Beach Diet, created 16 years ago by world-renowned cardiologist Dr. Arthur Agatston, was a bestseller and has more than 23 million copies in print.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Low Cost, Highly Scalable Model. Unlike traditional commercial weight loss programs, which primarily sell through franchisee and company-owned centers, we primarily generate revenue in our direct channel online and through the telephone (including the redemption of prepaid gift cards). Our method of distribution removes the fixed costs and capital investment associated with diet centers. We minimize fixed costs and capital investments in food procurement and fulfillment by outsourcing the production of our food products to a number of vendors. We also outsource 100% of our fulfillment operations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Superior Customer Value Proposition. Our goal is to offer our customers a complete weight loss program that is convenient, private and cost-effective. Our customers primarily place their orders online or over the telephone and have their food delivered directly to their home. This affords our customers the convenience and anonymity that other diets, which rely on weight-loss centers, cannot ensure. Additionally, we provide our customers with monthly food packages containing a four-week meal plan consisting of breakfasts, lunches, dinners, snacks and Flex™ meals, which they supplement, depending on which program they are using, with fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, lean protein and dairy. This removes the confusion of reading nutrition labels, measuring portions or counting calories, carbohydrates or points. We believe our weight loss programs offer our customers significant value and are priced below those of our competitors. In addition, unlike some of our competitors, we do not charge a membership fee.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Retail. We also generate revenue through the sale of our multi-day kits and single items at select retail locations. These multi-day kits and single items have expanded our product and consumer reach. The retail channel provides us with great brand exposure, offering consumers who may not be aware of our programs an opportunity to sample Nutrisystem at a more attractive price point.

Our Industry
 Weight management is a challenge for a significant portion of the U.S. population, as well as the global population. It is estimated that 39.8% of, or 93.3 million, U.S. adults are obese. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, overweight and obese individuals are increasingly at risk for diseases such as Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, certain types of cancer, stroke, arthritis, sleep apnea and depression. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the “CDC”) estimates one out of every ten people (30.3 million) have diabetes in the U.S. and more than one out of three adults (84.1 million) have a condition known as prediabetes. The CDC estimates 110 million Americans will have diabetes by the year 2050. However, there is evidence that weight loss may reduce the risk of developing these conditions, as well as improve the health and quality of life of people who have these conditions. 
Competition
 The weight loss industry is very competitive and consists of pharmaceutical products and weight loss programs, digital tools and wearable trackers, as well as a wide variety of diet foods and meal replacement bars and shakes, appetite suppressants, nutritional supplements and surgical procedures. The weight loss market is served by a diverse array of competitors. Potential customers seeking to manage their weight can turn to traditional center-based competitors, online diet-oriented sites, self-directed dieting and self-administered products such as prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs and supplements, meal replacement products, as well as medically supervised programs.
 We believe that our principal competitive factors in the weight loss market are:
  
• | the availability, convenience, privacy and effectiveness of the weight loss program;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | brand recognition and trustworthiness;
--+---------------------------------------


• | media spending;
--+----------------


• | new products and innovative offerings;
--+---------------------------------------


• | program pricing; and
--+---------------------


• | the ability to attract and retain customers through promotion and personal referral.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Based on these factors, we believe that we can compete effectively in the weight loss industry. We, however, have no control over how successful competitors will be in addressing these factors. By providing well-recognized food-based weight management programs using the direct channel, we believe that we have a competitive advantage in our market.
 Our Products and Services
 For more than 45 years, Nutrisystem has been recognized as a leader in the weight loss industry. We provide comprehensive weight loss programs consisting primarily of a pre-packaged food program, digital tools and counseling. Typically, our customers purchase monthly food packages of frozen and ready-to-go food containing a four-week meal plan consisting of breakfasts, lunches, dinners, snacks and Flex meals, which they supplement, depending on the program they are following, with fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, lean proteins, dairy and complex carbohydrates like whole grains. Most customers order through our Auto-Delivery feature. Our programs feature approximately 250 menu options at different price points including frozen and ready-to-go entrees, snacks and shakes. Trained weight loss counselors are available to answer questions and make recommendations to help each customer achieve and maintain his or her weight loss goal. Customers support and encourage each other and share information via social media channels. These services are complemented with relevant information on diet, nutrition and physical activity. Additionally, our digital products integrate with wearable fitness devices and health platforms and are offered at no charge.
 
Our programs consist of approximately 250 foods that contain no artificial flavors, sweeteners, colors from artificial sources, high-fructose corn syrup, MSG, or artificial trans fats (partially hydrogenated oils). 
 
We are focused on things that make our programs truly unique in the marketplace. We do not believe that one brand or product can be all things to all people, which is why we continue to differentiate and expand our multi-brand platform with new product introductions targeted to different consumer audiences.

In 2018, we began to offer the Nutrisystem® Turbo13 program, which meets the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) guidelines for fat, saturated fat, trans fat, sodium, carbohydrates, fiber, added sugars and protein. A large number of our foods aim to have at least 50% of the grains coming from whole grain sources. Including grocery additions to supplement our meals, all plans contain less than 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day, consistent with national guidelines, and tailored versions of the plans are available that deliver as low as 1,500 milligrams per day. In contrast, the average American consumes 2,900 to 4,000 milligrams of sodium per day. We constantly strive to meet or exceed national nutritional guidelines as they are updated. Convenient and easy-to-

follow, Turbo13 provides safe and meaningful weight loss and includes support and counseling options from trained weight loss coaches, registered dietitians and certified diabetes educators available seven days a week from the Company’s award-winning contact center, as well as free digital apps that complement each plan. Additionally, for customers transitioning to maintenance, there is the Nutrisystem® Success® plan.
 
The South Beach Diet® program, in its second year as a home-delivered, structured weight-loss plan, continues to offer a safe, effective method of weight loss through an enhanced three-phased low-carb approach designed to burn fat, transform metabolism and boost energy. The 7-Day Body Reboot, the one-week Phase 1 jumpstart introduced this year, helps customers break the sugar habit and delivers fast results. In Phase 2, designed for steady weight loss, customers can choose from an expanded menu and add in good carbs like fruits and whole grains. Phase 3 helps customers learn how to maintain a healthy weight, without hunger or deprivation. The plan allows individuals to eat heart healthy, good fats that nourish and satisfy, versus other high protein diets that do not distinguish between good and bad fats. Created by Dr. Arthur Agatston, a renowned cardiologist from southern Florida, “The South Beach Diet,” was first published in 2003 and became a bestseller with more than 23 million copies in print and multiple titles appearing on the New York Times bestseller list. The plan includes support and counseling options from trained weight-loss coaches and registered dietitians available seven days a week. Customers can also download the new South Beach Diet Tracker app. 
 
This year, we also launched the DNA Body Blueprint™ kit, a genetic-based product using a proprietary algorithm that provides an integrated personal action plan focused on eating behaviors, nutrition and metabolism. Nutrisystem greenlighted the creation of the DNA Body Blueprint based on a thorough assessment of market dynamics and scientific reviews from our Science Advisory Board. This board consists of a team of professionals, each with distinct backgrounds and expertise, who helped evaluate existing research to enhance current programs, as well as develop new programs utilizing the latest science and technology trends within weight management.
 Additionally, our multi-day meal kits are available at select retailers. We offer several varieties of our Nutrisystem 5-day kit, a “D” kit targeted to individuals with or at risk of Type 2 diabetes, as well as SmartCarb and PowerFuel products including meal replacement bars, multiple varieties of powder shakes, baked goods and a line of snacks designed to complement our multi-day kits. The retail channel provides us with great brand exposure, offering consumers who may not be aware of our programs an opportunity to sample our products at a more attractive price point. We are seeing repeat business as well as multiple kit purchases, indicating that customers are seeing results or enlisting other family members to diet with them. Also, we continue to offer our programs at Costco through the sale of prepaid gift cards. 
 For those with Type 2 diabetes or for those at risk for Type 2 diabetes, we have the Nutrisystem® D® Program, a weight loss program specifically designed to produce gradual weight loss. It provides nutrition consistent with the guidelines of the USDA. Two randomized controlled trials published in peer-reviewed medical journals found the Nutrisystem® D® Program, in combination with counseling sessions, produced statistically and clinically meaningful improvements in weight, HbA1c (a key measure of blood glucose control), and several other risk factors. Notably, improvements in diabetes control were observed along with a reduction in diabetes medications among participants who received the Nutrisystem D intervention. A third study, utilizing continuous glucose monitoring technology, found improvements in blood glucose control when subjects used the Nutrisystem® D® Program, even before the achievement of significant weight loss.
 By offering a variety of frozen and ready-to-go foods, we help our customers sustain their weight loss efforts. On our websites, customers can order food 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The transition and maintenance plans allow customers the means to gradually increase their responsibility for grocery shopping and food preparation while adhering to the principles of our weight loss programs. These lower cost programs help extend the supportive relationship and allow time to reinforce the dietary changes that produced the initial weight loss. These plans include recipes and portion-control tools in addition to a reduced number of entrees delivered each month. Our weight loss programs’ features are counter to traditional weight loss programs’ limitations, such as, high initiation and recurring membership fees, the inconvenience of traveling to weight loss centers for scheduled appointments and lack of privacy. In addition, our prepared meals provide our customers with a structured program with limited weighing and measuring of foods and no need to count calories, carbohydrates or points. 
 
Customers are provided breakfasts, lunches, dinners and snacks, which they supplement, depending on the program they are following, with Flex meals and snacks made up of fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, lean protein and complex carbs like whole grains. We believe that the convenience of home delivery, reduced grocery shopping time, the portability of the food, and rapid food preparation also aid customer compliance with our weight loss program.
 Our food items have accounted for 98%, 99% and 99% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. No other product or service has accounted for more than 1% of our revenue in any of the last three years. Approximately 99% of our revenue was generated in the United States in each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.

The Customer Experience
 Our sales, marketing, ecommerce and service operations seek to understand our customers’ needs throughout their weight loss and management journey to help us develop effective, compelling and innovative products and services. Through a combination of consumer research and data management, we personalize the introduction, on-boarding, weight loss, transition and maintenance phases of our customers’ experience.

• | Introduction/Acquisition
--+-------------------------

 We attract new customers via direct response television, online marketing (including search engine marketing, search engine optimization, affiliate marketing, display advertising, partnerships, social media and email), direct mail, print advertisements and a variety of other direct marketing efforts. We have a fully integrated acquisition enterprise. Response is tracked to the specific vehicle, and analytic models are used to attribute other orders back to the response source, in order to closely manage the effectiveness of our specific direct marketing efforts. 
 The majority of our new customers buy via our websites. We consistently seek to refine our sales conversion funnel through thoughtful testing to improve the learning and buying experience for prospects and to increase conversion rates.
 We also have an in-house call center. Staffing levels fluctuate seasonally and are aligned to marketing spend and consequent call volume. Sales agents, paid primarily on commission, take in-bound responses from our advertisements and personalize the weight loss plan for each customer. They also make out-bound calls to customers who have provided their contact information.
  
• | On-Boarding
--+------------

 To help customers get off to a strong and successful start, we provide both printed materials in initial shipments of food (including guides and a daily food tracker) and access to a robust set of customizable online tools and trackers. Customers also have access to Nutrisystem and South Beach Diet content sites, The Leaf and The Palm, for recipes, inspiration and how-to articles and videos. 
  
• | On-Program
--+-----------

 We use customer preferences to offer a variety of additional products and services that help customers while on the path to their weight loss goals. These offers are made via our websites, emails, social media, newsletters and our contact center.
 We also offer unlimited counseling services for our customers with trained weight loss counselors, registered dietitians and certified diabetes educators at no cost. We seek to hire counselors with backgrounds in psychology, sociology, nutrition, dietetics or other health-related fields and with suitable, compassionate personalities to help and support our customers throughout their weight loss journey. Counselors are trained in our programs, motivational techniques and problem solving. Counselors take in-bound requests for help via phone and also reach out to customers via email and phone.
  
• | Transition and Maintenance
--+---------------------------

 As customers reach their weight loss goals, we offer transition and maintenance programs that provide products and guidance that combine the right amount of structure and flexibility. These programs are offered online, via email marketing, and via our contact center’s retention agents. 
  
• | Reactivation
--+-------------

 Because we realize that weight management is a lifelong process, and that customers may need our programs again from time to time, we reach out to past customers to attempt to put them back on structured programs if needed. Our digital content, e-newsletters and apps help keep customer relationships active after the completion of the first weight loss cycle. Employing data and segmentation, we develop products and programs that address the varied needs of past customers. We offer these products and programs via our contact center, television, digital marketing and targeted emails, social media efforts and direct mail.  
  
• | Customer Service
--+-----------------

 We are committed to the highest levels of customer service and manage our customer relations through our in-house call center. Our representatives are trained to answer questions and solve problems once a purchase has been made. Customers contact us via email, online chat and phone. Typical inquiries concern delivery dates, reported missing or damaged items, and requests for credits or exchanges. For email inquiries, we have a software system that scans the customer’s email for keywords and automatically supplies the representative with a response that is then reviewed, edited and sent to the customer. We regularly review customer satisfaction levels and improve our practices accordingly.

Supply Chain
 An integrated order receipt, billing, picking, shipping and delivery tracking system comprised of proprietary and third-party components is utilized for our orders. This system integrates the front end, or website customer interface, with order processing and shipping, and allows customers to access shippers’ order tracking numbers online. Our computer-assisted picking system allows for virtually paperless order picking in all warehouse facilities.
 We utilize an integrated network of distribution facilities through an existing arrangement with our outside fulfillment provider. We work closely with our fulfillment provider to drive out waste and continuously improve processes. We currently utilize seven outsourced distribution facilities. Three are located in Pennsylvania (Allentown, Bethlehem and Chambersburg), two in Nevada (both in Sparks), one in Illinois (Troy) and one in Georgia (Atlanta). As of December 31, 2018, all fulfillment was being handled by one outsourced provider. 
 We have a service agreement with our outside fulfillment provider which provides for storage, handling of frozen and ready-to-go foods and other services, including pricing and minimum space commitments. The current contract expires on various dates ranging from June 30, 2020 to June 30, 2023 with respect to certain of the sites but may be terminated sooner upon 180-day written notice. We believe that other outside fulfillment providers could be utilized if needed and we continually evaluate the need for secondary fulfillment services.
 We continue to partner with our fulfillment provider to efficiently process and ship our orders. In 2018, approximately, 94% of all direct customer initial orders were shipped within three business days of the date the order was received.    
 Direct customers are not charged for their orders until the ordered product is shipped. We do not charge customers for shipping on any four-week meal plan. For customers who purchase an Auto-Delivery plan, we provide a discount off the regular one-time rate of the four-week meal plan. If an Auto-Delivery customer cancels before receipt of a second shipment and after the 14-day money back guarantee period, the customer will be charged a cancellation fee for the Auto-Delivery discount received on the first shipment. 
 Product Development
 All of our foods and supplements are currently outsourced from more than 35 manufacturers or vendors. We have entered into supply agreements with several of these vendors, some of which may provide for annual pricing, annual purchase obligations, exclusivity in the production of certain products, as well as certain rebates to us if certain volume thresholds are exceeded. These contracts have terms of five years or less and generally may be terminated by us upon written notice, mostly between 30 and 180 days, or under certain circumstances only upon a default of the vendor. We anticipate meeting all annual purchase obligations.
 In 2018, approximately 10% and 6% of inventory purchases were from two vendors. In 2017, these vendors supplied approximately 12% and 8% of inventory purchases, and in 2016, they supplied approximately 11% of inventory purchases each.
 Our product development team uses a number of sources – customer feedback, market trends, nutrition science, national dietary guidelines and breakthroughs in food technology – to create new ideas for our program. New foods are created to enhance the variety of our current offerings or to support the efforts of creating a new program. Typically, concepts are formulated in collaboration with our food manufacturers to meet our requirements for nutrition and stability. We then contract with these food manufacturers to produce these products based on our specifications. Alternatively, food manufacturers may suggest items. Regardless of a given food item’s pathway through development, that food is evaluated for nutrition, compliance with our program, taste and cost considerations. The number of stock keeping units, or SKUs, we introduce each year varies depending on whether we are introducing a new program or simply updating an existing one.
 Public Relations
 We conduct a proactive public relations program that is designed to garner positive coverage of the Company and our weight loss programs across all media platforms including television, magazine, print, online news, blogs and social media, particularly around the key dieting seasons. In addition, the public relations team supports an executive communication program to broadly support our brands.
Community Support
 We have been a local sponsor of the Go Red for Women Campaign for the last four years. In 2018, Nutrisystem CEO, Dawn Zier, served as a member of the Go Red for Women Executive Leadership Team, a committee of Philadelphia based executives committed to raising awareness of heart disease and stroke. In 2017, the Go Red for Women Campaign in Greater Philadelphia, under 
 10

Nutrisystem CEO Dawn Zier’s leadership as chair, generated more funds than ever before, setting a new local record for total funds raised making Greater Philadelphia’s efforts the largest in the nation.
 Nutrisystem is a perennial sponsor –– 2018 was the 9th consecutive year –– of The American Diabetes Association Step Out: Walk to Stop Diabetes in Philadelphia. As part of our sponsorship in 2018, we hosted the Step Out Café and dozens of our employees assisted with the registration of event participants and provided other logistical services in support of the event. 
 Since 2015, Nutrisystem has been a partner of Girl Talk, an international, non-profit, peer-to-peer mentoring program focused on helping teens build confidence and develop leadership skills, having announced the partnership in conjunction with the Company’s #NowBelieveIt campaign, a social empowerment initiative that highlights the positive power that compliments play in the lives of women and girls. Each year, Nutrisystem has awarded a scholarship to Girl Talk’s 2018 National Leader of the Year, the organization’s highest and most prestigious honor.
 Our Customers
 We offer weight loss programs designed for women and men as well as people with Type 2 diabetes or at risk for Type 2 diabetes who want to lose weight and manage their diabetes. Based on our customer research, our typical Nutrisystem® customer is female and we believe that, on average, customers want to lose 40 pounds over a period of time. Additionally, based on our customer research, we believe our typical customers tend to stay on our program for 11 to 12 weeks. We believe that this research indicates our customers value the following Nutrisystem® program attributes:

• | effective weight loss;
--+-----------------------


• | convenient direct delivery to their door;
--+------------------------------------------


• | simple to follow and stay on program;
--+--------------------------------------


• | food can be easily prepared in minutes;
--+----------------------------------------


• | wide variety of food choices; and
--+----------------------------------


• | they feel satisfied while on the program.
--+------------------------------------------

Information Systems
 Our ecommerce and community websites and our tools and trackers, all of which are based primarily on third-party software customized to meet our business needs, are each hosted in top tier hosting facilities. These facilities provide redundant network connections, physical and fire security and generator power back up for the equipment upon which our websites rely and are intended to provide an uninterruptible power supply. Our servers and our network are monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
 We use a variety of security techniques to protect our confidential customer data. When our customers place an order or access their account information, we secure that transaction by using encryption technologies, including transport layer security, or TLS. Our customer data is protected against unauthorized access by security measures and we engage a variety of industry leading technology providers including VeriSign, CyberSource and SecureWorks to further ensure the security of our credit card transactions and the safety of our customers’ personal information.
 Intellectual Property
 We own numerous domestic and international trademarks and other proprietary rights that are important to our business. Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are used in the regular course of trade and/or their registrations are properly maintained. We believe the protection of our trademarks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, and trade secrets is important to our success. We aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on a combination of watch services and trademark, copyright, patent, trade dress and trade secret laws, and through the domain name dispute resolution system.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 544 employees and consider our relations with these employees to be good.
 11

Seasonality
 Typically in the weight loss industry, revenue is greatest in the first calendar quarter and lowest in the fourth quarter. We believe our business experiences seasonality, driven primarily by the predisposition of dieters to initiate a diet at certain times of the year and the placement of our advertising, which is based on the price and availability of certain media at such times.
