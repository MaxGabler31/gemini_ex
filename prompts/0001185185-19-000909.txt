ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Corporate History
 
AeroGrow International, Inc. (“AeroGrow,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our”) was formed as a Nevada corporation in March, 2002. After more than three years of initial research and product development, we began sales activities in 2006. Our principal executive offices are located at 6075 Longbow Drive, Suite 200, Boulder, Colorado 80301 and our main telephone number is (303) 444-7755.
Our Business
 
AeroGrow is a developer, marketer, direct-seller, and wholesaler of advanced indoor garden systems designed for consumer use and priced to appeal to the gardening, cooking, healthy eating, and home and office decor markets. We offer multiple lines of proprietary indoor gardens, grow lights, a patented nutrient formula, more than 40 corresponding proprietary seed pod kits, and various cooking, gardening and decor accessories, primarily in the United States and Canada, as well as selected countries in Europe. As of March 31, 2019, we have manufactured and shipped approximately 2.2 million AeroGarden® units and approximately 4.5 million seed pod kits to consumers worldwide, through the following two sales channels:

● | Retail Sales Channel, both online and in-store retail distribution (with about 2,400 brick and mortar store fronts carrying our products) in North America and in five European countries; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Direct-to-Consumer Sales Channel, predominantly online via our website based upon traffic from our catalogues, commercials and other awareness campaigns. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 (“Fiscal 2019”), we mailed approximately 200,000 catalogues, tested and utilized several forms of digital advertising and ran some 30, 60 and 120 second television commercials. In prior years, we also utilized direct television sales, including infomercials and 60 and 120 second television commercials, mall kiosks, and print and radio advertisements. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We commenced initial marketing and distribution of our products in March 2006 with an emphasis on our retail sales channel, which typically generates lower margins and requires much higher investments in inventory than our direct sales channel.  As a result of the downturn in the economy in 2009 and the corresponding lack of funding, we shifted our sales and marketing efforts away from retail distribution.  During the four-year period ending March 31, 2013, we emphasized our higher margin “direct-to-consumer” sales channels by utilizing in-house direct mail catalogues, e-mail marketing, and internet marketing, while continuing to sell to a limited number of international customers.  
 
Beginning in April 2013, we began to sell to retail customers again due to improving economic conditions and our strategic alliance with a subsidiary of The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (“Scotts Miracle-Gro”).  In July 2018, Scotts Miracle-Gro provided us with up to $6.0 million of incremental working capital on an as needed basis.  Interest was charged at the stated rate of 10% per annum.  We believe that the strategic alliance also gives Scotts Miracle-Gro an entry into the burgeoning indoor gardening market, while providing AeroGrow a broad base of support in marketing, distribution, supply chain logistics, R&D, and sourcing.  See “April 2013 Scotts Miracle-Gro Strategic Alliance” below.
 
Our principal products are indoor gardens and proprietary seed pod kits that allow consumers, with or without gardening experience, to grow: (i) vegetables, such as tomatoes, chili peppers and salad greens; (ii) fresh herbs, including cilantro, chives, basil, dill, oregano, and mint; and (iii) flowers, such as petunias, snapdragons, geraniums and vinca. Consumers can also plant and grow their own seeds using our proprietary “grow anything” kits, or use their AeroGardens as seed starters for their outdoor gardens with our “seed starting” systems.
 
Our indoor gardens are designed to be simple, consistently successful, and affordable.  We believe that our products enable almost anyone, from consumers who have little or no gardening experience to those who are professional gardeners, to produce year-round harvests of a variety of herbs, vegetables, and flowers, regardless of season, weather, or availability of natural light. We believe that our unique and attractive designs make our indoor gardening products appropriate for use in almost any location, including kitchens, living areas, and offices.
 
Our indoor gardening units are designed to match customer needs and interests with the appropriate garden unit features and benefits at retail list prices ranging from approximately $50 to $700, depending on size, design elements, light intensity and other automated features.  As is customary, we sometimes offer temporary discounts and targeted promotions that are designed to generate new customer sales and higher sales volume.

April 2013 Scotts Miracle-Gro Strategic Alliance
 
In April 2013, the first month of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014 (“Fiscal 2014”), we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement and strategic alliance with a wholly owned subsidiary of Scotts Miracle-Gro. In conjunction with this transaction, we entered into several other agreements, including: (i) an Intellectual Property Sale Agreement; (ii) a Technology Licensing Agreement; (iii) a Brand Licensing Agreement; and (iv) a Supply Chain Management Agreement.  For further information on the strategic alliance with Scotts Miracle-Gro, please see Note 3 “Scotts Miracle-Gro Transactions – Convertible Preferred Stock, Warrants and Other Transactions” to our financial statements.
Intellectual Property Sale Agreement.  Pursuant to the Intellectual Property Sale Agreement, we agreed to sell all intellectual property associated with our hydroponic products (the “Hydroponic IP”), other than the AeroGrow and AeroGarden trademarks, free and clear of all encumbrances, to Scotts Miracle-Gro for $500,000; we also agreed to pay 2% of our revenue to Scotts Miracle-Gro for a defined period.  Scotts Miracle-Gro has the right to use the AeroGrow and AeroGarden trademarks in connection with the sale of products incorporating the Hydroponic IP.
Technology Licensing Agreement.  Under the Technology Licensing Agreement, Scotts Miracle-Gro granted us an exclusive license to use the Hydroponic IP in North America and certain European Countries ( collectively, the “AeroGrow Markets”) in return for a royalty of 2% of annual net sales, as determined at the end of each fiscal year through March 2019. For the first four years of the agreement, we paid the royalty in shares of common stock.  The initial term of the Technology Licensing Agreement was five years, but is renewable for additional five-year terms by providing notice to Scotts Miracle-Gro at least six months in advance of the expiration of each five-year term. As disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 4, 2018, we renewed the Technology Licensing Agreement for an additional five-year term ending in March 2023.
Brand Licensing Agreement.  Under the Brand Licensing Agreement, we may use certain of Scotts Miracle-Gro trade names, trademarks and/or service marks to rebrand the AeroGarden, and, with the written consent of Scotts Miracle-Gro, other products in the AeroGrow Markets in exchange for our payment to Scotts Miracle-Gro of an amount equal to 5% of incremental growth in net sales, as compared to net sales during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013 (“Fiscal 2013”).  The initial term of the Brand Licensing Agreement was five years, but is renewable for additional five-year terms by providing notice to Scotts Miracle-Gro at least six months in advance of the expiration of each five-year term.  As disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 4, 2018, we renewed the Brand Licensing Agreement for an additional five-year term ending in March 2023.
Supply Chain Services Agreement.  Under the Supply Chain Services Agreement, Scotts Miracle-Gro will pay AeroGrow an annual fee equal to 7% of the cost of goods of all products and services requested by Scotts Miracle-Gro during the term of the Technology Licensing Agreement (referenced above), thereby assisting AeroGrow in exploiting the Hydroponic IP internationally (outside of the AeroGrow Markets).
Hydroponics and Aeroponics Industry - Background
 
Hydroponics is the science of growing plants using nutrients suspended in water instead of soil. Used commercially worldwide, hydroponics is considered an advanced and often preferred crop production method. Hydroponics is typically used inside greenhouses to give growers the ability to better regulate and control nutrient delivery, light, air, water, humidity, pests, and temperature. Hydroponic growers benefit by producing crops faster and with higher crop yields per acre than traditional soil-based growers.
 
Aeroponic technology is derived from hydroponics and occurs when plant roots are suspended in an air chamber and bathed with a nutrient solution. We believe that the aeroponic technology used in our indoor gardening products is a technological advance over most hydroponic growing systems because plant roots are partially suspended in air and allowed direct access to oxygen, while being bathed in a highly oxygenated, nutrient rich solution.  For these reasons, we believe the use of a well-designed and maintained aeroponic system can yield increases in growth rates and plant survival when compared to most hydroponic or soil-based systems.
 
Until the development of our indoor gardening products, certain barriers prevented hydroponic or aeroponic technology from being incorporated into mainstream, mass-marketed consumer products, including:
 

● | Consumers generally lack the specialized knowledge required to select, set up, operate, and maintain the various components for a typical hydroponic or aeroponic system, including growing trays, irrigation channels, growing media, nutrient reservoirs, and nutrient delivery systems consisting of electronic timers, pumps, motors, tubing, and nozzles;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 2



● | In the absence of adequate natural light, consumers generally do not possess the specific knowledge required to select, set up, operate, and maintain the varied indoor lighting systems that are necessary to grow plants indoors;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Consumers are often unable to properly mix and measure complex hydroponic nutrient formulas, which change depending on the plant variety and the stage of plant growth;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Consumers are unable to deal with the problem of nutrient spoilage; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Federally mandated water quality reports show that the water in many large cities is not suitable for hydroponic or aeroponic growing and requires treatments in order to sustain growth.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our research leads us to believe that these complexities have been accepted in existing hydroponic market channels because manufacturers have generally focused their product development and marketing efforts on satisfying the needs of the commercial greenhouse and dedicated hobbyist markets. These users are motivated to gain the specialized knowledge, equipment and experience currently required to successfully grow plants with these products.  Our research also indicates that the hydroponic growing equipment currently available in these markets is bulky, expensive and comprised of many, often unintegrated, parts.
 
We believe that the complexities of currently available commercial hydroponic and aeroponic products fail to address the needs and wants of the mass consumer market, leaving that market underserved. We further believe that our patented inventions, companion technologies, and trade secrets have simplified and improved hydroponic and aeroponic technologies and have enabled us to create an indoor hydroponic and aeroponic gardening system appropriate for the mass consumer market.
 
Proprietary Technology and Intellectual Property
 
Since our inception in 2002, we have been innovating, simplifying, and integrating proprietary technologies and inventions into a family of “plug and grow” indoor gardening products and related seed pod kits specifically designed and priced for the mass consumer market. We have used this technology platform to develop eight different models of indoor gardens, each with different features and technology groupings, with list prices ranging from approximately $50 to $700.  Multiple patent applications have been filed in the United States and internationally to protect the inventions that are exclusively used in our indoor garden system and seed pod kits, and seven patents have been issued (four in the United States and three internationally).  We have also obtained access to, both domestically and internationally, trademarks and certain domain names, including AeroGrow.com, AeroGarden.com, AeroGarden.net, AeroGarden.tv, AeroGarden.biz, and Getthegarden.com, among others.
 
Our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our exclusive access to technology and expertise.  While we rely on patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark law to protect the use of such technology, we also believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new product developments, product enhancements, and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position. There can be no assurance, however, that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies.  Each of our employees, independent contractors, interns, and consultants has executed assignment of rights to intellectual property agreements and nondisclosure agreements. The assignment of application rights to intellectual property agreements grant us the right to own inventions and related patents which may be granted in the United States and throughout the world. The nondisclosure agreements generally provide that these people will not disclose our confidential information to any other person without our prior written consent.
 
Following is a description of the proprietary technologies, all of which were sold to Scott Miracle-Gro, and inventions that are exclusively used in our indoor garden system and seed pod kits.
 
Rainforest Nutrient Delivery System. The “rainforest” nutrient delivery system combines technologies with features from several hydroponic and aeroponic methodologies into a proprietary system that leaves plant roots suspended in an air gap.  Plant roots take oxygen directly out of the air and, in testing of aeroponic systems by multiple different sources, including lettuce studies by NASA Small Business Innovation Research, plants grow faster as a result.
Advanced Growing System. The Advanced Growing System (“AGS”) is available on several of our indoor gardens and combines features from the rainforest delivery system with technologies that deliver increased nutrient oxygenation, faster and healthier root growth, decreased consumer maintenance requirements, and increased product reliability.  With AGS, plant roots are suspended in air in a 100% humid aeroponic chamber and then grow into a continuously oxygenated nutrient bath.

Pre-Seeded Bio-Grow Seed Pods. The proprietary bio-grow seed pods include specially selected, pre-implanted seeds, a growing medium, removable bio-dome covers, and a grow basket.
 
Microprocessor-Based Control Panel and Nutrient Cycle Delivery System. The microprocessor-based controls include automated grow lights to ensure that plants receive the proper amount of lighting, and feature nutrient and water reminder systems that alert consumers to add water and nutrients when needed.  In addition, some systems allow consumers to select from multiple plant types (for example, lettuce, herbs, tomatoes, or flowers) and the system then automatically adjusts the nutrient, water and lighting cycles to optimize growth.  In addition, some systems take into account stage of growth of the specific plants when optimizing these factors. Our ULTRA gardens, which were first introduced in Fiscal 2013, include a display screen that walks consumers step-by-step through planting, tending and harvest, and allows for complete customization of all aspects of the grow cycle, including photo period, pump cycle and nutrient cycle.
Custom Nutrients and Automatic pH Adjustment. The patented nutrient solutions have been designed specifically to deliver the proper nutrients to plants, while offering consumers a user-friendly application methodology. Plant specific nutrients are included with each seed pod kit, and consumers simply add them when instructed by the microprocessor-based nutrient reminder. The pre-measured and mixed nutrients eliminate the need for mixing multi-part nutrient formulas and storing various nutrients in separate containers. A proprietary buffer has been formulated and included into the nutrients that automatically adjusts tap water from around the country to the right pH ranges for plant growth.  Without this adjustment, tap water from many areas in the country will severely limit or inhibit plant growth in most aeroponic and hydroponic systems.
Integrated and Automated Lighting System. Hydroponic systems typically do not incorporate built-in lighting systems. Our indoor gardening products include built-in adjustable grow lights with ballast, reflector hood, grow bulbs and an electronic timer. The integrated lighting systems include proprietary high-output compact fluorescent light LED bulbs that deliver a spectrum and intensity of light designed to optimize plant growth without supplemental sunlight needed. In addition, the lighting system is fully automated and controlled by a microprocessor-based control panel described above. Variations in lighting are a differentiator in our product lines, and we have several gardens on the market with “50% more light and twice the height” of our initial gardens, thereby allowing consumers to grow larger plants such as full-sized tomatoes in our indoor gardens, and deliver higher yields.
New Technologies in Development.  We continue to develop improvements in lights, nutrients, oxygenation, seed variety selection, and style and design innovations, each of which are applied to our products on an ongoing basis.
Business Segments
 
We divide our business into the following reportable segments:
 

● | Direct-to-Consumer
--+-------------------


● | Retail
--+-------

 
This division of reportable segments is consistent with how the segments report to and are managed by our Chief Executive Officer (the chief operating decision-maker of the Company). Financial information about these segments for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 is presented in Note 9 - “Segment Information” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The products described throughout this form are not mutually exclusive to a specific segment.  The description of products and processes throughout this form are applicable to both segments.
 
Markets
 
Based on our historical sales and our existing channels of distribution, and supplemented by our own formal and informal market research consisting of individual consumer interviews, focus groups, blog monitoring, customer modeling, and Internet survey responses, we believe that our indoor gardening products appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers across multiple areas of interest.  We believe that our products appeal to at least four major market segments:
Gardener Market. A recent study conducted by the National Gardening Association states that gardening is America’s number one hobby with more than 81 million households active in gardening.  Based upon this survey, there were estimated to be 36 million households participating in food gardening and 13 million households participating in fresh herb gardening.  We believe that our indoor gardening products and related products offer both expert and novice gardeners several major benefits not readily available through traditional gardening methods, including:
 
 4



● | the ability to grow fresh herbs, lettuces, vegetables, tomatoes, and flowers year-round, regardless of indoor light levels or seasonal weather conditions;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the ability to easily start growing plants indoors during colder months and then transplant them outdoors at the onset of the outdoor growing season;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the ability to use stem cuttings to propagate multiple reproductions of the desired plants in our indoor gardening products; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the ease of growing in our indoor gardens, in contrast to the toil associated with traditional gardening, including preparing the soil, planting, thinning, weeding, watering, and removing pests.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“Want-to-be” Gardener Market. We believe that many people have an interest in gardening but lack the knowledge, confidence, available space, equipment, or time to garden. We have observed the following barriers that often prevent people from gardening:

● | gardening requires an ongoing time commitment;
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | apartment, high-rise, and condominium dwellers often lack the land needed for a traditional garden;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | gardening requires physical work, which can be a significant barrier to people with limited mobility or health issues;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | buying the necessary equipment to garden can be expensive; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | gardening requires knowledge and expertise.
--+--------------------------------------------

 
We believe that our indoor gardening products overcome many of these barriers and provide a simple, convenient way for many current non-gardeners to begin to garden.
 
Cooking and Healthy Eating Market. Many customers enjoy cooking as a hobby, including those who:
 

● | are interested in cooking and appreciate the convenience and satisfaction of having a readily available supply of fresh-cut herbs to flavor soups, salads, and other dishes;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | prefer the distinctive texture and taste of freshly picked, vine-ripened tomatoes, basil, lettuces, and other vegetables over days-old supermarket produce; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | are interested in healthy, pesticide-free foods for themselves and their families, reflecting both the rapidly growing interest in naturally and organically grown foods and the increasing number of people who, for health or weight concerns, include salads and fresh vegetables as part of their families’ diets.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe that our indoor gardening products are embraced in this market by people who understand the value of having an ongoing supply of fresh herbs and fresh produce throughout the year.
 
Home and Office Decor Market. Flowers are frequently used to brighten homes and offices worldwide. It is difficult to readily grow flowers indoors due to a lack of sufficient light and growing knowledge. As a result, people often use cut flowers, which are expensive, short-lived, and require ongoing maintenance. Our indoor gardening products enable colorful and fragrant flowers to be easily grown indoors year round and at a lower cost. Flowers grown with our indoor gardening products will last for months with minimal care and maintenance. Flowers can be grown in a wide variety of indoor locations, including kitchen and bathroom countertops, living rooms, bedrooms, family rooms, offices, work stations, waiting rooms, and lobbies.
Products
 
AeroGarden Indoor Gardens.  We offer eight different indoor garden models with list prices ranging from approximately $50 to $700 and differentiated based on size, design, light intensity, degree of automation, inclusion of Adaptive Growth Technology or Advanced Growing Systems, height potential of light hoods, and inclusion of plant support systems.

Other Accessories.  To complement and expand the functionality of our indoor gardening products, we have developed a variety of accessory products.
 
Future Products.  The core technology platform can be leveraged by bundling different components into new products with a wide variety of features and price points that then can be sold through a variety of direct and retail channels for use in different settings around the home or office.  Examples include significantly larger, modular gardens, and less expensive, more decorative gardens.
Integrated Marketing and Sales Channel Strategy
 
We consider our products to be an entirely new product category and our primary objective has been to maximize the exposure of the product and educate consumers on the benefits of indoor gardening through an integrated marketing and distribution strategy.  We launched our products in 2006 with a nationwide public relations campaign, and received extensive media exposure, with multiple features on national talk shows as well as local television coverage, local and national print articles and blog and Internet pieces.  We combined the public relations launch with a retail and direct-to-consumer strategy focusing on high visibility partners and media, including product sales through retailers, national cataloguers, home shopping channels, direct television commercials, our own in-house catalogues, internet sales, and inbound and outbound telemarketing. 
 
Channel/Consumer Strategy.  As of March 31, 2019, our products were offered in approximately 2,400 storefronts in North America, as well as through select online retailers such as Amazon.com, bedbathandbeyond.com and Kohls.com. We plan to expand and revise our retail presence during the coming fiscal year as our trials with specific retailers and brick and mortar stores are revised and examined.
 
Direct-to-Consumer Sales.  In 2007, we began mailing our own in-house, direct mail product catalogue, which tested successfully with a mailing of approximately 60,000 catalogues.  In Fiscal 2019, we mailed approximately 200,000 catalogues.  With our catalogue sales we focus on remarketing to current customers and also prospecting for new customers using database marketing techniques.
 
We established our first consumer product website in the fall of 2006 and supplemented this website in late 2007 with search engine advertising, banner advertising, email campaigns and web affiliate programs.  In the fall of 2008 we took on in-house management of many of these programs from third-party providers and have seen resulting increases in efficiency.
 
A key focus of our web and catalogue marketing is to maximize the lifetime value of AeroGrow customers through repeat sales of our seed pod kits, light bulbs and accessories. During Fiscal 2019, direct-to-consumer sales represented 23.5% of our total net sales.
 
Retail Sales.  Initial shipments to retailers commenced in March 2006.  Over the next several years, we rapidly grew our retail distribution and as of March 31, 2009 our products were being sold through approximately 7,500 stores in North America.  We then began to reduce our sales to retailers (as discussed above) and as of March 31, 2013 our products were only sold through 72 stores in North America.  Since March 31, 2013, we have renewed our focus on reaching the end-consumer through select retail markets and increased our visibility in stores.  In Fiscal 2019, our products were sold in approximately 2,400 stores and sales to retailers represented 72.4% of our total net sales.
 
During Fiscal 2019, sales to Amazon.com, Inc. represented approximately 55.9% of our retailer sales and approximately 40.5% of our total sales. As we continue our expansion of our retail sales efforts during the coming fiscal year, we expect to continue our sales with strong retailers as a result of our strategic alliance with Scotts Miracle-Gro. For further information on the strategic alliance with Scotts Miracle-Gro, please see Note 3 “Scotts Miracle-Gro Transactions – Convertible Preferred Stock, Warrants and Other Transactions” to our financial statements.

International Sales.   In Fiscal 2019, international sales have been conducted through third-party distributors but we have begun to focus efforts on new retailers such as Amazon.co.uk, Amazon Spain, Amazon Germany, Amazon France and Amazon Italy.  During Fiscal 2019, international sales represented 4.1% of our total net sales, as we continued to expand into Europe, including the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Spain and France.
Competition
 
Aeroponic and hydroponic technologies have historically been limited to ardent hobbyists and commercial growing facilities.  We believe that we are the first company to develop and offer a simple dirt-free indoor growing system for the mass consumer market.
 
Typical hydroponic manufacturers offer a range of equipment and accessories through distributors or small independent “hydro-shops” in a trade-oriented manner similar to plumbing or electrical suppliers. Purchasers typically mix and match equipment from various suppliers in an “a la carte” fashion to individually customize a large system that they then assemble on their premises.  We believe that these products are substantially more expensive than our products.
 
We believe that our simplified and complete indoor gardening products and current and planned methods of distribution offer significant benefits from these traditional hydroponic industry practices.  To date, we have discovered a few kitchen design firms that have tried to introduce an indoor growing system into the market, but we do not believe they have a significant presence in the market.  In our laboratory tests, these systems have performed at levels far below our own systems in terms of germination success, longevity, speed-of-growth and overall yields.  However, we recognize that there are other companies that are better funded and have greater experience in producing hydroponic products in commercial markets, or that have been more successful in manufacturing or selling consumer products or soil-based gardening products.
 
Manufacturing and Operations
 
We source our AeroGarden products and accessory items from contract manufacturing companies that manufacture products using tooling we own, in accordance with our specifications, and subject to our intellectual property rights provided by the Technology Licensing Agreement with Scotts Miracle-Gro.  We have four Chinese manufacturers of our garden products.  Several are capable of manufacturing multiple garden models.  We believe the existing production capacity of these manufacturers is more than sufficient to meet our garden requirements for the short-to-medium term.  In addition, capacity expansion is available in a reasonable period of time with a nominal tooling investment.  We also try to have multiple, dual-sourced manufacturers of our many component parts and accessories.  Indoor gardening products are shipped from China to the third-party fulfillment center in Missouri, as well as to third-party distribution facilities in countries outside North America.

To date, product returns have been within our expectations for both retail and direct-to-consumer sales.  At retail, we generally use a “destroy in field” methodology as the cost of shipping a used product back to us often does not justify the value of the recovered unit.  We record warranty liabilities at the time of sale for the estimated costs that may be incurred under our basic warranty program. The specific warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold, but generally include technical support, repair parts, and labor for periods up to one year.  Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units currently under warranty, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims on those units, and cost per claim to satisfy our warranty obligation.
Governmental Regulation and Certification
 
We believe that we are in compliance with regulations in the United States and Canada concerning the shipping and labeling of seeds and nutrients. Currently, the components for the indoor garden system are Electrical Testing Laboratories “ETL” certified. These certifications confirm that the products have been tested and conform to a recognized level of fire and other safety standards for consumers. Such independent third-party certification is required for sales of products through many major retailers.
 
We believe that our costs of compliance with environmental laws will not be material.
 
Personnel
 
As of March 31, 2019, AeroGrow employed 40 full-time employees.  In addition, we contract the services of part-time and project consultants on an “as needed” basis.  We believe that our employee relations are good.  Historically, our outsourced business also included manufacturing, telemarketing, infomercial production, fulfillment and shipping.   Additional employees and/or consultants may be hired in the future as our operations merit.
