 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 History and Organization
 We are a mining and minerals production and exploration company focused on precious and base metals in Argentina, Mexico, Canada and the United States. On January 24, 2012, we changed our name from US Gold Corporation to McEwen Mining Inc. after the completion of the acquisition of Minera Andes Inc. (“Minera Andes”) by way of a statutory plan of arrangement under the laws of the Province of Alberta, Canada.
 In 2017, we completed two acquisitions that established our operations in Canada.  On April 26, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Lexam VG Gold Inc. (“Lexam”) pursuant to a statutory Plan of Arrangement under Ontario law and Lexam became a wholly-owned subsidiary of our company. Lexam controls a cluster of four past-producing gold properties located in the Timmins district of northern Ontario, Canada, which we believe have the potential for both open-pit and underground mining.
 On October 3, 2017, we completed the acquisition of additional mining assets located in the Timmins district of Ontario.  In a transaction with Primero Mining Corp., we acquired the Black Fox Complex, an operating underground precious metal mine, associated mining claims and equipment, the Black Fox-Stock Mill, and the Grey Fox and Froome projects, advanced-stage properties located near the Black Fox Complex.  
 Following the acquisitions in 2017, we own 100% of the El Gallo 1 mine in the state of Sinaloa, Mexico, 100% of the Black Fox Complex in Timmins, Ontario, Canada, and a 49% interest in Minera Santa Cruz S.A. (“MSC”), the owner and operator of the producing San José mine in the province of Santa Cruz, Argentina, which is controlled by the majority owner of the joint venture, Hochschild Mining plc (“Hochschild”). In addition to our operating properties, we also hold interests in advanced stage and exploration stage properties and projects in Argentina, Mexico, Timmins, and the United States, including the Gold Bar (“Gold Bar”) and Los Azules (“Los Azules”) projects.
 Our objective is to increase the value of our shares through the exploration and extraction of gold, silver and other valuable minerals. Other than the San José mine in Argentina, we generally conduct our activities as the sole operator, but we may enter into arrangements with other companies through joint venture or similar agreements in an effort to achieve our strategic objectives. We hold our mineral interests and property and operate our business through various subsidiary companies, and except for MSC, each of which is owned entirely, directly, or indirectly, by us.
 Our principal executive office is located at 150 King Street West, Suite 2800, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5H 1J9 and our telephone number is (866) 441-0690. We also maintain offices in San Juan, Argentina; Guamuchil, Mexico, Elko, Nevada (U.S.), and Matheson, Canada. Our website is www.mcewenmining.com. We make available our periodic reports and news releases and certain of our corporate governance documents, including our Code of Ethics, on our website. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) and on the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) under the symbol “MUX”.

      Products
     The end product at our gold and silver operations is either in the form of doré or concentrate. Doré is an alloy consisting primarily of gold and silver but also containing other impurity metals. Doré is sent to refiners to produce bullion that meets the required market standard of 99.95% gold and 99.9% silver. Ore concentrate, or simply concentrate, is raw ore that has been ground finely to a powdery product from which gangue (waste) is removed, thus concentrating the metal component. Slag and fine carbon are by-products of the gold production process left over after gold and silver have been separated which are sent to smelters for further recovery of metals.
     Production from the El Gallo 1 mine consists of approximately 98% doré and 2% slag and fine carbon, whereas 100% of gold and silver production at the Black Fox mine is doré. Production from the San José mine consists of approximately 48% doré and 52% concentrate.  
     During 2017, we reported the following consolidated production attributable to us:

 | Gold | Silver | Gold equivalent
Consolidated Production | ounces | ounces | ounces(1) 
El Gallo 1 mine | 46,446 | 18,586 | 46,694 
Black Fox Complex(2) | 14,268 | 804 | 14,279 
San José mine (on 49% basis) | 49,232 | 3,159,352 | 91,357 
Total Production | 109,946 | 3,178,742 | 152,330 


(1) | Calculated using silver to gold ratio of 75:1
----+----------------------------------------------


(2) | The Black Fox Complex was acquired effective October 3, 2017, so the figures represent a partial year of production.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Gold and silver bullion obtained from the doré produced in Mexico and Canada is sold at the prevailing spot market price. Gold and silver doré produced from the San José mine is sold at the prevailing spot market price based on the London fix. Concentrates are provisionally priced, whereby the selling price is subject to final adjustments at the end of a period ranging from 30 to 90 days after delivery to the customer. The final price is based on the market price at the relevant quotation point stipulated in the contract. Due to the time elapsed between shipment and the final settlement with the buyer, MSC must estimate the prices at which sales of metals will be settled. At the end of each financial reporting period, previously recorded provisional sales are adjusted to estimated settlement metals prices based on relevant forward market prices until final settlement with the buyer.
 During 2017, total gold and silver sales were $55.8 million for the El Gallo 1 mine, $11.6 million for the Black Fox mine, and $227.1 million for the San José mine on a 100% basis.  Since we account for the San José mine using the equity method of accounting, we do not include revenue from the San José mine in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information regarding production and operating results for our properties, and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Investments, for additional information regarding the equity method of accounting.

 Like all metal producers, our operations are affected by fluctuations in metal prices. The following table presents the annual high, low and average daily London P.M. Fix prices per ounce for gold and London Fix prices per ounce for silver over the past three years and 2018 to the most recent practical date on the London Bullion Market:

 | Gold | | Silver | 
Year | High | | Low | | Average | High | | Low | | Average
 | (in dollars per ounce) | 
2015 | $ | 1,296 | | $ | 1,049 | $ | 1,160 | | $ | 18.23 | $ | 13.71 | $ | 15.68
2016 | | 1,366 | | | 1,077 | | 1,251 | | | 20.71 | | 13.58 | | 17.14
2017 | | 1,346 | | | 1,151 | | 1,257 | | | 18.56 | | 15.22 | | 17.05
2018 (through February 16, 2018) | | 1,355 | | | 1,311 | | 1,332 | | | 17.52 | | 16.35 | | 17.01

      On February 16, 2018 the London P.M. Fix for gold was $1,352 per ounce, whereas the London Fix for silver was $16.84 per ounce.
 Gold and Silver Processing Methods
 Gold and silver are extracted from mineralized material by either milling or heap leaching depending on, among other things, the amount of gold and silver contained in the material, whether the material is naturally oxidized or not, the amenability of the material to treatment. At the El Gallo 1 mine, mineralized material is processed using heap leaching methods. Heap leaching consists of stacking crushed, oxidized material on impermeable pads, where a weak cyanide solution is applied to the surface of the heap to leach the gold and silver. The gold and silver‑bearing solution is then collected and processed into gold and silver into doré bars. Doré bars are then shipped from the mine to a third party refiner to obtain bullion.
 At Black Fox, ore mined is initially crushed on-site, transported to the Black Fox mill site and fed to the mill’s crushing circuit.  Following processing and refining, the mill produces doré bars. Doré bars are then shipped from the mine to a third party refiner to obtain bullion.
 The processing plant at the San José mine is composed of conventional crushing, grinding and flotation circuits. Approximately half of the silver‑gold flotation concentrate is subsequently processed in an intensive cyanide leaching circuit with the dissolved gold and silver recovered by electro-winning of a clarified solution followed by smelting to produce doré. The doré is then sent to refiners to obtain bullion. The balance of the flotation concentrate is filtered and shipped to a smelter for further processing. 
 Hedging Activities
 Our strategy is to provide shareholders with exposure to gold and silver prices by selling our gold and silver ounces at spot market prices and consequently, we do not hedge our gold or silver sales. We may, however, from time to time, manage certain risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currencies using the derivatives market.  Gold and Silver Reserves
 We have established gold and silver reserves at three of our properties, including San Jose, Black Fox and Gold Bar.  The portion of Proven and Probable gold and silver Reserves attributable to us for San Jose and Gold Bar as of December 31, 2017, is presented in Item 2. Properties.   Competitive Business Conditions
 We compete with many companies in the mining and mineral exploration and production industry, including large, established mining companies with substantial capabilities, personnel, and financial resources. There is a limited supply of desirable mineral lands available for claim‑staking, lease, or acquisition in Mexico, Argentina, Canada, or the United States, and other areas where we may conduct our mining or exploration activities. We may be at a competitive disadvantage in acquiring mineral properties, since we compete with these individuals and companies, many of which have greater financial resources and larger technical staffs than we do. From time to time, specific properties or areas which would otherwise be attractive to us for exploration or acquisition may be unavailable due to their previous acquisition by other companies or our lack of financial resources.

 Competition in the industry is not limited to the acquisition of mineral properties, but also extends to the technical expertise to find, advance, and operate such properties; the labor to operate the properties; and the capital for the purpose of funding such exploration and development. Many competitors not only explore for and mine precious and base metals, but conduct refining and marketing operations on a world‑wide basis. Such competition may result in not only our company being unable to acquire desired properties, but to recruit or retain qualified employees or to acquire the capital necessary to fund our operation and advance our properties. Our inability to compete with other companies for these resources would have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, financial condition and cash flows.
 General Government Regulations
 In Mexico, Argentina, Canada and the United States, we are subject to various governmental laws and regulations, including environmental regulations. Other than operating licenses for our mining and processing facilities and concessions granted under contracts with the host government, there are no third party patents, licenses or franchises material to our business.  The applicable laws and regulations applicable to us include:
· | mineral concession rights;
--+---------------------------


· | surface rights;
--+----------------


· | water rights;
--+--------------


· | mining royalties;
--+------------------


· | environmental laws; and
--+------------------------


· | mining permits.
--+----------------

  We believe that all of our properties are operated in compliance with all applicable governmental laws and regulations.
 Customers
 Production from the El Gallo 1 and Black Fox mines is sold as refined metal on the spot market or doré under the terms set out in a doré purchase agreement between us and the Bank of Nova Scotia (“Scotia”), a Canadian financial institution.  Under the terms of that agreement, dated July 2012, we have the option to sell approximately 90% of the gold and silver contained in doré bars produced at the El Gallo 1 and Black Fox mines prior to the completion of refining by the third party refiner, which normally takes approximately 10 to 15 business days.  During the year ended December 31, 2017, 98% and 98% of the sales made by El Gallo 1 mine and Black Fox mine were to Scotia, respectively, with no sales made through the doré purchase agreement. We also have an agreement to sell refined metal to a second Canadian financial institution.
 During the year ended December 31, 2017, 74% of total sales from the San José mine were made to Republic Metals Corporation, Argo-Heraeus and LS Nikko Copper Inc. Republic Metals, a Florida corporation, is a purchaser of doré and accounted for 39% of that amount. Argo-Heraeus, a Swiss company, is a purchaser of doré, which accounted for 29% of such amount. LS Nikko Copper Inc., a South Korean company, is a purchaser of concentrate, which accounted for 32% of that amount. MSC has sales agreements with each of these purchasers. 
 In the event that our relationship with Scotia or MSC’s relationship with Republic Metals, Argo-Heraeus or LS Nikko Copper Inc. were interrupted for any reason, we believe that we or MSC could locate other purchasers for our products. However, any interruption would temporarily disrupt the sale of our products and could adversely affect our operating results. 
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 535 employees including 245 employees based in Mexico, 6 in Argentina, 20 in the United States, 24 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and 240 in Timmins, Ontario, Canada. All our employees based in Toronto work in an executive, technical or administrative position, while our employees in Mexico, Argentina, the United States, and Timmins include laborers, craftsmen, mining, geology and permitting specialists, information technologists, and various other support roles.

 Some of our employees in Mexico are covered by union labor contracts and we believe we have good relations with our employees and their unions. We also frequently engage independent contractors in connection with certain administrative matters and the exploration of our properties, such as drillers, geophysicists, geologists, and other specialty technical disciplines.  As of December 31, 2017, MSC had 1,156 employees in Argentina.
