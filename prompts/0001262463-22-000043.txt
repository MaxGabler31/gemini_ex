Competition
 
The Company operates in a dynamic and competitive market. Other national and regional food distribution companies, along with non-traditional competitors, such as mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, and online retailers, represent a competitive risk to the Company’s ability to attract customers and operate profitably. The businesses the Company considers to be its main competitors are Loblaw Companies Limited, Sobeys Inc., Metro Inc. and Walmart Inc.
 
The Company will experience competition from other local grocery businesses and established chains, including well-capitalized chains or franchisors who have liquid capital available for expansion, that can utilize their existing operations as well as their financial, technological, marketing and personnel resources and high brand name recognition and awareness.
 
The Company’s indirect competition comes from other businesses in the supermarkets and grocery stores industry, and those that specialize in groceries and those that do not. The Company’s direct competitors include other grocery stores, quick service pickup and delivery grocery businesses in the associated area. Additionally, sales of groceries at other Canadian grocery stores may significantly impact the sales from the Company’s business.
