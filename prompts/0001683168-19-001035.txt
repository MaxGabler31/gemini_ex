Market Overview
 
Domestic Markets
 Through the member based distribution network, the Company has access to the major markets in Jining City area and most other cities in the Shandong province.
International Market
 Currently, international markets show an interest in Chinese herb medicine. For instance, European and US companies in the food industry use advanced technology to extract ginkgo biloba, then add it in gum, chocolate, and other health foods. The Company focuses on product diversification and innovation. It plans to sell its produces in well-known retail stores in Europe and US, such as Walmart.
Market Opportunity
 
Consumers are increasingly concerned about their own health. The spending on health-related products has increased year by year, and the demand for nutrition and health food is high. According to the international standard classification, medicine and health care is one of the world's fastest growing trade sectors. Sales of health food is currently experiencing a rapid annual growth.
 
In China, the health products market is expanding along with the growth of economy and acceleration of aged population. People used to see health products as optional. Now they are necessities of daily life. The sixty and older group is expected to keep growing fast. The elderly group tends to draw attention to nutrition and health product, which will boost the development of the health market. In addition, young people are beginning to pay more attention to their heath, and health food and products are the new powerful impetus. Therefore, the Company believes it will be able to take advantage of this increased demand.
 
Competition
 
At present, Chinese health food manufacturers are mainly concentrated in Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Ningxia and a few other regions. Although in recent years, the health and production conditions of the eastern coastal areas have been improved to some extent. Overall, China’s nutrition and health food businesses are small scale, use outdated technology, and lack brand recognition.
Intellectual Property
 
Confucian is actively planning research and development activities in order to patent these products.
 
Government Regulation
 
The great social demand of nutrition and health care products has led to a policy of governmental support. In December 2011, the Nutrient agency released “125 Development Plan for Food Industry”, in which nutrition and health care products manufacturing was first listed as the most important development within the industry. In addition, “the opinions of State Council on Promoting Health Development of Service Industry” published in 2013, “Notice on Promoting Health and Pension Services” published in 2014, and “Chinese Food and Nutrition Development Program” published in 2014 all had positive effects on the development of health products industry.
