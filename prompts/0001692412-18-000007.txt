Item 1. Business.
Overview 
We are a leading owner, operator, manager and developer of all-inclusive resorts in prime beachfront locations in popular vacation destinations in Mexico and the Caribbean. As of December 31, 2017, we owned a portfolio consisting of 13 resorts (6,130 rooms) located in Mexico, the Dominican Republic and Jamaica and managed one resort (184 rooms) owned by a third party, located in the Dominican Republic. We believe that the resorts we own, as well as the resort we manage, are among the finest all-inclusive resorts in the markets they serve. All of our resorts offer guests luxury accommodations, noteworthy architecture, extensive on-site activities and multiple food and beverage options. Our guests also have the opportunity to purchase upgrades from us such as premium rooms, dining experiences, wines and spirits and spa packages.  
We believe that our resorts have a competitive advantage due to their location, extensive amenities, scale and guest-friendly design. Our portfolio is comprised of all-inclusive resorts that share the following characteristics: (i) prime beachfront locations; (ii) convenient air access from a number of North American and other international gateway markets; (iii) strategic locations in popular vacation destinations in countries with strong government commitments to tourism; (iv) high quality physical condition; and (v) capacity for further revenues and earnings growth through incremental renovation or repositioning opportunities. 
We focus on the all-inclusive resort business because we believe it is a rapidly growing segment of the lodging industry that provides its guests with compelling opportunities. Our all-inclusive resorts provide guests with an attractive vacation experience that offers value and a high degree of cost certainty, as compared to traditional resorts, where the costs of discretionary food and beverage services and other amenities can be unpredictable and significant. We believe that the all-inclusive model provides more predictable revenue, expenses and occupancy rates as compared to other lodging industry business models because, among other reasons, guests at all-inclusive resorts often book and pay for their stays further in advance than guests at traditional resorts. Since stays are generally booked and paid for in advance, customers are less likely to cancel, which allows us to manage on-site expenses and protect operating margins accordingly. These characteristics of the all-inclusive model allow us to more accurately adjust certain operating costs in light of expected demand, as compared to other lodging industry business models. We also have the opportunity to generate incremental revenue by offering upgrades, premium services and amenities not included in the all-inclusive package. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 58.8% of our guests came from the United States. We believe that guests from the United States purchase upgrades, premium services and amenities that are not included in the all-inclusive package more frequently than guests from other markets. 
Our portfolio consists of resorts marketed under a number of different all-inclusive brands. Hyatt Ziva, Panama Jack and Dreams are all-ages brands. Sanctuary, Hyatt Zilara, THE Royal and Secrets are adults-only brands. We entered into an exclusive agreement with Panama Jack that provides us with the right to develop and own, and/or manage all-inclusive resorts under the Panama Jack brand in certain regions. We rebranded two of our resorts under the Panama Jack brand. We believe that these brands enable us to differentiate our resorts and attract a loyal guest base.
We have a strategic relationship with Hyatt, a global lodging company with widely recognized brands, pursuant to which we jointly developed the standards for the operation of the all-ages Hyatt Ziva and adults-only Hyatt Zilara brands (the "Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort Brands"). Playa currently is the only Hyatt-approved operator of the Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort Brands and we have rebranded five of our resorts under the Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort Brands since 2013. Pursuant to the Hyatt Strategic Alliance Agreement, as amended by the First Amendment to the Hyatt Strategic Alliance Agreement (the “Hyatt Strategic Alliance Agreement”), Playa and Hyatt have provided each other a right of first offer through December 31, 2021 with respect to any proposed offer or arrangement to acquire the rights to own and operate an all-inclusive hotel property at the level of quality and service consistent with the Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort Brands (a "Hyatt All-Inclusive Opportunity") in Mexico, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Panama (the "Market Area"). Specifically, if we intend to accept a Hyatt All-Inclusive Opportunity in the Market Area (and if Hyatt exercises the right of first offer), we must negotiate in good faith with Hyatt the terms of franchise agreement and related documents with respect to such property, provided that we acquire such property on terms acceptable to us within 60 days of offering such opportunity to Hyatt, and if Hyatt intends to accept a Hyatt All-Inclusive Opportunity in the Market Area (and if we exercise the right of first offer), Hyatt must negotiate in good faith with us the terms of a management agreement and other documents under which we would manage the resort (subject to a franchise agreement between Hyatt and the affiliate of Hyatt that would own such property), provided that Hyatt acquires such property on terms acceptable to it within 60 days of offering such opportunity to us. The Hyatt Strategic Alliance Agreement also provides that if either party is approached by a third party with respect to the management or franchising of an all-inclusive resort in the Market Area, and such third party has not identified a manager or franchisor for the resort, the parties will notify each other and provide an introduction to the third party for the purposes of negotiating a management agreement or a franchise agreement, as the case may be.

6

In addition to creating potential future opportunities to expand our business, we believe that our strategic relationship with Hyatt will further establish Playa as a leader in the all-inclusive resort business by providing its Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort Brand resorts access to Hyatt’s distribution channels and guest base that includes leisure travelers. We believe that our strategic relationship with Hyatt and the increasing awareness of our all-inclusive resort brands among potential guests will enable us to increase the number of bookings made through lower cost sales channels, such as direct bookings through Hyatt, with respect to our Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort Brand resorts, and our company and resort websites. For the year ended December 31, 2017, 30.6% of the bookings at our Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort Brand resorts came from direct, group and World of Hyatt (previously Hyatt Gold Passport®) sources, as compared to 12.5% of the bookings at our other resorts. Direct and group bookings from all of our resorts totaled 19.4%.
We consider each one of our hotels to be an operating segment, none of which meets the threshold for a reportable segment. For further discussion about our operating segments and financial information about the geographic regions in which we operate, please see Note 17 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
Recent Developments - Sagicor Contribution
On February 26, 2018, we entered into a Share Exchange Implementation Agreement (the “Contribution Agreement”) with certain companies affiliated with the Sagicor Group (collectively, the “Sagicor Parties”). The Contribution Agreement provides that, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary and other closing conditions, the Sagicor Parties will contribute to a subsidiary of our Company a portfolio of all-inclusive resorts in Jamaica, two adjacent developable land sites and a management contract for an all-inclusive resort (the “Sagicor Assets”) in exchange for consideration consisting of, subject to adjustment pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, 20 million of our ordinary shares and $100.0 million in cash (such transaction, the “Sagicor Contribution”). 
The Sagicor Assets consist of the following:

• | The Hilton Rose Hall Resort (currently 489 rooms);


• | The Jewel Runaway Bay Resort (currently 268 rooms);


• | The Jewel Dunn’s River Resort (currently 250 rooms);


• | The Jewel Paradise Cove Resort (currently 225 rooms);


• | The 88 units comprising one of the towers in the multi-tower condominium currently at Jewel Grande Resort;


• | A developable land site adjacent to The Jewel Grande Resort;


• | A developable land site adjacent to The Hilton Rose Hall Resort;


• | The management contract for a portion of the units owned by the Sagicor Parties at the Jewel Grande Resort; and


• | All rights to "The Jewel" hotel brand.

Our obligation to close the Sagicor Contribution is subject to us entering into a franchise agreement, relating to the Hilton Rose Hall Resort, with Hilton Worldwide Franchising LP on terms and conditions acceptable to us in our sole discretion. Each party’s obligation to close the Sagicor Contribution is subject to certain other conditions provided in the Contribution Agreement. The closing of the Sagicor Contribution is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2018.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe the following competitive strengths distinguish us from other owners, operators, developers and acquirers of all-inclusive resorts:

• | Premier Collection of All-Inclusive Resorts in Highly Desirable Locations. We believe that our portfolio represents a premier collection of all-inclusive resorts. Our resorts, a number of which have received public recognitions for excellence, are located in prime beachfront locations in popular vacation destinations, including Cancún, Playa del Carmen, Puerto Vallarta and Los Cabos in Mexico, Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic and Montego Bay in Jamaica. Guests may conveniently access our resorts from a number of North American and other international gateway markets.


• | Well-Maintained Portfolio with Significant Embedded Growth Opportunities. Our portfolio has been well-maintained and, in some cases, recently renovated and is in excellent physical condition. Since January 2014, we have made development capital improvements at seven of our resorts, including the addition of 350 rooms, of $258.9 million, or

7

approximately $82,300 per room. We believe there are other significant opportunities within our current portfolio and the Sagicor Assets to increase revenue and Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) through expansions, renovations, repositionings and rebrandings of certain of our resorts. By redeveloping and rebranding our properties and offering additional amenities to our guests, we believe we can increase both occupancy and Net Package ADR (as defined in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) at these properties in order to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns on our invested capital. For example, in late 2014, we completed the process of expanding, renovating, repositioning and rebranding our Jamaica resort, which was formerly operated as a Ritz-Carlton hotel by the previous owner. The property was rebranded under both the all-ages Hyatt Ziva brand and the adults-only Hyatt Zilara brand. We further renovated this property in 2017 by remodeling 334 remaining original rooms and building a beach spa and a fitness center, among other improvements. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our Hyatt Ziva and Hyatt Zilara Rose Hall resort in Jamaica generated Adjusted EBITDA of $16.0 million, as compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, in late 2015, we completed the expansion and renovation of the resort formerly known as Dreams Cancún, and we rebranded it as Hyatt Ziva Cancún. We also renovated the resort formerly known as Dreams Puerto Vallarta, and rebranded it as Hyatt Ziva Puerto Vallarta. In conjunction with these two rebrandings, we also internalized management and eliminated the management fees that we previously paid to a third-party manager with respect to these resorts. While all three rebranded resorts generated a combined Total Net Revenue (as defined in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) growth of 22.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the corresponding 2016 period, we believe these resorts are still in their ramp-up phase and there is room for future growth in their operational results. We believe that these initiatives, which favorably impacted revenue in 2017 and 2016, will be significant drivers of future growth. We also believe that we can generate earnings growth by potentially internalizing, over time, resort management functions at the five resorts in our portfolio that we currently do not manage. In December 2017, we completed the renovation and repositioning of two of our hotels that were formerly known as Gran Caribe and Gran Porto under the Panama Jack hotel brand. We may also seek additional growth at these and other resorts through targeted, smaller investments where we believe we can achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns on our invested capital.

• | First Mover Advantage in a Highly Fragmented Industry. As exemplified by the recently announced Sagicor Contribution, we believe that we are well-positioned to pursue acquisitions in the all-inclusive segment of the lodging industry and further establish ourselves as a leading owner and operator of all-inclusive resorts. The all-inclusive resort segment is highly fragmented and includes numerous resorts owned and managed by smaller operators who often lack capital resources to maintain their competitive position. We believe that our management team’s experience with executing and integrating resort acquisitions, track record of renovating, repositioning and rebranding resorts, and relationships with premier all-inclusive resort brands, together with our developed and scalable resort management platform and strong brands, position us to grow our portfolio of all-inclusive resorts through targeted acquisitions. We believe that our ability to offer potential resort sellers the option of receiving our publicly-traded securities (instead of or in combination with cash) may provide us a competitive advantage over private buyers, as such securities can provide sellers potential appreciation from an investment in a diversified portfolio of assets. Our senior management team’s proven track record of sourcing and executing complex acquisitions has helped establish an international network of resort industry owners, including resort owners, financiers, operators, project managers and contractors. For example, our August 2013 acquisition of Real Resorts included the purchase of four resorts located in Cancún with a total of 1,577 rooms and a resort management company for consideration consisting of cash, debt and our preferred shares.


• | Exclusive Focus on the All-Inclusive Model. We believe the all-inclusive resort model is increasing in popularity as more people come to appreciate the benefits of a vacation experience that couples value and a high degree of cost certainty without sacrificing quality. We also believe that the all-inclusive model provides us with advantages over other lodging business models through relatively higher occupancy predictability and stability, and the ability to more accurately forecast resort utilization levels, which allows us to adjust certain operating costs in pursuit of both guest satisfaction and more efficient operations. Because our guests have pre-purchased their vacation packages, we also have the opportunity to earn incremental revenue if our guests purchase upgrades, premium services and amenities that are not included in the all-inclusive package. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated $78.2 million of this incremental revenue, representing an increase of 10.8% over the comparable period in the prior year.


• | Integrated and Scalable Operating Platform. We believe we have developed a scalable resort management platform designed to improve operating efficiency at the nine resorts we currently manage and enable us to potentially internalize the management of additional resorts we own or may acquire, as well as to proficiently manage hotels owned by third parties. Our integrated platform enables managers of each of our key functions, including sales, marketing and resort management, to observe, analyze, share and respond to trends throughout our portfolio. As a result, we are able to implement management initiatives on a real-time and portfolio-wide basis. Our resort management platform is scalable

8

and designed to allow us to efficiently and effectively operate a robust and diverse portfolio of all-inclusive resorts, including resorts owned by us, resorts we may acquire and resorts owned by third parties that we may manage for a fee in the future without the need to incur significant capital expenditures to enhance our management platform. In regards to the anticipated Sagicor Contribution, Playa will use its existing operating platform to create significant operational synergies at the acquired properties including: preferred rates with online travel agencies and tour operators, purchasing and centralized services synergies and cost synergies by integrating several functions, including accounting, marketing, legal, procurement and insurance. Playa’s historical track record, management expertise, strong regional presence, long-term customer relationships and powerful brands will contribute to significantly improving the Sagicor portfolio’s performance.

• | Strategic Relationship with Hyatt to Develop All-Inclusive Resorts. Our strategic relationship with Hyatt, which indirectly beneficially owned approximately 10.8% of our ordinary shares as of December 31, 2017, provides us with a range of benefits, including the right to operate certain of our existing resorts under the Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort Brands in certain countries and, through December 31, 2021, certain rights with respect to the development and management of future Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort Brands resorts in the Market Area. The Hyatt Ziva brand is marketed as an all-inclusive resort brand for all-ages and the Hyatt Zilara brand is marketed as an all-inclusive resort brand for adults-only. We believe these brands are currently Hyatt’s primary vehicle for all-inclusive resort growth and demonstrate Hyatt’s commitment to the all-inclusive model. We also have, with respect to our Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort Brand resorts, access to Hyatt’s low cost and high margin distribution channels, such as Hyatt guests using the World of Hyatt guest loyalty program (which had in excess of ten million members as of December 31, 2017), Hyatt’s reservation system and website and Hyatt’s extensive group sales business. We believe that our strategic relationship with Hyatt and the increasing awareness of our all-inclusive resort brands among potential guests will enable us to increase the number of bookings made through lower cost sales channels, such as direct bookings through Hyatt, with respect to our Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort Brand resorts, and our company and resort websites.


• | Experienced Leadership with a Proven Track Record. Our senior management team has an average of 30 years of experience in the lodging industry, including significant experience with all-inclusive resorts.


– | Mr. Wardinski, our Chief Executive Officer and beneficial owner of approximately 2.3% of our ordinary shares, founded our prior parent and previously was the Chief Executive Officer of two lodging companies: Barceló Crestline Corporation (“Barceló Crestline”), an independent hotel owner, lessee and manager; and Crestline Capital Corporation (New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”): CLJ), a then- NYSE-listed hotel owner, lessee and manager. Mr. Wardinski was also the non-executive chairman of the board of directors of Highland Hospitality Corporation, a then-NYSE-listed owner of upscale full- service, premium limited-service and extended-stay properties. Mr. Wardinski held other leadership roles within the industry including Senior Vice President and Treasurer of Host Marriott Corporation (now Host Hotels and Resorts (NYSE: HST)), and various roles with Marriott International, Inc. (“Marriott International”).


– | Mr. Stadlin, our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Executive Officer of our resort management company, was employed by Marriott International for 33 years and spent 12 years working on Marriott International’s expansion into Latin America.


– | Mr. Froemming, our Chief Marketing Officer, spent 10 years as the sales and marketing leader of Sandals Resorts International, leading the growth of its two well-known all-inclusive brands, Sandals and Beaches.


– | Mr. Hymel, our Chief Financial Officer, has over 15 years of experience working within the hospitality sector. He previously served as our Senior Vice President and Treasurer of Playa and has worked at the hotel and resort owner and operator Barceló Crestline and Crestline Capital Corporation.

Our Business and Growth Strategies
Our goal is to be the leading owner, operator, manager and developer of all-inclusive beachfront resorts in the markets we serve and to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns and provide long-term value appreciation to our shareholders by implementing the following business and growth strategies:

• | Selectively Pursue Strategic Growth Opportunities. The all-inclusive segment of the lodging industry is highly fragmented. We believe that we are well positioned to grow our portfolio through acquisitions in the all-inclusive segment of the lodging industry, such as the recently announced Sagicor Contribution. We believe that our extensive experience in all- inclusive resort operations, brand relationships, acquisition, expansion, renovation, repositioning and

9

rebranding, established and scalable management platform and ability to offer NASDAQ-listed ordinary shares to potential resort sellers will make us a preferred asset acquirer.

• | Capitalize on Internal Growth Opportunities. An important element of our strategy is to capitalize on opportunities to seek revenue and earnings growth through our existing portfolio and resort management platform. With respect to our existing portfolio, these opportunities may include resort expansions, renovations, repositionings or rebrandings. For example, in the last four years, we have completed three major expansion, renovation, repositioning and/or rebranding projects at Hyatt Ziva and Hyatt Zilara Rose Hall, Hyatt Ziva Cancún and Hyatt Ziva Puerto Vallarta. Upon the consummation of our recently announced Sagicor Contribution, we expect the Sagicor Assets will provide significant opportunities for internal growth through resort expansions, renovations, repositionings and rebrandings. In addition, we intend to pursue opportunities to capitalize on our scalable and integrated resort management platform and our expertise and experience with managing all-inclusive resorts, by seeking to manage all-inclusive resorts owned by third parties for a fee and to potentially, over time, internalize the management of resorts we own that are currently managed by a third party. For example, in September 2017, we entered into a long-term agreement to manage the 184-room Sanctuary Resort in Cap Cana.


• | Seek Increased Operating Margins by Optimizing Sales Channels. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 55.7% of our bookings were through wholesale channels. We bear the costs of wholesale bookings (i.e., commissions), which are typically higher than those of direct guest bookings. We believe that, over time, our strategic relationship with Hyatt and the increasing awareness of our all-inclusive resort brands, some of which are recently developed, among potential guests will enable us to increase the number of bookings made through lower cost sales channels, such as direct bookings through Hyatt, with respect to our Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort Brand resorts, and our recently re-launched resort websites.


• | Panama Jack Relationship. We believe that there is a significant opportunity to further expand our direct-to-consumer business by rebranding some of the resorts in our current portfolio, as well as potential future hotels we may acquire or manage, to consumer-recognized brands, as we have done at our Hyatt-branded resorts. We believe our new and exclusive arrangement to develop Panama Jack brand hotels will allow us to differentiate these Panama Jack brand hotels from non-branded or under-branded resorts and drive incremental direct-to-consumer business.

Playa’s Hyatt Resort Agreements
For each Playa resort using a Hyatt All-Inclusive Brand, the Hyatt franchise agreements grant to each of Playa and any third-party owner for whom Playa serves as hotel operator (each a “Resort Owner”) the right, and such Resort Owner undertakes the obligation, to use Hyatt’s hotel system and system standards to build or convert and operate the resort subject to the agreement. Each franchise agreement between Hyatt and such Resort Owner has an initial 15-year term and Hyatt has two options to extend the term for an additional term of five years each or 10 years in the aggregate. Hyatt provides initial and ongoing training and guidance, marketing assistance, and other assistance to each Resort Owner (and Playa as the resort’s manager) in connection with the resort’s development and operation. As part of this assistance, Hyatt reviews and approves the initial design and related elements of the resort. Hyatt also arranges for the provision of certain mandatory services, as well as (at the Resort Owner’s option) certain non-mandatory services, relating to the resort’s development and operation. In return, each Resort Owner agrees to operate the resort according to Hyatt’s operating procedures and its brand, quality assurance and other standards and specifications. This includes complying with Hyatt’s requirements relating to the central reservation system, global distribution systems and alternative distribution systems. In addition to the Hyatt franchise agreement, each Hyatt franchise Resort Owner enters into additional agreements with Hyatt pertaining to the development and operation of such new Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort Brand resort, including a trademark sublicense agreement, a World of Hyatt (previously Hyatt Gold Passport®) guest loyalty program agreement, a chain marketing services agreement, and a reservations agreement.
We continue to work with Hyatt to jointly improve all aspects of the brand system and standards for the Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort Brands. Hyatt owns the intellectual property rights relating to the Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort Brands, but we will have rights to use certain innovations that Hyatt and Playa jointly developed for the Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort Brands.
The Hyatt Strategic Alliance Agreement
We have entered into the Hyatt Strategic Alliance Agreement with Hyatt pursuant to which Playa and Hyatt have provided each other a right of first offer with respect to any Hyatt All-Inclusive Opportunity in the Market Area. If Playa intends to accept a Hyatt All-Inclusive Opportunity, Playa must notify Hyatt of such Hyatt All-Inclusive Opportunity and Hyatt has 10 business days to notify Playa of its decision to either accept or reject this Hyatt All-Inclusive Opportunity. If Hyatt accepts the Hyatt All-Inclusive Opportunity, Playa must negotiate in good faith with Hyatt the terms of a franchise agreement and related documents 
10

with respect to such property, provided that Playa acquires such property on terms acceptable to Playa within 60 days of offering such opportunity to Hyatt. If Hyatt intends to accept a Hyatt All-Inclusive Opportunity, Hyatt must notify Playa and Playa has to notify Hyatt within 10 business days of its decision to either accept or reject this Hyatt All-Inclusive Opportunity. If Playa accepts the Hyatt All-Inclusive Opportunity, Hyatt must negotiate in good faith with Playa the terms of a management agreement and other documents under which Playa would manage such Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort Brand resort (subject to a franchise agreement between Hyatt and the affiliate of Hyatt that would own such property), provided that Hyatt acquires such property on terms acceptable to it within 60 days of offering such opportunity to Playa. If Playa or Hyatt fails to notify each other of its decision or declines its right of first offer within the aforementioned 10 business day period, or if Playa or Hyatt determine after good-faith discussions that we cannot reach mutual acceptance of terms under which the development property would be licensed as a Hyatt Ziva or Hyatt Zilara hotel, such right of first offer will expire and Playa or Hyatt will be able to acquire, develop and operate the property related to such Hyatt All-Inclusive Opportunity free of any restrictions. In addition, if either party is approached by a third party with respect to the management or franchising of an all-inclusive resort in the Market Area, and such third party has not identified a manager or franchisor for the resort, the parties will notify each other and provide an introduction to the third party for the purposes of negotiating a management agreement or franchise agreement, as the case may be. On February 26, 2018, we and Hyatt extended the term of the Hyatt Strategic Alliance Agreement until December 31, 2021 unless extended by each party.
AMResorts Management Agreements
Five of our resorts (Dreams Puerto Aventuras, Secrets Capri, Dreams Punta Cana, Dreams La Romana and Dreams Palm Beach) are operated by AMResorts pursuant to long-term management agreements that contain customary terms and conditions, including those related to fees, termination conditions, capital expenditures, transfers of control of parties or transfers of ownership to competitors, sales of the hotels, and non-competition and non-solicitation. We pay AMResorts and its affiliates, as operators of these resorts, base management fees and incentive management fees. In addition, we reimburse the operators for some of the costs they incur in the provision of certain centralized services. We expect that these resorts will continue to be operated by AMResorts until the expiration of all such agreements in 2022. However, we have the right to terminate the management agreement related to Dreams La Romana resort, subject to certain conditions, and we may choose to do so in order to rebrand the resort and internalize its management. We may also choose to opportunistically sell one or more of these resorts and redeploy the proceeds from any such sales, subject to certain restrictions under our Senior Secured Credit Facility (as defined below). 
The Panama Jack Agreement
We have entered into a master development agreement (the “Panama Jack Agreement”) with Panama Jack. Pursuant to the Panama Jack Agreement, Panama Jack has granted us, subject to our compliance with certain development milestones, the exclusive right to develop and own and/or to manage resorts under the Panama Jack brand (the “Panama Jack Resorts”) in Antigua, Aruba, the Bahamas, Barbados, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama, St. Lucia and, subject to the lifting of various U.S. sanctions, Cuba. In addition, if Playa wishes to participate in any project to develop, convert or operate any resorts in the aforementioned countries that we believe in good faith and reasonable judgment are suitable for branding or conversion as a Panama Jack Resort, we will submit an application to Panama Jack to operate such resort as a Panama Jack Resort pursuant to the terms of the Panama Jack Agreement. Panama Jack may, in its commercially reasonable discretion, decide to approve or reject our application to operate a Panama Jack Resort. If Panama Jack approves our application, each such approved resort will be subject to a separate license agreement with Panama Jack.
We have fully rebranded and re-opened two of our existing resorts, Gran Caribe Resort and Gran Porto Resort, under the Panama Jack brand as of December 2017. 
The Panama Jack Agreement has a 10 year term expiring in 2026, subject to either party’s right to terminate in the event of the other party’s (i) admission of its inability to pay its debts as they become due or assignment for the benefit of creditors, liquidation or dissolution, or commencement of a proceeding for bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding, (ii) uncured breach of the Panama Jack Agreement within 30 days after delivery of written notice or (iii) knowing maintenance of false books and records or knowing submission of false or misleading reports or information to the other party.
Vacation Package Distribution Channels and Sales and Reservations
Our experienced sales and marketing team uses a strategic sales and marketing program across a variety of distribution channels through which our all-inclusive vacation packages are sold. Key components of this sales and marketing program include:

• | Targeting the primary tour operators and the wholesale market for transient business with a scalable program that supports shoulder and lower rate seasons while seeking to maximize revenue during high season, which also includes:


• | Engaging in cooperative marketing programs with leading travel industry participants;

11


• | Participating in travel agent promotions and awareness campaigns in coordination with tour operator campaigns, as well as independent of tour operators; and


• | Utilizing online travel leaders, such as Expedia and Booking.com, to supplement sales during shoulder and lower rate seasons;


• | Developing programs aimed at targeting consumers directly through:


• | Our company and resort websites;


• | The Hyatt website and toll free reservation telephone numbers with respect to Playa’s Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort Brand resorts;


• | The World of Hyatt (previously Hyatt Gold Passport®) guest loyalty program, with respect to Playa’s Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort Brand resorts; and


• | Our toll free reservation system that provides a comprehensive view of inventory in real time, based on demand;


• | Targeting group and incentive markets to seek and grow a strong base of corporate and event business utilizing Playa’s group sales team and fostering leads developed in conjunction with Hyatt’s group sales function;


• | Highlighting destination wedding and honeymoon programs by utilizing specialist sales agents for this growing resort category;


• | Participating in key industry trade shows targeted to the travel agent and wholesale market;


• | Engaging in online and social media, including:


• | Search engine optimization;


• | Targeted online and bounce-back advertising;


• | Social media presence via sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest; and


• | Flash sales and special offers for high need periods;


• | Monitoring and managing TripAdvisor and other similar consumer sites; and


• | Activating a targeted public relations plan to generate media attention-both traditional and new media including travel bloggers who focus on vacation travel to Mexico and the Caribbean.

We are seeking to grow a base of business through our group and incentive sales team, as well as destination wedding business. We seek to support this base through tour operators that can help generate sales during shoulder and lower rate seasons. We also seek luxury transient business to provide high rate business during peak seasons, such as winter and spring holidays, while “bargain hunters” can be targeted through social media for last minute high need periods. This multi-pronged strategy is designed to increase Net Package RevPAR (as defined in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) as well as generate strong occupancy through all of the resort seasons.
Insurance
Our resorts carry what we believe are appropriate levels of insurance coverage for a business operating in the lodging industry in Mexico, the Dominican Republic and Jamaica. This insurance includes coverage for general liability, property, workers’ compensation and other risks with respect to our business and business interruption coverage.
This general liability insurance provides coverage for any claim, including terrorism, resulting from our operations, goods and services and vehicles. We believe these insurance policies are adequate for foreseeable losses and on terms and conditions that are reasonable and customary with solvent insurance carriers.
Competition
We face intense competition for guests from other participants in the all-inclusive segment of the lodging industry and, to a lesser extent, from traditional hotels and resorts that are not all-inclusive. The all-inclusive segment remains a relatively small part of the broadly defined global vacation market that has historically been dominated by hotels and resorts that are not all-inclusive. Our principal competitors include other operators of all-inclusive resorts and resort companies, such as Barceló Hotels & Resorts, RIU Hotels & Resorts, IBEROSTAR Hotels & Resorts, Karisma Hotels & Resorts, AMResorts, Meliá Hotels International, Excellence Resorts and Palace Resorts, as well as some smaller, independent and local owners and operators. We compete for guests based primarily on brand name recognition and reputation, location, guest satisfaction, room rates, quality of service, 
12

amenities and quality of accommodations. In addition, we also compete for guests based on the ability of members of the World of Hyatt (previously Hyatt Gold Passport®) guest loyalty program to earn and redeem loyalty program points at our Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort Brand resorts. We believe that our strategic relationship with Hyatt provides us with a significant competitive advantage, with respect to our Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort Brand resorts, through Hyatt’s brand name recognition, as well as through Hyatt’s global loyalty program, distribution channels and other features.
Seasonality
The seasonality of the lodging industry and the location of our resorts in Mexico and the Caribbean generally result in the greatest demand for our resorts between mid-December and April of each year, yielding higher occupancy levels and package rates during this period. This seasonality in demand has resulted in predictable fluctuations in revenue, results of operations and liquidity, which are consistently higher during the first quarter of each year than in successive quarters.
Cyclicality
The lodging industry is highly cyclical in nature. Fluctuations in operating performance are caused largely by general economic and local market conditions, which subsequently affect levels of business and leisure travel. In addition to general economic conditions, new hotel and resort room supply is an important factor that can affect the lodging industry’s performance, and over-building has the potential to further exacerbate the negative impact of an economic recession. Room rates and occupancy, and thus Net Package RevPAR (as defined in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations), tend to increase when demand growth exceeds supply growth. A decline in lodging demand, or increase in lodging supply, could result in returns that are substantially below expectations, or result in losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Further, many of the costs of running a resort are fixed rather than variable.
