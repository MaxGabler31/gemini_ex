Item 1. Business
Overview



We are an Austin, Texas based publicly held oilfield energy technology products company focused on improving well performance and extending the lifespan of the industry’s most sophisticated and expensive equipment. America’s resurgence in oil and gas production is largely driven by new innovative technologies and processes as most dramatically and recently demonstrated by fracking. We provide and apply wear-resistant alloys for use in the global oilfield services industry which are mechanically stronger, harder and more corrosion resistant than typical alloys found in the market today. This combination of characteristics creates opportunities for drillers to dramatically improve lateral drilling lengths, well completion time and total well costs.



Our wear-resistant alloys reduce drill-string torque, friction, wear and corrosion in a cost-effective manner, while protecting the integrity of the base metal. We apply our coatings using advanced welding techniques and thermal spray methods. We also utilize common materials, such as tungsten carbide to chromium carbide, to deliver the optimal solution to the customers. Some of our hardbanding processes protect wear in tubulars using materials that achieve a low coefficient of friction to protect the drill string and casing from abrasion.



We plan to continue our U.S. oilfield services company acquisition initiative, aimed at companies which are already recognized as a high-quality service providers to strategic customers in the major North American oil and gas basins. When completed, we expect that each of these oilfield services company acquisitions will provide immediate revenue from their current regional customer base, while also providing us with a foundation for channel distribution and product development of our existing products. We intend to grow each of these established oilfield services companies by providing better access to capital, more disciplined sales and marketing development, integrated supply chain logistics and infrastructure build out that emphasizes outstanding customer service and customer collaboration, future product development and planning.



We believe that a well-capitalized technology-enabled oilfield services business will provide the basis for more accessible financing to grow the Company and execute our oilfield services company acquisitions strategy. We anticipate new innovative products will come to market as we collaborate with drillers to solve their other down-hole needs.



Acquisition of Pro-Tech Hardbanding Services, Inc. 



On July 31, 2018, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement to purchase 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock of Pro-Tech Hardbanding Services, Inc., (“Pro-Tech”), an Oklahoma corporation which is a hardbanding company servicing Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, Arkansas, Louisiana, and New Mexico. The Company believes that the acquisition of Pro-Tech will create opportunities to leverage its existing portfolio of intellectual property to fulfill its mission of operating as a technology-focused oilfield services company. The stock purchase agreement was included as Exhibit 10.1 on the Form 8-K filed by us on August 2, 2018.
Our Industry and Market



The following information excerpts were sourced from a September 2020 “Anti-Corrosion Coatings Market Size Report, 2020-2027” published by Grand View Research (Report ID: CVR-4-68039-128-0), available at www.grandviewresearch.com



The global anti-corrosion coatings market size was valued at USD 27.2 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.6% from 2020 to 2027. The rising demand for thin-walled durable metallic components in the manufacturing of lightweight products, which are used in various industries including building and construction, automotive, marine, and oil & gas is expected to propel the market growth over the forecast period. Amid the global COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for anti-corrosion coatings has increased primarily in the oil and gas and marine application industries owing to the reduced exploration and marine operation. The machines and equipment, which are not in operations need maintenance so as to avoid the degradation and rusting as such equipment has crude oil residual, water, salt, and other chemicals, which cause corrosion. 



The regional market is mainly dominated by North America and the Middle East and Africa, with the presence of major oil and gas exploration markets such as the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. Government initiatives coupled with infrastructural developments in these countries are further propelling the growth of the market in these regions.



Sector Insights



The upstream sector of the oil and gas industry involves activities such as exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas. These activities primarily include drilling of exploratory wells, making requisite operations and bringing natural gas and other products to the ground surface. For these activities, various components require protection as they get older. Carbon steel is extensively used in this industry especially for pipelines and it freely corrodes when it comes into contact with water, which is produced with the natural gas and crude oil from underwater reservoirs.

The midstream sector consists of transportation activity of crude oil and natural gas. These products are transported by various medium including pipelines, tankers, tank cars, and trucks. The outer surface of the tanks or pipelines is prevented from the atmospheric corrosion with the help of coatings and cathodic protection.



In the downstream sector, during the refinery operations, most of the corrosion occurs due to the presence of water, H2S, CO2, sodium chloride and sulfuric acid. In downstream, deterioration occurs due to curing agents those are present in crude oil or feedstock and are associated with process or control. To prevent such corrosion, various products including coatings, inhibitors, cathodic protection and paints are used.



Regional Insights



North America and the Middle East and African regions are projected to contribute to market growth in coming years primarily fueled by the need for transportation/supply infrastructure and technological innovations for the corrosion detection in various countries including the U.S., Canada, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and others. The applications in oil and gas sector such upstream, midstream and downstream have been experiencing significant growth in these countries over the past few years.
Our Products and Services



In today’s harsher drilling environment, exploration and productions companies are seeking new methods and technologies for reducing drill-string torque and down-hole friction when drilling long laterals. Without a comprehensive solution, drill pipe, tubing, tool joints and drill string mid-sections will suffer from aggressive wear that will negatively impact drilling torque, friction, time to complete and total drilling costs. Our wear-resistant alloys will solve these problems. Our goal is to help drillers across the major oil and gas basins of North America create better oil and gas well outcomes and lower total well costs when drilling long laterals. Our initial product line will be focused on tubing and drill-pipe metal coating products, RFID enclosure products and other services that provide protection and friction reduction for nearly every metal component of a drilling operation.



With hardness that can range from 900 to 1500 Vickers, our coatings products will be 3 to 5 times harder than normal metals such as titanium and steel. Oilfield products protected our wear-resistant alloys are lasting two to ten times longer than other coated products in field applications. Additionally, our coatings products will deliver a friction coefficient of 0.05 to 0.12, similar to the smoothness of Teflon. 



With the acquisition of Pro-Tech, a hardbanding service provider servicing Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, Arkansas, Louisiana, and New Mexico, we believe we will create opportunities to leverage our existing portfolio of intellectual property to fulfill our mission of operating as a technology-focused oilfield services company.



Our Competitors



The key players in the global market include The 3M Company, AkzoNobel N.V, Jotun A/S, Hempel A/S, Axalta Coating System Ltd., The Sherwin-Williams Company, Kansai Paints Co. Ltd., RPM International, Inc., Aegion Corporation, Ashland Inc., and BASF SE. The industry is characterized by merger and acquisitions as the players are focusing on increasing their market presence.
