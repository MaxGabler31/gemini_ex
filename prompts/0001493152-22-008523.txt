Item 1. Description of Business.
Overview
 
We operate through our active subsidiaries, Cougar Express and Shyp FX, as a logistics and transportation company specializing in ecommerce fulfillment, last mile deliveries, two-person home delivery, mid-mile, and long-haul services.
 
We are primarily an asset-based point-to-point delivery company. An asset-based delivery company, as compared to a non-asset-based delivery company, owns its own transportation equipment and employs its own drivers. As of December 31, 2021, through our active subsidiaries, we owned approximately 17 vehicles consisting of box trucks and vans and employed approximately 22 drivers.
 
In addition, our operations utilize the services of independent contractors, who generally use their own vehicles, on an as needed basis. As of December 31, 2021, approximately nine to 12 independent contractors provided services to us on a part-time basis.
 
Between June 18, 2018 and September 30, 2020, we operated through two New Jersey-based subsidiaries, namely Prime EFS, which conducted a last-mile business focused on deliveries to retail consumers for our primary customer in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, and Shypdirect, which was formed in July 2018 and focused on, and conducted, our long-haul and mid-mile delivery businesses.
 
The great bulk of Prime EFS’s business prior to September 30, 2020 was conducted pursuant to the Delivery Service Provider program (the “Prime EFS DSP Program”) of Amazon Logistics, Inc., a subsidiary of Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”). In June 2020, Amazon gave notice to Prime EFS that Amazon would not be renewing the Prime EFS DSP Program agreement when that agreement terminated effective September 30, 2020. Amazon made clear to Prime EFS that Amazon’s decision not to renew the DSP agreement was part of a well-publicized initiative by Amazon to restructure how it would be delivering its last-mile services and did not reflect the quality of the services provided by Prime EFS. Prime EFS ceased operations on September 30, 2020 due to Amazon’s non-renewal of the Prime EFS DSP Program.
 
Shypdirect conducted its business as a carrier under a relay program service agreement with Amazon Logistics, Inc., last amended on August 24, 2020 (the “Program Agreement”). Under that agreement, Shypdirect provided transportation services, including receiving, loading, storing, transporting, delivering, unloading and related services for Amazon and its customers. On July 17, 2020, Amazon notified Shypdirect that Amazon had elected to terminate the Program Agreement, effective as of November 14, 2020 (the “Shypdirect Termination Notice”). On August 3, 2020, Amazon offered to withdraw the Shypdirect Termination Notice and extend the term of the Program Agreement to and including May 14, 2021, conditioned on Prime EFS executing, for nominal consideration, a separation agreement with Amazon under which Prime EFS would agree to cooperate in an orderly transition of its Amazon last-mile delivery business to other service providers, would release any and all claims it may have against Amazon, and covenant not to sue Amazon (the “Aug. 3 Proposal”). On August 4, 2020, the Company, Prime EFS and Shypdirect accepted the Aug. 3 Proposal. The Program Agreement expired on May 14, 2021. In June 2021, Shypdirect ceased its tractor trailer and box truck delivery services to Amazon, and in July 2021, Shypdirect ceased all operations.
 
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, one customer, Amazon, represented 28.5% and 96.7% of our total net revenues. Approximately 28.5% of our revenue of $5,495,146 for the year ended December 31, 2021 was attributable to Shypdirect’s now terminated mid-mile and long-haul business with Amazon. The termination of the Prime EFS last-mile business with Amazon on September 30, 2020 had a material adverse impact on the operations of Prime EFS beginning in the 4th fiscal quarter of 2020 and the termination of Shypdirect’s Amazon mid-mile and long-haul business, which was effective on or about May 14, 2021, had a material adverse impact on operations of Shypdirect beginning in the 2nd fiscal quarter of 2021. This impact caused Prime EFS and Shypdirect to become insolvent and to cease operations.
 
On August 16, 2021, Prime EFS and Shypdirect executed Deeds of Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors in the State of New Jersey pursuant to N.J.S.A. §2A:19-1, et seq. (the “ABC Statute”), assigning all Prime EFS and Shypdirect assets to Terri Jane Freedman as Assignee for the Benefit of Creditors (the “Assignee”) and filing for dissolution. An “Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors,” “general assignment” or “ABC” in New Jersey is a state-law, voluntary, judicially-supervised corporate liquidation and unwinding similar to the Chapter 7 bankruptcy process found in the United States Bankruptcy Code. In an ABC, debtor companies, here Prime EFS and Shypdirect, together referred to as the “Assignors”, executed Deeds of Assignment, assigning all of their assets to the Assignee chosen by the Company, who acts as a fiduciary similar to a Chapter 7 trustee in bankruptcy. On September 7, 2021, the ABCs were filed with the Bergen County Clerk in Bergen County, New Jersey and filed with the Surrogate Court, Bergen County, initiating judicial proceedings. The Assignee has been charged with liquidating the assets for the benefit of the Prime EFS and Shypdirect creditors pursuant to the provisions of the ABC Statute.
 
As a result of Prime EFS and Shypdirect’s filing of the executed Deeds of Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors on September 7, 2021, the Assignee assumed all authority to manage Prime EFS or Shypdirect. Additionally, Prime EFS and Shypdirect no longer conduct any business and are not permitted by the Assignee and ABC Statute to conduct any business. For these reasons, effective September 7, 2021, we relinquished control of Prime EFS and Shypdirect. Further, on October 13, 2021, Prime EFS and Shypdirect filed for dissolution with the Secretary of State of New Jersey. Therefore, we deconsolidated Prime EFS and Shypdirect effective with the filing of executed Deeds of Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors in September 2021. Our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 include the results of Prime EFS and Shypdirect prior to the September 7, 2021 filing of the executed Deeds of Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors with the State of New Jersey.
 
While the Company has commenced replacing its Amazon business with acquisitions as set forth below, we continue to: (i) seek new last-mile, mid-mile and long-haul business with other, non-Amazon, customers; (ii) explore other strategic relationships; and (iii) identify potential acquisition opportunities.
 
On November 13, 2020, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Shyp FX, under the laws of the State of New Jersey. On January 15, 2021, through Shyp FX, we simultaneously executed an asset purchase agreement (“APA”) and closed a transaction to acquire substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of Double D Trucking, Inc., a northern New Jersey-based logistics provider specializing in servicing Federal Express over the past 25 years (“DDTI”). The purchase price under the APA was $100,000 of cash and a promissory note of $400,000. The principal assets involved in the acquisition were vehicles for cargo transport, system equipment for vehicle tracking and navigation of vehicles, and delivery route rights together with assumption of associated customer relationships.

On March 24, 2021, our subsidiary, TLSS Acquisition, acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Cougar Express, a New York-based full-service logistics provider specializing in pickup, warehousing, and delivery services in the New York tri-state area. The purchase price was $2,000,000 of cash plus cash for the acquisition of security deposits, a cash payment equal to 50% of the difference between cash and accounts receivable acquired and accounts payable assumed, less the assumption of truck loans and leases, and a promissory note of $350,000. The previous owner of Cougar Express is barred from competing with the Cougar Express business through March 24, 2026. Cougar Express was a family-owned full-service transportation business that has been in operation for more than 30 years providing one-to-four person deliveries and offering white glove services. It utilizes its own fleet of trucks, warehouse/driver/office personnel and on-call subcontractors from its convenient and secure New York JFK airport area location, allowing it to pick-up and deliver throughout the New York tri-state area. Cougar Express serves a diverse base of approximately 50 commercial accounts, which are freight forwarders that work with some of the most notable retail businesses in the country.
 
We have a highly experienced and dedicated senior management team, which is currently evaluating various opportunities, whether by acquisition or otherwise, for the Company to augment its current business and/or enter into new line(s) of business. While the Company is hopeful that it will be able to announce a plan in this regard shortly, there can be no assurance that we will in fact be able to augment our current business and/or enter into new line(s) of business or to do so profitably.
 
Corporate History
 
TLSS was incorporated under the name “PetroTerra Corp.” in the State of Nevada on July 25, 2008. Prior to March 2017, TLSS was an independent oil or gas exploration and development company focused on the acquisition or lease of properties that potentially contained extractable oil or gas. However, at that time, we had not generated any revenues and, due to a decline of the oil and gas markets, elected to seek other business opportunities.
 
On March 30, 2017, TLSS entered into a Share Exchange Agreement, dated as of the same date, with Save on Transport Inc., a Florida-based non-asset provider of integrated transportation management solutions, including brokerage and logistics services related to the transportation of automobiles and other freight (“Save on Transport”), pursuant to which we acquired Save on Transport as a wholly owned subsidiary. TLSS’s acquisition of Save on Transport was treated as a reverse merger and recapitalization of Save on Transport for financial reporting purposes because the Save on Transport shareholders retained an approximate 80% controlling interest in our consolidated company. Save on Transport was considered the acquirer for accounting purposes, and our historical financial statements before the acquisition transaction were replaced with the historical financial statements of Save on Transport before such acquisition. The balance sheets at their historical cost basis of both entities were combined at the acquisition date and the results of operations from the acquisition date forward included the historical results of Save on Transport and our combined results of operations from the acquisition date forward. On May 1, 2019, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Save On and Steven Yariv, whereby the Company returned all of the stock of Save On to Steven Yariv in exchange for Mr. Yariv conveying 1,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company back to the Company.
 
On June 18, 2018, TLSS completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Prime EFS from its members pursuant to the terms and conditions of a Stock Purchase Agreement entered into among the Company and the Prime EFS members on the Acquisition Date. Prime EFS was a New Jersey based transportation company that generated substantially all of its revenues from Amazon in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania until it ceased operations on September 30, 2020 due to Amazon’s non-renewal of its Delivery Service Partner (DSP) Agreement with Prime EFS, as described above and elsewhere.
 
On July 24, 2018, TLSS formed Shypdirect LLC, a company organized under the laws of New Jersey. Shypdirect was a transportation company with a focus on tractor trailer and box truck deliveries of product on the east coast of the United States from one distributor’s warehouse to another warehouse or from a distributor’s warehouse to the post office. Since its inception, Shypdirect generated substantially all of its revenues from Amazon. As described below, in August 2020, Amazon elected to terminate its Amazon Relay Carrier Terms of Service with Shypdirect effective May 14, 2021. Accordingly, in June 2021, Shypdirect ceased its tractor trailer and box truck delivery services to Amazon, and in July 2021, Shypdirect ceased all operations.
 
On November 13, 2020, TLSS formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Shyp FX, under the laws of the State of New Jersey. On January 15, 2021, through Shyp FX, we executed an asset purchase agreement (“APA”) and closed a transaction to acquire substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of DDTI.
 
On November 16, 2020, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, TLSS Acquisition, under the laws of the State of Delaware. On March 24, 2021, TLSS Acquisition acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Cougar Express.
 
On February 21, 2021, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Shyp CX, under the laws of the State of New York. Shyp CX does not engage in any revenue-generating operations.
 
Our principal executive offices are located in the United States at 5500 Military Trail, Suite 22-357, Jupiter, Florida 33458, and our telephone number is (833) 764-1443.
 
Company Overview
 
E-Commerce Fulfillment Solutions
 
The rapid growth of e-commerce and the online retailing segment of e-commerce is well documented. Online retail companies have logistics needs that differ from those of traditional businesses. Unlike traditional inventory management, e-commerce companies need to ship items directly to customers, who expect their orders to arrive on time and as described. We have built our delivery services to perform effectively in the “on demand” shipping environment that is part of the e-commerce fulfillment solutions system. We are currently looking to offer the expertise and knowledge we have in this area to new customers.

Our Strategy and Competitive Strengths
 
As a result of the termination of Prime EFS’s involvement with Amazon’s DSP Program, we have begun the process of diversifying our business primarily starting with the acquisition of Cougar Express and the assets of DDTI. Our strategy is to be a leader in the transportation industry by providing on-time, high-quality pick-up, transportation, and long-haul, mid-mile and last-mile delivery services.
 
Market Knowledge and Understanding. While we have been operating our current business for only a few years, our senior management personnel collectively have more than 40 years of experience in the transportation industry and broad knowledge in providing transportation services. These solutions are in high demand, and we hope to grow our business more profitably than was experienced in prior periods. Members of our senior management team have operational experience both within and without the transportation and logistics industry together with extensive experience in business growth and acquisitions. We believe we understand the various segments of the end-to-end solutions required to deliver goods rapidly and accurately between the various pick-up and delivery points in the delivery chain.
 
Unwavering Focus on Relationships and Superior Service. We aim to be the premier platform and partner of choice for our customers. We believe we offer superior services and solutions due to our company-wide commitment to customer service.
 
Experienced and Proven Management Team. We believe our management team is among the most experienced in the industry. Our senior management team brings experience in transportation and logistics, mergers and acquisitions, information technology, e-commerce retailing and fulfillment.
 
We hope to leverage our competitive strengths to increase shareholder value through the following core strategies.
 
Pursue Value-Enhancing Strategic Acquisitions. We intend to pursue strategic acquisitions as a means of adding new markets in the United States, expanding our transportation and logistics service offerings, adding talented management and operational employees, expanding, and upgrading our technology platform and developing operational best practices. We are currently at various stages of reviewing several potential acquisition targets and believe we have significant opportunities to grow our business through our knowledge of our industry and possible acquisition targets.
 
Build Upon Strong Customer Relationships to Expand Organically. We intend to utilize our strategic acquisitions to facilitate organic growth through leveraging our product and service capabilities, expanding the size of our service area, and adding higher margin services to our service offerings.
 
Expand Our Operations to Other Regions of the U.S. Our mid-mile and long-haul delivery services are currently provided in the eastern United States. As we continue to expand our marketing and customer relationships, we anticipate expanding our geographic footprint to provide such services, and to capture market share, in other regions of the U.S. by opening our own operations centers and warehouses, acquiring existing regional transportation and logistics companies operating in other areas and partnering with local operators in other regions. We believe the expansion of our business in other regions of the U.S. will also allow us to expand our relationships with existing customers who operate in those regions.
 
Enhance Our Operating Margins. We hope to enhance our operating margins through a combination of increased operational efficiencies, leveraging our existing assets and distribution facilities and increasing our usage of technology to help us better plan, execute and monitor the performance of our services and transportation assets.
 
Technology
 
An integral part of our operating philosophy is the utilization of technology to support our transportation services and provide our employees with real time information on the status of our operations. We believe our focus on technology as a support to our operations allows our employees to focus on performing at high levels for the benefit of our customers.
 
We are also exploring technology-based acquisition opportunities that can provide higher margin solution-based products and services.
 
Customers and Markets
 
For the year ended December 31, 2021, four customers represented 74.5% (28.5%, 21.6%, 12.5% and 11.9%, respectively) of the Company’s total net revenues, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, one customer, Amazon, represented 96.7% of the Company’s total net revenues.
 
Accordingly, we continue to have customer concentration risk, which we hope to address by expanding our organic growth through the addition of new customers and through the acquisition of businesses that provide transportation services for new customer bases.
 
Acquisitions
 
On January 15, 2021, through Shyp FX, we simultaneously executed an asset purchase agreement (“APA”) and closed a transaction to acquire substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of DDTI. DDTI’s annual revenues in 2020 exceeded $1 million. The purchase price under the APA was $100,000 of cash and a promissory note of $400,000. The principal assets involved in the acquisition were vehicles for cargo transport, system equipment for vehicle tracking and navigation of vehicles, and delivery route rights together with assumption of associated customer relationships. The acquisition of DDTI made the Company an approved contracted service provider of FedEx, which, we believe, fits in well with our current geographic coverage area and may lead to additional expansion opportunities within the FedEx network.
 
On November 11 2020, our wholly owned subsidiary, TLSS Acquisition, entered into an asset purchase agreement dated as of November 6, 2020 (“APA”), to acquire substantially all the assets and certain liabilities of Cougar Express. Cougar Express was a family-owned full-service transportation business that has been in operation for more than 30 years providing one-to-four person deliveries and offering white glove services. It utilizes its own fleet of trucks, warehouse/driver/office personnel and on-call subcontractors from its convenient and secure New York JFK airport area location, allowing it to pick-up and deliver throughout the New York tri-state area. Cougar Express serves a diverse base of 50 commercial accounts, which are freight forwarders that work with some of the most notable retail businesses in the country. Some of Cougar Express’s accounts have been customers of Cougar Express for more than 20 years. On March 24, 2021, TLSS Acquisition acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Cougar Express. The purchase price was $2,000,000 of cash plus cash for the acquisition of security deposits, a cash payment equal to 50% of the difference between cash and accounts receivable acquired and accounts payable assumed, less the assumption of truck loans and leases, and a promissory note of $350,000. The previous owner of Cougar Express is barred from competing with the Cougar Express business through March 24, 2026.

Consistent with our primary strategy to become a leader in the transportation industry in providing on-time, high-quality pick-up, transportation and delivery services, we expect to accomplish this goal, in part, by pursuing strategic acquisitions as a means of adding new markets in the United States, expanding its transportation and logistics service offerings, adding talented management and operational employees, expanding and upgrading its technology platform and developing operational best practices. Moreover, one factor in assessing acquisition opportunities is the potential for subsequent organic growth post-acquisition.
 
We believe that the acquisition of DDTI and Cougar Express fit our current business plan, given DDTI and Cougar Express’s demographic location, services offered, and diversified customer base, and given that it would provide us with a long-standing, well-run operation as a first step to begin replacing the revenue we lost as a result of Amazon’s terminating its delivery service provider and mid-mile and long-haul businesses.
 
Competition
 
Transportation services is highly competitive and composed of fragmented marketplaces, with multiple companies competing in the geographic region in which we provide services. We compete on service, reliability, scope and scale of operations, technological capabilities, and price. Our competitors include local, regional, and national companies that offer the same services we provide — some with larger customer bases, significantly more resources and more experience than we have. Additionally, some of our customers have internal resources that can perform services we offer. Due in part to the fragmented nature of the industry, we must strive daily to retain existing business relationships and forge new relationships.
 
The health of the transportation industry will continue to be a function of domestic economic growth, particularly in the e-commerce marketplace. We believe that we have positioned the Company to grow with and benefit from the e-commerce expansion. Together with our scale, technology, and company-specific initiatives, we believe that our positioning should keep us growing faster than the macro environment.
 
Seasonality
 
None.
 
Regulation
 
Our operations are regulated and licensed by various governmental agencies. These regulations impact us directly and indirectly by regulating third-party transportation providers we use to transport freight for our customers.
 
Regulation Affecting Motor Carriers, Owner-Operators and Transportation Brokers. In the United States, our subsidiaries that operate as motor carriers have motor carrier licenses issued by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”) of the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”). In addition, our subsidiaries acting as property brokers have property broker licenses issued by the FMCSA. Our motor carrier subsidiaries and the third-party motor carriers must comply with the safety and fitness regulations of the DOT, including those related to drug-testing, alcohol-testing, hours-of-service, records retention, vehicle inspection, driver qualification and minimum insurance requirements. Weight and equipment dimensions also are subject to government regulations. We also may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to emissions, drivers’ hours-of-service, independent contractor eligibility requirements, onboard reporting of operations, air cargo security and other matters affecting safety or operating methods. Other agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), also regulate our equipment, operations and independent contractor drivers. Like our third-party support carriers, we are subject to a variety of vehicle registration and licensing requirements in certain states and local jurisdictions where we operate. In foreign jurisdictions where we operate, our operations are regulated by the appropriate governmental authorities.
 
In 2010, the FMCSA introduced the Compliance Safety Accountability program (“CSA”), which uses a Safety Management System (“SMS”) to rank motor carriers on seven categories of safety-related data, known as Behavioral Analysis and Safety Improvement Categories, or “BASICs.”
 
Although the CSA scores are not currently publicly available, we believe such scores will be made public in the future. Our fleet could be ranked worse or better than our competitors, and the safety ratings of our motor carrier operations could be impacted. Our network of third-party transportation providers may experience a similar result. A reduction in safety and fitness ratings may result in difficulty attracting and retaining qualified independent contractors and could cause our customers to direct their business away from the Company and to carriers with more favorable CSA scores, which would adversely affect our results of operations.
 
Classification of Independent Contractors. Tax and other federal and state regulatory authorities, as well as private litigants, continue to assert that independent contractor drivers in the trucking industry are employees rather than independent contractors. Federal legislators have introduced legislation in the past to make it easier for tax and other authorities to reclassify independent contractors as employees, including legislation to increase the recordkeeping requirements and heighten the penalties for companies who misclassify workers and are found to have violated overtime and/or wage requirements. Additionally, federal legislators have sought to abolish the current safe harbor allowing taxpayers that meet certain criteria to treat individuals as independent contractors if they are following a longstanding, recognized practice. Federal legislators also sought to expand the Fair Labor Standards Act to cover “non-employees” who perform labor or services for businesses, even if said non-employees are properly classified as independent contractors; require taxpayers to provide written notice to workers based upon their classification as either an employee or a non-employee; and impose penalties and fines for violations of the notice requirement and/or for misclassifications. Some states have launched initiatives to increase revenues from items such as unemployment, workers’ compensation and income taxes, and the reclassification of independent contractors as employees could help states with those initiatives. Taxing and other regulatory authorities and courts apply a variety of standards in their determinations of independent contractor status. If our independent contractor drivers are determined to be employees, we would incur additional exposure under some or all the following: federal and state tax, workers’ compensation, unemployment benefits, and labor, employment, and tort laws, including for prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings.
 
Environmental Regulations. Our facilities and operations and our independent contractors are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the hauling, handling and disposal of hazardous materials, emissions from vehicles, engine-idling, fuel tanks and related fuel spillage and seepage, discharge and retention of storm water, and other environmental matters that involve inherent environmental risks. Similar laws and regulations may apply in many of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We have instituted programs to monitor and control environmental risks and maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We may be responsible for the cleanup of any spill or other incident involving hazardous materials caused by our operations or business. In the past, we have been responsible for the costs of cleanup of diesel fuel spills caused by traffic accidents or other events, and none of these incidents materially affected our business or operations. We generally transport only hazardous materials rated as low-to-medium-risk, and a small percentage of our total shipments contain hazardous materials. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with current laws and regulations, and we do not know of any existing environmental condition that reasonably would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results. Future changes in environmental regulations or liabilities from newly discovered environmental conditions or violations (and any associated fines and penalties) could have a material adverse effect on our business, competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. U.S. federal and state governments, as well as governments in certain foreign jurisdictions where we operate, have also proposed environmental legislation that could, among other things, potentially limit carbon, exhaust and greenhouse gas emissions. If enacted, such legislation could result in higher costs for new tractors and trailers, reduced productivity and efficiency, and increased operating expenses, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations.
