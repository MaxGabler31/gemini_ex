Item 1. Business 
 ﻿
 General
 ﻿
 Veru Inc. is a urology and oncology biopharmaceutical company.  The Company does business as both "Veru Healthcare" and "The Female Health Company."  On July 31, 2017, the Company changed its corporate name from The Female Health Company to Veru Inc. 
 ﻿
 Veru utilizes the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway to develop and commercialize drug candidates. The FDA's 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway is designed to allow for potentially expedited, lower cost and lower risk regulatory approval based on previously established safety, efficacy, and manufacturing information on a drug that has been already approved by FDA for the same or a different indication.  Veru is developing drug candidates under the 505(b)(1) pathway as well, which is the traditional full new drug application (NDA) pathway that requires a complete preclinical, clinical, and manufacturing application. The Company is currently developing drug product candidates for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH or enlarged prostate), overactive bladder (urge incontinence, urgency, or frequency of urination), hot flashes in men associated with prostate cancer hormone treatment, erectile dysfunction, male infertility and novel oral therapy (alpha & beta tubulin inhibitor) for a variety of malignancies, including metastatic prostate, breast, endometrial, ovarian, and other cancers. 
 ﻿
 To help support these clinical development programs, the Company markets and sells the FC2 Female Condom® (FC2) into the US market by prescription and other sales channels and through The Female Health Company Division in the global public health sector (ministries of health, government health agencies, U.N. agencies, and nonprofit organizations). In addition, the Company markets and sells the PREBOOST® (4% benzocaine medicated individual wipes) which is a male genital desensitizing drug product for the prevention of premature ejaculation (PE) that is being co-promoted and distributed with Timm Medical Technologies, Inc.
 ﻿
 On October 31, 2016, as part of the Company's strategy to diversify its product line to mitigate the risks of being a single product company, the Company completed its acquisition (the APP Acquisition) of Aspen Park Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (APP) through the merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company into APP.  The completion of the APP Acquisition transitioned us from a single product company selling only the FC2 Female Condom® into a biopharmaceutical company with multiple drug products under clinical development and commercialization focused in urology and oncology.
 ﻿
 On August 12, 2016, the FDA agreed that the Company's Tamsulosin DRS (tamsulosin HCl delayed release sachet) medication, a proprietary slow release granule formulation for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms of an enlarged prostate, called benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a $3.5 billion market, qualifies for the expedited 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway.  In March 2017, the Company initiated a bioequivalence clinical study for Tamsulosin DRS and in April 2017 announced the successful completion of Stage 1 of the bioequivalence clinical study, which selected the optimal formulation of our proprietary Tamsulosin DRS product.  In October 2017, the Company initiated Stage 2 of the bioequivalence clinical study of Tamsulosin DRS and in November 2017 announced the results of Stage 2 of the bioequivalence clinical study.  During the Stage 2 bioequivalence clinical study, dosing with Tamsulosin DRS fasted and Tamsulosin DRS fed were successfully shown to be bioequivalent with FLOMAX fed based on AUC, which is the key determinant of drug exposure over time.  The Tamsulosin DRS formulation still needs to meet the remaining bioequivalence criterion for peak value (Cmax). The Company intends to initiate a new bioequivalence study after adjusting the formulation to address Cmax and expects this study to be completed in the first quarter of 2018. The Company plans to develop Tamsulosin XR (tamsulosin HCl extended release) capsules as well. The Company does not believe that the new bioequivalence study and capsule formulation development will affect the timing of its planned submission of an NDA for Tamsulosin DRS granules and Tamsulosin XR capsules and, if the new bioequivalence study is successful, plans to submit the NDA in the first half of 2018. 
 ﻿
 On May 13, 2017, the Company announced positive results of a clinical study of its novel PREBOOST®product.  The PREBOOST® Phase 4 clinical study enrolled 26 men aged 18 years or older in a heterosexual, monogamous relationship, with PE, defined as reported poor control over ejaculation, personal distress related to ejaculation and average intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) of two minutes or less on stopwatch measurement. After treatment with PREBOOST®, 82 percent of men were no longer considered to have PE with an increase time to ejaculation on average of 5 minutes.  Results showed that treatment was well tolerated.  Therefore, the results of the study showed that PREBOOST® prolonged time to ejaculation, supporting the clinical validity of PREBOOST® for the prevention of premature ejaculation.  The Company launched the product in the United States on January 6, 2017 and on October 3, 2017 entered a co-promotion and distribution agreement with Timm Medical Technologies, Inc. 
 ﻿
 The Company presented an overview of its drug candidate for male infertility, VERU-722 by invitation from the FDA to present at the meeting of the Bone, Reproductive and Urologic Drugs (BRUD) FDA Advisory Committee on December 6, 2016. The FDA uses advisory committees to obtain independent expert advice on scientific, technical and policy matters. At the meeting, the committee discussed appropriate clinical trial design features, including acceptable endpoints for demonstrating clinical benefit, for drugs intended to treat secondary hypogonadism (low testosterone levels) while preserving or improving testicular function, including 

 
4


spermatogenesis. At the meeting, the FDA Advisory Committee provided guidance for clinical trial design and endpoints. The committee agreed with the intended patient population to treat, and supported the use of improvement of semen quality for such clinical endpoints as avoidance of aggressive assisted reproductive procedures such as in vitro fertilization or pregnancy. Based on this advice, the Company plans to consider advancing VERU-722 into Phase 2 clinical trial in men with testicular dysfunction [oligospermia (low sperm count) and secondary hypogonadism] as a cause of male factor infertility.
 ﻿
 On May 24, 2017, the Company announced that, following a Pre-Investigational New Drug Application meeting with FDA, it plans to advance VERU-944 (cis-clomiphene citrate), oral agent being evaluated for the treatment of hot flashes in men receiving hormone therapy, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), for advanced prostate cancer into Phase 2 clinical trial utilizing the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. Approximately 80% of men receiving one of the common forms of ADT, including LUPRON®, ELIGARD® and FIRMAGON®, experience hot flashes and 30-40% will suffer from moderate to severe hot flashes.  An investigational new drug application (IND) is expected to be filed with FDA in the first quarter of 2018.
 ﻿
 On December 11, 2017, the Company announced that it has acquired world-wide rights to a novel, proprietary oral granule formulation for solifenacin from Camargo Pharmaceuticals Services, LLC.  Solifenacin is the active ingredient in a leading drug VESIcare® for the treatment of overactive bladder in men and women. Solifenacin Delayed Release Granule (DRG) formulation addresses the large population of men and women who have overactive bladder (OAB) and who have dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing tablets.  In PreIND meeting, FDA confirmed that a single bioequivalence study and that no additional nonclinical, clinical efficacy and/or safety studies will be required to support the approval of Solifenacin DRG product for the treatment of overactive bladder.  The Company plans to complete the Solifenacin DRG bioequivalence study in 2018 and to file the NDA in 2019. 
 ﻿
 On December 15, 2017, the Company acquired world-wide rights to Tadalafil-Finasteride combination capsules formulation from Camargo Pharmaceuticals Services, LLC.  Tadalafil-Finasteride combination capsules (tadalafil 5mg and finasteride 5mg) is a new, proprietary formulation that addresses the large population of men who have lower urinary tract symptoms and restricted urinary stream because of an enlarged prostate. Tadalafil 5mg is a phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor marketed under CIALIS® for benign prostatic hyperplasia and erectile dysfunction and finasteride 5mg is a Type 2, 5-alpha reductase inhibitor marketed under PROSCAR® to decrease size the prostate, prevent urinary retention and the need for prostate surgery in men who have an enlarged prostate. In PreIND meeting held in November 2017, FDA agreed that a single a bioequivalence study and no additional nonclinical, clinical efficacy and safety studies will be required to support the approval of Tadalafil-Finasteride combination capsules via a 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. The Company plans to complete the bioequivalence study in 2018 and to file the NDA in 2019.
 ﻿
 Prior to the completion of the APP Acquisition, the Company had been a single product company, focused on manufacturing, marketing and selling the Female Condom (FC2) in the public sector.  FC2 is the only currently available female-controlled product approved for market by the FDA and cleared by the World Health Organization (WHO) for purchase by U.N. agencies that provides dual protection against unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV/AIDS and the Zika virus.  In 2017, The Company established new commercial sales channels for US market to generate new revenue. Nearly all of the Company’s net revenues for fiscal 2017 were derived from sales of FC2.
 ﻿
 Company History
 ﻿
 Veru Inc. is the successor to The Wisconsin Pharmacal Company, Inc. (Wisconsin Pharmacal), a company which manufactured and marketed disparate specialty chemical and branded consumer products. Wisconsin Pharmacal was originally incorporated in 1971.
 ﻿
 The FDA approved the Company's first generation Female Condom, FC1, for distribution in the U.S. in 1993 and approved the Company's U.K. FC1 manufacturing facility in 1994.  Prior to 1996, Wisconsin Pharmacal owned certain rights to the Female Condom in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.  In 1996, the Company completed a series of actions which resulted in the Company's acquisition of worldwide rights to FC1, the divestiture of Wisconsin Pharmacal's other businesses and the change of the Company's name to "The Female Health Company."  As a result of these actions, the Company's sole business consisted of the manufacture, marketing, and sale of the FC1 Female Condom. 
 ﻿
 In 2005, the Company completed the development of its second generation Female Condom (FC2).  FC2 was first marketed internationally in March 2007 and has been marketed in the U.S. since August 2009.  FC2 was approved by the FDA as a Class III medical device on March 10, 2009.  In addition to FDA approval, FC2 has been approved by other regulatory agencies, including the European Union, India, and Brazil.  Based on a rigorous scientific review, WHO cleared FC2 for purchase by U.N. agencies in 2006.  
 ﻿
 On October 31, 2016, the Company completed the APP Acquisition.  Pursuant to the APP Acquisition, the outstanding shares of APP common stock and preferred stock were converted into the right to receive in the aggregate 2,000,000 shares of our common stock and 546,756 shares of our Class A Convertible Preferred Stock - Series 4 (the Series 4 Preferred Stock).  Effective as of July 31, 2017, the shares of Series 4 Preferred Stock converted into a total of 21,870,240 shares of common stock, resulting in the total issuance of 23,870,240 shares of common stock to the former stockholders of APP in the transaction.  The total estimated purchase price of approximately $19,807,980 was based on the closing price of our common stock of $0.95 per share on October 31, 2016 and certain 

 
5


discounts due to lack of liquidity and other factors. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statement for detail on how the purchase price was determined.
 ﻿
 Strategy
 ﻿
 Our goal is to be a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on urology and oncology by developing a portfolio of pharmaceutical products that address significant health needs in large potential markets.  We have combined the revenue and cash flows from the market leading FC2 female condom with APP's deep pipeline of pharmaceutical and consumer health product candidates.  Initially, we intend to focus on the three low-cost, near-term and potentially high-reward programs that are expected to qualify for the abbreviated 505(b)(2) FDA regulatory pathway: Tamsulosin DRS and Tamsulosin XR capsules for BPH and VERU-944 for hot flashes in men taking hormonal therapies for advanced prostate cancer.  The 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway can result in a much less expensive and faster route to approval, compared with the traditional 505(b)(1) regulatory development path, while creating new, differentiated products with potentially high commercial value. The Company is also developing new chemical entities such as VERU-111 for the treatment of metastatic prostate, breast, endometrial, ovarian, and other cancers and VERU-111/112 for the prevention and treatment of gout and Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) via the traditional 505(b)(1) regulatory development pathway.
 ﻿
 The key elements of our strategy are as follows:
 ﻿

· | Obtain regulatory approvals of products in North America, Europe and Asia. Assuming the successful completion of clinical trials, we expect to file, or a partner will file on our behalf, for regulatory approval of our pharmaceutical products in North America, Europe and Asia, including Tamsulosin DRS and Tamsulosin XR capsules for the treatment of BPH, Solifenacin DRG for the treatment of OAB, Tadalafil/Finasteride combination capsules for the initial treatment of BPH in men with enlarged prostate, VERU-722 for the treatment of male infertility, VERU-944 for the treatment of hot flashes in men on prostate cancer hormonal therapies, VERU-111 for the treatment of metastatic prostate, breast, endometrial, ovarian, and other cancers and VERU-111/112 for the prevention and treatment of gout and Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF).

  ﻿

· | Develop a portfolio of urology and oncology pharmaceutical products. We have developed or acquired development and marketing rights to a portfolio of urology and oncology pharmaceutical products and intend to continue to acquire, in-license and develop new pharmaceutical products that we believe offer unique market opportunities and/or complement existing product lines. We have adopted a three-tier strategy with respect to licensing or acquiring new products and technologies designed to diversify the risks inherent in traditional new chemical entity pharmaceutical development: (i) license or acquire fully-developed, FDA-approved products that have development potential and offer certain market protection against competitors, such as patent rights, marketing exclusivity or orphan drug designation; (ii) create differentiated products with potentially high commercial value by selecting a new indication for or modifying existing FDA-approved products utilizing the 505(b)(2) FDA approval pathway; and (iii) identify and acquire products and technologies in late preclinical or early clinical stages of development to minimize the time and expense of development.

  ﻿

· | Focus on products with significant potential commercial opportunities in urology and oncology markets. We intend to focus on developing drugs that we believe have potential significant commercial opportunities in markets. The core areas of interest include BPH, overactive bladder, sexual dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, cancer treatments for prostate, breast, endometrial, ovarian and other cancers, amelioration of prostate cancer hormonal therapy side effects including hot flashes and bone loss, and male infertility. We believe that these areas of the pharmaceutical market are large, growth markets. Through continued specialization as a urology and oncology company and by continuing to refine its capabilities in clinical research and development and marketing, we believe we can develop a strong position to be a leader in these markets.

  ﻿

· | Develop business and enhance research through strategic alliances. A key component of our business strategy is to leverage the resources gained from each collaboration to expand our technology and operations base. In addition, we believe outsources functions to health science companies (CROs), collaborations with academic centers and small discovery innovative companies will supplement the scientific resources available to us and broaden access to rapidly emerging drug discovery candidates. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Develop opportunities in the consumer and prescription markets. The Company believes that there are opportunities to develop the prescription market for FC2, and that such marketing of FC2 will complement the consumer launch of PREBOOST®. The Company appointed a Chief Commercial Officer for Veru to oversee the implementation of its marketing plan for FC2 by prescription and PREBOOST®, as well as the future prelaunch and launch activities for Tamsulosin DRS, Tamsulosin XR capsules, Solifenacin DRG, and Tadalafil/Finasteride combination capsules.

 Tamsulosin DRS (tamsulosin HCl 0.4mg  for extended release oral suspension) and Tamsulosin 0.4mg XR capsules (tamsulosin HCl extended release capsules)  for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms of BPH.
 ﻿
 Scientific Overview.  Tamsulosin DRS is a new slow release granule formulation containing the active pharmaceutical ingredient in FLOMAX® (tamsulosin HCl) capsules which is a commonly used medicine for the treatment of symptoms of BPH, also known as enlargement of the prostate.  FLOMAX® is indicated for the treatment of symptoms of BPH.  Tamsulosin is a selective alpha1 adrenergic receptor blocking drug that is specific for the alpha1 adrenergic receptors located in the smooth muscle of the prostate and bladder neck.  Symptoms associated with BPH occur, at least in part, as a result of increased smooth muscle tone of the prostate and bladder which leads to constriction of urinary flow, urinary retention, urinary infection, kidney damage and life threatening blood infection called urosepsis.  Blocking these alpha1 adrenergic receptors relaxes the smooth muscles of the prostate and bladder neck resulting in the improvement of urinary flow rate and alleviation of the symptoms of BPH.  As stated on the FDA approved package insert, FLOMAX® capsules should not be crushed, chewed or opened, because doing so changes the speed by which the drug is absorbed into the bloodstream.  Further, FLOMAX® capsules can only be taken after a meal. It has a “food effect” such that, if  FLOMAX ® is not taken with food, the drug gets in too fast and men are placed at higher risk for dizziness and postural hypotension (sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing that can lead to fainting). Tablets and capsules are problematic for 15% of men over the age of 60 in the general community and the up to 60% of men in long term facilities who have difficulty or cannot swallow tablets and capsules because of certain medical conditions, including degenerative neurological diseases like Parkinson's, having suffered a stroke, and Alzheimer’s disease.  Not being able to take an alpha blocker drug for BPH, like FLOMAX®, because of difficulty or not able to swallow tablets and capsules may lead to the increased risk of acute urinary retention, urinary catheterization, urosepsis and death.  These men are currently managed with diapers, catheters, or surgery. Because Tamsulosin DRS is a new proprietary slow release granule formulation containing the active pharmaceutical ingredient in FLOMAX®, it would provide a more convenient and reliable way to deliver therapeutic levels of tamsulosin to men who have difficulty or cannot swallow tablets and capsules. 
 ﻿
 Development Plan.  This new formulation called Tamsulosin DRS contains the same active pharmaceutical ingredient, tamsulosin, that is found in FLOMAX® (tamsulosin HCl 0.4mg) capsules and, as such, would be expected to have the same efficacy and safety as FLOMAX®. This information can be referenced under a 505(b)(2) NDA submission for Tamsulosin DRS. On August 12, 2016, the FDA agreed that the Company's Tamsulosin DRS medication, a proprietary slow release granules formulation for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms of BPH, a $3.5 billion market, qualifies for the expedited 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway.  In March 2017, the Company initiated a Stage 1 (pilot) bioequivalence clinical study for Tamsulosin DRS, and in April 2017, announced the successful completion of Stage 1 of the bioequivalence clinical study, which demonstrated that the blood levels of the Tamsulosin DRS over time were bioequivalent to FLOMAX®. In August 2017, the Company initiated Stage 2 of the bioequivalence clinical study of Tamsulosin DRS and in November 2017 announced the results of Stage 2 of the bioequivalence clinical study.  During the Stage 2 bioequivalence clinical study, dosing with Tamsulosin DRS fasted and Tamsulosin DRS fed were successfully shown to be bioequivalent with FLOMAX® fed based on AUC, which is the key determinant of drug exposure over time.  The Tamsulosin DRS formulation did not meet the remaining bioequivalence criterion for peak value (Cmax). The Company intends to initiate a new bioequivalence study after adjusting the formulation to address Cmax and expects this study to be completed in the first half of 2018.  Unlike FLOMAX®, the new tamsulosin granule formulation, based on the bioequivalence studies, does not appear to have a food effect which means that the new formulation may be administered without food. This difference may have a market advantage not only for men who cannot swallow capsules, but also for men who can swallow capsules. As a consequence, the Company is also developing Tamsulosin XR (extended release) capsules, which contain the new formulated granules, for the urology and primary care markets. The Company does not believe that the new bioequivalence study will affect the timing of its planned submission of an NDA for Tamsulosin DRS and Tamsulosin XR capsules and, if the new bioequivalence study is successful, plans to submit the NDA in the first half of 2018. In addition, the Company plans to meet with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to discuss the requirements to file a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) in EU in 2018.
 ﻿
 Market.  The initial commercialization plan for Tamsulosin DRS granule formulation is to target men in long term care facilities and men in the community who have difficulty or cannot swallow tablets and capsules. Currently, tamsulosin oral suspension is not currently available,and if approved, would be the only oral suspension formulation that would be available on formularies in long term care pharmacies. A sales force is not required for this product as pharmacists and physicians in long term care facilities would identify patients that would benefit from this formulation.. Tamsulosin XR capsules, however, will be marketed to urology and primary care physicians, and the Company will either commercialize itself or seek marketing and sales partnerships. Based on IMS data, FLOMAX® and generic tamsulosin sales from March 2014 to March 2015 were $3.5 billion in the U.S.  The U.S. market for all alpha blockers for BPH is estimated to be $4.5 billion annually per IMS.  Men in long term care or nursing homes have up to a 60% prevalence of swallowing difficulties and account for about 13% of total tamsulosin sales, whereas over 15% of men over 60 years of age in the general population have difficulty swallowing tablets and capsules. Tamsulosin DRS and Tamsulosin XR capsules, if approved, will be new branded, not generic products.

 Solifenacin Delayed Release Granules (DRG) (solifenacin succinate for extended release oral suspension) for the treatment of overactive bladder.  
 ﻿
 Scientific Overview.  Solifenacin DRS is a new proprietary granule formulation containing the active pharmaceutical ingredient in VESIcare® (Solifenacin 5mg or 10 mg tablets). Solifenacin is a competitive selective M3 muscarinic receptor antagonist.  Solifenacin is indicated for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB) which are symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency in men and women. Muscarinic receptors play a major role in mediating contractions of the urinary bladder. 
 ﻿
 Development Plan. In November 2017 PreIND meeting, FDA confirmed that Solifenacin DRG qualifies for a 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. FDA also agreed that a single bioequivalence study will be sufficient to support the approval of Solifenacin DRG product for the treatment of overactive bladder and no additional nonclinical, clinical efficacy and/or safety studies will be required.. The Company plans to complete the Solifenacin DRG bioequivalence study in 2018 and to file the NDA in 2019. 
 ﻿
 Market. Solifenacin DRS (solifenacin succinate extended release for oral suspension) is a new proprietary oral extended release granule formulation being developed for men and women with overactive bladder and dysphagia, difficulty or cannot swallow pills or capsules. In the US, the prevalence of OAB was similar in women and men, at 16.9% and 16%, respectively. According to the US Department of Health and Human Services (2014), up to 36.7% of short-term residents and 70.3% of long-term nursing home residents were not in complete control of their bladder (2014). Annual sales for VESIcare® tablets (5 mg and 10 mg) were approximately $1.1 billion dollars according to IMS Health 2017 sales data and worldwide annual direct costs of OAB are expected to be greater than 10 billion dollars by 2018. Like OAB, dysphagia (swallowing difficulty) is also a growing health issue in our aging population.  Up to 38% of elderly who live independently and up to 68% of elderly nursing home residents have difficulty swallowing. Swallowing difficulties are particularly prevalent in people who have Parkinson’s Disease (80%), Alzheimer’s Disease (40-70%) and Stroke (50%). These are the same conditions that are associated with OAB, and unfortunately, currently available selective M3 muscarinic receptor antagonists, including solifenacin, are only available as tablets. According to FDA label, tablets should be swallowed whole and not chewed, crushed or broken. Currently, Solifenacin DRG oral suspension is not currently available, and if approved, would be the only oral suspension formulation of a M3 muscarinic antagonist that would be available on formularies in long term care pharmacies. A sales force is not required for this product as pharmacists and physicians in long term care facilities would identify patients that would benefit from this formulation. 
 ﻿
 Tadalafil-Finasteride combination capsules (tadalafil 5mg and finasteride 5mg) for the initial treatment of men with lower urinary tract symptoms and enlarged prostate 
 ﻿
 Scientific Overview. Tadalafil-Finasteride combination capsule is a new, proprietary formulation that addresses men who have lower urinary tract symptoms and restricted urinary stream because of an enlarged prostate. CIALIS® (tadalafil 5mg) and PROSCAR® (finasteride 5mg) co-administration is indicated for the initial treatment of BPH for up to 26 weeks. CIALIS® (Tadalafil 5mg) is a phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor and PROSCAR® (finasteride 5mg) is a Type 2, 5 alpha reductase inhibitor. Tadalafil 5mg daily has been approved for the treatment of erectile dysfunction and BPH. Finasteride 5mg has been approved the treatment of BPH: to improve symptoms, to reduce risk of acute urinary retention and the need for prostate surgery, and to prevent progression of BPH. 
 ﻿
 Development plan. In a November 2017 PreIND meeting, FDA confirmed that Tadalafil/Finasteride combination capsules qualifies for a 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. FDA also agreed that a single bioequivalence study and no additional nonclinical, clinical efficacy and/or safety studies will be required to support the approval of Tadalafil/Finasteride combination capsules for the initial treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in men with enlarged prostates. The Company plans to complete the Tadalafil/Finasteride combination capsules bioequivalence study in 2018 and to file the NDA in 2019.
 ﻿
 Market. The worldwide prevalence of BPH lower urinary symptoms is estimated to be 10-25% of the male population and will rise to 1.1 billion men by 2018. Currently, co-adminstration of CIALIS® and PROSCAR® is currently FDA approved for the initial treatment of signs and symptoms of BPH up to 26 weeks.  According to Elkelany O et al. (Therapeutics and Clinical Risk Management 11:507-513, 2015), other men who may benefit from this co-administration include: 1) men who have a suboptimal response to 5 alpha reductase inhibitors alone (PROSCAR®(finasteride) or AVODART®(dutasteride)) 2) men who have a suboptimal response to an alpha blocker alone (FLOMAX® (tamsulosin), HYTRIN® (terazocin), UROXATRAL® (alfuzosin), CARDURA® (doxazosin), and RAPAFLO® (silodosin)) or in combination with a 5 alpha reductase inhibitor (JALYN® (dutasteride/tamsulosin combination)) and 3) men who have an optimal response to 5 alpha reductase inhibitors, but who also have erectile dysfunction. A Tadalafil 5mg / Finasteride 5mg combination capsule is not currently available.  A combination capsule would increase convenience and drug compliance. Poor compliance with a BPH medicine could lead to increase chance of acute urinary retention, urosepsis, and death. The Company would consider marketing and sales efforts of this product to urology, but seek co-promotion partners for primary care physicians in US.  The company would seek pharmaceutical partnerships in territories outside the US.

VERU-944 (cis-clomiphene citrate) for the treatment of hot flashes caused by prostate cancer hormonal therapies in men with advanced prostate cancer.
 ﻿
 Scientific Overview.  Prostate cancer is the most common noncutaneous cancer diagnosed in men, with over 161,000 new cases in the U.S. in 2017.  The estimated prevalence of prostate cancer in the U.S. is 2.35 million cases for which over one-third will have received androgen deprivation therapy.  Hot flashes, also known as vasomotor symptoms, are the most common and distressing side effect of prostate cancer hormonal therapies.  Hormone therapies include androgen deprivation, like LUPRON® (leuprolide) or ZOLADEX® (goserelin), as well as the newer agents approved to treat advanced prostate cancer such as ZYTIGA® (abiraterone) and XTANDI® (enzalutamide).  Up to 80% of men on androgen deprivation therapy complain of hot flashes and 30-40% will have moderate to severe hot flashes.  Hot flashes are defined as intense heat sensation, flushing and profuse sweating and chills as well as anxiety and palpitations.  Although episodes of hot flashes occur repeatedly and last a few minutes, some may last up to 20 minutes.  Hot flashes associated with prostate cancer hormonal therapies tend to persist over time with the same frequency and intensity throughout therapy.  Up to 50% of men continue to report hot flashes after five years on prostate cancer hormonal therapy.  Patients on prostate cancer hormonal therapy report significant effects on daily functioning and quality of life.  Hot flashes are one of the main reasons for patients to be noncompliant with their prostate cancer hormonal therapy.  As prostate cancer patients with advanced and metastatic disease are living longer because of more effective hormonal therapies, hot flashes have become an even bigger concern and impact on quality of life.
     Hormonal and nonhormonal therapies have been used off-label to treat hot flashes in men on prostate cancer hormonal therapies.  In general, hormonal agents especially estrogens have been shown off-label to be helpful for  treating hot flashes.  However, estrogen treatment is complicated by lack of consistent dosing, dose dependent gynecomastia (breast enlargement), gynecodynia (painful breasts), and increase in thromboembolic events.  Nonhormonal agents that have been also used off-label include anti-seizure agents and antidepressants that have serious side effects.  Moreover, nonhormonal agents tend to be less effective than hormonal therapies for the treatment of hot flashes.  There are no FDA-approved therapies for hot flashes caused by prostate cancer hormonal therapy in men with advanced prostate cancer.  CLOMID® (clomiphene citrate), which contains 30-50% zuclomiphene, appears to be well-tolerated in 39 published studies in over 2,200 men with doses as high as 400 mg/day and up to three years of use.  CLOMID® (clomiphene citrate) also contains the trans-isomer, enclomiphene which causes hot flashes as such CLOMID® (clomiphene citrate) and generics cannot substitute for VERU-944 as they will actually exacerbate hot flashes. VERU-944 is the pure cis-clomiphene.  Cis-clomiphene is a potent nonsteroidal estrogen receptor agonist.  We believe that a nonsteroidal hormone therapy like VERU-944 has the potential to be an effective and well tolerated treatment for hot flashes caused by prostate cancer hormonal therapies in men with advanced prostate cancer.
 ﻿
 Development Plan. As VERU-944, cis-clomiphene, comprises 30-50% of CLOMID® (clomiphene citrate) which is approved for the treatment of ovulatory dysfunction in women desiring pregnancy, the Company believes that it will be able to reference parts of the nonclinical and clinical safety information from both the listed drug labeling and the published literature under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway.  On May 24, 2017, the Company announced that, following a Pre-IND meeting with the FDA in which the Company received concurrence on the 505(b)(2) pathway, that FDA agreed with plan to advance the proprietary drug candidate, VERU-944 (cis-clomiphene), into a dose finding Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of hot flashes in men receiving hormone therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer. Approximately 80% of men receiving one of the common forms of ADT, including LUPRON® (leuprolide), ELIGARD®(leuprolide) and FIRMAGON®(degarelix), experience hot flashes.  The Company expects to file an IND with the FDA and begin the Phase 2 dose finding clinical trial to evaluate VERU-944 for the treatment of hot flashes in men on androgen deprivation therapy in the first half of 2018.
 ﻿
 Market.  Hot flashes are the most common side effect of prostate cancer hormone therapy occurring in up to 80% of men, with about 30-40% having moderate to severe hot flashes.  Approximately 700,000 men annually in the United States are on androgen deprivation therapy, abiraterone, or enzalutamide for advanced prostate cancer.  There are currently no FDA-approved therapies for hot flashes associated with prostate cancer hormonal therapies.  The annual U.S. market for the treatment of hot flashes in men on prostate cancer hormonal therapies is estimated to be $600 million.
 ﻿
 VERU-722 (Fixed ratio of trans- and cis- clomiphene citrate isomers) for the treatment of male infertility related to testicular dysfunction.
 ﻿
 Scientific Overview.  Up to 10% of infertile men have an endocrine cause and 2% of infertile men have an adult onset form of idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.  Current FDA-approved treatments for this indication include Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) and Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) injections.  There are no FDA-approved oral therapies for male infertility. CLOMID® (clomiphene citrate) 50mg tablets are being used off-label as first line empiric therapy in 90% of idiopathic infertile men.  CLOMID® is FDA-approved for the treatment of ovulatory dysfunction in women desiring pregnancy.  CLOMID is a mixture of two geometric isomers cis-clomiphene (zuclomiphene) and trans-clomiphene (enclomiphene) containing between 30-50% of the cis-clomiphene isomer.  Trans-clomiphene has antiestrogenic activity, while the cis-clomiphene has estrogenic activity.  In men, clomiphene has the ability interact with the hypothalamus and pituitary gland to cause the secretion of Luteinizing Hormone (LH), and 

 
10


the higher levels of LH will stimulate Leydig cells in the testes to produce testosterone, to promote spermatogenesis, and to improve sperm count and quality.
 Based on the scientific literature, clomiphene has demonstrated the ability to improve sperm quality and sperm counts in infertile men and result in higher pregnancy rates.  Based on 39 published studies, clomiphene appears to be well tolerated in men with doses as high as 400 mg/day and up to three years of use.  However, the efficacy results for an individual patient have been inconsistent from study to study for several reasons: the form of clomiphene used contains varying ratios of the trans- and cis-clomiphene isomers, different doses were given, various dosing schedules were followed and different patient populations were studied.  Clomiphene has not been formally studied for regulatory approval for the indication of male infertility; therefore, there is no established dose or schedule for efficacy or safety in men.  VERU-722 is a patented, proprietary daily oral tablet that has a specific fixed ratio of the combination of trans- and cis-clomiphene isomers.
 ﻿
 Development Plan.  VERU-722 is being developed as the first FDA-approved oral agent for the treatment of male infertility.  VERU-722 has fixed ratio of the combination of trans- and cis- clomiphene isomers.  We believe that using a fixed ratio approach will allow the determination of the correct dose and schedule for efficacy and safety for the treatment of male infertility.  The patient population will be men who have hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and oligozoospermia (low sperm count).  We met with the FDA for a pre-IND meeting on May 28, 2015 where the FDA confirmed that VERU-722 qualifies for the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway.  The formulation, doses and dosing regimen for VERU-722 will differ from those of CLOMID®.  Despite the differences, the approval of VERU-722 will rely on nonclinical and clinical efficacy and safety information from the listed drug labeling and in the published literature.  On December 6, 2016, the Company was invited to discuss our clinical trial design and plans with the FDA as part of The Bone, Reproductive, and Urologic Drugs FDA Advisory Committee Meeting.  Based on positive regulatory recommendations by the BRUD FDA Advisory Committee, we are reviewing our plans to file an IND and possibly initiate a Phase 2 clinical study.  
 ﻿
 Market.  If approved, VERU-722 will be indicated as the first oral treatment for male infertility. Infertility affects 6.1 million couples in the United States representing 15% of all couples trying to conceive.  Up to 50% of infertility is attributed to males who are subsequently found to have abnormal semen analysis, of which 50% of these men are diagnosed with idiopathic, or unexplained, infertility.  Ninety percent of men with idiopathic male infertility are empirically treated with off-label use of CLOMID®.  VERU-722 may be effective in treating male factor infertility caused by testicular dysfunction [low sperm concentration (oligozoospermia) and low testosterone blood levels (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism)].  The current U.S. market size for male infertility is estimated to be $700 million annually based on current off-label use of CLOMID® and clomiphene generics prescription data (IMS).
 ﻿
 VERU-111, a novel oral therapy targeting alpha and beta tubulin for the treatment of metastatic prostate, breast, endometrial ovarian, and other cancers.
 ﻿
 Scientific Overview.  In 2017, there were approximately 161,000 new cases of prostate cancer in the U.S. and about 25% will die from the disease.  In the U.S., 5% of men with prostate cancer will have metastatic cancer and up to 30% of men with high-risk, localized prostate cancer will develop metastatic cancer following initial therapy.  The median survival of patients with metastatic prostate cancer ranges from 3.2-4.5 years.  For these men, the 1st line therapy is androgen deprivation therapy, or medical castration. Although most will initially respond, nearly all these patients will progress to metastatic castration resistant prostate and have a poor prognosis with an average survival of 1.5 years.  New 2nd line hormonal agents, like XTANDI® (enzalutamide) and ZYTIGA® (abiraterone/prednisone) have resulted in an additional four to five months of average survival, but again, nearly all men on these agents will develop progressive metastatic prostate cancer.
 ﻿
 Agents that target tubulin, the subunits of microtubules, have been shown to be the most effective targeted cytotoxic chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. Microtubules are critical for cancer cell replication and to shuttle the androgen receptor into the nucleus where the receptor stimulates genes for cancer cell proliferation.  Docetaxel and cabazitaxel are examples of FDA-approved chemotherapy drugs that are given intravenously (IV) that target tubulin to treat metastatic prostate cancer.  Although effective, the challenges for this class of chemotherapy agents, also known as taxanes, include that they must be given intravenously (IV) and that the cancer cells develop resistance to taxanes. There are also serious safety concerns with IV taxanes which include serious hypersensitivity reactions, myelosuppression and neurotoxicity such as peripheral neuropathy and muscle weakness.
 ﻿
 VERU-111 is a novel small molecule that is a new chemical entity (NCE) that has been optimized to be a novel oral therapy targeting alpha and beta tubulin subunits of microtubules. Unlike taxanes which bind to just the beta subunit of tubulin, VERU-111 binds strongly to both the alpha and beta subunits of tubulin.  VERU-111 has high oral bioavailability; less resistance as it does not interact with multiple drug resistance proteins so it cannot be pumped out of the cancer cell; minimal drug to drug interactions especially not metabolized by CYP3A4, and has high activity against many tumor types including prostate cancer resistant to drugs like enzalutamide, AR-V7 positive, and taxanes as well as triple negative breast cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, and melanoma.  In preclinical studies, VERU-111 appears to have less neurotoxicity and leukopenia compared to taxanes and vinca alkaloids chemotherapy agents. 
 ﻿
 Development Plan.  The Company plans to develop VERU-111 initially as a treatment for men with metastatic prostate cancer that have failed hormonal therapy and therefore their disease has progressed.  The Company is also evaluating the drug in other cancer 

 
11


types that are historically known to be sensitive to taxane based chemotherapies including metastatic breast, ovarian and endometrial cancers. Production of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and preclinical safety toxicology studies required for an IND are expected to be completed in 2018, anticipate filing IND in early 2018, and Phase 1/2 studies are planned for 2018.  The Company is partnering with The Johns Hopkins Hospital Cancer Center and their cancer center network to conduct the Phase 1/2 clinical studies. Phase 1 studies of VERU-111 are planned in men who have metastatic prostate cancer that has progressed while taking androgen deprivation therapy and abiraterone or enzalutamide as well as in patients with metastatic breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancers.
 ﻿
 Market.  In the U.S., there is a $5 billion annual market for 2nd line hormone therapies for prostate cancer and a $4.8 billion annual market for IV-given taxanes and vinca alkaloids chemotherapies (docetaxel $1 billion and cabazitaxel $500 million in prostate cancer) per Decision Resources Group and Allied Market Research.  Second line hormonal therapies like enzalutamide and abiraterone/prednisone have almost complete cross-resistance and should not be used in sequence for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer.  VERU-111, as an oral therapy targeting alpha and beta tubulin, could be substituted for IV given docetaxel and cabazitaxel antitubulin chemotherapies.  VERU-111 could also be developed a 1st line therapy given with androgen deprivation in men who have hormone sensitive, high volume prostate cancer where androgen deprivation therapy and docetaxel have been shown in several studies to increase survival in these men by 17-21 months.  Another 1st line indication could be developed in men who have metastatic prostate cancer and splice variants of the androgen receptor including a common variant known as AR-V7.  Prostate cancer hormone therapies are not effective in men who have AR-V7.  However, this type of cancer appears to respond to docetaxel and may be potentially treated by a novel oral therapy targeting alpha and beta tubulin like VERU-111.  VERU-111 could also be developed as an oral dosing alternative to chemotherapies for the treatment of metastatic breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancers as these tumors that responded to IV taxane chemotherapies.

 VERU-111/VERU-112 for the treatment of gout and Familial Mediterranean Fever.
 ﻿
 Scientific Overview.  Colchicine is FDA-approved for prophylaxis and treatment of gout flares in adults (0.6-1.2mg/day) and for FMF in adult and children four years and older (0.3-2.4mg/ day depending on age).  Gout is a type of arthritis characterized by sudden, severe attacks of burning joint pain, usually the big toe, because of the deposition of uric acid crystals in the joint.  The attacks can be recurrent and last a few days to many weeks until there is pain relief.  Gout is a disease of high levels of uric acid in the blood and is ten times more common in men than women.  Colchicine is effective to prevent and to treat acute attacks. 
 ﻿
 FMF is a hereditary inflammatory disorder caused by mutations in the MEFV gene that causes episodes of fever, pain and swelling in the abdomen (peritonitis), lungs (pleuritis), heart (pericarditis) and joints (arthritis) in adults and children.  Signs and symptoms of FMF usually begin in childhood with attacks that last for weeks or months.  Colchicine is considered the gold standard and the only drug recommended for treating FMF.  Colchicine is used at low doses to prevent and treat these FMF patients chronically.
 ﻿
 Colchicine has a narrow therapeutic index which means that the doses required to treat the disease and the occurrences of serious safety issues are close.  Colchicine has common side effects such as abdominal cramping, nausea and diarrhea that have limited its use.  More concerning, however, colchicine has "warning and precautions" in the label for drug-drug interactions and should not be taken in conjunction with other drugs that are P-gycoprotein (P-gp) or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors as this could lead to serious side effects and death.  Examples of drugs and other items that could increase the concentration of colchicine in the blood into toxic ranges include certain antibiotics, antidepressants, lipid lowering drugs, tranquilizers, grapefruit juice and antihistamines.
 ﻿
 VERU-111, and its back up VERU-112, are NCEs, small molecules that have high oral bioavailability, and like colchicine, bind to the "colchicine binding site" of tubulin.  Unlike colchicine, there should not be drug-drug interactions, as VERU-111 does not interact with P-gp or CYP3A4. This may potentially eliminate the possibility of serious and life-threatening side effects when given with other drugs that are P-gp or CYP3A4 inhibitors.  VERU-111/112 could be used as a potentially safer alternative to colchicine, which remains the mainstay of therapy for both prevention and treatment of gout and FMF.
 ﻿
 Development Plan.  The Phase 1 VERU-111 studies that are planned in 2018 in cancer patients will provide the initial pharmacokinetics and safety information that can be used for dosing and safety considerations for filing the IND and conducting the Phase 2 studies for gout expected in 2019.
 ﻿
 Market.  According to nationally representative data (NHANES), gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis in men, with a prevalence of 5.9% in men (6.1 million) and in women the prevalence is 2% (2.2 million).  The estimated U.S. annual market for gout therapies is $725 million per IMS.  FMF affects primarily people of Mediterranean extraction, mostly Sephardic Jews, Armenians, Arabs and Turks.  It is very common in the populations at risk with estimated carrier rates of 1/6 in Armenians, 1/7 in North African Jews and 1/13 in Iraqi Jews. FMF affects less than 200,000 patients in the U.S. population and could be eligible for orphan drug status.

FC2 for dual protection against unintended pregnancy and STIs.
 ﻿
 Product.  FC2 is the only currently available female-controlled product approved for market by FDA and cleared by the WHO for purchase by U.N. agencies that provides dual protection against unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections STIs, including HIV/AIDS and the Zika virus. FC2 was approved for market by FDA as a Class III medical device in 2009.
 ﻿
 FC2 has basically the same physical design, specifications, safety, and efficacy profile as FC1, the Company's first generation Female Condom.  Manufactured from a nitrile polymer formulation that is exclusive to the Company, FC2 is produced more economically than FC1, which was made from a more costly raw material, polyurethane.   FC2 consists of a soft, loose fitting sheath and two rings: an external ring of rolled nitrile and a loose internal ring made of flexible polyurethane.  FC2’s soft sheath lines the vagina, preventing skin-to-skin contact during intercourse.  Its external ring remains outside the vagina, partially covering the external genitalia. The internal ring is used for insertion and helps keep the device in place during use.
 ﻿
 FC2’s primary raw material, a nitrile polymer, offers a number of benefits over natural rubber latex, the raw material most commonly used in male condoms.  FC2’s nitrile polymer is stronger than latex, reducing the probability that the female condom sheath will tear during use. Unlike latex, FC2’s nitrile polymer quickly transfers heat.  FC2 can warm to body temperature immediately upon insertion, which may enhance the user’s sensation and pleasure. Unlike the male condom, FC2 may be inserted in advance of arousal, eliminating disruption during sexual intimacy. FC2 is also an alternative to latex sensitive users who are unable to use male condoms without irritation. For example, 7 percent to 20 percent of the individuals with significant exposure to latex rubber (i.e., health care workers) experience such irritation. To the Company's knowledge, there is no reported allergy to the nitrile polymer.  FC2 is pre-lubricated, disposable, and recommended for use during a single sex act.  FC2 is not reusable.
 ﻿
 Global Public Health Sector Market.  FC2’s primary use is for disease prevention and family planning, and the global public health sector has been the main market for FC2. Within the public health sector, various organizations supply critical products such as FC2, at no cost or low cost, to those who need but cannot afford to buy such products for themselves.
 ﻿
 The Company has a relatively small customer base for FC2, with a limited number of customers who generally purchase in large quantities. Over the past few years, significant customers have included large global agencies, such as the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Sekunjalo Investments Corporation (PTY) Ltd (Sekunjalo), the Company’s distributor in the Republic of South Africa (RSA), and the Brazil Ministry of Health either through UNFPA or Semina Indústria e Comércio Ltda (Semina), the Company’s distributor in Brazil.  Other customers include ministries of health or other governmental agencies, which either purchase directly or via in-country distributors, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).  
 ﻿
 FC2 has been distributed in 144 countries.  A significant number of countries with the highest demand potential are in the developing world.  The incidence of HIV/AIDS, other STIs, and unwanted pregnancy in these countries represents a remarkable potential for significant sales of a product that benefits some of the world’s most underprivileged people.  However, conditions in these countries can be volatile and result in unpredictable delays in program development, tender applications, and processing orders.
 ﻿
 The global public health sector market for male condoms is estimated to be greater than 8-10 billion units annually. The private sector market for male condoms is estimated at 10-15 billion units annually. The combined global male condom market (public and private sector) is estimated at a value of $4.5 billion annually.  The female condom market represents a very small portion of the total global condom market, yet 50 percent of individuals living with HIV/AIDS are women.  As a result a number of independent women’s groups are advocating for increased investment in and distribution of female condoms on a gender equality basis.
 ﻿
 The Company has distribution agreements and other arrangements with commercial partners which market as a consumer health product through distributors and retailers in 16 countries, including Brazil, Spain, France, and the United Kingdom. These agreements are generally exclusive for a single country. Under these agreements, the Company sells FC2 to the distributor partners, who market and distribute the product to consumers in the established territory. 
 ﻿
 U.S. Market.    ﻿
 Recent changes in the U.S. market provided an opportunity for the promotion and expansion of FC2 to protect against STIs and unwanted pregnancies. FC2 is the only device approved by the FDA (Class III medical device) for this use. As FC2 is nonhormonal, it is a viable alternative for many U.S. women who have reported dissatisfaction with the side effects of hormonal birth control. Moreover, there are unique groups of women such as breast cancer survivors who desire contraception and cannot take hormonal birth control because of this underlying condition.  FC2 is currently reimbursable by prescription under the Affordable Care Act.. In January 2017 we have built the necessary infrastructure to allow for broad access across the US. As a result, FC2 is now available through multiple access channels including: 98% of retail pharmacies, community based organizations, by prescription, telemedicine, universities, direct purchase and 340B qualified health care clinics, and directly to the public sector without distributors. Marketing and educational programs, both traditional and by digital and social media, are being developed and implemented to target health care 

 
13


providers (physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants), pharmacies, and women to coordinate awareness and access to FC2 that is fully reimbursable.
 ﻿
 PREBOOST® (4% benzocaine medicated individual wipes) for the prevention of premature ejaculation.    ﻿
 Scientific Overview.  Premature ejaculation is the most common sexual dysfunction and even more frequent than erectile dysfunction based on epidemiological studies.  Premature ejaculation is a self-reported diagnosis.  Men with premature ejaculation desire treatment; however, most are reluctant and unlikely to request treatment out of embarrassment.  Discrepancies also exist between the man and his partner's reports of the man's ejaculatory behavior as women have been found to report premature ejaculation affecting their relationship more often than their male partner. 
     There are no FDA-approved prescription products for premature ejaculation (PE).  PREBOOST® is a proprietary OTC male genital desensitizer used for the treatment of PE.  There are no prescription products for PE approved by the FDA.  Off-label use of antidepressants and PDE-5 inhibitors has had limited success because of inconsistent efficacy and unacceptable side effects.  Psychological counseling and behavioral therapy are also used with mixed results.  Of the consumer health products, the topical anesthetics are administered as sprays and gels.  The drawbacks of these approaches include inconsistent dosing leading to too much anesthetic and transference of the anesthetics to the partner.  PREBOOST® is compliant with the FDA monograph and is approved in the United States.  PREBOOST® is the only individually packaged medicated wipe that contains a desensitizing agent (benzocaine 4.0%).  The advantages are:  1) Convenient individually wrapped wipes so it is easier to carry and to be discreet, 2) The correct dose is delivered each time, 3) The medicine is applied topically and dries quickly which prevents the potential for transference to partner, and 4) Benzocaine at 4.0% temporarily desensitizes, but does not completely numb the penis.    ﻿
 Development Plan.  PREBOOST® is approved in the United States.  The Company has completed a Phase 4 clinical study of PREBOOST®.  The PREBOOST® Clinical Study enrolled 26 men aged 18 years or order in a heterosexual, monogamous relationship, with PE, defined as reported poor control over ejaculation, personal distress related to ejaculation and average intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) of two minutes or less on stopwatch measurement.  Subjects were randomized 2-to-1 to treatment with benzocaine wipes or placebo wipes, with men in the placebo group crossed over to the treatment group one month after randomization.  The primary outcome measure for the study was change in IELT at two months, with secondary outcomes including change in questionnaire assessments of global rating of distress, medication assessment and IPE.  Data showed that patients treated with benzocaine 4% wipes demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in IELT after the first month of treatment (2.75 minutes), with greater improvement after the second month (5.5 minutes), compared to placebo (1.8 minutes).  Men in the treatment group also reported greater improvement in distress relating to intercourse, control of ejaculation and satisfaction with sexual intercourse over the study period.  After treatment with PREBOOST®, 82 percent of men were no longer considered to have premature ejaculation.  Results showed that treatment was well tolerated.  
 ﻿
 Therefore, the results of the study showed that PREBOOST® prolonged time to ejaculation, supporting the clinical validity of PREBOOST® for the prevention of premature ejaculation.  The Company launched the product in the United States on January 6, 2017.
 ﻿
 Market.  Premature ejaculation is the most prevalent sexual disorder affecting one in four men and is more common than erectile dysfunction.  The estimated prevalence is 50 million men in United States and 60 million men in Europe.  There are no approved drugs for premature ejaculation and the OTC agents currently available are not optimal or effective.  Total worldwide market for premature ejaculation drugs and consumer health care products is estimated to be greater than $500 million.  The Company has entered into a co-promotion and distribution agreement for PREBOOST® with Timm Medical Technologies Inc.  The Company also plans to increase sales by having a sampling program targeting urologists, introducing the product through additional internet outlets including Walmart, CVS, Walgreens and other OTC distribution outlets, optimizing its internet ecommerce capabilities and digital marketing via www.preboost.com as well as through out-licensing opportunities for markets outside the United States.

 Government Regulation
 ﻿
 The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products and medical devices.  These agencies and other federal, state, and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, tracking, approval, import, export, advertising, and promotion of our products.
 ﻿
 FDA Regulation of Female Condoms.  Female condoms as a group were classified by the FDA as a Class III medical device in 1989.  Class III medical devices are deemed by the FDA to carry potential risks with use which must be tested prior to FDA market approval, referred to as Premarket Approval (PMA), for sale in the U.S.  As FC2 is a Class III medical device, prior to selling FC2 in the U.S., the Company was required to submit a PMA application containing technical information on the use of FC2, such as pre-clinical and clinical safety and efficacy studies, which was gathered together in a required format and content.  The FC2 PMA was approved for market by the FDA as a Class III medical device in March 2009.  It is possible that the FDA may consider reclassifying female 

 
14


condoms as Class II medical devices, which are not subject to PMA.  If the FDA were to reclassify female condoms as Class II medical devices, it may significantly reduce the barriers for other types of female condoms to enter the U.S. market.
 ﻿
 Pursuant to section 515(a)(3) of the Safe Medical Amendments Act of 1990 (the SMA Act), the FDA may temporarily suspend approval and initiate withdrawal of the PMA if the FDA finds that FC2 is unsafe or ineffective, or on the basis of new information with respect to the device, which, when evaluated together with information available at the time of approval, indicates a lack of reasonable assurance that the device is safe or effective under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling. Failure to comply with the conditions of FDA market approval invalidates the approval order. Commercial distribution of a device that is not in compliance with these conditions is a violation of the SMA Act.  As an FDA market approved medical device, the facilities in which FC2 is produced and tested are subject to periodic FDA inspection to ensure compliance with current Good Manufacturing Processes.  The Company’s most recent FDA inspection of its U.K. and Malaysian facilities was completed in September 2010.  The Chicago office was inspected by the FDA in October 2016 for activities related to being a registered agent.
 ﻿
 The FDA’s market approval order for FC2 includes conditions that relate to product labeling, including information on the package itself and instructions for use called a “package insert” which accompanies each product.  The Company believes it is in compliance with the FDA market approval order.
 ﻿
 FDA Regulation of Pharmaceutical Products.  The process required by the FDA before pharmaceutical product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 ﻿

· | nonclinical laboratory and animal tests, including some that must be conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | submission of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | adequate and well‑controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug candidate for its intended use;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources.  Prior to commencing the first clinical trial with a drug candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA.  The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30‑day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial by imposing a clinical hold.  In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin.  Submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial.  A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development.  Further, an independent institutional review board (IRB) for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial commences at that center.  Regulatory authorities or an IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.  Some studies also include a data safety monitoring board (DSMB), which receives special access to unblinded data during the clinical trial and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy.
 ﻿
 In general, for purposes of NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.
 ﻿

· | Phase 1—Studies are initially conducted to test the drug candidate for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion in healthy volunteers or patients.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Phase 2—Studies are conducted with groups of patients with a specified disease or condition to provide enough data to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule, and expanded evidence of safety. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Phase 3—These clinical trials are undertaken in larger patient populations to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy, and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. These trials may be done globally to support global registrations.

The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved.  These so‑called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to be satisfied after approval.  The results of Phase 4 studies can confirm the effectiveness of a drug candidate and can provide important safety information. 
 ﻿
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug candidate, as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements.  The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product.  Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 ﻿
 505(b)(2) Approval Process. Section 505(b)(2) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), which was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, otherwise known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, provides an expedited regulatory pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved drug products.  Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference.  The applicant may rely upon the FDA's findings of safety and effectiveness for an approved product that acts as the Reference Listed Drug (RLD).  The FDA may also require 505(b)(2) applicants to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the RLD.  The FDA may then approve the new drug candidate for all or some of the labeled indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 
 ﻿
 We expect our Tamsulosin DRS, Tamsulosin XR capsules, Solifenacin DRG, Tadalafil/Finasteride combination capsules, VERU-722 and VERU-944 drug candidates to qualify for the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway because they are or will be based on already approved active pharmaceutical ingredients rather than new chemical entities, and formulations that has been through Phase 1 studies.  On August 12, 2016, FDA cleared Tamsulosin DRS for the expedited 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway and agreed with our plans to conduct a single bioequivalence study to support the filing of an NDA.  On December 6, 2016, based on positive regulatory recommendations by the BRUD FDA Advisory Committee, we are considering plans to file an investigational new drug application (IND) and possibly initiate a Phase 2 clinical study. On May 24,2017, the FDA agreed with plans to enter the Phase 2 dose finding clinical trial to evaluate VERU-944 for the treatment of hot flashes in men on androgen deprivation therapy. In November 2017, FDA agreed in PreIND meetings that Solifenacin DRG and Tadalafil/Finasteride combination capsules qualify for 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway.
 ﻿
 Orange Book Listing.  In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant’s product.  Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly referred to as the Orange Book.  Any applicant who files a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is not sought until after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the proposed new product.  This last certification is known as a Paragraph IV certification.  If the competitor has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the competitor must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the holder of the NDA for the RLD and the patent owner once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA.  The NDA holder or patent owner may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification.  The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification prevents the FDA from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the date of the lawsuit, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant.  The applicant may also elect to submit a “Section VIII” statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain, or carves out, any language regarding the patented method‑of‑use rather than certify to a listed method‑of‑use patent. 
 ﻿
 NDA Submission and Review by the FDA.  The results of product development, nonclinical studies, and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA.  The submission of an NDA requires payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA.  The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions.  The FDA reviews applications to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the manufacturing controls are adequate to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity.  Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured.  The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.  Once the NDA submission has been accepted for filing, which occurs, if at all, within 60 days after submission of the NDA, the FDA’s goal for a non‑priority review of a 505(b)(2) NDA is ten months to complete the review process for the application and respond to the applicant, which can take the form of either a Complete Response Letter or Approval.  The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information, studies, or clarification.  The FDA may delay or refuse approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information, and/or require post‑marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.  FDA approval of any NDA submitted by us 

 
16


will be at a time the FDA chooses.  Also, if regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed.  Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace.  In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 post‑marketing studies to monitor the effect of approved products, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post‑marketing studies. 
 ﻿
 Post‑Approval Requirements.  Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences.   Drug and biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third‑party manufacturers.  We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements.  If our present or future suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a product from distribution, or withdraw approval of the NDA.
 ﻿
 The FDA closely regulates the marketing and promotion of drugs.  A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity, and potency that are approved by the FDA.  Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, and potential civil and criminal penalties.  Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA.  Such off‑label uses are common across medical specialties.  Physicians may believe that such off‑label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances.  The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments.  The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off‑label use. 
 ﻿
 The recently enacted Drug Supply Chain Security Act imposes new obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing.  Among the requirements of this new legislation, manufacturers will be required to provide certain information regarding the drug products to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug product.  The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically.  Manufacturers will also be required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers’ products are appropriately licensed.  Further, under this new legislation, manufacturers will have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death. 
 ﻿
 Other Healthcare Regulations.  Our business activities, including but not limited to, research, sales, promotion, distribution, medical education, and other activities will be subject to regulation by numerous regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including potentially the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services and its various divisions, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and state and local governments.  Our business activities must comply with numerous healthcare laws, including but not limited to, the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, the False Claims Act, the Veterans Health Care Act, and similar state laws. 
 ﻿
 The federal Anti‑Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for the purchase, lease, or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs.  The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value.  There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution.  The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing, or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor.  Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti‑Kickback Statute.  Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case‑by‑case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. 
 ﻿
 The federal False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. 
 ﻿
 We and our business activities are subject to the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 
 ﻿
 Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), and its implementing regulations, require certain manufacturers of drugs and medical devices for which payment is available under Medicare, 

 
17


Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 
 ﻿
 In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business.  The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), and its implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.  Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates—independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity.  HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.  In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 ﻿
 The Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 requires manufacturers of “covered drugs” to offer those drugs for sale to certain federal agencies, including but not limited to, the Department of Veterans Affairs, on the Federal Supply Schedule, which requires compliance with applicable federal procurement laws. 
 ﻿
 Depending on the circumstances, failure to comply with these laws can result in penalties, including criminal, civil, and/or administrative criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion of products from reimbursement under government programs, “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, reputational harm, diminished profits, and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our business. 
 ﻿
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals designed to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably.  Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access.  In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. 
 ﻿
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party, or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business.  The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. 
 ﻿
 Foreign and Other Regulation.  In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to develop or sell any products outside of the United States.  The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval.  The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.  
 ﻿
 FC2 received the CE Mark which allows it to be marketed throughout the European Union.  FC2 has also been approved by regulatory authorities in Brazil, India, Canada, and other jurisdictions.  
 ﻿
 The Company’s facility may also be subject to inspection by UNFPA, USAID, International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and country specific ministries of health. 
 ﻿
 Intellectual Property 
 ﻿
 We will be able to protect our technology from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent it is covered by valid and enforceable patents or is effectively maintained as trade secrets. Patents and other proprietary rights are an essential element of our business.
 ﻿
 As of December 1, 2017, we owned or held exclusive rights to 9 issued U.S. patents, 6 pending U.S. patent applications and additional patents and patent applications in other jurisdictions outside the United States.  These include an international patent application 

 
18


relating to our Tamsulosin DRS product that is subject to deferred payment obligations and patents and patent applications relating to our VERU-111 and VERU-112 drug candidates that we license from a third party.  Additional information regarding our patent portfolio is provided below.
 ﻿
 PREBOOST® Patent Application.  PREBOOST®, medicated individual wipes which is a male genital desensitizing drug product that helps in the prevention of premature ejaculation, is covered by a pending U.S. patent application.
 ﻿
 VERU-722 Patent. VERU-722, an oral agent we are developing for the treatment of male infertility, is covered by an issued U.S. patent that expires in May 2021.  We also own additional patents outside of the United States and patent applications covering VERU-722 some of which, if granted, could provide meaningful protection until February 2037.
 ﻿
 Tamsulosin DRS, Tamsulosin XR capsules, and Solifenacin DRG Patent Application.  We own two patent applications with respect to Tamsulosin DRS, Tamsulosin XR capsules, and Solifenacin DRG: (1) an international patent application (would expire on May 2037) and (2) an European original application (would expire on October 2037).  Veru acquired those patent rights pursuant to a purchase agreement that provides for significant continuing installment and milestone payment obligations.  In addition, Veru granted a security interest in the purchased assets to the seller to secure Veru's present and future payment and performance obligations under the purchase agreement.  Accordingly, there will be significant payments that Veru will be required to make in the future to the seller of the Tamsulosin DRS, Tamsulosin XR capsulse, and Solifenacin DRG assets and the failure to make such payments may result in Veru losing its rights to such intellectual property.  If Veru fails to retain such rights, we would not be able to commercialize any products relating to Tamsulosin DRS, Tamsulosin XR capsules, and Solifenacin DRG
 ﻿
 VERU-944 Patent Application. We have one issued U.S. patent application related to substantially pure cis-clomiphene for the treatment of osteoporosis, bone fractures, loss of bone mineral density and hot flashes, especially in men on prostate cancer hormone therapies. Patent expires in July 2035.
 ﻿
 VERU-111/VERU-112 License.  We hold an exclusive license to 3 issued U.S. patents, 2 pending U.S. patent applications and 50 patents and patent applications in countries outside the United States  relating to our VERU-111 and VERU-112 drug candidates.  This license contains provisions requiring upfront, milestone and royalty payments to the licensor (Ohio State University).   If we fail to comply with these obligations or other obligations to the licensor, the licensor might have the right to terminate the license, in which event we would not be able to commercialize these drug candidates. Patent expires for VERU-111 in July 2029 and with a maximum 5-year patent extention is expected because of clinical development and FDA review time, in which case the patent could expire June 2034.
 ﻿
 FC2 Patents.  FC2 patents have been issued by the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, South Africa, the People’s Republic of China, Japan, Mexico, Brazil, India and the African Regional Intellectual Property Organization (ARIPO), which includes Botswana, Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.  Further, the European patent for FC2 has been validated in the following countries: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Switzerland, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Germany, Denmark, Estonia, Spain, Finland, France, United Kingdom, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Monaco, Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Sweden, Slovenia, Slovakia, and Turkey.  The patents cover the key aspects of FC2, including its overall design and manufacturing process.  The patents have expiration dates in 2023 and 2024.  
 ﻿
 Trademarks. The Company has a registration for the trademarks “FC2 Female Condom” and "PREBOOST" in the United States and has filed applications in the U.S. for the trademarks “Veru Inc.,” "Veru Healthcare," "Veru Biopharma," "Veru Pharmaceuticals" and "Veru Pharma."  The Company has filed applications or secured registrations in 40 countries or jurisdictions around the world to protect the various names and symbols used in marketing its Female Condoms.   
 ﻿
 We cannot be certain that any of our pending patent applications, or those of our licensors, will result in issued patents. In addition, because the patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions, the patents we own and license, or any further patents we may own or license, may not prevent other companies from developing similar or therapeutically equivalent products.  Patents also will not protect our product candidates if competitors devise ways of making or using these product candidates without legally infringing our patents.  In recent years, several companies have been extremely aggressive in challenging patents covering pharmaceutical products, and the challenges have often been successful. We cannot be assured that our patents will not be challenged by third parties or that we will be successful in any defense we undertake. Failure to successfully defend a patent challenge could materially and adversely affect our business. 
 ﻿
 In addition, changes in patent laws, rules or regulations or in their interpretations in the United States and other countries by the courts may materially diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
 ﻿


 
19


We also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors to execute non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements and our employees to execute assignment of invention agreements to us on commencement of their employment. Agreements with our employees also prevent them from bringing any proprietary rights of third parties to us. We also require confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials.
 ﻿
 Significant Customers
 ﻿
 Because FC2 provides dual protection against both STIs, including HIV/AIDS, and unintended pregnancy, it is an integral part of both HIV/AIDS prevention and family planning programs throughout the world.  These programs are typically supplied by global public health sector buyers who purchase products for distribution, at low cost or no cost, to those who need but cannot afford to buy such products themselves.  Within the global public health sector are large global agencies, such as UNFPA, USAID, DFID (the U.K.’s Department for International Development), and PSI (Population Services International), other social marketing groups, various government health agencies, and NGOs.  The Company’s most significant customers are either global public health sector agencies, country specific ministries of health, or those who facilitate their purchases and/or distribution. 
 ﻿
 The Company's largest customers in fiscal 2017 were USAID and UNFPA.  USAID accounted for 44 percent of unit sales in fiscal 2017, 24 percent of unit sales in fiscal 2016, and 16 percent of unit sales in fiscal 2015.  UNFPA accounted for 25 percent of unit sales in fiscal 2017, 25 percent of unit sales in fiscal 2016, and 18 percent of unit sales in fiscal 2015.  The Brazil Ministry of Health (through Semina) accounted for 27 percent of unit sales in fiscal 2016 and 47 percent of unit sales in fiscal 2015.  No other single customer accounted for more than 10 percent of unit sales in fiscal 2017, 2016, or 2015.  The Company considers its most significant customers to be UNFPA, USAID, Sekunjalo, and the Brazil Ministry of Health (either through UNFPA or Semina).
 ﻿
 Employees 
 ﻿
 As of December 23, 2017, the Company had 175 full-time employees, including 27 located in the U.S., 11 in the U.K., 134 in Malaysia, and 3 in other countries to implement training and programs. None of the Company’s employees are represented by a labor union. The Company believes that its employee relations are good.  In Malaysia, a significant proportion of direct labor is supplied by a contracted work force.    ﻿ Environmental Regulation
 ﻿
 The Company believes there are no material issues or material costs associated with the Company's compliance with environmental laws related to the manufacture and distribution of FC2.  The Company has not incurred environmental expenses in fiscal 2017, 2016, or 2015, nor does it anticipate environmental expenses in the foreseeable future.
 ﻿
 Raw Materials
 ﻿
 The principal raw material used to produce FC2 is a nitrile polymer. While general nitrile formulations are available from a number of suppliers, the Company has chosen to work closely with the technical market leader in synthetic polymers to develop a grade ideally suited to the bio-compatibility and functional needs of a female condom.  As a result, the Company relies on supply for its principal raw material for FC2 from one supplier that could produce the raw material from multiple supply points within its organization.
 ﻿
 Manufacturing
 ﻿
 The Company leases production space in Selangor D.E., Malaysia for the production of FC2, which currently has manufacturing capacity of approximately 100 million units annually.  In fiscal 2014 the Company added additional space, resulting in a total of 45,800 sq. ft. in the Company’s Malaysia facility, comprised of production and warehouse space and which provides sufficient space to add manufacturing capacity of up to an additional 100 million units annually.  The Company will consider manufacturing in other locations as the demand for FC2 develops.
 ﻿
 The Company expects to rely on third-party contract manufacturers and other third parties to produce, package and store sufficient quantities of any future drug candidates.  The Company has entered into an agreement with a third-party contract manufacturer to produce its PREBOOST® medicated individual wipes for managing premature ejaculation.
 ﻿

Competition 
 ﻿
 FC2 participates in the same market as male condoms; however, it is not seen as directly competing with male condoms. Rather, studies show that providing FC2 is additive in terms of prevention and choice. Male condoms cost less and have brand names that are more widely recognized than FC2. In addition, male condoms are generally manufactured and marketed by companies with significantly greater financial resources than the Company. 
 ﻿
 Other parties have developed and marketed female condoms.  None of these female condoms marketed or under development by other parties have secured FDA market approval. FDA market approval is required to sell female condoms in the U.S.  USAID, a U.S. government funded agency, is required to procure from the FDA product approval for market; however there can be exceptions.  Outside of the U.S., the Company has experienced increasing competition and pricing pressures for FC2.  In addition to FC2, three female condoms have successfully completed the WHO prequalification process and been cleared by UNFPA for purchase by U.N. agencies: the Cupid female condom (which was prequalified by WHO in July 2012 and cleared by UNFPA thereafter), the Velvet female condom marketed by Hindustan Latex Limited (which was prequalified by WHO and cleared by UNFPA in March 2016) and the female condom marketed by PATH (which was prequalified by WHO and cleared by UNFPA in March 2016).  The female condom marketed by Hindustan Latex Limited, which is the Company’s former exclusive distributor in India, is substantially similar in design to FC2, except it is made of latex.  FC2 has also been competing with other female condoms in markets that do not require either FDA market approval or WHO prequalification.  Reflecting increased competition, Cupid received part of the last two South African tenders.  Increasing competition in FC2’s markets has, and will likely continue to, put pressure on pricing for FC2 and may also adversely affect sales of FC2.  Some customers, particularly in the global public health sector, prioritize price over other features where FC2 may have an advantage.  It is also possible that other female condoms may receive FDA market approval or complete the WHO prequalification process, which would increase competition from other female condoms in FC2’s markets.
 ﻿
 The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, and is characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress.  The success of our pharmaceutical products will depend on our ability to acquire, develop and commercialize products and our ability to establish and maintain markets for any products for which we receive marketing approval. Potential competitors in North America, Europe and elsewhere include major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology firms, universities and other research institutions and government agencies.  Many of the competitors with respect to our pharmaceutical products under development have substantially greater research and development and regulatory capabilities and experience, and substantially greater management, manufacturing, distribution, marketing and financial resources, than we will.
 ﻿
 All drugs currently used to treat BPH symptoms are tablets or capsules.  These drugs include those that decrease size of the prostate, like 5 alpha reductase inhibitors which include PROSCAR® (finasteride) from Merck & Co., Inc. and AVODART® (dutasteride) from GlaxoSmithKline.  The other major class of drugs treat BPH by relaxing the smooth muscles of the prostate and bladder neck and include alpha blockers like FLOMAX® (tamsulosin HCI) from Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, HYTRIN® (terazocin), UROXATRAL® (alfuzosin), CARDURA® (doxazosin), and RAPAFLO® (silodosin) from Allergan as well as Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors like CIALIS ® (tadalafil) from Eli Lilly.  One class of drugs combines a drug that shrinks and another that relaxes the prostate called JALYN® (dutasteride/tamsulosin combination) from GlaxoSmithKline.
 ﻿
 There are drugs that have been approved for the treatment of male infertility for the indication of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.  These drugs are only available by injection which include: GONAL-F® (Follitropin Alfa) which is recombinant DNA human follicle stimulating hormone by EMD Serono, Inc., NOVAREL® (chorionic gonadotropin for injection USP) which is human chorionic gonadotropin by Ferring, Inc. and PREGNYL® (chorionic gonadotropin for injection USP) which is human chorionic gonadotropin by Merck & Co., Inc.  There are no FDA-approved oral therapies for male infertility.
