Item 1. Business
In this report, when we refer to “the Company,” “us,” “we,” “our,” or “ours,” we are referring to Schneider National, Inc. and its subsidiaries. References to "Notes" are to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Company Overview
We are a leading transportation and logistics services company providing a broad portfolio of premier truckload, intermodal, and logistics solutions and operating one of the largest for-hire trucking fleets in North America. We were founded in 1935 by Al J. Schneider in Green Bay, Wisconsin. In April 2017, we completed our IPO. 
We believe we have developed a differentiated business model that is difficult to replicate due to our scale, breadth of complementary service offerings, and proprietary technology platform. Our highly flexible and balanced business combines asset-based truckload services with asset-light intermodal and non-asset logistics offerings, enabling us to serve our customers’ diverse transportation needs. We believe we have become an iconic and trusted brand within the transportation industry by adhering to a culture of safety “first and always” and upholding our responsibility to our customers, our associates, and the communities that we serve. 
Our service offerings range from dry van to bulk transport, intermodal to supply chain management, and First to Final Mile “white glove” delivery. We categorize our operations into the following reportable segments:

• | Truckload – which consists of freight transported and delivered with standard and specialty equipment by our company-employed drivers in company trucks and by owner-operators. These services are executed through either for-hire or dedicated contracts. Our truckload services include standard long-haul and regional shipping services primarily using dry van equipment, and bulk, temperature-controlled, First to Final Mile “white glove” delivery, and customized solutions for high-value and time-sensitive loads. With our acquisition of WSL, we established a national footprint and expertise in shipping large parcel consumer items, such as furniture, mattresses, and other household goods.


• | Intermodal – which consists of door-to-door container on flat car service by a combination of rail and over-the-road transportation, in association with our rail carrier partners. Our intermodal service offers vast coverage throughout North America, including cross-border freight through company containers, chassis, and trucks.


• | Logistics – which consists of non-asset freight brokerage services, supply chain services (including 3PL), and import/export services. Our logistics business typically provides value-added services using third-party capacity, augmented by our assets, to manage and move our customers’ freight.

For more information on our reportable segments and the geographic areas in which we conduct business, see Note 16, Segment Reporting.
In addition, we engage in equipment leasing to third parties through our wholly owned subsidiary Schneider Finance, Inc., which is primarily engaged in leasing trucks to owner-operators, including owner-operators with whom we contract. We also provide insurance for both the company and owner-operators through our wholly owned insurance subsidiary. Finally, we conduct limited China-based trucking operations consisting primarily of brokerage services.
We have established a network of facilities across North America in order to maximize the geographic reach of our company trucks and owner-operators and provide maintenance services and personal amenities for our drivers. Our portfolio diversity, network density throughout North America, and large fleet allow us to provide an exceptional level of service to our customers and consistently excel as a reliable partner, especially at times of peak demand. Our early investment and adoption of next generation technology and data analytics is a competitive advantage. Our custom quote-to-cash Quest platform leverages proprietary decision science algorithms and real-time data analytics to optimize network density and equipment use across our entire network. This state-of-the-art platform allows us to make informed decisions at every level of our business and was built utilizing technology from Oracle Corporation.

Industry and Competition
Truckload
Trucking is the primary means of serving the North American transportation market and hauls a large percentage of freight volume within the United States. Trucking continues to attract shippers due to the mode’s cost advantages relative to air transportation and flexibility relative to rail. Truckload growth is largely tied to U.S. economic activity, such as GDP growth and industrial production, and moves in line with changes in sales, inventory, and production within various sectors of the U.S. economy, including manufactured goods, construction products, and bulk commodities. 
In the U.S. truckload industry sector, both dry van and specialty equipment are used to transport goods over a long haul and on a regional basis. Dry van carriers represent an integral component of the transportation supply chain for most retail and manufactured goods in North America. Specialty carriers employ equipment such as flat-bed trucks, straight trucks, temperature-controlled trailers, over-sized trailers, and bulk transport, dump, and waste equipment. These carriers can transport temperature-controlled products and bulk commodities such as specialty chemicals and petrochemicals. Specialty equipment offering is characterized by higher equipment costs and more extensive driver training requirements relative to dry van offerings, resulting in higher barriers to entry and creating opportunities for differentiated value propositions for customers.
The U.S. truckload industry is highly competitive and fragmented, characterized by many small carriers with revenues of less than $1 million per year, fewer than 50 carriers with revenues exceeding $100 million per year, and fewer than 10 carriers with revenues exceeding $1 billion per year, according to 2017 rankings published by Transport Topics, an American Trucking Association publication. 
Regulations and initiatives to improve the safety of the U.S. trucking industry have impacted industry dynamics. We believe the recent trend is for industry regulation to become progressively more restrictive and complex, which constrains the overall supply of trucks and drivers in the industry. 
Domestic Intermodal
“Domestic” or “North American domestic” intermodal is the term used within the trucking industry to refer to intermodal operations within North America (such as a shipment by rail and by truck either all within the United States or throughout North America). Freight is transported in a 53-foot container or trailer, combining multiple modes of transportation (rail and truck) within the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Intermodal transportation eliminates the need for customers to directly handle freight when changing modes between rail and truck and holds significant productivity, cost, and fuel-efficiency advantages when moving mass freight. Containers are typically moved from truck onto rail and then back onto trucks before they reach their final destination. Domestic intermodal volumes are largely driven by over-the-road conversions from truckload to intermodal and from the volume of overseas imports into the United States, such as from China. 
The intermodal market is comprised of service providers of differing asset intensity, with customers being served by either non-asset intermodal marketing companies (IMCs) or asset-light network intermodal providers, such as Schneider. While IMCs are the most prevalent intermodal solution provider, asset-light network intermodal providers offer differentiated higher-value solutions to customers given the reliability, geographic breadth, and high service levels of company assets (trucks, containers, and even chassis) compared to non-asset IMCs.
The domestic intermodal segment is highly consolidated, where the top three intermodal providers, including our Intermodal segment, operate a significant portion of the U.S. dry van domestic container fleet. Network density, size, and scale are critical barriers to entry in the intermodal market. Increasing sophistication and complexity of shippers’ needs require network density and the ability to deliver reliable capacity. Railroads have been spending significant amounts in recent years to maintain and improve their infrastructure and equipment, which we believe supports growth of the intermodal industry and improves the efficiency and reliability of the railroad component of our intermodal service.
We are currently one of the largest intermodal providers in North America by revenue and are well positioned for future growth in intermodal freight through our nationwide network and company container model. We focus on intermodal service as an alternative to placing additional trucks and drivers in lanes for which rail service otherwise provides competitive service or that are significantly longer in distance. Our longstanding railroad relationships with Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) Railway, CSX Transportation, Canadian National Railway, Kansas City Southern Railway, and other regional rail carriers, such as Florida East Coast Railway, provide rail access nationwide. Our customers value our intermodal network over IMCs due to our consistent access to capacity through our company assets and high-quality drayage services that provide a larger geographic reach around intermodal terminals. In 2017, we completed the process of converting from rented chassis to a company-owned 
4

chassis model. This conversion will lower our all-in chassis operating costs, improve service reliability, and increase driver efficiency and satisfaction by increasing our control over the chassis operations of our intermodal business. We believe that our balanced network and large base of company assets provide a significant competitive advantage that would be difficult for other carriers to replicate.
Logistics
The logistics industry is a large, fast-growing, and fragmented market that represents an integral part of the global economy. Increased material costs coupled with enhanced global competition impose margin pressure on manufacturers, often resulting in the outsourcing of noncore transportation logistics to supply chain specialists who offer a combination of scale, strong technology platforms, and lower costs. Additionally, more shipments are transported using multiple modes and technical expertise, driving shipper preferences for logistics providers with an asset-based network to complement their third-party capacity. Transportation asset owners often provide logistics services to meet excess demand and provide customers with greater breadth of services. Our logistics business not only provides additional services to existing customers and incremental freight to our assets, but helps to facilitate the expansion of our customer base and offers opportunities for cross-selling our suite of services. 
Customers 
As of December 31, 2017, we offered our services to approximately 19,000 customers across our portfolio, including nearly 200 Fortune 500 companies. We believe customers value our breadth of services, demonstrated by 22 of our top 25 customers using services from all three of our reportable segments. Our Logistics segment manages over 26,000 qualified carrier relationships and managed approximately $2.1 billion of third-party freight in 2017. 
Our broad portfolio limits our customer and industry concentration as compared to other carriers. We receive revenue from a diversified customer base and had only one customer from whom we generated revenues slightly in excess of 10% in 2017. Revenues from this customer, Walmart, were distributed over five service offerings and crossed all of our reportable segments. We maintain a broad end-market footprint, encompassing over ten distinct industries including general merchandise, chemicals, electronics & appliances, and food & beverage, among others. Our diversified revenue mix and customer base drive stability throughout the fiscal year, even though many of our customers are affected by seasonal fluctuations. For example, our consumer goods and big box retail sales experience the greatest demand in the fourth quarter, whereas our food & beverage sales peak during the summer and home improvement sales peak in spring and early summer, creating more balanced year-round demand. Our balanced customer base allows for stable revenue and yield management through the fiscal year, allowing for more efficient seasonality management.
Revenue Equipment 
Our revenue equipment fleet was comprised of the following equipment at December 31, 2017:

Revenue Equipment Type | Approximate Number of Units
Over-the-road sleeper cab tractors | 8,600 
Day cab tractors | 1,600 
Other tractors (yard tractors, straight trucks, and training tractors) | 500 
Trailers | 38,000 
Intermodal containers | 18,000 
Chassis | 15,700 

Employees 
As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 19,600 associates, approximately 60% of whom are drivers and 40% of whom are managers, support personnel, and other corporate office employees. Approximately 14% of our associates are based in our headquarters in Brown County, Wisconsin. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our associate relations to be good. Currently eleven of our company drivers are members of an organized labor union, as a result of a commitment we made in the 1980s to allow this group of drivers to finish their careers at Schneider while remaining union members. None of our other associates are represented by a labor union.
5

Owner-Operators
In addition to the company drivers that we employ, we enter into contracts with owner-operators. Owner-operators are small business owners who operate their own trucks (some may employ drivers that they hire) and provide us with services under a contractual arrangement whereby they are generally responsible for the ownership and operating expenses and are generally compensated on a percentage of revenue basis. Owner-operators select their own load assignments and are in control of their schedule.
Owner-operators, who tend to be experienced drivers, represented approximately 21% of all trucks in our truckload fleet as of December 31, 2017. By operating safely and productively, owner-operators can improve their own profitability and ours. 
We offer owner-operators the opportunity to purchase trucks from us and sometimes provide financing to owner-operators for these purchases. 
We believe our various operating arrangements, which include self-dispatch, percentage of revenue settlement, and truck financing, are unique in our industry and position us as a preferred partner for owner-operators.
Safety 
“Safety first and always” is a Schneider core value. We believe we have a responsibility to our associates, customers, and the community to operate safely. Our safety culture is built on five key components:

• | Driver hiring and drug testing. We complement our comprehensive driver hiring with physical testing. We voluntarily choose to use hair follicle testing in addition to urine-based drug testing. While costing more per driver, hair follicle testing is generally more accurate than the alternative.


• | Military drivers. We have a strong relationship with the United States military and employ many drivers with military experience. This experience produces quality truck drivers due to the discipline instilled through the military training programs.


• | Training. Initial training is complemented by regularly scheduled follow-up training to sustain and enhance basic skills. We hire both experienced drivers and drivers new to the industry. We operate company-sponsored driver training facilities, and have invested in simulators for both initial and sustainment training.


• | Equipment and technology We invest in trucks that are configured with roll stability capability, proprietary collision mitigation, and forward-facing cameras. Driving behavior is electronically monitored, alerts are provided to the driver situationally, and performance is documented for subsequent coaching. We also employ electronic logging, which ensures HOS compliance and reduces the instance of fatigue.


• | Active management. Driver leaders and safety coordinators have real-time access to activity in the truck, facilitating situational and scheduled coaching. We have invested in predictive analytics that assist in proactively identifying drivers with potential safety issues and recommending a remediation path.

Truckload carriers share safety performance information in monitored peer to peer forums. These comparisons show that we are one of the safest truckload carriers on the road today. We have, and have always maintained, a satisfactory DOT safety rating, which is the highest available rating.
Fuel
We actively manage our fuel purchasing network in an effort to maintain adequate fuel supplies. In 2017, we made 99% of our fuel purchases through negotiated volume purchase discounts. We store fuel in underground storage tanks at 11 locations and in above ground storage tanks at 1 location. We believe that we are in substantive compliance with applicable environmental laws relating to the storage of fuel.
In response to increases in fuel costs we use fuel surcharge programs to pass on the majority of increased fuel costs to our customers. We believe that the most cost effective protection against fuel cost increase is to continue the fuel surcharge programs and to invest in a fuel efficient fleet. To that end, we leverage fuel consumption metrics in driver evaluation. However, fuel surcharges may not adequately cover potential future increases in fuel prices.

Regulation
Industry Regulation
Our operations are regulated and licensed by various agencies in the United States, Mexico, and Canada. Our company drivers and owner-operators must comply with the safety and fitness regulations of the DOT, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and HOS. Weight and equipment dimensions are also subject to government regulations. Other agencies, such as the EPA and Department of Homeland Security, also regulate equipment. We believe regulation in the transportation industry may become progressively more restrictive and complex. The following discussion presents recently enacted federal, state, and local regulations that have an impact on our operations.
Hours of Service
We are subject to the FMCSA's HOS rule, which was effective on July 1, 2013. The key provisions include:

• | an 11-hour daily driving time limit;


• | a maximum number of hours a truck driver can work within a week of 70 hours; and


• | a limit of eight consecutive driving hours a truck driver can work before being required to take a 30 minute break.

BASICs
Since December 2010, the FMCSA has ranked both fleets and individual drivers on seven categories of safety-related data. These categories, known as BASICs, currently include Unsafe Driving, Fatigued Driving (HOS), Driver Fitness, Controlled Substances/Alcohol, Vehicle Maintenance, Hazardous Materials Compliance, and Crash Indicator. 
Certain BASICs information was initially published and made available to carriers, as well as the general public. However, in December 2015, as part of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act, Congress mandated that the FMCSA remove all CSA scores from public view until a more comprehensive study regarding the effectiveness of BASICs improving truck safety can be completed and the recommendations from that study are evaluated for implementation.
Implementation and effective dates of these recommended changes are unclear, as there is currently no proposed rulemaking with respect to BASICs. This leaves SafeStat, a national system instituted by the Federal Highway Administration for evaluating the safety of motor carriers, as the authoritative safety measurement system in effect. We currently have a satisfactory SafeStat DOT rating, which is the best available rating under the current safety rating scale.
Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Bill
The FMCSA issued its final rule mandating the use of electronic logging devices in December 2015. Under the rule, carriers were required to adopt and use compliant devices beginning in December 2017. No significant actions were required by the company, as we were already compliant with the rule's requirements. 
Prohibiting Coercion of Commercial Motor Vehicle Drivers
The Prohibiting Coercion of Commercial Motor Vehicle Drivers rule, as published in the Federal Register and adopted by the FMCSA, explicitly prohibits motor carriers and other parties in the supply chain from coercing drivers to violate certain FMCSA regulations, including driver HOS limits, commercial driver's license regulations, drug and alcohol testing rules, and hazardous materials regulations, among others. Under the rule, drivers can report incidents of coercion to the FMCSA, which is authorized to issue penalties against the offending party.
7

Environmental Regulation
We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the hauling and handling of hazardous materials, fuel storage tanks, emissions from our vehicle and facilities, engine idling, discharge and retention of storm water, and other environmental matters that involve inherent environmental risk. We maintain bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at many of our terminals. We also have vehicle maintenance, repair, and washing operations at some of our facilities. Our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage and seepage, discharge of contaminants, environmental damage, and hazardous waste disposal, among others. We have instituted programs to monitor and control environmental risks and maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws. As part of our safety and risk management program we periodically perform environmental reviews. We are a partner in the EPA’s SmartWay Transport Partnership, a voluntary program promoting energy efficiency and air quality. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with current laws and regulations and do not know of any existing environmental condition that would be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results.
If we are held responsible for the cleanup of any environmental incidents caused by our operations or business, or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to liabilities, including substantial fines or penalties or civil and criminal liability. We have paid penalties for, and have incurred costs to remediate, spills and violations in the past.
In 2008 the State of California’s Air Resources Board (ARB) approved the Heavy-Duty Vehicle Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emission Reduction Regulation in efforts to reduce GHG emissions from certain long-haul tractor-trailers that operate in California by requiring them to use technologies that improve fuel efficiency (regardless of where the vehicle is registered). The regulation required owners of long-haul tractors and 53-foot trailers to replace or retrofit their vehicles with aerodynamic technologies and low rolling resistance tires. The regulation also contained certain emissions and registration standards for temperature controlled trailer operators.
Thereafter, the United States EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) began taking coordinated steps at a national level in support of a new generation of clean vehicles and engines through reduced GHG emissions and improved fuel efficiency. In September 2011, the United States EPA finalized federal regulations for controlling GHG emissions, beginning with model year 2014 medium- and heavy-duty engines and vehicles and increasing in stringency through model year 2018. The federal regulations relate to efficient engines, use of auxiliary power units, mass reduction, low rolling resistance tires, improved aerodynamics, improved transmissions, and reduced accessory loads.
In December 2013, California’s ARB approved regulations to align its GHG emission standards and test procedures, as well as its tractor-trailer GHG regulation, with the federal Phase 1 GHG regulation, which applied fuel efficiency standards to vehicles for model years 2014 to 2018. 
In October 2016, the EPA and NHTSA published a Final Rule for Phase 2 of the GHG emissions and fuel efficiency standards for medium and heavy-duty engines and vehicles. The Final Rule, which became effective as of December 27, 2016, is expected by the EPA to lower CO2 emissions by 1.1 billion metric tons and reduce oil consumption by up to 2 billion barrels over the lifetime of vehicles sold under the Phase 2 program. First-time GHG and fuel efficiency standards for trailers will start in model year 2018 for EPA and model year 2021 for NHSTA, and CO2 and fuel consumption standards for combination tractors and engines (which are subject to individual and separate regulatory requirements) commence in model year 2021, increase incrementally in model year 2024, and achieve a fully phased-in requirement by model year 2027. EPA and
NHSTA expect that motor carriers will meet the increased standards through the use of technology improvements in multiple areas, including the engine, transmission, driveline, aerodynamic design, extended idle reduction technologies, and the use of other accessories.
Since its adoption of the Phase 2 Final Rule, the EPA has received various petitions for reconsideration based on the position that the EPA lacked legal authority to regulate certain types of vehicles, including glider vehicles and trailers. In light of these petitions, the EPA decided to revisit certain provisions in the Phase 2 Final Rule. In November 2017, the EPA issued a proposal to repeal the emissions standards and other requirements for heavy-duty glider vehicles, glider engines, and glider kits based upon a proposed interpretation of the Clean Air Act (CAA) under which glider vehicles would be found not to constitute “new motor vehicles” within the meaning of CAA Section 216(3), glider engines would be found not to constitute “new motor vehicle engines” within the meaning of CAA Section 216(3), and glider kits would not be treated as “incomplete” new motor vehicles. Under this proposal interpretation, the EPA would lack authority to regulate glider vehicles, glider engines, and glider kits under CAA Section 202(a)(1). The public comment period for this proposal expired on January 5, 2018. 
8

Current and proposed GHG regulations could impact us by increasing the cost of new trucks, impairing productivity, and increasing our operating expenses.
Federal and state lawmakers are considering a variety of climate-change proposals related to carbon emissions and GHG emissions. The proposals could potentially limit carbon emissions for certain states and municipalities, which continue to restrict the location and amount of time that diesel-powered trucks (like ours) may idle.
Other Regulation
In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, federal, state, and municipal authorities implemented and continue to implement various security measures on large trucks, including checkpoints and travel restrictions. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) adopted regulations that require drivers applying for or renewing a license for carrying hazardous materials to obtain a TSA determination that they are not a security threat. 
Technology and Research and Development
We are a technology leader in the truckload industry. Our in-cab telematics platform delivers customer location specific step-by-step work assignments to our company driver fleet. Our trailer and container fleets are equipped with monitoring devices which function both when tethered to a tractor and standing alone. Our tractors are equipped with stability and collision avoidance technology. All tractor technology interfaces with the in-cab device and provides the driver and the driver leader with real-time performance data.
We execute our business on Quest, an integrated technology platform using technology from our strategic development partner, Oracle Corporation, reflecting an end-to-end process design with focus on information accessibility and insight across our value chain. Quest enables an integrated approach to cash process including load/order acceptance based on driver and network optimization, vehicle dispatch, continuous quote monitoring, and visibility to the load from pick-up to delivery and customer billing. Our technology is enhanced by the work of a team of operations research engineers and data scientists. Proprietary decision support tools are embedded throughout the Quest platform. Decision support tools improve our ability to, among other things, situationally coach drivers, minimize fuel costs, and maintain the fleet in the most cost effective manner. The most significant application of such “decision science” technology is in planning and dispatch. These tools assist our associates in making the right trades-offs among drivers’ needs for earnings and work-life balance, customers’ needs for reliable capacity and service, and our business and its shareholders’ needs for an adequate return.
We continue to expand business capabilities by extending the foundational Quest platform. Development of the next generation of in-cab technology is well underway. We have committed to purchase a limited amount of Tesla's recently unveiled electric Semi trucks to improve the driver experience, decrease our carbon footprint, and lower operating costs. We are also leveraging mobile applications to better connect with company drivers and customers. One example is a mobile application that prompts our company drivers to rate the shipping, receiving, and driver support locations that they visit. Our gathering and sharing of this information with customers and providers has been well received and is driving action to improve the drivers' experience.
