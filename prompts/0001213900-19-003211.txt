Historical Background and Corporate Structure
 
Intec Pharma Ltd. was established and incorporated in Israel on October 23, 2000 as a private Israeli company under the name Orly Guy Ltd. In February 2001, our name was changed to Intec Pharmaceuticals (2000) Ltd. Our research and development activities began originally through a private partnership, Intec Pharmaceutical Partnership I.P.P, a general Israeli partnership, formed on September 21, 2000. Its operations were transferred in full to us at the beginning of 2002 in return for the allocation of shares in our company to the partners in the partnership, pro rata with their ownership in the partnership. In March 2004, we changed our corporate name to Intec Pharma Ltd. In February 2010, we successfully completed an initial public offering in Israel on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, or TASE and in August 2015 we completed an initial public offering in the U.S. In September 2017, we incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, Intec Pharma Inc., in the State of Delaware. In August 2018, we voluntarily delisted from the TASE.
 
In connection with our initial public offering in Israel in February 2010, we raised approximately NIS 35.3 million before issuance costs and issued 783,969 ordinary shares and registered warrants (Series 1) to purchase 313,588 of our ordinary shares. As of the date of this Annual Report, all warrants issued in our initial public offering in Israel have expired.
 
In connection with our initial public offering in the U.S., we raised gross proceeds of approximately $34.0 million before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. In August 2017, we completed an underwritten follow-on public offering in the U.S. in which we raised gross proceeds of approximately $57.5 million before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses and in April 2018, we completed another underwritten follow-on public offering in the U.S. in which we raised gross proceeds of approximately $37.5 million before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses.
 
Effective January 1, 2019, we ceased reporting as a “foreign private issuer” as defined in Rule 3b-4 of the Exchange Act, and became subject to the rules and regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or Exchange Act, applicable to U.S. domestic issuers. As a result, we are filing an Annual Report on Form 10-K beginning with the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. Our annual reports for prior years were filed on Form 20-F.
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to, and intend to, take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” such as reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more, (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our ordinary shares pursuant to an effective registration statement (i.e., December 31, 2020) (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt or (iv) the date on which we are deemed a “large accelerated issuer” as defined in Regulation S-K of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act.
 
We are also a smaller reporting company, and we will remain a smaller reporting company until the fiscal year following the determination that our voting and non-voting common shares held by non-affiliates is more than $250 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter, or our annual revenues are more than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and our voting and non-voting common shares held by non-affiliates is more than $700 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter. Similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosure, are exempt from the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404, and have certain other reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, being required to provide only two years of audited financial statements and not being required to provide selected financial data, supplemental financial information or risk factors.

Overview
 
We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing drugs based on our proprietary Accordion Pill platform technology, which we refer to as the Accordion Pill. Our Accordion Pill is an oral drug delivery system that is designed to improve the efficacy and safety of existing drugs and drugs in development by utilizing an efficient gastric retention, or GR, and specific release mechanism. Our product pipeline currently includes several product candidates in various clinical trial stages. Our leading product candidate, Accordion Pill Carbidopa/Levodopa, or AP-CD/LD, is being developed for the indication of treatment of Parkinson’s disease symptoms in advanced Parkinson’s disease patients. We have successfully completed a Phase II clinical trial for AP-CD/LD for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease symptoms in advanced Parkinson’s disease patients and have agreed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, on the remaining clinical development program for AP-CD/LD for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease symptoms in advanced Parkinson’s disease patients, including the main principles of the single required pivotal Phase III clinical trial in advanced Parkinson’s disease patients.
 
We are currently conducting a pivotal Phase III clinical for AP-CD/LD for the treatment of advanced Parkinson’s disease known as the ACCORDANCE study. In April 2016, we enrolled the first patient in the ACCORDANCE study and in October 2018, we completed enrollment. We currently expect to release top-line results in mid-2019. In our correspondence with the FDA, the FDA previously agreed that an acceptable regulatory pathway for AP-CD/LD would be to submit a new drug application, or NDA, pursuant to Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA which is a streamlined approval pathway that may accelerate the time to commercialize and decrease the costs of FDA approval for AP–CD/LD, as compared to those typically associated with a new chemical entity, or NCE.
 
In February 2019, we announced that AP-CD/LD met the primary endpoint in a pharmacokinetic, or PK, study comparing the AP-CD/LD 50/500mg dosed three times daily, the most common dose used in our on-going ACCORDANCE study, to 1.5 tablets of CD/LD immediate release (Sinemet™) 25/100 dosed five times per day in Parkinson’s disease patients.
 
We have invested in the commercial scale manufacture of AP-CD/LD, for which we are in partnership with LTS Lohmann Therapie-Systeme AG, or LTS. In December 2018, the large commercial scale production line was delivered to LTS in Andernach, Germany. We are in the process of installing and connecting all the ancillary equipment and expect to begin the validation, bioequivalency and stability studies needed for approval of our commercial production processes in the coming months. After preliminary discussions with the FDA in anticipation of filing for marketing approval of AP-CD/LD, we remain confident we are on track to submit a New Drug Application, or NDA, for approval of AP-CD/LD in mid- to late-2020, assuming positive topline data in the Accordance Study in mid-2019.
 
In addition, we have initiated a clinical development program for our Accordion Pill platform with the two primary cannabinoids contained in cannabis sativa, which we refer to as AP-Cannabinoids. We are formulating and testing cannabidiol, or CBD, and 9-tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, for the treatment of various pain indications. AP-Cannabinoids are designed to extend the absorption phase of CBD and THC, with the goal of more consistent levels for an improved therapeutic effect which may address several major drawbacks of current methods of treatment, such as short duration of effect, delayed onset, variability of exposure, variability of the administered dose and adverse events that correlate with peak levels. In March 2017, we initiated a Phase I single-center, single-dose, randomized, three-way crossover clinical trial in Israel to compare the safety, tolerability and PK of AP-THC/CBD, with Sativex®, an oral buccal spray containing CBD and THC that is commercially available outside of the United States. Initial results demonstrate that the Accordion Pill platform is well-suited to safely deliver CBD and THC with significant improvements in exposure compared with Sativex. In December 2018, we initiated a PK study of AP-THC. We have completed the dosing of the AP-THC PK study and the data is in the process of being analyzed by a third party contract research organization per protocol. However, upon raw data review, the delivery of THC does not appear to meet our full program expectations. We await the full dataset and the statistical analysis to determine our next steps.
 
In December 2018, we reported that we successfully developed an Accordion Pill for a Novartis proprietary compound that met the required in vitro specifications set forth in a feasibility agreement with Novartis. We have mutually agreed to proceed with the program and plan to enter the clinic with a first-in-human PK study in the first half of 2019. We believe continued success with this program further validates the platform, confirms our technical abilities to build custom APs and paves the way for additional collaborative agreements.
 
Our Accordion Pill Platform Technology
 
We believe that our Accordion Pill technology has the potential to improve the performance of approved drugs and drugs in development, including Levodopa, by providing several distinct advantages, including, but not limited to:

● | increasing efficacy of the drug incorporated into the Accordion Pill;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | improving safety of the drug incorporated into the Accordion Pill by reducing the side effects of such drugs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | reducing the number of daily administrations required to achieve the same or superior therapeutic effect as the non-Accordion Pill version of such drugs; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expanding the intellectual protection period of the drug incorporated into the Accordion Pill.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our anticipated ability to submit NDAs pursuant to Section 505(b)(2) for our existing pipeline and future products increases the likelihood of accelerating the time to commercialization of our products and decreasing costs when compared to those typically associated with NCEs.

Our Accordion Pill platform technology is designed to increase the time that drugs are retained in the stomach as compared to other oral dosage forms, such as tablets and capsules. This capability is particularly important to drugs with a narrow absorption window, or NAW, which are absorbed mainly in the upper part of the gastrointestinal, or GI, tract. Regular controlled-release formulations of such drugs currently on the market sometimes fail to provide an efficient solution, as once the regular dosage form has passed the drug’s NAW in the upper gastrointestinal, or GI, tract, the drug is not, or is very poorly, absorbed in the distal parts of the GI tract. The Accordion Pill platform technology is also designed for drugs with low solubility, which do not efficiently dissolve in the GI tract, and drugs with low permeability, which do not efficiently penetrate the intestinal wall and reach the blood stream, such as Biopharmaceutics Classification System, or BCS, Class II (low solubility, high permeability) and Class IV (low solubility, low permeability) drugs. According to The AAPS Journal published by the American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists, of the top 200 oral drugs in the United States, Great Britain, Spain and Japan in 2006, approximately 30% to 35% were BCS Class II drugs and approximately 5% to 10% were BCS Class IV drugs. Further, according to The AAPS Journal in 2011 approximately 90% of new molecular entities in development were either Class II or Class IV drugs. Poorly soluble drugs are sometimes characterized by low bioavailability, which is strongly affected by the drug’s solubility. In addition, the extent of absorption of poorly soluble drugs can be dose dependent, leading to non-linear PK behavior. The Accordion Pill’s efficient GR and specific release mechanism prolongs the absorption phase of drugs with an NAW, which can result in significantly more stable plasma levels. In addition, the Accordion Pill has demonstrated an enhancement of the absorption of a poorly soluble, BCS Class II/IV drug in a crossover PK clinical study in 12 healthy volunteers. For poorly soluble drugs, we believe that our technology acts through the gradual delivery of an undissolved drug by the Accordion Pill in the stomach, which allows for the complete dissolution of the drug dose in the stomach over the delivery period. The gradual passage of the drug from the stomach to the upper part of the GI tract enables an increase in the amount of the drug that can be dissolved and thus absorbed, in the upper small bowel. In addition, we believe that bile secretion in the upper part of the GI tract also improves the intestinal environment for better absorption. Finally, the significant dilution of the drug solution in the small bowel caused by prolonged delivery increases the amount of the drug available for absorption.
 
Our clinical trials to date have demonstrated that the Accordion Pill is retained in the stomach for eight to 12 hours, as compared to significantly shorter time periods, typically as little as two to three hours, when using other solid dosage forms. The efficient GR and the predetermined release profile for each specific drug associated with our Accordion Pill technology demonstrated a significant improvement in PK, which is the drug plasma level over time and a corresponding improvement in efficacy and safety.
 
The following chart depicts the Accordion Pill’s capability to improve the PK of Levodopa, which is a drug characterized by a narrow absorption window:
 
AP-CD/LD Phase II clinical trial — more stable Levodopa levels with statistically significant reduced peak-to-trough fluctuations
 

Levodopa plasma levels in n=8 advanced Parkinson’s disease patients following twice daily, or b.i.d, administration (eight hours apart) of AP-CD/LD 50/375 versus four times daily, or q.i.d, administration (four hours apart) of a commercial Carbidopa/Levodopa formulation (equivalent daily Levodopa dose). The PK study was performed on day seven, following six days of drug administration at home. No Levodopa medication was allowed for ten hours before the first administration at day seven. The PK results showed that the peak to trough ratio, which measures the maximum average concentration relative to the minimum average concentration of LD plasma levels, was reduced from 29.9 to 3.2 with the AP-CD/LD. Demonstration of the clinical benefits of these peak to trough ratios are being further studied and confirmed in the ACCORDANCE study.

The following chart depicts the Accordion Pill’s capability to improve the PK of a BCS Class II/IV drug combined with our Accordion Pill technology that is currently on the market and is characterized with poor solubility:
 
PK results with the Accordion Pill with a BCS Class II/IV drug that is currently available on the market in 12 healthy volunteers
 

The results of our clinical trial have demonstrated approximately a 100% increase in bioavailability in 12 healthy volunteers with our Accordion Pill technology, as compared to the commercial formulation of the drug. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that the increase in bioavailability obtained when administering one Accordion Pill and two Accordion Pills was proportional to the increase in dosage, or linear absorption, whereas the commercial formulation does not show linear absorption in these dosage ranges.
 
Although there is no assurance that these results will be repeated in other instances, we believe that these results are important because the enhancement of bioavailability of poorly soluble drugs is one of the main challenges facing the pharmaceutical industry.
 
Our Accordion Pill technology enables us to combine active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, which are also referred to as drugs, and inactive ingredients that are included in the FDA’s list of approved inactive ingredients, into pharmaceutical-grade, biodegradable polymeric films, welded into a planar structure, folded into the shape of an accordion and placed inside of a capsule. While in the stomach, the capsule dissolves and the Accordion Pill unfolds and releases the drug in a predetermined profile. In order to provide optimum results for each drug, each Accordion Pill drug differs and will likely differ in several ways, including composition, structure and properties.
 
The diagram below illustrates the general structure of the Accordion Pill:
 

All of the ingredients in the Accordion Pill (active and inactive) are combined physically, not chemically, thus maintaining the chemical composition of the active ingredients.
 
The Accordion Pill has a drug release mechanism that is independent of the gastric retention mechanism. It can combine both immediate and controlled release profiles, as well as more than one drug. We have demonstrated that the Accordion Pill has the ability to carry a drug load of up to 550 mg. We have also demonstrated that the Accordion Pill fully degrades in the intestine once it is expelled from the stomach.

Our Product Pipeline
 
Our product pipeline currently includes several product candidates in various clinical trial stages. Our leading pipeline product, AP-CD/LD, is focused on leveraging our Accordion Pill technology to improve the efficacy and safety of an approved drug for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease symptoms in advanced Parkinson’s disease patients. We have agreed with the FDA on the remaining clinical development program for AP-CD/LD for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease symptoms in advanced Parkinson’s disease patients, including the main principles of our ongoing ACCORDANCE study, a pivotal Phase III clinical for AP-CD/LD for the treatment of advanced Parkinson’s disease. In April 2016, we enrolled the first patient in the ACCORDANCE study and in October 2018, we completed enrollment. We currently expect to release top-line results in mid-2019. See “— Current Regulatory Status of AP-CD/LD.” We also initiated a new clinical development program for our Accordion Pill platform with the two primary cannabinoids contained in cannabis sativa, which we refer to as AP-Cannabinoids. We are formulating and testing CBD, and THC, for the treatment of various pain indications. The AP-Cannabinoids are currently in Phase I.
 
In addition, in December 2018, we reported that we successfully developed an Accordion Pill for a Novartis proprietary compound that met the required in vitro specifications set forth in a feasibility agreement with Novartis. We have mutually agreed to proceed with the program and plan to enter the clinic with a first-in-human PK study in the first half of 2019. We believe continued success with this program further validates the platform, confirms our technical abilities to build custom APs and paves the way for additional collaborative agreements.
 
Our Business Strategy
 
We plan to leverage our Accordion Pill technology platform to become a leading specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing improved proprietary versions of approved and development stage drugs for the treatment of various diseases.
 
We intend to continue to develop our existing product candidates while reviewing other drug candidates that may also benefit from our platform technology. We seek to create global partnerships to assist us in the development and marketing of our products and may also independently commercialize certain products in the U.S. We believe that our approach will allow us to continue to advance our current product candidates and should allow us to avoid dependency on a small number of drugs.
 
Using this approach, we have advanced our product candidates into various stages of clinical development. Specific elements of our current strategy include the following:
 

● | Continue to advance our current pipeline by developing improved versions of drugs with reduced side effects and that enhance the efficacy of existing drugs. We expect that our products will potentially offer significant advantages over the original versions of the drugs. Results from our completed Phase II clinical trial demonstrate that AP-CD/LD can improve motor function in patients suffering “off time” episodes. “Off time” refers to debilitating periods of decreased motor and non-motor functions. We are pursuing the development and approval of AP-CD/LD under the Section 505(b)(2) pathway, which allows us to rely in part upon FDA’s prior findings of safety or efficacy for an approved CD/LD reference drug. In October 2018, we completed patient enrollment in our Phase III ACCORDANCE Study and expect to report top-line results in mid-2019. If our pivotal Phase III clinical trial is successful, we intend to submit an NDA for regulatory approval in the United States.

● | Utilize the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway to leverage extensive existing clinical and regulatory experience with the original drugs and bring our improved versions of these drugs to market more quickly. An NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA may be permitted to reference FDA’s prior conclusions regarding the safety and effectiveness of that previously approved drug, or rely in part on data in the public domain. This may expedite the development program for our product candidates by potentially decreasing the amount of clinical data that we would need to generate to submit an NDA. As the FDA has previously agreed that our lead product, AP-CD/LD, would likely be eligible to file under Section 505(b)(2), assuming the successful completion of the ACCORDANCE study, we believe that there is a strong likelihood that our future products would similarly qualify. The factors related to this qualification are expected to reduce the time and costs associated with clinical trials when compared to a traditional NDA for an NCE. We also believe the strategy of targeting drugs with proven safety and efficacy provides a better prospect of clinical success of our proprietary development portfolio as compared to de novo drug development. We estimate that the average time to market and cost of clinical trials for our products could be less than that required to develop a new drug.

● | Use our expertise with our platform technology to evaluate drug development and commercialization opportunities. We continuously seek attractive product candidates to develop and commercialize. We intend to focus on product candidates that we believe would be synergistic with our Accordion Pill technology. We intend to use our expertise in our technology and our pharmacological expertise to grow our product candidate portfolio.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Seek attractive partnership opportunities. We believe that our Accordion Pill technology can be applied to many drugs that have already been approved by the FDA, as well as developmental stage drugs. We believe that the proprietary rights provided by our Accordion Pill technology, together with the clinical and compliance benefits, will be attractive to potential partners. We are seeking to build a portfolio of commercially attractive partnerships in a blend of co-developments and licenses. Where possible, we are seeking partnerships that allow us to participate significantly in the commercial success of each of the drugs. Although we are currently developing most of our current pipeline, we are looking to partner with the owners of rights to patented drugs in order to develop Accordion Pill versions of those drugs, and we may seek strategic partners to market our Accordion Pill products worldwide. We may also seek arrangements with third parties to assist in the development and commercialization of our products. These arrangements will allow us to share the high development cost, minimize the risk of failure and enjoy our partners’ marketing capabilities, while also enabling us to treat a more significant number of patients.

● | Develop products that target significant commercial opportunities. Our existing product candidates are intended to target diseases that have major global markets. Our intent is to continue to develop products that present significant market opportunities by leveraging our Accordion Pill technology.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Maintain a prominent intellectual property position. We believe our licensed and proprietary patents and patent applications provide and will provide broad and comprehensive coverage for the use of our Accordion Pill technology for the treatment of certain diseases, focusing on BCS Class II/IV and NAW drugs, or drugs where longer retention in the upper GI tract could improve efficacy and absorption and reduce side effects. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that we believe are important to the development of our business. We also rely on know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position. We have submitted and intend to continue to submit patent applications for various Accordion Pill and drug combinations that we develop.

AP-CD/LD for the Treatment of Parkinson’s Disease Symptoms in Advanced Parkinson’s Disease Patients
 
Parkinson’s disease
 
Parkinson’s disease is a progressive, degenerative disease characterized by movement symptoms such as involuntary tremor or trembling in the hands, arms and legs; muscle rigidity of the limbs and trunk; slowness of and a decline in movement; and impaired balance and coordination. In its advanced stages, the disease causes comprehensive dysfunction of the patient’s bodily systems, including difficulties in swallowing, speech disorders and significant mental decline. Parkinson’s disease results from a continuing loss of dopamine-producing nerve cells. Dopamine is required for normal functioning of the central nervous system and smooth, coordinated function of the body’s muscles and movement. According to the National Parkinson’s Foundation, the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease appear when approximately 60–80% of dopamine-producing cells are damaged.
 
Although there is presently no cure for Parkinson’s disease, there are a number of medications that provide relief from the symptoms. Dopamine replacement therapy with Levodopa is generally considered to be the most effective treatment for Parkinson’s disease. After 50 years of clinical use, Levodopa therapy still offers the best symptomatic control of Parkinson’s disease and is the most widely used therapy. Levodopa is converted into dopamine in the brain and is usually administered with Carbidopa, which helps prevent Levodopa from converting to dopamine outside the brain. Levodopa helps reduce tremor, stiffness and slowness and helps improve muscle control, balance and walking. Virtually all Parkinson’s disease patients will require Levodopa therapy during the course of their disease.
 
Parkinson’s disease patients typically experience a satisfactory response to initial treatment with Levodopa. However, at later stages of Parkinson’s disease, there is a decline in the capacity of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system, or the brain pathways that moderate control of voluntary movement, to synthesize, store, and release dopamine. Therefore, the dopaminergic system becomes more and more dependent on dopamine from external sources, such as Levodopa treatment.
 
As the disease progresses, it becomes increasingly difficult to control the symptoms adequately by Levodopa treatment, and patients develop motor complications, for the following reasons:
 

● | The duration of the response after each Levodopa dose declines, resulting in a “wearing off” effect, wherein the clinical benefits of Levodopa are lost until the next dose reaches therapeutic levels.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The patients suffer from longer periods in which Levodopa does not provide symptom relief and patients’ movements are severely restricted (i.e., off time).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | When Levodopa doses are increased to address the loss of clinical benefit, involuntary movements or troublesome dyskinesia emerges.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recent studies have reported that up to 50% of patients show the onset of motor fluctuations within two years of starting conventional Levodopa therapy. For many patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease, the repeated emergence of off states can occupy up to one-third or more of a typical waking day. The loss of consistent symptomatic control from Levodopa is a major challenge for the long-term management of Parkinson’s disease. When Parkinson’s disease patients experience “wearing off” between Levodopa doses, this short-duration response occurs in parallel to the drug’s peripheral PK profile. Therefore, with the evolution of these short-duration responses, improving the consistency in Levodopa’s plasma levels becomes the major factor for improving symptom control.
 

Oral Levodopa formulations currently on the market do not provide satisfactory consistent Levodopa plasma levels. There are two major challenges to maintaining consistency in Levodopa plasma levels: (i) the very short half-life of Levodopa (approximately 90 minutes) and (ii) the fact that Levodopa’s absorption is confined to the upper part of the GI tract (i.e., it has an NAW). For drugs with an NAW, conventional controlled release formulations are limited in providing long-acting performance, as once the drug has passed through the upper GI tract, it will no longer be absorbed. These factors result in high peak-to-trough ratios of Levodopa in the plasma, namely high variability of the concentration of the drug in the blood, rather than a consistent level being maintained, reducing the clinical benefits of Levodopa therapy. Providing stable Levodopa plasma levels is therefore a major unmet need for the long-term management of Parkinson’s disease.
 
Key opinion leaders interviewed by Global Data, a market research provider, summarized the unmet needs in Parkinson’s disease treatment to include, among others, greater efficacy in reducing motor complications, reducing side effects and reducing pill burden.
 
Market. According to a 2018 report by Global Data, Parkinson’s disease is the second most common chronic progressive neurodegenerative disorder in the elderly after Alzheimer’s disease, affecting 1%–2% of individuals worldwide over the age of 65 and the annual growth of Parkinson’s disease cases in individuals over the age of 65 from 2016 to 2026, in the Seven Major Markets, is estimated to be 2.28%. According to Global Data, in 2016 the market for pharmaceutical treatments for Parkinson’s disease was approximately $3.1 billion a year in the Seven Major Markets growing to $8.8 billion by 2026. According to a 2016 Global Burden of Disease Study there are approximately 6.1 million people worldwide who suffer from Parkinson’s disease.
 
We have also conducted, together with leading consultants, market assessment of AP-CD/LD for the treatment of the symptoms associated with advanced Parkinson’s disease. The assessment indicates there is a substantial market for AP-CD/LD with hundreds of thousands of patients suffering with Parkinson’s disease appropriate for AP-CD/LD treatment.
 
Our Solution — AP-CD/LD
 
AP-CD/LD, our lead product candidate, is in development for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease symptoms. AP-CD/LD is an Accordion Pill that contains the generic drugs Carbidopa and Levodopa, which are currently approved for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease symptoms. We have successfully completed a Phase II clinical trial, and the FDA has permitted us to initiate a Phase III clinical trial of AP-CD/LD. On May 5, 2015, we held an end of Phase II meeting with the FDA for AP-CD/LD. We reached an agreement with the FDA on the remaining clinical development program for AP-CD/LD and are currently conducting a pivotal Phase III clinical trial, the ACCORDANCE Study.

AP-CD/LD – Clinical Trials
 
Phase II Clinical Trial
 
Our Phase II clinical trial with AP-CD/LD was a multi-center, open-label, randomized, crossover, active control trial that included five groups. Overall, 60 patients completed the trial per protocol, in several medical centers in Israel. The Phase II clinical trial assessed safety, PK and pharmacodynamics/efficacy in patients with various stages of Parkinson’s disease compared with their current Levodopa treatment. Each group of the clinical trial was deemed to initiate upon the first patient enrolling in a group and to be completed upon the conclusion of data analysis. The initiation and completion dates for groups 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 were August 2009 – December 2009, April 2010 – August 2010, December 2010 – July 2011, August 2011 – November 2011 and December 2011 – October 2012, respectively. The following table details the structure, design and purpose of the Phase II clinical trial:

Pharmacokinetic Results
 
Group 1 of our Phase II clinical trial with AP-CD/LD was conducted with 12 male and female patients with non-fluctuating Parkinson’s disease. The crossover design included the following treatment arms: (i) AP-CD/LD 50/250 mg administered b.i.d and (ii) immediate release CD/LD 25/250 mg administered by half tablet q.i.d, resulting in a total daily dosage of 50/500mg. The treatments were administered for six days, with the seventh day consisting of PK testing. On the PK day of the control period, patients were given an additional 50 mg of Carbidopa (12.5 mg q.i.d) to achieve the recommended daily 70 – 100 mg dose of Carbidopa. Immediately following the PK testing on day seven, the patients crossed over to the other treatment to repeat the seven day process. This study concluded that (i) the bioavailability of Levodopa when administered via AP-CD/LD was similar to the immediate release reference; (ii) AP-CD/LD provided more stable plasma levels of Levodopa, with reduced peak-to-trough ratio, when compared to the immediate release reference; and (iii) AP-CD/LD provided higher morning Levodopa plasma levels than the immediate release reference.
 
Group 3 of our Phase II clinical trial with AP-CD/LD was conducted with ten male and female patients with advanced, fluctuating Parkinson’s disease, of which eight completed the PK trial per protocol. The crossover design included the following treatment arms: in the AP-CD/LD treatment arm, the AP-CD/LD 50/375 mg was administered b.i.d for six at home days of treatment with up to an additional three add-on immediate release Carbidopa/Levodopa, as needed, and on day seven, b.i.d administration of AP-CD/LD 50/375 mg. In the control arm, the patient’s current treatments were administered for six at home days and, on the seventh day, they were given immediate release Carbidopa/Levodopa 18.75/187.5 mg q.i.d, resulting in a total dosage of 75/750 mg. On the seventh day of each treatment regime, we conducted PK testing. Immediately following the PK testing on day seven, the patients were crossed over to the other treatment to repeat the seven day process.
 
These trials concluded that (i) the PK of AP-CD/LD demonstrated an efficient controlled-release profile, with significantly more stable Levodopa levels; (ii) the Levodopa absorption phase was increased more than six-fold versus the control treatment; (iii) the b.i.d administration of AP-CD/LD provided daily coverage of therapeutic Levodopa plasma levels; (iv) the peak-to-trough ratio in Levodopa plasma levels was half of those of the control; (v) the morning, or pre-first dose, Levodopa plasma levels of AP-CD/LD, were significantly higher than the control; and (vi) Levodopa’s high bioavailability was preserved when using AP-CD/LD.

The PK results showed that peak to trough ratio, which measures the maximum average concentration relative to the minimum average concentration of LD plasma levels, was reduced from 29.9 to 3.2 with the AP-CD/LD. Cmax/Cmin with the AP-CD/LD was 5.8. The average LD plasma levels during time 0-16 hours was 1,038 ng/ml.
 
Pharmacodynamics Results
 
The following figure sets forth the structure of the Phase II clinical trial for Groups 4 and 6:
 


* | Patient’s optimized CD/LD regimen.
--+-----------------------------------

 
CD/LD = Carbidopa/Levodopa
 
Groups 3, 4 and 6 of our Phase II clinical trial examined the pharmacodynamic effects of AP-CD/LD. Each group assessed the effects in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease; ten, 16 and 18 patients completed the trials per protocol in Groups 3, 4 and 6, respectively. Groups 3 and 4 tested AP-CD/LD in the 50/375 mg strength, administered b.i.d. with additional CD/LD immediate release tablets if needed; Group 6 tested the 50/500 mg strength administered b.i.d. with additional CD/LD immediate release tablets if needed. In these three trials, AP-CD/LD was compared to the patients’ current Levodopa treatment (including a dopamine decarboxylase inhibitor, such as Carbidopa). All three groups were cross-over, with Group 3 receiving the treatments as described above and Groups 4 and 6 receiving each of their current treatment and AP-CD/LD for 21 days, with the second tested treatment starting immediately after completion of the first. In Groups 4 and 6, off time, on time and dyskinesia were assessed by patient-completed home diaries during days 18 through 20 of each arm.
 
Because Levodopa is usually prescribed for long-term treatment, three weeks of treatment with AP-CD/LD was sufficient to demonstrate statistically significant improvements in the primary endpoint, as well as most of the secondary endpoints. The statistical significance of a result was captured by the associated “p-value”, or the estimated probability that the observed effect was by chance. A “p-value” of less than 0.05 implied that there was less than a 5% probability that the observed effect was by chance, and was generally accepted as a statistically significant event.
 
These studies demonstrated that (i) total off time was decreased when taking AP-CD/LD versus the control, by 44% and 45% in Groups 4 and 6, respectively (statistically significant p<0.0001); (ii) improvements in off time and on time without troublesome dyskinesia did not come at the expense of an increase of on time with troublesome dyskinesia, and, moreover, with the AP-CD/LD 50/500 mg troublesome dyskinesia was decreased by 0.5 hours (statistically significant p = 0.002); (iii) the effect of AP-CD/LD on total off time and on time with troublesome dyskinesia resulted in a total increase of “good” on time (i.e., without troublesome dyskinesia) of 2.1 and 2.7 hours per day in Groups 4 and 6, respectively (statistically significant p<0.0001); (iv) the improvements in treating symptoms with AP-CD/LD were achieved with fewer daily doses; and (v) the improvements in treating symptoms with AP-CD/LD correlate with stable Levodopa plasma levels throughout the day with appropriate therapeutic levels of the drug.

The figure below reflects the mean total off time in hours over a 24 hour period during days 18 through 20 of Groups 4 and 6. The average total off time was reduced by 1.9 hours and 2.3 hours with AP-CD/LD 50/375 mg (Group 4) and 50/500 mg (Group 6), respectively. This reduction is statistically significant (p<0.0001).

The figure below reflects the mean total “good” on time (on time without troublesome dyskinesia) in hours over a 24 hour period during days 18 through 20 of Groups 4 and 6. The average total “good” on time was increased by 2.1 hours and 2.7 hours with AP-CD/LD 50/375 mg (Group 4) and 50/500 mg (Group 6), respectively. This reduction is statistically significant (p<0.0001).

The figure below reflects the mean total on time with troublesome dyskinesia in hours over a 24 hour period during days 18 through 20 of Groups 4 and 6. On time with troublesome dyskinesia was not changed and decreased by 0.5 hours (p = 0.002) with AP-CD/LD 50/375 mg (Group 4) and 50/500 mg (Group 6), respectively.

* | In the administration of the AP-CD/LD arm, patients received b.i.d AP-CD/LD pills and were allowed to take additional commercially available immediate release Carbidopa/Levodopa formulations, as add-ons when needed. As seen in the figure above, patients took, in addition to the b.i.d AP-CD/LD pills, one-and-a-half to two commercially available immediate-release Carbidopa/Levodopa formulations, in Groups 4 and 6, respectively.

Demonstration of the clinical benefits of these peak to trough ratios will be further studied and confirmed in the ACCORDANCE study.
 
Phase I Clinical Trials
 
We conducted four Phase I clinical trials - three to assess the PK profile of Levodopa when administered in several formulations and one to measure the GR time of our Accordion Pill without an active ingredient.
 
The first PK trial was conducted with early formulations in 24 healthy volunteers to assess the PK profile of Levodopa when administered in the following three forms: (i) in an Accordion Pill with a dosage of 75/300 mg; (ii) in the immediate release form currently on the market, Sinemet; and (iii) in the controlled release form currently on the market, Sinemet CR. This group underwent a partially randomized open trial compared with immediate release Sinemet and controlled release Sinemet. The trial results indicated a significant prolongation of Levodopa’s mean residence time, or MRT, in the blood when administered with the Accordion Pill compared with the Sinemet and Sinemet CR. Furthermore, the study showed the level of Levodopa received with the Accordion Pill reached treatment-relevant levels.

The second PK trial was conducted with early formulations in 23 healthy volunteers to assess the PK profile of Levodopa when administered in the following two forms: (i) an Accordion Pill in two formulations, 75/300 mg and 50/200 mg; and (ii) in the currently marketed immediate release form, Sinemet. This was a randomized open trial, compared with immediate release Sinemet. The trial results indicated a very significant increase in the MRT of Levodopa in the blood when administered with the Accordion Pill in both formulations, and a very significant prolongation of the absorption phase (up to 12 hours) of Levodopa was demonstrated when administered with the Accordion Pill compared with Sinemet (two hours).
 
The third PK trial was conducted with the AP-CD/LD 50/500 mg Phase II formulation in 18 healthy volunteers to assess the PK profile of Levodopa when administered in the following two forms: (i) AP-CD/LD 50/500 mg; and (ii) the currently marketed immediate release form, Sinemet. This was a randomized open trial, compared with immediate release Sinemet. The trial results indicated that the absorption phase of Levodopa was increased to approximately ten hours when administered with the Accordion Pill compared to approximately two hours with Sinemet.
 
The GR Phase I clinical trial was a MRI study conducted with 17 Parkinson’s patients to measure the GR time of the Accordion Pill without an active pharmaceutical ingredient. This trial was a non-randomized open trial comparison of a few formulations. The results indicated that GR of over 13 hours can be achieved in these patients using all three formulations.
 
Safety
 
AP-CD/LD was tested for safety on Göttingen minipigs in accordance with the FDA’s guidelines. The study was 180 days and a subgroup of minipigs were kept for recovery for an additional 30 days without receiving any treatments. This study included the following four arms: AP-CD/LD 50/400 mg three times daily, AP-CD/LD 50/500 mg b.i.d, a Carbidopa/Levodopa reference (Sinemet) and a placebo. The study was completed in March 2014. The study evaluated (i) animal wellbeing as represented by behavior, food consumption and weight, (ii) microscopic and macroscopic organ pathology, (iii) ophthalmic evaluation and (iv) electrocardiograms of the miniature pigs, which is the recording of the electrical activity of the heart. This study’s results form an additional basis regarding the safety of AP-CD/LD.
 
In the Phase I and Phase II clinical trials, AP-CD/LD was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events that were related to the study drug. Adverse events were generally mild in severity and resolved without intervention. The most common adverse events reported included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, chest pain and fatigue, which are known adverse events associated with Levodopa treatment.
 
Current Regulatory Status of AP-CD/LD
 
On May 5, 2015, we held an end of Phase II meeting with the FDA for AP-CD/LD. We reached an agreement with the FDA on the remaining clinical development program for AP-CD/LD, and the following are the main principles of the single required pivotal Phase III clinical trial:
 

● | A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel, active-controlled trial, comparing the efficacy and safety of AP-CD/LD to Sinemet IR, an immediate release CD/LD, which is a conventional Levodopa medication for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease symptoms that is currently on the market.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The total treatment period for each patient is 25 weeks, composed of:
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | Six weeks open-label titration/ conversion/ optimization of Sinemet IR (all patients);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | Six weeks open-label titration/ optimization of AP-CD/LD (all patients); and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | 13 weeks double-blind, double-dummy active comparator period, in which approximately half of the patients are randomized to AP-CD/LD and half of the patients are randomized to Sinemet IR.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline to endpoint in the percent of daily off time during waking hours, based on Hauser home diaries.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In October 2018, we completed enrollment in our ACCORDANCE Study with a total of 462 patients entered into the Sinemet titration period. After the multiple titration and optimization steps, 320 patients were then randomized into the 13-week double-blinded portion of the study.

As part of our agreement with FDA regarding the approval of the AP-CD/LD product, we committed to perform additional safety studies on the first 100 patients with a predefined safety stopping rule related to gastric ulcers. These additional safety evaluations involved endoscopy procedures that would detect whether the AP was causing gastric ulcers of a predefined size that might be of medical concern. By the time the safety study completed enrollment of 123 patients, we were able to obtain evaluable paired gastroscopies (endoscopy procedures prior to AP treatment and at end of treatment) on 64 patients who completed all stages of the study. At the second scheduled periodic meeting of the independent data monitoring committee (DMC) in February 2018, the DMC determined that based on available results, there did not appear to be a significantly increased rate of the prespecified gastric ulcers defined in the safety charter. At that meeting, the DMC recommended to continue the ACCORDANCE study without modification. The DMC will continue to monitor adverse events of special interest, and also recommended we submit its comments and findings to the FDA, which we have done. No further endoscopic procedures are planned.
 
Consistent with International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Human Use (ICH) guidelines, we are also required to submit evidence of the adequate safety experience of at least 100 patients receiving AP-CD/LD for one year, with at least 50% receiving the highest proposed dose of AP-CD/LD. This is a standard requirement for drugs intended for long-term treatment of non-life-threatening conditions. We are collecting this long-term safety data, from our on-going open label extension of the ACCORDANCE study.
 
We also agreed, at the FDA’s request, to conduct an additional bioavailability study to compare the PK between Sinemet IR and the to-be-marketed formulation of AP-CD/LD as the formulation of AP-CD/LD has changed from our previously completed comparative bioavailability study. We currently intend to conduct this study during 2019. The FDA also strongly suggested that we conduct additional dissolution testing and we anticipate doing so.
 
In addition, in February 2019 we announced the results of a new PK study to determine the performance of the to-be-marketed formulation of AP-CD/LD when dosed three time per day (t.i.d). The objective of this open-label, crossover PK study was to compare the plasma levodopa variability in 12 Parkinson’s disease patients treated with standard levodopa therapy and with AP-CD/LD 50/500 mg t.i.d.  On day one, all participants received 1.5 tablets of standard Sinemet 25/100 mg five times at approximately three-hour intervals.  Plasma was collected for PK determination at 30-minute intervals for 16 hours in the clinic.  This period provided the reference PK profile for Sinemet. On days two through seven, PD patients were treated at home with AP-CD/LD 50/500 mg capsules dosed t.i.d., at approximately five-hour intervals. On day eight, participants returned to the clinic and PK assessments were repeated as described above. The primary outcome measure in this study was the fluctuation index [(Cmax-Cmin)/Cavg] in plasma levodopa concentration at steady state (between hours four and 16.)  The key secondary endpoint was the levodopa coefficient of variation.
 
AP-CD/LD 50/500 mg TID met its primary endpoint demonstrating significantly less variability than standard oral CD/LD when dosed 5x/ day in the levodopa fluctuation index (p<0.005) (see the table below).  These results were supported by the findings of significant outcomes on each of the prespecified sensitivity analyses.  Similar results were observed for the key secondary endpoint of coefficient of variation of plasma levodopa levels (p<0.047).  AP-CD/LD was very well tolerated with no reported adverse events. 
 

 | Primary Endpoint: Levodopa Fluctuation Index at Steady State (4-16 Hours)
----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Treatment/ Difference | Mean Value | 95% Confidence Interval | p-Value
Sinemet (IR-CD/LD) | 2.22 | 1.82 – 2.62 | -- 
Accordion AP-CD/LD | 1.59 | 1.23 – 1.95 | -- 
Difference | 0.63 | 0.24 – 1.03 | 0.005 

 
Phase III ACCORDANCE Study
 
The Phase III ACCORDANCE clinical trial of AP-CD/LD is a multi-center, global, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, parallel-group study in adult subjects with advanced PD. The study is evaluating the safety and efficacy of AP-CD/LD compared with immediate release CD/LD (IR-CD/LD; Sinemet) as a treatment for the symptoms of PD.
 
The study enrolled a total of 462 patients into the Sinemet titration period. After the multiple titration and optimization steps, 320 patients were then randomized into the 13-week double-blinded portion of the study. The study is being conducted at approximately 90 clinical sites throughout the U.S., Europe and Israel.
 
Preliminary analysis of the baseline data for the enrolled population shows:
 

· | Average age at study entry was 63 and 65% of enrolled patients were male;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Entering patients had a diagnosis of PD for 8.8 years on average;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The average daily levodopa dose for patients upon entering the blinded portion of the study was in excess of 800 mg and the most common Accordion Pill dose was AP-CD/LD 50/500mg three times per day;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Average daily OFF time for patients upon entering the study was approximately 6.1 hours; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Approximately 31% of patients were enrolled in the U.S.
--+--------------------------------------------------------

 
Prior to the 13-week randomized portion of the study, the ACCORDANCE study had two open label periods of 6 weeks each during which all patients in these open label periods were first stabilized and optimized on the active comparator, Sinemet, and then on AP-CD/LD. All patients completing the 13-week randomized period are eligible to continue in an OLE study in which they will receive treatment with AP-CD/LD for up to an additional 12 months. To date, more than 90% of eligible patients have elected to enter an open label extension study.

The following is an illustration of the study design:
 

The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is the change from baseline to endpoint in the percentage of daily off time during waking hours based on Hauser home diaries. The study is 90% powered to be statistically significant for a one-hour difference in off time between Sinemet and AP-CD/LD.
 
Secondary endpoints currently include change from baseline to endpoint in “on time” without troublesome dyskinesia during waking hours, CGI-I at endpoint as recorded by physician and patient and change from baseline through endpoint in the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Score parts 2 and 3.
 
We expect to report topline results from the ACCORDANCE Study in mid-2019.
 
Development of Accordion Pills with additional drugs
 
We are continuously evaluating the possibilities of developing Accordion Pills with various additional specific drugs for its pipeline. In August 2016, we announced the initiation of a new clinical development program for the Accordion Pill platform with the two primary cannabinoids contained in Cannabis Sativa, Cannabidiol (CBD) and 9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), for treatment of various pain indications. The Cannabis sativa plant is used in treatment of chronic pain and a variety of other indications. Previous clinical studies conducted using the whole plant or specific extracts generated evidence of the cannabis analgesic activity. Furthermore, extracts containing known amounts of the active plant driven compounds (mainly THC and CBD) or diverse synthetic THC derivatives are promising treatments for painful conditions that do not respond properly to currently available treatments, such as chronic, neuropathic, and inflammatory pain.
 
We believe that AP-Cannabinoids hold the potential to address several major drawbacks of current methods of use and treatment with cannabis and cannabinoids, such as short duration of effect, delayed onset, variability of exposure, variability of the administered dose and adverse events that correlate with peak levels. AP-Cannabinoids are designed to extend the absorption phase of CBD and THC, with the goal of more consistent levels, for an improved therapeutic effect. We believe that the cannabis market has significant commercial potential and is projected to represent approximately 10% of the specialty pharmaceutical market by 2020, or a market of at least $20 billion.
 
In August 2017, we announced the results of a Phase I clinical trial that compared the safety, tolerability and PK of AP-THC/CBD with Sativex®. This Phase I trial is a single-center, single-dose, randomized, three-way crossover study in Israel to compare the safety, tolerability and PK of two formulations of AP-CBD/THC with Buccal Sativex® in 21 normal healthy volunteers. The results showed that patients in the Accordion Pill CBD/THC arm demonstrated significant improvements in exposure to CBD (290% to 330%) and THC (25% to 50%) compared with Sativex®. The median time to peak concentration was 2-3 times longer than Sativex and absorption was significantly higher. Additionally, the formation of THC metabolites was meaningfully reduced, and the drug had a good safety profile and was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events reported. Sativex® is a commercially available oral buccal spray containing CBD and THC. Following the Phase 1 clinical trial, we evaluated the program and decided as a next step to develop two new Accordion Pills containing only the individual cannabinoid components, namely CBD and THC.
 
We recently commenced a Phase 1 PK study of AP-THC. The study is a single-center, single-dose, randomized, open-label three-way crossover study to investigate the PK, safety and tolerability of AP-THC in up to 18 normal healthy volunteers and we dosed the first patient in January 2019. We have completed the dosing of the AP-THC PK study and the data is in the process of being analyzed by a third party contract research organization per protocol. However, upon raw data review, the delivery of THC does not appear to meet our full program expectations. We await the full dataset and the statistical analysis to determine our next steps.

We successfully completed a Phase II clinical trial for Accordion Pill Zaleplon, or AP–ZP, in November 2011 under an IND that we submitted to the FDA for AP–ZP as a treatment for the induction and maintenance of sleep in patients suffering from insomnia. The FDA also agreed that AP-ZP could also benefit from the streamlined pathway available through filing an NDA pursuant to Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. The FDA indicated in written correspondence to us that we may be able to design the development program for AP–ZP in a manner that would allow us to obtain sufficient data for the NDA submission for AP–ZP in one pivotal Phase III clinical trial. The details of such a trial were not determined or confirmed with the FDA. We are currently focusing on the development of, and are employing almost all of our resources toward, AP-CD/LD and AP-Cannabinoids. We are not currently developing or seeking a partner to develop AP-ZP and we have not presently budgeted any funds toward its development. In the future, we may consider viable partnership opportunities for this product candidate.
 
In addition, in March 2016, we completed a Phase I clinical trial for one of our product candidates that is being developed for the prevention and treatment of gastroduodenal and small bowel NSAID induced ulcers. The PK results demonstrated in the Phase I trial were within the well-defined safety levels of the drug. At this time, we have not presently budgeted any funds toward the development of this product candidate.
 
In January 2018, we also entered into a feasibility and option agreement with Novartis Pharmaceutical to explore using the Accordion Pill platform for a proprietary Novartis compound. Following potentially successful feasibility studies, including a Phase I PK study, Novartis has the option to enter into negotiations with respect to a potential licensing agreement for employing Intec Pharma Accordion Pill technology. In December 2018, we reported that we successfully developed an Accordion Pill for the Novartis proprietary compound that met the required in vitro specifications set forth in a feasibility and option agreement with Novartis. We have mutually agreed to proceed with the program and plan to enter the clinic with a first-in-human PK study in the first half of 2019.
 
Manufacturing
 
We currently manufacture the Accordion Pill in our production and packaging facility located in Har Hotzvim, in Jerusalem, Israel, in the same building as our offices. This production and packaging facility was granted the Certificate of GMP Compliance of Manufacturer from the Israeli Ministry of Health in August 2018. This certificate applies in Israel, as well as in the EU, in accordance with the Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products (CAA) agreement between the EU and Israel. The certificate is valid until August 2021.
 
We have the capacity to manufacture the required quantities for the ACCORDANCE study. Our fully automated assembly line enables us to manufacture approximately two to three million capsules annually. With respect to the future commercialization of the AP-CD/LD, we have decided to rely on a third-party manufacturer. Establishing a manufacturing facility to produce commercial quantities of our products will require a substantial investment by any party intending to manufacture our products.
 
In March 2018, we entered into a Term Sheet for Manufacturing Services with LTS, for the commercial manufacture of AP-CD/LD, which was subsequently superseded in December 2018 by a Process Development Agreement. Under the agreement, LTS will exclusively manufacture and supply us with AP-CD/LD capsules using our proprietary Accordion Pill production technology in LTS’ manufacturing facility in Andernach, Germany subject to the execution and terms of a manufacturing and supply agreement to be negotiated and entered into between us and LTS. The large-scale automated production line for manufacturing AP-CD/LD capsules, or the Production Line, will be owned by us with LTS operating and maintaining the Production Line and owning the other production equipment for AP-CD/LD. Under the agreement, we are responsible for compensating LTS for certain development activities and we agreed to bear the costs incurred by LTS to acquire the other production equipment for AP-CD/LD, or Production Equipment, (which are estimated to total approximately seven million Euros and as of December 31, 2018 we transferred payments of approximately 4.3 million Euros); however such amount is required under the agreement to be later reimbursed to us by LTS in the form of a reduction in the purchase price of the AP-CD/LD capsules. In addition, upon our decision to not continue with the project or commercialization of the product, LTS has the right to (i) purchase the Production Equipment from us in which case LTS is required to pay to us the share of the cost of the Production Equipment paid by us less up to two million Euros for upgrade costs of LTS’s facility invested by LTS or (ii) transfer such Production Equipment to us in which case we are required to pay LTS up to two million Euros for upgrade costs of LTS’s facility invested by LTS. In addition, we may under certain circumstances be required to pay to LTS up to one million Euros for certain upgrade costs of LTS’ facility invested by LTS upon the earlier of the announcement of our Phase III results or October 31, 2019. The agreement shall continue in force unless earlier terminated or upon the termination of any future manufacturing agreement. The agreement contains several termination rights which are expected to be included in a definitive manufacturing and supply agreement, including, among others, in the cases of bankruptcy, breach by either party, change of control of either of the parties, or the sale or licensing by us of the Accordion Pill to a third party.
 
In December 2018, the Production Line was delivered to LTS in Andernach, Germany. We are in the process of installing and connecting all the ancillary equipment and expect to begin the validation, bioequivalency and stability studies needed for approval of our commercial production processes in the coming months. After preliminary discussions with the FDA in anticipation of filing for marketing approval of AP-CD/LD, we remain confident we are on track to submit a NDA for approval of AP-CD/LD in mid- to late-2020, assuming positive topline data in the Accordance Study in mid-2019.

We have received Israeli government grants for certain of our research and development activities. The terms of these grants may require us to satisfy specified conditions in order to manufacture products and transfer technologies outside of Israel. We may be required to pay penalties in addition to the repayment of the grants in case we decide to manufacture outside of Israel. With respect to the manufacturing of the AP-CD/LD, the Israel Innovation Authority, or IIA (formerly known as the Office of the Chief Scientist of the Ministry of Economy and Industry, or the OCS) approved our request to transfer 100% of the manufacturing rights to such product, which was developed under one of the IIA funded programs, to a non-Israeli manufacturer. As a result, we will be required to pay the IIA royalties from revenue generated from the AP-CD/LD product candidate at an increased rate and up to an increased cap amount. The IIA noted that the approval granted was exceptional and that the IIA will not approve manufacturing additional product candidates out of Israel.
 
The FDA will likely condition granting any marketing approval, if any, on a satisfactory on-site inspection of our manufacturing facilities. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to the Clinical Development, Manufacturing and Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates — Our product candidates are manufactured through a compounding, film casting and assembly process, and if we or one of our materials suppliers encounters problems manufacturing our products or raw materials, our business could suffer.”
 
Our manufacturing process consists of the following stages: compounding, which includes manufacturing of solutions and/or suspensions; film casting, which involves manufacturing of specific layers of films, including films containing the applicable drug; assembly and capsulation, which is processing and folding the films into an accordion shape and capsulation; and packaging, which entails packaging the pills in plastic bottles or blister packs.
 
Raw Materials and Supplies
 
With the exception of three inactive ingredients, we believe the raw materials that we require to manufacture AP-CD/LD and AP–Cannabinoids, as well as the raw materials that we require for our research and development operations relating to our products, are widely available from numerous suppliers and are generally considered to be generic pharmaceutical materials and supplies. Except as described below, we do not rely on a single supplier for the current production of any product in development or for our research and development operations relating to our products.
 
We usually contract with suppliers in Israel and worldwide to purchase the materials required for the research and development operations of our products. All the materials required in the research and development operations of our products are off-the-shelf pharmaceutical products; special production or special requirements are not required to order these materials. We have no written agreements with most of our suppliers. Rather, we submit purchase orders to our suppliers from time to time and as required.
 
Three of our inactive ingredients used in our products have only one supplier of each such ingredient. The three suppliers are each large, well-established suppliers (BASF, the Dow Chemical Company and Evonik), and most of the pharmaceutical industry relies on these suppliers when they need to purchase certain pharmaceutical products such as these inactive ingredients. To avoid a shortfall of these materials, we usually purchase sufficient material in advance for a period of at least one year. The pharmaceutical industry usually relies on these three manufacturers as suppliers of specific materials. The prices of these commonly used raw materials are not volatile.
 
Marketing and Sales
 
We do not currently have any marketing or sales capabilities. We intend to license to, or enter into strategic alliances with, companies in the pharmaceutical business, which are equipped to market and/or sell our products, if any, through their well-developed marketing and distribution networks. We may establish marketing and/or sales forces in the future in addition to licensing arrangements or strategic alliances.
Competition
 
The pharmaceutical and drug delivery technologies industries are characterized by rapidly evolving technology, intense competition and a highly risky, costly and lengthy research and development process. Adequate protection of intellectual property, successful product development, adequate funding and retention of skilled, experienced and professional personnel are among the many factors critical to success in the pharmaceutical industry.
 
Assertio Therapeutics, Inc. (formerly known as Depomed Inc.) has several products on the market based on its GR technology. Several companies have reported research projects related to systems designed for GR including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Avadel Pharmaceuticals, Merrion Pharmaceuticals, Sun Pharma and others, all of which develop products delivered orally that are designed for GR. We are not aware of any approved drug delivery system currently on the market that is similar to the Accordion Pill, nor are we aware of any product candidates that are similar to our Accordion Pill with respect to mechanism of action.
 
Other drug delivery technologies, other drugs on the market, new drugs under development (including drugs that are in more advanced stages of development in comparison to our product pipeline) and additional drugs that were originally intended for other purposes, but were found effective for the indications we target, may all be competitive to the current products in our pipeline. In fact, some of these drug delivery systems and drugs are well-established and accepted among patients and physicians in their respective markets, are orally bioavailable, can be efficiently produced and marketed, and are relatively safe and inexpensive. Moreover, other companies of various sizes engage in activities similar to ours, including large pharmaceutical companies, such as Pfizer and Novartis, who have established in-house capabilities for the development of drug delivery technologies. Most, if not all, of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources available to them. Competitors include companies with marketed products and/or an advanced research and development pipeline.

Current Treatments on the Market and in Development for Parkinson’s Disease
 
The current common treatments for Parkinson’s disease include Levodopa (usually used in conjunction with other drugs such as Carbidopa), which is currently the standard and most efficient Parkinson’s medication used, and dopamine agonists, such as bromocriptine, pergolide, pramipexole and ropinirole, as well as MAO inhibitors and COMT inhibitors. However, Levodopa therapy is associated with “wearing-off”, a condition in which a treatment’s effects diminish over time as the disease progresses, and dyskinesia, or involuntary disturbing movements.
 
We believe our direct competition will include other technologies designed to address the need for more stable Levodopa levels. As such, AP-CD/LD will compete against other Levodopa-based Parkinson’s drugs that are already on the market, such as Sinemet, a combination of Levodopa and Carbidopa, which is sold by Merck, as well as generic Sinemet, which is sold by various generic manufacturers. In addition, other technologies and drug delivery systems designed to address the Levodopa blood concentration problem currently exist. To our knowledge, based on publicly-filed documents, press releases and published studies, we believe the companies described below would be our primary competition with respect to AP-CD/LD.
 
Novartis and Orion combine Levodopa and Carbidopa with Comtan (entacapone), a drug that inhibits the clearance of Levodopa from the blood, thereby slowing the rapid drop in the Levodopa level in the blood. Additional drug candidates that are developed by Bial and Orion are based on the same approach.
 
Solvay Pharmaceuticals, which has been acquired by AbbVie Inc., introduced a drug delivery system based on implanting a tube in the duodenum area attached to an external pump that releases Levodopa formulation directly to the NAW. This product has been approved for marketing in the United States and Europe. The invasive nature of implanting a tube in patients, most of whom are elderly, as well as various difficulties related to the system, are certain disadvantages of this technology.
 
Impax Laboratories, which has merged with Amneal Pharmaceuticals, has developed a product, RytaryTM, or IPX066, a continuous release Levodopa capsule formulation. The product was launched in April 2015. In addition, Amneal is developing IPX203, a new extended-release oral capsule formulation of carbidopa and levodopa, as a potential treatment for symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. IPX203 has commenced a Phase III clinical trial.
 
Civitas Therapeutics, Inc., which was acquired by Acorda Therapeutics, Inc. in September 2014, has developed a product, INBRIJATM, or CVT-301, a self-administered, adjunctive, as needed, inhaled oral Levodopa, for the ability to rapidly and predictably treat “off” episodes as they occur. In December 2018, Acorda announced that the FDA approved INBRIJATM for intermittent treatment of OFF episodes in people with Parkinson’s disease treated with carbidopa/levodopa.
 
NeuroDerm Ltd., which was acquired by Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation in October 2017, has the following subcutaneous product candidates, ND0612H and ND0612L for the treatment of patients suffering from Parkinson’s disease. These product candidates have completed Phase II clinical trials.
 
Other technologies for delivering Levodopa, such as through the skin (transdermal administration) using a patch, injections or inhalations, as well as new formulations and chemical modifications of Levodopa and/or complementary drugs, currently exist and might compete with AP-CD/LD as well, but, to our knowledge, these technologies, formulations and modifications have not yet been submitted for approval.
 
Government Regulation
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceuticals under the FDCA, and its implementing regulations. These products are also subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations, including federal and state consumer protection laws, laws protecting the privacy of health-related information, and laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive acts and trade practices.
 
The process required by the FDA before a new drug product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies, performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations; submission to the FDA of an IND which FDA must allow to become effective before human clinical trials in the US may begin; performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication; and submission to the FDA of an NDA for the drug, after completion of all pivotal clinical trials. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans.
 
Clinical trials that involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects are conducted under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with current Good Clinical Practice, or cGCP which is intended to protect the rights, safety and welfare of humans participating in research and assure the quality, reliability and integrity of data collected. A protocol for each clinical trial conducted in the US, or other protocols under IND even not conducted in the US, and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical trial site’s Institutional Review Board, or IRB, before the trials may be initiated, and the IRB must monitor the trial until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries.
 
17

 

Clinical trials are usually conducted in three phases. Phase I clinical trials are normally conducted in small groups of healthy volunteers to assess safety and tolerability. After an acceptable dose has been established, the drug is administered to small populations of patients (Phase II) to look for initial signs of efficacy in treating the targeted disease or condition and to continue to assess safety. Phase III clinical trials are usually multi-center, double-blind controlled trials in hundreds or even thousands of subjects at various sites to assess as fully as possible both the safety and effectiveness of the drug.
 
The FDA, the IRB, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the trial subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by a data safety monitoring board, or DSMB. This group of experts reviews unblinded data from clinical trials and provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points. A DSMB may order a trial halted if it believes that the risk to subjects is unacceptable or the product is so effective as to make it unethical to administer placebos or alternate treatments to the non-treatment arms. The sponsor may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business reasons.
 
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational drug product information is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product in the US for one or more indications. The NDA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee, which may be waived in certain circumstances. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. FDA has sixty days from the applicant’s submission of an NDA to either accept the NDA for filing or issue a refusal-to-file letter if it finds that the application is not sufficiently complete to permit substantive review.
 
Once the NDA submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months of filing. However, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations.
 
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities involved in the production of the product, as well as inspections of selected clinical trial sites for data integrity, it may issue an approval letter or, instead, a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the application is not ready for approval in its present form. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing, or any combination thereof. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA could also approve the NDA with restrictive indications, labeling that includes particular risk information, or a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. Such post-market testing may include Phase IV clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 
After regulatory approval of a drug product is obtained, we would be required to comply with a number of post-approval requirements. As a holder of an approved NDA, we would be required to report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, to provide updated safety and efficacy information, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for any of our products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP after approval, which includes, among other things, maintenance of a stability program. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural, substantive, and record keeping requirements. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of product out of specification results and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 
We produce, and expect to continue to produce, the quantities of our product candidates required for our clinical trials, and we do not yet have a need to produce our product candidates for commercial purposes. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers or licensees that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary withdrawal of the product’s approval, seizure, or FDA-initiated judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
 
In addition, as the NDA holder, we will be responsible for legal and regulatory compliance for advertising and promotion of the drug product. We are required to provide to the FDA copies of all drug promotion at the time of first use, and to ensure that all information disseminated conforms to the product’s approved labeling and other FDA regulations and policies.

505(b)(2) Applications
 
We intend to submit NDAs for our proposed products, assuming that the clinical data justify submission, under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, assuming the FDA agrees with our assessment that a given proposed product qualifies for review under that section. If the FDA disagrees with that assessment or revises its decision at a later date, we would be compelled to file under section 505(b)(1), which is the normal route used for traditional new drugs where the data relied upon for the NDA filing have been developed by the sponsor during its clinical trials. In contrast, Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA when at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely on published literature and the FDA’s findings of safety and effectiveness based on certain pre-clinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the changes from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. The abbreviated Section 505(b)(2) approval pathway increases the likelihood that the timeframe and costs associated with commercializing products will be lower than under a typical Section 505(b)(1) approval pathway.
 
Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (commonly known as the Orange Book) identifies drug products approved on the basis of safety and effectiveness by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and related patent and exclusivity information. When an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would.
 
Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:
 

● | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------


● | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
 
If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. This same procedure that applied to an ANDA applicant also applies to an NDA applicant under Section 505(b)(2).
 
Patent Term Restoration and Extension
 
A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for the patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The USPTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA.
 
19

 

Marketing Exclusivity
 
A Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant may be eligible for its own regulatory exclusivity period, such as three-year exclusivity. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant for a new condition of use, or change to a marketed product, such as a new extended release formulation for a previously approved product, may be granted a three-year market exclusivity if one or more clinical studies, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, were essential to the approval of the application and were conducted or sponsored by the applicant. Should this occur, the FDA would be precluded from approving any other application for the same new condition of use or for a change to the drug product that was granted exclusivity until after that three-year exclusivity period has run. Additional exclusivities may also apply.
Reimbursement
 
We face uncertainties over the pricing of pharmaceutical products. Sales of our product candidates will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal health programs, commercial insurance and managed care organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures, foreign governments and third party payors have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, pricing transparency disclosure obligations, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover any of our products after approved as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our product candidates on a profitable basis.
 
Specifically, in both the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our product candidates profitably. In the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, also called the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and certain others. Prior to MMA, Medicare did not cover most outpatient prescription drugs. MMA created a new voluntary Part D, which covers outpatient drugs for Medicare beneficiaries and is administered by private insurance plans that operate partially at-risk under contract with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS. These private Part D plans have incentives to keep costs down. MMA also introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered drugs. In addition, this legislation provided authority for limiting the number of certain outpatient drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class.
 
In recent years, Congress has considered further reductions in Medicare reimbursement for drugs administered by physicians. CMS has issued and will continue to issue regulations to implement the law which will affect Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payors. Medicare, which is the single largest third-party payment program and which is administered by CMS, covers prescription drugs in one of two ways. Medicare part B covers outpatient prescription drugs that are administered by physicians and Medicare part D covers other outpatient prescription drugs, but through private insurers. Medicaid, a health insurance program for the poor, is funded jointly by CMS and the states, but is administered by the states; states are authorized to cover outpatient prescription drugs, but that coverage is subject to caps and to substantial rebates. CMS also has the authority to revise reimbursement rates and to implement coverage restrictions for some drugs. Cost reduction initiatives and changes in coverage implemented through legislation or regulation could decrease utilization of and reimbursement for any approved products, which in turn would affect the price we can receive for those products. While the MMA and implementing regulations apply primarily to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from federal legislation or regulation may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. 
 
In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended, or the Affordable Care Act, which was amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively, PPACA became law in the United States, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers and impose additional health policy reforms. As amended, the PPACA expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability to include covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, increased the minimum rebate due for innovator drugs (both single source drugs and innovator multiple source drugs) from 15.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP to 23.1% of AMP or the difference between the AMP and best price, whichever is greater. The total rebate amount for innovator drugs is capped at 100.0% of AMP. The PPACA and subsequent legislation also narrowed the definition of AMP. Furthermore, the PPACA imposes a significant annual, nondeductible fee on companies that manufacture or import certain branded prescription drug products. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may affect our business practices with healthcare practitioners, and a significant number of provisions are not yet, or have only recently become, effective. The PPACA likely will continue to put pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. The PPACA remains subject to continuing legislative scrutiny, including efforts by Congress to repeal and amend a number of its provisions, as well as administrative actions delaying the effectiveness of key provisions. In addition, there have been lawsuits filed by various stakeholders pertaining to certain portions of the PPACA that may have the effect of modifying or altering various parts of the law. Efforts to date to amend or repeal the PPACA have generally been unsuccessful.
 
20

 

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. In August 2011, then President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, creates the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of an amount greater than $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to healthcare providers of up to 2.0% per fiscal year, starting in 2013. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several categories of healthcare providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, signed into law on November 2, 2015, increased the rebates that generic drug manufacturers are obligated to pay under the Medicaid program by applying an inflation-based rebate formula to generic drugs that previously only applied to brand name drugs. Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Trump Administration announced initiatives that it asserted are intended to result in purportedly lower drug prices. The first initiative, announced on October 15, 2018, involved the plan for a new federal regulation that would require pharmaceutical manufacturers to disclose the list prices of their respective prescription drugs in their television advertisements for their products if the list price is greater than $35. With respect to the second initiative, on October 25, 2018, the CMS gave Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to propose the implementation of an “International Pricing Index” model for Medicare Part B drugs and biologicals (single source drugs, biologicals, and biosimilars). Public comments were due on December 31, 2018 with a proposed rule theoretically being offered as early as spring 2019 with target implementation of a 5 year pilot program beginning in spring 2020. On January 31, 2019, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, Office of Inspector General proposed modifications to federal Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbors which, among other things, may affect rebates paid by manufacturers to Medicare Part D plans, the purpose of which is to further reduce the cost of drug products to consumers. While these initiatives have not been put into effect, we are not in a position to know at this time whether they will ever become law or what impact the enactment either of these proposals would have on our business.
 
Various states, such as California, have also taken steps to consider and enact laws or regulations that are intended to increase the visibility of the pricing of pharmaceutical products with the goal of reducing the prices at which we are able to sell our products. Because these various actual and proposed legislative changes are intended to operate on a state-by-state level rather than a national one, we cannot predict what the full effect of these legislative activities may be on our business in the future.
 
Although we cannot predict the full effect on our business of the implementation of existing legislation, including the PPACA or the enactment of additional legislation pursuant to healthcare and other legislative reform, we believe that legislation or regulations that would reduce reimbursement for or restrict coverage of our products could adversely affect how much or under what circumstances healthcare providers will prescribe or administer our products.
 
Additionally, in some countries, particularly the countries comprising the EU the pricing of pharmaceuticals and certain other therapeutics is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product andidate to other available therapies.
 
DEA
 
Our AP-Cannabinoids product candidates for treatment of various pain indications, uses CBD or THC. These products are quite distinct from crude herbal “medical marijuana,” and we intend to seek FDA approval for these products in accordance with the customary FDA approval process and based on adequate and well-controlled clinical studies. However, the active ingredients in our products are defined as controlled substances under the federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA. Under the CSA, the Drug Enforcement Administration of the United States Department of Justice, or DEA, places each drug that has abuse potential into one of five categories. The five categories, referred to as Schedules I-V, carry different degrees of restriction. Each schedule is associated with a distinct set of controls that affect manufacturers, researchers, healthcare providers, and patients. The controls include registration with the DEA, labeling and packaging, production quotas, security, recordkeeping, and dispensing. Schedule I is the most restrictive, covering drugs that have “no accepted medical use” in the United States and that have high abuse potential.
 
21

 

If and when any of our product candidates receive FDA approval, the DEA will make a scheduling determination and place the product in a schedule other than Schedule I in order for it to be prescribed to patients in the United States. Accordingly, our ability to ultimately commercialize the product will depend in part on the ultimate scheduling classification determination by DEA for our product.
 
The FDA has stated that it will continue to facilitate the work of companies interested in bringing safe, effective, and quality products to market, including scientifically-based research concerning the medical uses of products derived from marijuana and the FDA has approved synthetic compositions of the active ingredients found in marijuana. However, the use and abuse of controlled substances is currently subject to political and social pressures from certain constituencies related to their usage which could result in additional difficulty with respect to the approval of AP-Cannabinoids as a prescription pharmaceutical. For example, the FDA or DEA may require us to generate more clinical data about the potential for abuse than that which is currently anticipated, which could increase the cost and/or delay the launch of our product. In addition, DEA scheduling may limit our ability to achieve market share in the United States due to restricted access and the disinclination of some physicians to prescribe more restrictive scheduled controlled substances. For example, Schedule II drugs may not be refilled without a new prescription. These factors may limit the commercial viability of AP-Cannabinoids in the United States.
 
Most countries are parties to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961, which governs international trade and domestic control of narcotic substances, including the compounds in our AP-Cannabinoids product candidates. Countries may interpret and implement their treaty obligations in a way that creates a legal obstacle to our obtaining approval to market our AP-Cannabinoids product candidates. Approval to market in these countries could require amendments or modifications to existing laws and regulations that such countries would be unwilling to undertake or may cause material delays in any marketing approval.
 
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 
In the United States, our current and future activities with investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, third-party payors, patient organizations and customers are subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. Applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:

● | The federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, any good, item, facility or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The federal Anti-Inducement Act which prohibits persons from offering remuneration to beneficiaries to induce them to use a particular item or service payable in whole or in part by Medicare or Medicaid.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Ethics in Patient Referrals Act of 1989, commonly referred to as the Stark Law, and its corresponding regulations, prohibit physicians from referring patients for designated health services (including outpatient drugs) reimbursed under the Medicare or Medicaid programs to entities with which the physicians or their family members have a financial relationship or an ownership interest, subject to narrow regulatory exceptions, and prohibits those entities from submitting claims to Medicare or Medicaid for payment of items or services provided to a referred beneficiary.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The federal False Claims Act imposes criminal and civil penalties, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, and some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A PPACA provision, generally referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act or Open Payments Program, imposes reporting requirements for applicable drug and device manufacturers of covered products with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, and certain investment/ownership interests held by physicians and their immediate family members in the reporting entity. These disclosures are publicly disclosed by the Centers for Medicare &Medicaid Services, or CMS.

Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations could be costly. Although we believe our business practices are structured to be compliant with applicable laws, it is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our past or present operations, including activities conducted by our sales team or agents, are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from third party payor programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, debarment, imprisonment, integrity obligations and other compliance oversight, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians, providers or entities with whom we do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusion from government funded healthcare programs.
 
Many aspects of these laws have not been definitively interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of subjective interpretations which increases the risk of potential violations. In addition, these laws and their interpretations are subject to change. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business, and damage our reputation.
 
In addition, from time to time in the future, we may become subject to additional laws or regulations administered by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, or by other federal, state, local or foreign regulatory authorities, to the repeal of laws or regulations that we generally consider favorable or to more stringent interpretations of current laws or regulations. We are not able to predict the nature of such future laws, regulations, repeals or interpretations, and we cannot predict what effect additional governmental regulation, if and when it occurs, would have on our business in the future. Such developments could, however, require reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, recalls or discontinuance of certain products not able to be reformulated, additional record-keeping requirements, increased documentation of the properties of certain products, additional or different labeling, additional scientific substantiation, additional personnel or other new requirements. Any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
The growth and demand for electronic commerce, or eCommerce, could result in more stringent consumer protection laws that impose additional compliance burdens on online retailers. These consumer protection laws could result in substantial compliance costs and could interfere with the conduct of our business.
 
There is currently great uncertainty in many states whether or how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes, and libel and personal privacy apply to the Internet and commercial online retailers. These issues may take years to resolve. For example, tax authorities in a number of states, as well as a Congressional advisory commission, are currently reviewing the appropriate tax treatment of companies engaged in online commerce and new state tax regulations may subject us to additional state sales and income taxes. New legislation or regulation, the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business, or a change in application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet and commercial online services could result in significant additional taxes on our business. These taxes could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property, and to operate without infringing or violating the proprietary rights of others. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright laws, know-how, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights (including confidentiality and invention assignment agreements) to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property, including related intellectual property rights.
Patents
 
As of December 31, 2018, we own or exclusively license six families of patents to use within our field of business (families IN-1, IN-3, IN-7, IN-8, IN-11 and IN-21). Four of the patent families (IN-1, IN-3, IN-7 and IN-11) have granted patents registered in various countries, as detailed below. One family (IN-8) has granted patents in force in the US, Japan and Israel, which we plan to allow to lapse by non-payment of future renewal fees. With the exception of the first family of patents (IN-1) three families (IN-3, IN-7 and IN-11) have active pending applications under examination. The sixth patent family (IN-21) currently comprises of recently filed pending applications in 21 jurisdictions, including the United States, European Patent Office, Israel, China, Japan, Russia, Australia, Canada, and other countries. Our patents and patent applications generally relate to gastroretentive drug delivery devices for oral intake, the integration of the drugs into our delivery devices and their production, and our patents and any patents that issue from our pending patent applications are expected to expire at various dates between 2020 and 2037. We also rely on trade secrets to protect certain aspects of our technology. The following discussion describes certain patents/patent applications which we consider to be our material patents and patent applications.
IN-1 and Yissum License Agreement
 
The patent family, IN-1, that we exclusively license from Yissum (i.e., Gastroretentive Controlled Release Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms) pursuant to the license agreement described below, or the License Agreement covers gastroretentive system/device for controlled release of an active ingredient in the GI tract. This patent does not cover the implementation of the accordion technology with respect to any particular drug or in a manner that is readily manufactured commercially, but it broadly covers folded gastroretentive forms, and forms the basis for the accordion technology in its most basic form. The system is intended mainly for drugs with NAW, drugs that act locally in the digestive system and drugs whose active receptors are in the upper part of the GI tract. The system is intended for clinical use in humans and in animals. The patent is issued in the United States, Israel, Japan, Australia, Canada, South Africa, the United Kingdom and six other European countries, and expires in 2020.
 
23

 

In the License Agreement, Yissum granted us an exclusive license for developing, manufacturing and marketing of products based, directly or indirectly, on the IN-1 patent, the know-how and research results defined therein. Under the provisions of the License Agreement, as amended, Yissum may not transfer its rights in the patent without our prior written consent. In consideration of the license, we have undertaken to pay Yissum royalties equaling 3% of the total net revenues from the sale of products based on Yissum’s patent and royalties equal to 15% of any payment or benefit whatsoever received by us from any sublicensee. At the current time we have not commenced sales and have not granted any sublicenses to any third parties. The parties to the License Agreement are entitled to terminate the agreement in case of bankruptcy or receivership of the other party, or a material breach (including in respect of any payment obligations) that is not cured within 30 days. The License Agreement will remain in effect until the later of the expiration date of the patent or 15 years from the first commercial sale on the basis of the license. We have the right to assign our rights in the License Agreement with the prior consent of Yissum, not to be unreasonably withheld, and we are entitled to grant sublicenses under the licensed intellectual property of Yissum to third parties in our sole discretion, and any sublicensee(s) thereunder will not be required to assume any undertaking towards Yissum.
 
IN-3
 
An additional patent family (i.e., Method and Apparatus for Forming Delivery Devices for Oral Intake of an Agent), which we refer to as IN-3, covers various methods for making and folding the gastroretentive drug delivery system, and for folding it in an accordion configuration allowing its integration into an ordinary oral capsule, which are suitable for commercial manufacturing in mass quantities. The IN-3 family patents, will expire in 2027, except for the first United States patent of this family, which will expire in 2028. We consider our proprietary process for folding and cutting the films forming the drug delivery system for integration in an accordion-like configuration into an ordinary oral capsule to be material to our business. We have four granted patents in the U.S. and an additional pending patent application in connection with IN-3, as well as granted patents in Israel (three patents), Europe (two granted patents validated in more than 15 countries and a pending divisional application), Canada and Japan. Importantly, the second IN-3 patents granted in the U.S. and in Europe cover a specific embodiment of the Accordion Pill, particularly suitable for insoluble or poorly soluble drugs. Similar divisional applications have been filed in other countries and patents for these have already been granted in Israel and Japan.
 
IN-7
 
An additional patent family (for “frameless” Accordion Pill, specifically but not limited to Levodopa as the active drug) that we consider material to our business is referred to as IN-7. The accordion technology covered by our other patents may sometimes need to be specifically adapted for a given drug that might benefit from prolonged gastroretentive release. Thus, the layered structure of an Accordion Pill may be varied and specially designed by reference to factors that are unique to any given drug and indication, such as the quantity of active ingredient desired to be released, the length of time over which the active drug is released, the relative solubility of a particular drug molecule, and other factors. IN-7 patents/patent applications relate to a special Accordion Pill, which is “frameless”, and is suitable for carrying various active drugs, including but not limited to Levodopa, optionally in combination with Carbidopa. The IN-7 patent family relates to the Accordion Pill dosage form, the main feature of which is the uniform inner drug-containing layer, which allows for, but does not require, high load of the drug, while maintaining the requisite structural or mechanical strength of the Accordion Pill. This patent family includes patents/patent applications filed in the United States, the European Patent Office, Japan and several other countries in April 2009. We have four granted U.S. patents for an Accordion Pill with specific claims to Carbidopa/Levodopa as the active ingredient(s) (IN-7), which will be in force until April 17, 2029, and have been granted IN-7 patents in China, Japan, Hong Kong, Canada, Europe, (validated in over 30 countries), Israel, South Africa and South Korea. Applications in Europe, Israel and China (divisional) and in India are pending.
 
An additional patent family, related to IN-7, which we refer to as IN-11, seeks protection for an Accordion Pill containing Levodopa that is specifically formulated for treatment of Parkinson’s disease in a specific treatment regimen. We have been granted two United States patents, and have pending applications in Canada, EPO, India and Israel. Any granted patent of IN-11 will expire in November 2031.
 
IN-21
 
This patent family is directed to Accordion Pill comprising cannabinoid/s as active drugs (including THC and CBD, separately or in combination) currently includes pending patent applications in 21 jurisdictions, including the US, EPO, Israel, China, Republic of Korea, Canada, India, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Russia, Brazil, Mexico and others. Patents to be granted on these applications will expire in 2037.

General
 
We intend to submit patent applications for each Accordion Pill and/or drug combination that we develop. The patent outlook for companies like ours is generally uncertain and may involve complex legal and factual questions. Our ability to maintain and consolidate our proprietary position for our technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We do not know whether any of our patent applications or any patent applications that we license will result in the issuance of any patents. Our issued patents and those that may be issued in the future, or patents that we exclusively license, may be challenged, narrowed, circumvented or found to be invalid or unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or the length of term of patent protection that we may have for our products. We cannot be certain that we were the first to invent the inventions claimed in our owned patents or patent applications, or that Yissum was the first to invent the invention claimed in the patent that we exclusively license from Yissum. In addition, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by us, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with any meaningful competitive advantages against these competitors. Furthermore, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our products can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent.
Trademarks
 
We rely on trade names, trademarks and service marks to protect our name brands. Our trademark/service mark ACCORDION PILL is registered in Israel in Classes 5, 40 and 42. We are in the process of registering the ACCORDION PILL trademark/ service mark in the United States, where the application has been recently published. The trademark/service mark ACCORDION PILL is also registered in the UK.
Trade Secrets and Confidential Information
 
In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We rely on, among other things, confidentiality and invention assignment agreements to protect our proprietary know-how and other intellectual property that may not be patentable, or that we believe is best protected by means that do not require public disclosure. For example, we require our employees to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment relationships with us, and to disclose and assign to us inventions conceived in connection with their services to us. However, there can be no assurance that these agreements will be enforceable or that they will provide us with adequate protection. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data, trade secrets and know-how by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
 
We may be unable to obtain, maintain and protect the intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business, and may be subject to claims that we infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others, which could materially harm our business. For a more comprehensive summary of the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 
Insurance
 
We maintain directors’ and officers’ liability insurance with maximum coverage of $40.0 million in the aggregate for the benefit of our office holders and directors. Such directors’ and officers’ liability insurance contains certain standard exclusions.
 
We also maintain insurance for our premises for a maximum of NIS 40.0 million, including coverage of equipment and lease improvements against risk of loss (fire, natural hazard and allied perils, excluding damage from theft - hereinafter “named perils”) and business interruption insurance coverage caused by named perils out of which up to NIS 44.0 million for fixed cost and up to NIS 120.0 million for expenses related to the ACCORDANCE study, our Phase III clinical trial for AP-CD/LD. In addition, we maintain the following insurance: employer liability with coverage of NIS 20.0 million; third-party liability with coverage of NIS 20.0 million; and all risk coverage for machinery breakdown of our casting machine of approximately NIS 5.0 million.
 
We also procure additional insurance for each specific clinical trial which covers a certain number of trial participants and which varies based on the particular clinical trial. Certain of such policies are based on the Declaration of Helsinki, which is a set of ethical principles regarding human experimentation developed for the medical community by the World Medical Association, and certain protocols of the Israeli Ministry of Health.
 
We believe our insurance policies are adequate and customary for a business of our kind. However, because of the nature of our business, we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain insurance on a commercially reasonable basis or at all, or that any future claims will not exceed our insurance coverage.
 
Research Grants
 
Grants under the Israeli Innovation Law
 
Under the Encouragement of Research, Development and Technological Innovation in the Industry Law 5744-1984 (formerly known as the Law for the Encouragement of Research and Development in Industry 5744-1984), and the regulations, guidelines, rules, procedures and benefit tracks thereunder, or the Innovation Law, research and development programs that meet specified criteria and are approved by a committee of the IIA are eligible for grants. The grants awarded are typically up to 50% of the project’s expenditures, as determined by the IIA committee and subject to the benefit track under which the grant was awarded. A company that receives a grant from the IIA, or a Participating Company, is typically required to pay royalties to the IIA on income generated from products incorporating know-how developed using such grants (including income derived from services associated with such products), until 100% of the U.S. dollars-linked grant plus annual LIBOR interest is repaid. The rate of royalties to be paid may vary between different benefits tracks, as shall be determined by the IIA. Under the regular benefits tracks the rate of royalties varies between 3% to 5% of the income generated from the IIA-supported products. The obligation to pay royalties is contingent on actual income generated from such products and services. In the absence of such income, no payment of such royalties is required.
 
25

 

The terms of the grants under the Innovation Law also (generally) require that the products developed as part of the programs under which the grants were given be manufactured in Israel and that the know-how developed thereunder may not be transferred outside of Israel, unless a prior written approval is received from the IIA (such approval is not required for the transfer of a portion of the manufacturing capacity which does not exceed, in the aggregate, 10% of the portion declared to be manufactured outside of Israel in the applications for funding, in which case only notification is required) and additional payments are required to be made to the IIA. It should be noted, that this does not restrict the export of products that incorporate the funded know-how. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Operations in Israel” for additional information.
 
The IIA approved our request to transfer 100% of the manufacturing rights of AP-CD/LD that was developed under one of the IIA funded programs to LTS. As a result, we will be required to pay the IIA royalties from revenue generated from the AP-CD/LD product candidate at an increased rate and up to an increased cap amount. The IIA noted that the approval granted was exceptional and that the IIA will not approve manufacturing additional product candidates out of Israel.
 
From January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2016, we received from IIA approximately NIS 50.2 million. However, in March 2018, we repaid a portion of the grant amounts received in 2016 in the amount of approximately NIS 8.1 million (approximately $2.3 million), including interest and linkage differences, following a review and assessment by the IIA on the 2016 program. For more information see note 6c in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018.
 
Environmental Matters
 
We are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing air emissions, water and wastewater discharges, noise emissions, the use, management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. In addition, all of our laboratory personnel participate in instruction on the proper handling of chemicals, including hazardous substances before commencing employment, and during the course of their employment with us. In addition, all information with respect to any chemical substance that we use is filed and stored as a Material Safety Data Sheet, as required by applicable environmental regulations. Based on information currently available to us, we do not expect environmental costs and contingencies to have a material adverse effect on us. The operation of our facilities, however, entails risks in these areas. Significant expenditures could be required in the future if we are required to comply with new or more stringent environmental or health and safety laws, regulations or requirements.
 
We hold a business license from the Jerusalem Municipality with respect to manufacturing pharmaceutical products at 12 Hartom Street, Har Hotzvim in Jerusalem. The license is currently valid until December 31, 2023. The business license was granted after an inspection of our raw materials inventory, which we are permitted to maintain in our facilities and warehouses located at 12 Hartom Street. We also hold a toxic substance permit from July 26, 2018, which is valid until July 30, 2021.
 
On December 15, 2015, following our discussions with the Ministry of Environmental Protection to relax certain restrictions included in our business license, including, among others, to remove certain conditions the compliance with which is not feasible in the premises in which our facility is located, our business license was updated with additional terms which match our current activity.
 
We believe that our business, operations and facilities are being operated in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 83 employees, 70 of whom are full-time employees, five of whom were employed in management, 10 of whom were employed in finance and administration, 48 of whom were employed in research and development and operations, nine of whom were employed in clinical trials and regulatory affairs and 11 of whom were employed in quality assurance. As of December 31, 2018, all of these employees are located in Israel or the United States, where our U.S. subsidiary employs five employees.
 
Israeli labor laws principally govern the length of the workday, minimum wages for employees, procedures for hiring and dismissing employees, determination of severance pay, annual leave, sick days, advance notice of termination of employment, equal opportunity and anti-discrimination laws and other conditions of employment. Subject to certain exceptions, Israeli law generally requires severance pay upon the retirement, death or dismissal of an employee, and requires us and our employees to make payments to the National Insurance Institute, which is similar to the U.S. Social Security Administration. Our employees have defined benefit pension plans that comply with applicable Israeli legal requirements, which also include the mandatory pension payments required by applicable law and allocations for severance pay.
 
26

 

While none of our employees are party to any collective bargaining agreements, certain provisions of the collective bargaining agreements between the Histadrut (General Federation of Labor in Israel) and the Coordination Bureau of Economic Organizations (including the Industrialists’ Associations) are applicable to our employees by extension orders issued by the Israel Ministry of Economy and Industry. These provisions primarily concern the length of the workweek, pension fund benefits for all employees and for employees in the industry section, insurance for work-related accidents, travel expenses reimbursement, holiday leave, convalescent payments and entitlement for vacation days. We generally provide our employees with benefits and working conditions beyond the required minimums. We have never experienced any employment-related work stoppages and believe our relationship with our employees is good.
