Divisions
Bisco Industries
Bisco sells a broad spectrum of products that it offers to many markets, but primarily sells to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). While historically, the substantial majority of Bisco’s revenues have been derived from the Bisco Industries division, Bisco has also established additional divisions that specialize in specific industries and products. Bisco believes that the focus by industry and/or product enhances Bisco’s ability to provide superior service and devise tailored solutions for its customers.
National-Precision
The National-Precision division primarily sells electronic hardware and commercial fasteners to OEMs in the aerospace, fabrication and industrial equipment industries. National-Precision seeks to be the leading global distributor of mil-spec and commercial fasteners, hardware and distribution services used in production.
Fast-Cor
The Fast-Cor division was established to be a distributor’s source for a broad range of components and fasteners. Fast-Cor has access to the entire inventory of products that Bisco offers but primarily focuses on selling to other distributors, not manufacturers.

Customers and Sales
Bisco’s customers operate in a wide variety of industries and range from large global companies to small local businesses. Bisco strives to provide exceptional service to all customers, including smaller businesses, and continues to focus on growing its share of that market. As of August 31, 2022, Bisco had more than 10,000 customers; however, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of Bisco’s revenues for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022. For each of the fiscal years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021 (“fiscal 2022” and “fiscal 2021,” respectively), Bisco’s top 20 customers represented in the aggregate approximately 12% of Bisco’s revenues. 
Bisco generally sells its products through its sales representatives in its 51 sales offices located in the United States and Canada and 1 additional sales office in the Philippines. Customers can also place orders through Bisco’s website. Bisco currently maintains seven distribution centers located in Anaheim and San Jose, California; Dallas, Texas; Chicago, Illinois; Boston, Massachusetts; Atlanta, Georgia; and Toronto, Canada. Each of Bisco’s selling facilities and distribution centers are linked to Bisco’s central computer system, which provides Bisco’s management and salespersons with online, real-time data regarding inventory levels throughout Bisco and facilitates control of purchasing, shipping and billing. Bisco generally ships products to customers from one of its seven distribution centers, based on the geographic proximity to the customer and the location of the available ordered products. 
Bisco sells its products primarily in the United States, Canada, and countries within Asia. Bisco’s international sales represented 11.8% and 10.6% of its sales in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively. Sales to customers in Canada accounted for approximately 27% and 30% of such international sales in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively. Sales to customers located within Asia accounted for approximately 48% of such international sales in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021. Sales to customers in other countries make up 25% and 22% of such international sales in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively
Suppliers
As of August 31, 2022, Bisco offered products from over 260 manufacturers. The Company’s authorized distributor agreements with most manufacturers are typically cancelable by either party at any time or on short notice. While Bisco doesn’t manufacture its products, it does perform kitting and packaging of existing products for certain of its customers. Although Bisco sells more products of certain brands, Bisco believes that most of the products it sells are available from other sources at competitive prices. No single supplier accounted for more than 10% of Bisco’s purchases in fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2021.
Human Capital Resources
As of August 31, 2022, the Company had 506 full-time employees, which include 313 sales and marketing employees, 82 management, administrative and finance employees, 64 warehouse and fulfillment personnel and 47 supply chain management employees. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. 
A key element of our business strategy is to expand our operations and revenues by opening additional sales offices in new geographic locations, and we plan to add additional sales personnel to support such new offices. During fiscal 2022, the Company opened 2 new sales office locations. The Company believes it has been successful in attracting and retaining qualified sales personnel for these new positions. We continue to focus on employee development and training, and embrace diversity and inclusion. We believe an innovative workforce needs to be diverse and leverage the skills and perspectives of a wealth of backgrounds and experiences.
Compliance with Government Regulations
We are not aware of the need for any government approvals for our products. Because we use contract manufacturers, any laws regarding the manufacturing of the products we distribute will typically be the responsibility of our contract manufacturers. Prior to entering into any contracts with new manufacturers, we typically conduct diligence to determine that the manufacturer has satisfied all such requirements. We do not believe that we are subject to any state or federal environmental laws.
