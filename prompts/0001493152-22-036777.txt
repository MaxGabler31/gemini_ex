Generally, the video game hardware platforms are divided into mobile gaming on smartphones, PC/laptop gaming and consoles. It is estimated that in 2018, mobile gaming generated approximately $63.2 billion in revenues whereas the PC/laptop market generated approximately $33.5 billion in revenues and console gaming generated approximately $38 billion in revenues. Virtual reality games (“VR”) is still in its relative infancy and mostly in the PC/laptop and console venues but is expected to grow substantially as hardware continues to improve, becomes more affordable and becomes more prolific among mobile gamers. In addition, VR content is still in its relative infancy, which could provide an opportunity for content providers in the coming years.
 
Mobile gaming has seen the largest growth over the other hardware platforms, largely driven by affordability of the devices and availability of content. The largest growing trend within the mobile gaming market has been the free-to-play model whereby monetization comes from in-game purchases. Mobile gaming has its largest footprint in Southeast Asia where mobile devices have seen substantial proliferation over the last decade, whereas console gaming has its largest footprints in North America and Europe where disposable income is higher than other regions of the world.
 
Competition
 
The video game industry is extremely competitive globally with competitors ranging from small independent developers with limited resources to very large development companies with significant financial, technical and marketing resources, such as Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc., Activision Blizzard, Inc., Electronic Arts, Inc. and Ubisoft Entertainment, S.A.
 
In addition, while the industry is experiencing significant growth, it also continues to evolve and create new markets, which could lead to additional competition in the future.
