ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Organization
GreenSky, Inc. (or the "Company," "we," "us" or "our") was formed as a Delaware corporation on July 12, 2017. The Company was formed for the purpose of completing an initial public offering ("IPO") of its Class A common stock and certain Reorganization Transactions in order to carry on the business of GreenSky Holdings, LLC (“GS Holdings”) and its consolidated subsidiaries. GS Holdings, a holding company with no operating assets or operations, was organized in August 2017. On August 24, 2017, GS Holdings acquired a controlling interest in GreenSky, LLC ("GSLLC"), a Georgia limited liability company, which is an operating entity. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 for a detailed discussion of the Reorganization Transactions, as defined in that footnote, and the IPO.
Business Overview
We are a leading U.S.-based technology company Powering Commerce at the Point of SaleSM. Our platform facilitates merchant sales, while reducing the friction and improving the economics associated with a consumer making a purchase and a bank extending financing for that purchase. As of December 31, 2018, we had 14,907 active merchants on our platform, defined as home improvement merchants and healthcare providers that have submitted at least one consumer application during the 12 months ended at the date of measurement. From our inception through December 31, 2018, merchants have used our platform to enable approximately 2.2 million consumers to finance approximately $16.3 billion of transactions with "Bank Partners," defined as federally insured banks that originate loans under the GreenSky program and any other lenders with respect to those loans.
We have developed and have been advancing and refining our proprietary, purpose-built platform to provide significant benefits to our growing ecosystem of merchants, consumers and Bank Partners:

• | Merchants. Merchants using our platform, which presently range from small, owner-operated home improvement contractors and healthcare providers to large national home improvement brands and retailers, rely on us to facilitate low or deferred interest promotional point-of-sale financing and payments solutions that enable higher sales volume. Our platform is designed to provide a seamless experience for our merchants with a mobile-native design that is intuitive and easy to use. Our technology integrates effortlessly with merchants’ existing payments systems, while also allowing merchants to access funds faster.


• | Consumers. Consumers on our platform, who to date primarily have super-prime or prime credit scores, find financing with promotional terms to be an attractive alternative to paying with cash, check, credit card, or general purpose revolving credit, particularly in the case of larger purchases. We provide a completely paperless, mobile-enabled experience that typically permits a consumer to apply and be approved for financing in less than 60 seconds at the point of sale.


• | Bank Partners. We provide our Bank Partners with access to our proprietary technology solution and merchant network, enabling them to build a diversified portfolio of high-quality consumer loans with attractive risk-adjusted yields. Our platform delivers significant loan volume, while requiring minimal upfront investment by our Bank Partners. Furthermore, our program is designed to adhere to the regulatory and compliance standards of our Bank Partners, which has helped us to gain their confidence, allowing them to outsource both loan facilitation and servicing functions to us.

Our platform is powered by a proprietary technology infrastructure that delivers stability, speed, scalability and security. It supports the full transaction lifecycle, including credit application, underwriting, real-time loan allocation to our Bank Partners, document distribution, funding, settlement and servicing, and it can be expanded to additional industry verticals as we scale our business. We have cultivated strong relationships with channel partners (which we refer to as "Sponsors") to amplify the reach of our technology, enabling us to efficiently and cost-effectively onboard large numbers of potential merchants underlying each Sponsor. We offer merchants a platform that they can adopt without friction—including no upfront fees, capital expenditure or onerous systems integration. When our merchants offer our solution at the point of sale, they provide our Bank Partners with cost-effective

access to a vast number of consumers. This ecosystem of merchants, consumers and Bank Partners allows us to generate recurring revenues with minimal customer acquisition and marketing costs, resulting in attractive unit economics and strong margins.
We have a strong recurring revenue model built upon repeat and growing usage by merchants. We derive most of our revenue and profitability from upfront transaction fees that merchants pay us every time they facilitate a transaction using our platform. Thus, our profitability is strongly correlated with merchant transaction volume. The transaction fee rate depends on the terms of financing selected by a consumer. In addition, we collect servicing fees on the loan portfolios we service for our Bank Partners.
Seasonality. Our operating results can vary from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonality in consumer spending and payment patterns. Given that our home improvement vertical is a significant contributor to our overall revenue, our revenue growth generally is higher during the second and third quarters of the year as the weather improves, the residential real estate market becomes more active and consumers begin home improvement projects. During these periods, we tend to experience increased loan applications and, in turn, transaction volume. Conversely, our revenue growth generally slows during the first and fourth quarters of the year, as consumer spending on home improvement projects tends to slow leading up to the holiday season and through the winter months. As a result, growth in loan applications and transaction volume also tends to slow during these periods. Unlike the home improvement vertical, the elective healthcare vertical is less susceptible to quarter to quarter seasonality, as the volume of elective healthcare procedures tends to remain relatively constant throughout the year. Therefore, our seasonality trends may vary in the future as we introduce our program to new industry verticals and become less concentrated in the home improvement industry. 
The origination related and finance charge reversal components of our cost of revenue also are subject to these same seasonal factors, while the servicing related component of cost of revenue, in particular customer service staffing, printing and posting costs, is not as closely correlated to seasonal volume patterns. As transaction volume increases, the transaction volume related personnel costs, as well as costs related to credit and identity verification, among other activities, increase as well. Further, finance charge reversals are positively correlated to transaction volume in the same period of the prior year. As prepayments on deferred interest loans, which trigger finance charge reversals, typically are highest towards the end of the promotional period, and promotional periods are most commonly 12, 18 or 24 months, finance charge reversal settlements follow a similar seasonal pattern as transaction volumes over the course of a calendar year. 
Lastly, we have observed seasonal patterns in consumer credit, which results in lower charge-offs during the second and third quarters of the year. Credit improvement during these periods has a positive impact on the incentive payments we receive from our Bank Partners. Conversely, during the first and fourth quarters of the year, when credit performance is comparably lower, our incentive payment receipts are negatively impacted, which in turn has a negative impact on our cost of revenue.
Our Ecosystem
We have built an entrenched ecosystem of merchants, consumers and Bank Partners. Our platform enables each of these constituents to benefit from enhanced access to each other and to our technology, resulting in a virtuous cycle of increasing engagement and value creation. We believe our ecosystem grows stronger with scale.
Value Proposition to Merchants

• | Increased sales volume. Promotional payment plans and financing solutions make it easier for merchants to sell more goods and services. We have observed that our customizable solution helps merchants increase ticket size and conversion of sales.


• | Seamless integration. We design our solution to deliver instant value, enabling our merchants’ sales associates to use their existing mobile devices to facilitate loans through our platform. We settle payments through a national credit card payment network or through the Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) network, meaning merchants that already accept these types of payments require no systems integration to adopt our platform. This frictionless onboarding makes consumer point-of-sale financing available for merchants of all sizes.

• | Accelerated funding. Our merchants typically receive a sizeable portion of their funding faster than they would if they were paid in installments in a more traditional 30-day billing cycle.


• | Superior customer service. We work creatively and collaboratively to design promotional financing offers that fulfill the needs of our merchants while continuing to improve our solution to appeal to their customers.

Value Proposition to Consumers

• | Superior experience. Because we are able to process an application and approve financing at the point of sale with limited burden on the consumer, our platform enables consumers to “apply and buy” in most cases in less than a minute, utilizing an intuitive mobile interface and paperless loan agreement.


• | Promotional interest rates and terms. The majority of the loans facilitated by our platform carry promotional financing with deferred interest or low-rate terms, an attractive alternative relative to the rates on credit card balances.


• | Enables larger purchases. By allowing merchants to market to their customers by focusing on the monthly cost of their purchases rather than the one-time upfront cash outlays, consumers are able to better budget for larger purchases.


• | Preserves revolving credit availability. Rather than utilizing revolving credit for large purchases, which results in available credit lines being reduced, the loans we facilitate preserve credit card availability for everyday purchases.

Value Proposition to Banks

• | Consumer credit exposure at attractive risk-adjusted yields. We believe loans originated on our platform offer strong net interest margin, credit performance and duration characteristics relative to banks’ other unsecured consumer lending opportunities.


• | Nationally-diversified, small-balance loans. While many of our Bank Partners may traditionally focus on lending opportunities within their geographic footprints, our platform enables them to originate loans in all 50 states and at an average loan size of less than $10,000 as of December 31, 2018, thus creating an efficient mechanism to aggregate a granular, diversified national portfolio.


• | Access to our proprietary technology and merchant network. Over the past decade, we have built and refined our technology platform to deliver significant value to merchants and consumers. We also have cultivated strong relationships with Sponsors and merchants. We believe our Bank Partners would require significant time and investment to build such a technology solution and merchants network themselves.


• | No customer acquisition cost and limited operating expenses. Our platform alleviates the need for our Bank Partners to bear any marketing, software development or technology infrastructure costs to originate loans.


• | Robust compliance framework. We continually refine and upgrade our platform, risk management and servicing capabilities to meet the compliance, documentation and vendor management requirements of our Bank Partners and their regulators.

Our Platform
We believe our platform, powered by proprietary, patent-pending technology, has attributes that create meaningful barriers to entry for other providers attempting to reach the same scale with merchants, consumers and banks. These attributes include:

• | Intuitive user interface. We have designed our digital platform to be simple and easy to use.


• | Paperless application and documentation environment. Our platform auto-populates applications using a mobile device’s location data and a scan of the consumer’s driver license, eliminating unnecessary effort. Once the transaction is approved, a digital loan agreement is delivered in real time, generally back to the same mobile device. The consumer accepts the terms of the agreement electronically, eliminating the need for a physical signature.

• | Capacity to support a wide range of promotional financing solutions. Our technology enables merchants of all sizes and their sales associates to select among several promotional financing solutions based on customer preferences.


• | Significant flexibility and processing capabilities. Our technology stack includes an “Application Tier” (multiple user-facing applications) and a dynamic “Database Tier” (real time algorithmic underwriting and processing functionality, data archiving, lookup and reporting). Together, this results in a comprehensive technology solution that supports the full transaction lifecycle: credit application, loan underwriting, real-time bank loan allocation, borrower loan document distribution, bank loan funding and settlement and all borrower servicing functions.


• | Real time credit decisions and placement with a Bank Partner. We have developed an algorithm that underwrites potential loans against the specified credit criteria of each of our Bank Partners. Once loan applications are underwritten and matched against the Bank Partners’ credit criteria, a proprietary digital “round-robin” system allocates each unique approved loan to a Bank Partner.


• | Automated regulatory compliance. During the underwriting process, our systems instantly check applicants against national databases designed to identify potential money laundering and other “red flags.”


• | Integration into payments network. We settle and fund transactions on a national credit card network or via the ACH system, allowing merchants to adopt our digital platform without any capital expenditure or back-end payment systems integration.


• | System of record and loan servicing. Our technology maintains the system of record for the portfolio of each of our Bank Partners, whereby details of all loans initiated, funded and serviced are maintained in a secure, online, user-accessible environment.


• | Scalable digital platform. Because each feature of our platform is digitally-enabled, we can efficiently adapt to the changing preferences of our constituents and achieve greater scale.

2018 Developments
Specific key developments and results from 2018 include: 

– | We added two new Bank Partners. Combined with increases in funding commitments by existing Bank Partners, our aggregate commitments as of December 31, 2018 were $11.8 billion, an increase of $3.8 billion since December 31, 2017;


– | We maintained an attractive consumer profile. For all loans originated on our platform during 2018, the credit-line weighted average consumer credit score was 768. Furthermore, consumers with credit scores over 780 comprised 33% of the Loan Servicing Portfolio as of December 31, 2018 and over 85% of the Loan Servicing Portfolio as of December 31, 2018 consisted of consumers with credit scores over 700;


– | We achieved significant growth over 2017 in each of our key business metrics of active merchants (37%), transaction volume (34%), loan servicing portfolio (36%) and cumulative consumer accounts (43%);


– | We entered into a multi-faceted collaboration with American Express consisting of: (i) a strategic alliance whereby American Express will enable eligible United States merchants that accept American Express and the customers they serve to access the Company’s proprietary point-of-sale financing solutions, (ii) a pilot program (initially within the home improvement category) for direct to consumer loans for eligible American Express consumer Card Members to search for participating merchants within GreenSky's network, and to finance their purchases at participating American Express accepting merchants of their choosing within or outside of GreenSky's merchant network, and (iii) access to American Express vPayment, a virtual payments solution, in order to facilitate purchases via virtual account numbers delivered to approved customers; and


– | Our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $150 million of the Company's Class A common stock. Subsequently, we repurchased 4.7 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $43.9 million during 2018.

Competition
The consumer credit and payments market is highly fragmented and competitive. We face competition from a diverse landscape of consumer lenders, including traditional banks, credit unions and credit card issuers, as well as alternative technology-enabled lenders. Many of our credit and payment competitors are (or are affiliated with) financial institutions with the capacity to hold loans on their balance sheets, increasing the potential profitability of individual consumer relationships. Some of these competitors offer a broader suite of products and services than we do, including retail banking solutions, credit and debit cards and loyalty programs. 
We compete for merchants based on a number of key product features, including price, duration, simplicity of loan terms, promotional terms, ease of applying, merchant fees, user experience and time-to-funding. Our existing core unsecured term loan products face competition primarily from home equity lines of credit and general purpose revolving credit cards. Consumers can access these alternatives through a range of traditional and technology-enabled sources. In the future, we may confront increased competition from existing competitors, as many traditional, large-scale consumer lenders are investing in technology to streamline loan application and funding processes. We also expect to face additional competition from current competitors or others who embrace new technologies to significantly change the consumer credit and payment industry.
Significant Customers
Our top ten merchants (including certain groups of affiliated merchants) accounted for an aggregate of 27% of our total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018. The Home Depot is our most significant single merchant and represented approximately 5% of total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, affiliates of Renewal by Andersen, our largest Sponsor, represented together approximately 19% of total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018. We expect to have significant concentration in our largest merchant relationships for the foreseeable future. In the event that (i) The Home Depot or one or more of our other significant merchants, or groups of merchants, or (ii) Renewal by Andersen or one or more of our other significant Sponsors, and their dealers, terminate their relationships with us, or elect to utilize an alternative source for financing, the number of loans originated through the GreenSky program likely would decline, which would materially adversely affect our business and, in turn, our revenue.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, GreenSky had 1,088 full-time employees, with substantially all located in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia and Crescent Hills, Kentucky. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we believe we have positive relationships with our employees.
