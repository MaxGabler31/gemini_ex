ITEM 1.BUSINESS
Overview
Glaukos is an ophthalmic medical technology and pharmaceutical company focused on developing novel therapies for the treatment of glaucoma, corneal disorders, and retinal disease. We first developed Micro-Invasive Glaucoma Surgery (MIGS) as an alternative to the traditional glaucoma treatment paradigm, launching our first MIGS device commercially in 2012, and have since developed a portfolio of technologically distinct and leverageable platforms to support ongoing pharmaceutical and medical device innovations. Products or product candidates for each of these platforms are designed to advance the standard of care through better treatment options across the areas of glaucoma, corneal disorders such as keratoconus, dry eye and refractive vision correction, and retinal diseases such as neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic macular edema (DME), and retinal vein occlusion (RVO). 
Ophthalmic diseases and disorders are a national and global health concern and, as the population ages, the number of individuals with vision impairment and blindness is increasing. Moreover, improving access to cost-effective tools is increasing the diagnosis of sight-threatening ocular diseases globally and driving demand for innovative products, technologies, and therapies that improve clinical outcomes, and provide ease of use and reliability. In response to the significant unmet needs that exist within ophthalmology we have designed commercial and development-stage solutions to provide ophthalmologists with various treatment options.
Our commercial solutions and development-stage product candidates include: 
•MIGS products that primarily involve the insertion of a micro-scale device or drug delivery system designed to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) by restoring the natural aqueous humor outflow pathways for patients suffering from glaucoma and MIGS biosensors to measure pressure within the eye; 
•bio-activated pharmaceuticals that are intended to strengthen, stabilize, and reshape the cornea for patients impacted by corneal ectatic disorders such as keratoconus or refractive disorders; 
•transdermal pharmaceuticals that are applied to the eyelid and designed to treat dry eye, presbyopia, glaucoma and other ocular surface diseases and disorders; and
•proprietary micro-invasive, bio-erodible sustained release drug delivery implants that are designed to elute pharmaceuticals over time to improve the vision of patients impacted by retinal diseases such as AMD, DME, and RVO;

Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic and Current Economic Environment
While the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent economic slowdown materially impacted the global demand for our products starting March 2020, we began to see an early recovery toward more normalized levels for cataract and keratoconus procedures as early as May 2020, a trend that generally continued, with periodic volatility in certain geographies in which we operate, through December 31, 2021. Most recently the Omicron variant has led to a material increase in diagnosed cases worldwide, creating new government restrictions in select geographies and impacting elective procedures in hospital and ambulatory surgery center sites. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread staffing shortages, including in ambulatory surgery centers, which may also impact elective procedures. These trends accelerated at the end of December 2021 and continued through the date herein. 
We continue to actively assess the impact of COVID-19 on our clinical trials and other pipeline products. The closure of ophthalmic practices and deferral of elective procedures beginning in the first quarter of 2020 in response to COVID-19 disrupted new patient enrollment in our ongoing clinical trials. While we cannot predict the full impact of 

1



COVID-19 on the timing of completion of our clinical trials and the expected regulatory approvals for our pipeline products, our disclosed targeted approval dates anticipate, to our best estimate, such impact. 
Additionally, some of our vendors are continuing to experience supply challenges, both in the acquisition of raw materials as well as due to limited headcount resources, and we have experienced higher costs for certain raw materials. These challenges have led to delays and partial or unfulfilled deliveries of certain components needed for the manufacture of our products, in some cases requiring us to find second sources for materials. If these delays and partial or unfulfilled deliveries persist, they could impact our ability to ship some of our products to our customers, or bring some of our pipeline products to market, in a timely manner. We believe that much of these supply challenges and higher costs stem from the ongoing obstacles presented by COVID-19.
The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations going forward is unknown and will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 outbreak, the status of health and safety actions taken to contain its spread, the severity and transmission rates of new variants of COVID-19 such as the Omicron strain, the availability, distribution, and efficacy of vaccines for COVID-19, any additional preventative and protective actions that governments, or we, may take, any future surges of COVID-19 that may occur, the dynamics associated with the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccines, and how quickly and to what extent economic and operating conditions normalize within the markets in which we operate. For additional information, see the section titled Risks Related to Our Business within Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Recent Developments
2022 U.S. reimbursement rates
On November 2, 2021, the United States (U.S.) Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) published its final rules for 2022 Medicare physician fee payment rates and 2022 Medicare facility fee payment rates for services furnished in both the ambulatory surgery center and hospital outpatient settings (Final Rules). These Final Rules superseded the proposed rates that were issued by CMS in July 2021 which were much lower than the rates issued in the Final Rules. Compared to the 2021 reimbursement rates, the Final Rules contained a new, significantly lower physician fee related to the implantation of trabecular bypass stents, such as our iStent family of products, in conjunction with cataract surgery. Conversely, the facility fee schedule related to surgeries that include implantation of trabecular bypass stents, such as our iStent family of products, in conjunction with cataract surgery, slightly decreases reimbursements to an ambulatory surgery center and increases reimbursements to a hospital. We estimate that approximately 80% of procedures utilizing our trabecular micro-bypass technologies in the U.S. are performed in the ambulatory surgery center setting and the remaining estimated 20% of procedures are performed in the hospital. Additionally, the Final Rules established facility fee payment rates that were lower than anticipated for standalone insertion of an aqueous drainage device in the ambulatory surgery center and hospital settings, which would be the procedure that such facilities would use with our iStent infinite product, which is not yet approved by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration. These CMS reimbursement rates contained in the Final Rules took effect January 1, 2022. 
U.S. Glaucoma volumes were negatively impacted during our third and fourth quarter of 2021 as typical customer ordering patterns were disrupted and trialing of competitive products increased in anticipation of the potential 2022 CMS physician and facility fee reimbursement rate decreases becoming effective as originally proposed in July 2021. The physician fee reimbursement rate as issued in the Final Rules may have an adverse impact on 2022 procedural iStent family product volumes, in conjunction with cataract surgery as well as on our 2022 U.S. combo-cataract Glaucoma revenues, gross profit, and net income, the full extent of which is not known at this time. 
Attillaps License Agreement
On September 20, 2021, we announced that we had entered into a licensing agreement (Attillaps License Agreement) with Attillaps Holdings, Inc. (Attillaps) under which Attillaps granted us a global exclusive license to Attillaps’ proprietary library of investigational pharmaceutical compounds that target the eradication of Demodex mites, which are the root cause of Demodex blepharitis and often associated with meibomian gland dysfunction and related ophthalmic diseases. Under the Attillaps Licensing Agreement, we have the exclusive global right to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize products using certain acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of ophthalmic 

2



diseases caused by Demodex mites. We paid $5.0 million upon the signing of the Attillaps License Agreement and will have ongoing milestone and royalty payment obligations depending on the success of the development, approval and commercialization of the compounds. 
Settlement of Patent Litigation
On September 14, 2021, we entered into a settlement agreement (Settlement Agreement) with Ivantis, Inc. (Ivantis), pursuant to which we and Ivantis agreed to terminate the patent infringement lawsuit we had filed against Ivantis on April 14, 2018 in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Southern Division (the Lawsuit). In the Lawsuit, we alleged that Ivantis’ Hydrus® Microstent device infringes our U.S. Patent Nos. 6,626,858 and 9,827,143. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Ivantis has made cash payments totaling $60.0 million, $30.0 million of which was paid to us during the year ended December 31, 2021, and $30.0 million of which was paid to us in January 2022. 
Additionally, Ivantis will make quarterly royalty payments to us in the amount of 10% of Ivantis’ Hydrus Microstent U.S. sales and any international sales supplied out of the U.S. beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021 through April 26, 2025, subject to a per-unit minimum payment. We and Ivantis have dismissed with prejudice all of our claims against each other in the Lawsuit, which was scheduled for trial beginning on or around September 28, 2021, and in related lawsuits in other forums and jurisdictions. The parties also have agreed to mutual licenses and covenants not to sue the other party for patent infringement relating to Ivantis’ Hydrus Microstent or our micro-stent devices.
Santen License Agreement
On May 18, 2021, we announced that we entered into a new development and commercialization license agreement with Santen Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Santen) for the PreserFlo MicroShunt, superseding the previous collaboration and distribution agreements between the two parties. Under the new agreement, we obtain exclusive commercialization rights for the MicroShunt in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Brazil, Mexico and the remainder of Latin America. The new agreement also provides us with control over development activities for the MicroShunt in these same territories, including clinical development and regulatory affairs activities in the United States following a transition period. We did not make any payment in connection with the execution of the license agreement; however, should we be successful in obtaining regulatory approval for the PreserFlo MicroShunt, we would be required to pay Santen a milestone payment, followed by royalties and other potential future milestones depending on the success of the commercialization of the product.
Intratus License Amendment
On April 14, 2021, we announced that we had entered into an amended licensing agreement with Intratus, Inc. (Intratus) under which Intratus granted us a global exclusive license to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize Intratus’ patented, non-invasive drug delivery platform for application in the treatment of presbyopia. The addition of presbyopia expands upon the existing agreement between us and Intratus announced on July 22, 2019. The amendment includes a mechanism to further expand the existing agreement to other indications, applying the active pharmaceutical ingredients being advanced by us in glaucoma, corneal disorders and presbyopia to new ophthalmic fields.
Products and Pipeline
We operate in one operating segment and our primary business activity is the development and commercialization of therapies across several end markets within ophthalmology. In an effort to provide greater visibility into our business, the following discussion is presented based on our three principal end markets within ophthalmology: glaucoma, corneal disorders and retinal diseases.
Glaucoma
Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases characterized by progressive, irreversible and largely asymptomatic vision loss in which elevated levels of IOP are often associated with optic nerve damage that can cause blindness. While some glaucoma patients do not experience an increase in IOP, it is widely considered a major risk factor in glaucoma’s progression, and reduction in IOP is the only clinically proven treatment for the disease. Elevated IOP occurs when aqueous humor is not circulating normally or properly draining from the front part of the eye. 

3



We have three primary commercialized products designed to treat mild-to-moderate open-angle glaucoma: the iStent, the iStent inject, and the iStent inject W. The iStent, the iStent inject, and the iStent inject W are FDA-approved micro-bypass stents that improve aqueous humor outflow and are inserted through the small corneal incision made during cataract surgery. Our iStent, a single stent device which reduces IOP by restoring the natural physiologic pathways for aqueous humor, was the first commercially available MIGS treatment solution. Our next generation iStent inject and iStent inject W devices include two stents pre-loaded in an auto-injection system designed to allow the surgeon to inject stents through a single corneal entry. The iStent, iStent inject, and iStent inject W procedures are currently reimbursed in the U.S. by Medicare and all major national private payors. The iStent technologies are commercially available in numerous countries, including Australia, Brazil, Canada and Japan and certain European Union (EU) and other countries, even though reimbursement may not always be available for all such procedures. 
We are also developing several pipeline products for glaucoma, including the iStent infinite and iDose TR, neither of which have yet been approved for commercialization. The iStent infinite consists of three stents that are designed for use as a standalone procedure in glaucoma patients. In 2021, we submitted our 510(k) clearance application for the iStent infinite for the treatment of glaucoma patients who have failed prior surgical therapy and estimate that we will receive clearance in the first half of 2022.
​
The iDose drug delivery system is a targeted injectable implant based on our micro-scale device-platform that is designed to continuously deliver therapeutic levels of medication from within the eye for extended periods of time. We completed patient enrollment and randomization in our Phase 3 clinical trials in 2021 for iDose TR and now anticipate submitting a new drug application (NDA) in 2022 with potential FDA approval of this product in 2023. Additionally, our glaucoma pipeline includes the next-generation extended release iDose (TREX); iDose (ROCK) which would include proprietary Rho Kinase inhibitor compounds from a research and development collaboration agreement with D. Western Therapeutics Institute; programs for our iLution platform; and the IOP Sensor which are still in a research and development (R&D) stage.
​
In addition to our organic R&D efforts, we have licensed from Santen the PreserFlo MicroShunt. The MicroShunt is an ab-externo device being developed for treatment of glaucoma where IOP is uncontrolled with maximum tolerated medical therapy or where progression of the disease warrants surgery. Santen submitted a PMA application to the FDA in June 2020, and the FDA currently is reviewing additional input obtained from glaucoma surgeons to ensure a complete evaluation of the clinical data submitted in the PMA, and as such the timing of a potential approval, and U.S. commercial launch is currently unknown. We did commence initial commercial launch activity in Australia and Canada during the fourth quarter of 2021.
Corneal Disorders
The cornea, the eye’s outermost layer, is a clear, dome-shaped surface that functions best as a lens when the cornea is strong and shaped properly. The cornea is responsible for the majority of the eye’s total focusing power and corneal disorders, including ectasia, refractive vision errors and dry eye, among others, can cause vision impairment. Corneal ectatic disorders are comprised of a class of diseases characterized by an ectatic, or misshaped, cornea. Corneal ectasia is typically caused by a weakening of the cornea, which can be due to a number of factors, including genetic causes, adverse side effects from ophthalmic refractive procedures such as LASIK, or excessive eye rubbing. We are currently targeting corneal disorders with our bio-activated pharmaceuticals including keratoconus, and corneal ectasia following refractive surgery. Keratoconus is mostly a hereditary, degenerative ectatic disease that is often first seen in older children or young adults in which the typically round, dome-shaped cornea progressively thins and weakens, causing a cone-like corneal bulge due to normal internal pressure of the eye. Corneal ectasia following refractive surgery is a serious complication that involves the cornea becoming weakened following a refractive procedure, such as LASIK, with symptoms similar to naturally occurring keratoconus. Refractive vision errors, or the inability of the cornea to properly focus light, are prevalent in the U.S. and abroad and include disorders such as presbyopia and myopia. Presbyopia is a natural part of aging due to the hardening of the eye’s crystalline lens over time, resulting in a loss of lens elasticity or the ability of the lens to change shape in order to focus incoming light on the retina. Myopia, or nearsightedness, is a vision condition in which close objects are seen clearly, but objects farther away appear blurred, and is usually caused by an elongation of the eyeball or a cornea having too much curvature. Presbyopia affects nearly everyone over the age of 40 while myopia first occurs in school-age children and typically progresses until about age 20.

Our pharmaceutical iLink platform uses a suite of novel single-use drug formulations that are bio-activated by our proprietary systems to address these corneal diseases. The iLink therapies, bioactivated upon the delivery of ultraviolet A (UVA) light to the cornea, induce a biochemical reaction called corneal collagen cross-linking, or corneal cross-linking (CXL). CXL strengthens, stabilizes and reshapes the cornea to treat corneal ectatic disorders. Our KXL System, which delivers UVA light to a large portion of the cornea, and Photrexa therapy, is approved by the FDA for use in the U.S. following removal of the epithelium (often referred to as “iLink epi-off”), a procedure familiar to ophthalmologists. In May 2019, patient enrollment in a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial was completed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our next generation pharmaceutical iLink therapeutic system for the treatment of keratoconus without the removal of the epithelium (often referred to as “iLink epi-on”). We expect a U.S. NDA submission during 2022 and potential approval of the iLink epi-on product in 2023. We also expect to advance a third generation iLink therapeutic system into clinical trials during 2022. Internationally, our pharmaceutical therapies can also be administered with the KXL System to address corneal weakening caused by refractive surgery such as LASIK. Our bio-activated pharmaceutical products may also offer a means of improving the vision of patients with presbyopia, myopia or other corneal diseases. 
​
We have also developed our iLution platform of cream-based drug formulations that are applied to the outer surface of the eyelid for dropless transdermal delivery of pharmaceutically active compounds for the treatment of eye disorders. Several iLution platform products leverage an exclusive global licensing arrangement with Intratus to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize a patented, non-invasive, transdermal drug delivery formulation designed for application on the eyelid in the treatment of dry eye disease, presbyopia, glaucoma, and other ocular surface diseases and disorders. In January 2022, we commenced patient enrollment in Phase 2 clinical trials of two investigational drug candidates for the treatment of signs and symptoms of dry eye disease (GLK-301) and presbyopia (GLK-302). 
Lastly, in September 2021, we entered into a licensing agreement with Attillaps Holdings, Inc. (Attillaps) to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize Attillaps’ proprietary library of investigational pharmaceutical compounds that target the eradication of Demodex mites, which are the root cause of Demodex blepharitis and often associated with meibomian gland dysfunction and related ophthalmic diseases.
Retinal Diseases
Retinal diseases vary widely but universally affect the retina, a thin layer of tissue inside the back wall of the eye containing light-sensitive cells that convert light into neural signals. Most retinal diseases cause visual impairment, including blurred or distorted vision and vision loss. Our R&D efforts in our retinal franchise are focused on treating AMD, DME, RVO, and other retinal diseases. AMD is a progressive disease that occurs when the macula, the central portion of the retina, is impaired, which can result in severe vision problems. DME is highly prevalent among individuals with type 2 diabetes and is associated with DR, the impairment of small blood vessels in the retina caused by increased glucose levels. Advanced DR can lead to fluid leaking into the macula, which causes DME and severe vision impairment. RVO occurs when the flow of blood from the retina is blocked, often due to a blood clot blocking the retinal vein, which can result in severe vision problems. 
We are developing sustained release pharmaceutical retinal platforms leveraging our expanded pharmaceutical and sustained drug delivery R&D capabilities, including Triamcinolone Acetonide SR, Multi-Kinase Inhibitor SR and Anti-VEGF SR. If commercialized, these platforms would be designed to treat AMD, DME, RVO, and other retinal diseases. The focus of our retinal research and development efforts is to develop potential treatment options with a longer duration-of-effect than current standards of care products. 
Research & Development 
We devote significant resources to our R&D efforts, which are focused on developing new products, and enhancing the effectiveness, ease of use, safety, and reliability of our commercialized products. Our R&D objectives are:

● | to advance glaucoma patient care through continuous improvement of our MIGS technologies through our iStent platform;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5




● | to further enhance treatment options for keratoconus, while expanding iLink and CXL indications to include treatment for certain refractive and other corneal conditions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | to develop dropless, transdermal pharmaceutical therapies for dry eye disease, presbyopia, glaucoma and other corneal disorders; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | to leverage our expertise in sustained release pharmaceutical retinal platforms to identify and develop viable treatment options for retinal diseases such as AMD, DME and RVO.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A considerable portion of our R&D investment includes clinical trials and the collection of evidence that provide data for use in regulatory submissions and required post-market approval studies involving applications of our products. We expect our R&D and clinical expenditures to increase as we continue to devote significant resources to clinical trials and regulatory approvals of our pipeline products. We currently conduct R&D activities primarily in the U.S. but are expanding our clinical capabilities to sites internationally.
Sales and Marketing
Our global sales efforts and promotional activities are currently aimed at ophthalmic surgeons and other eye care professionals. Our primary customers include ambulatory surgery centers, hospitals and physician private practices. In the U.S., we sell the majority of our products through a direct sales organization. Internationally, we sell our products through direct sales organizations in seventeen countries and a network of distribution partners in other markets where we do not have a direct commercial presence or maintain a modest commercial presence. In 2021, sales to customers inside U.S. and internationally accounted for 76% and 24% of our net sales, respectively. No single customer or distributor accounted for more than 10% of our total net sales in 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our iStent technologies, the iStent, the iStent inject, and the iStent inject W and related accessories, which comprise our key iStent platform, accounted for approximately 79% of our net sales, while our iLink therapies accounted for approximately 21% of our net sales.

Competition 
The medical technology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive. We may compete with many companies, including divisions of companies much larger than us that may have greater resources and name recognition, and smaller companies that compete against specific products or in certain geographies. Furthermore, new product development, discoveries, and technological change characterize the areas in which we compete. Our present or future products could be rendered obsolete as a result of advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other surgical or pharmaceutical therapy development. We must continue to develop and commercialize new products, technologies and therapies to remain competitive in the ophthalmology industry. We believe that we compete primarily on the basis of clinical superiority supported by extensive data and innovative features that enhance patient benefit, product performance, and safety.
The ophthalmic segment of the medical technology and pharmaceutical industries is dynamic and subject to significant change due to cost-of-care considerations, regulatory reform, industry and customer consolidation and evolving patient needs. The ability to provide products, technologies and therapies that demonstrate value, are reimbursed through government or third-party payors, improve clinical outcomes and provide ease of use and reliability is becoming increasingly important for companies within ophthalmology.
In glaucoma, our MIGS offerings primarily compete against Ivantis (which was acquired by Alcon in January 2022), however there are a considerable number of large and small companies providing more invasive surgical glaucoma technologies, laser-based therapies, and pharmaceuticals that may provide indirect competition or with whom we may compete should our broad clinical development pipeline be approved and commercialized. In corneal disorders, we have, under an orphan drug designation, the only FDA approved bio-activated pharmaceutical therapy for the treatment of keratoconus but globally we compete against numerous providers of corneal crosslinking therapies such as PeschkeTrade GmBH. Our corneal disorder pipeline, if approved, would vastly expand our competition to numerous large companies such as AbbVie Inc., Alcon and Johnson & Johnson, as well as some small companies that provide medical technology and pharmaceutical therapies for several areas including dry eye and refractive conditions. Our 

6



retinal health pipeline, if approved, may face substantial competition from large pharmaceutical companies such as AbbVie Inc., Novartis AG, Genentech/Roche, Regeneron and Bayer, and there are also a considerable number of large and small companies with development efforts in the field.
Facilities, Manufacturing and Distribution 
Our corporate headquarters and our manufacturing operations for the iStent, iStent inject and iStent inject W are located in an approximately 98,000 square foot campus in San Clemente, California which is comprised of two main buildings. Our pharmaceutical therapies for keratoconus are primarily manufactured and supplied by third parties in the U.S. and Germany. We lease approximately 27,000 square feet of office and laboratory space in Waltham, Massachusetts, pursuant to a lease that expires in 2023, and our manufacturing operations for the majority of our proprietary systems are located in approximately 60,000 square feet of space located in Burlington, Massachusetts under a lease that expires on July 31, 2033 and contains one option to extend for a five-year period at market rates. In the first quarter of 2022, we relocated certain administrative, laboratory, R&D and warehouse space to three office buildings, comprising approximately 160,000 rentable square feet of space, located in Aliso Viejo, California (Aliso Facility). The term of the Aliso Facility lease commenced on May 1, 2019 and will continue for thirteen years, with an option to extend the lease for two additional five-year periods at market rates. We currently intend to maintain manufacturing facilities for the iStent, iStent inject, and iStent inject W at our San Clemente location for the foreseeable future. Our international subsidiaries also lease facilities in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom. 
Intellectual Property 
The strength of our competitive position depends substantially upon our ability to obtain and enforce intellectual property rights protecting our technology both domestically and internationally. We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, trade secrets and other similar intellectual property, as well as customary contractual protections and security measures used to protect our proprietary, trade secret information. 
In the aggregate, our intellectual property assets are of material importance to our business. We are significantly dependent on our patent and other intellectual property rights and the failure to protect such rights could negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products or prohibit us from enforcing our patents or other intellectual property rights against others. For additional information see the section titled Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property within Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

As of December 31, 2021, we owned or exclusively licensed in certain fields of use over 300 issued patents, pending U.S. patent applications, issued foreign patents and pending foreign patent applications. We may, from time to time, choose to acquire or license additional patents and patent applications, or we may choose to abandon, sell, or license certain Company patents and patent applications, depending on our needs. The issued patents that protect our commercial products and current product pipeline expire between 2022 and 2038.
Government Regulation 
Our products and operations are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by federal, state, and local authorities, as well as foreign regulatory authorities. These governmental agencies regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, approval, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion and marketing, distribution, post approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of medical devices and drugs (including drug/device combination products) in their respective jurisdictions to assure the safety and effectiveness of medical products and pharmaceuticals for their intended use. In general, there has been a trend of increased regulation of medical device and drug products, which has resulted in, and will likely continue to result in, increased prices to bring new products to market.
U.S. Regulation & Reimbursement
The FDA has broad regulatory authority over medical devices and drugs in the U.S. The FDA regulates, among other things, product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting.

Medical Device Requirements
Each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires one of the following: (i) exemption from or clearance under a 510(k) premarket notification; (ii) approval under a Premarket approval (PMA) application; or (iii) approval of a de-novo classification petition.
The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturing and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class III devices, which include our iStent products that produce the majority of our revenue, are deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices and devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a predicate device that the FDA has already cleared for marketing. Class III devices require FDA approval of the more demanding PMA application before marketing of the device can proceed. While the iStent, iStent inject and the PreserFlo MicroShunt are categorized as Class III devices and thus would generally be subject to the more rigorous PMA approval pathway, the FDA determined that an appropriate predicate device exists for the iStent infinite and that 510(k) premarket notification would be sufficient. 
​
PMA Approval Pathway
In a PMA application process, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is safe and effective for its intended use, and the PMA must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. If the FDA accepts the application for review, it has 180 days under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) to complete its review of a PMA, although in practice, the FDA’s review can take up to several years. The FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the applicant or its third-party manufacturers’ or suppliers’ manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (QSR). Even after a PMA approval, the FDA may require post-approval conditions to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including additional clinical studies or post-market surveillance. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval. Certain changes to an approved device, such as changes in manufacturing facilities, methods, or quality control procedures, or changes in the design performance specifications, which may affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, require submission of a PMA supplement. 
Clinical Trials of Medical Devices
Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA for a Class III device. All clinical investigations must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s IDE regulations. If the device presents a “significant risk,” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an investigational drug exemption (IDE) application to the FDA, showing with appropriate data that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. 
Regardless of the degree of risk presented by the medical device, clinical studies must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board (IRB) for each clinical site. During a study, the sponsor and any clinical investigators are required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements. After a trial begins, the sponsor, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits.
Post-Market Regulation
​
After a device is approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
​

● | Establishment registration and device listing with the FDA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------

​

8




● | QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Labelling, advertising and promotion regulations, which require that promotion is truthful, not misleading, fairly balanced and provide adequate directions for use and that all claims are substantiated, and also prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Approval of product modifications of approved devices that affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of an approved device;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.

​
The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:
​

● | warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Drug Requirements
The development and commercialization of drug products is subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries. Before marketing in the U.S., a drug must undergo rigorous preclinical and clinical studies and an extensive regulatory approval process implemented by the FDA under the FDCA. Several of our pipeline products, including our iDose implants and our iLution cream-based formulations, are drug products that are subject to this regulatory approval process.
Before commencing clinical studies in humans in the US, we must submit to the FDA an IND that includes, among other things, the general investigational plan and protocols for specific human studies and the results of preclinical studies. Once clinical studies have begun under the IND, they are usually conducted in three phases and under FDA oversight. These phases generally include the following:

9



Phase 1. Introduction into patients or healthy human volunteers and is tested for safety, dose tolerance and pharmacokinetics.
Phase 2. Introduction into a limited patient population to assess the efficacy of the drug in specific, targeted indications, assess dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
Phase 3. Expansion to further demonstrate clinical efficacy, optimal dosage and safety within an expanded patient population.
The results of drug development, preclinical studies and clinical studies must be submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA. The NDA also must contain extensive manufacturing information. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) establishes timeframes for FDA review of NDAs and the 2007 Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act gave the FDA authority to require implementation of a formal Risk Evaluation and Management Strategy to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh its risks. At the end of the review period, the FDA communicates either approval of the NDA or a complete response listing the application’s deficiencies.
As part of the NDA approval, the FDA may require post-marketing studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, to monitor the safety and effectiveness of approved drugs, which may limit further marketing of the drug based on the results of these post-marketing studies. 
If regulatory approval for a drug is obtained, the marketing of the drug will be limited to those diseases and conditions approved by FDA and for which the drug was shown to be effective, as demonstrated through clinical studies and specified in the drug’s labeling. Even if this regulatory approval is obtained, a marketed drug, its manufacturer and its manufacturing facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA. The FDA ensures the quality of approved drugs by carefully monitoring manufacturers’ compliance with its current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations, which contain minimum requirements for the methods, facilities, and controls used in manufacturing, processing, and packaging of a drug. The FDA may withdraw drug approval if compliance with post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety or quality issues are identified after the drug reaches the marketplace. 
The FDA has recently determined that products previously regulated as drugs, which are comprised of a drug constituent part and a device part, may become subject to regulation as drug-led combination products. This may impact some of our pipeline products, such as our iDose drug-eluting implants. These products that are considered to be drug-device combination products will require review and coordination by FDA’s drug and device centers prior to approval, which may delay approval. In the U.S., a combination product with a drug primary mode of action generally would be reviewed and approved pursuant to the drug approval processes under the FDCA. In reviewing the approval application for such a product, however, FDA reviewers in the drug center will consult with their counterparts in the device center to ensure that the device component of the combination product meet applicable requirements regarding safety, effectiveness, durability and performance. Under FDA regulations, combination products are subject to cGMP requirements applicable to both drugs and devices, including the Quality System (QS) regulations applicable to medical devices. 
We are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA and other regulatory authorities have broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including the power to withdraw approvals.
Health Care Regulatory Laws
Additional laws and regulations also govern our business operations and products in the U.S., including among others:

● | the federal health care Anti-Kickback Statute which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order,
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10




arrangement for, or recommendation of, items or services for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal health care programs;
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. False Claims Act liability is significant in the healthcare industry because the statute provides for treble damages and significant mandatory penalties per false claim or statement for violations (adjusted annually for inflation);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | federal and state laws and regulations that govern the collection, dissemination, security, use, disclosure and confidentiality of patient-identifiable health and other proprietary and personally-identifiable information, in particular, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH). HIPAA created federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires applicable manufacturers like us to report annually to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) information related to payments and other “transfers of value” made to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. For reports beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report information regarding such payments and transfers of value provided in 2021 to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Certain states also mandate implementation of corporate compliance programs, require adherence to the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines, impose restrictions on manufacturer marketing practices, require registration or licensing of manufacturers and their sales representatives, and/or require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation, and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities. 
Additionally, some states have proposed or enacted legislation that will create new data privacy and security obligations for certain entities, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) that went into effect January 1, 2020, the California Privacy Rights Act approved in November 2020 and that will be effective in January 2023, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act enacted on March 2, 2021 and the Colorado Privacy Act enacted on July 8, 2021. Violations of these laws, or the health care regulatory laws described above, may subject us to administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, including imprisonment of individuals, the imposition of significant fines, monetary penalties, and damages, exclusion from participation in (or reimbursement for our products from) federal health care programs like Medicare or Medicaid, imposition of compliance obligations or monitoring, curtailment or restructuring of our operations, and damage to our reputation. 
Reimbursement
Ambulatory surgery centers, hospitals and physician private practices that purchase our medical device products typically bill various third-party payors, such as government programs, private insurance plans and managed care programs, to cover all or a portion of the costs and fees associated with the therapeutics or procedures in which our products are used and bill patients for any applicable deductibles or co-payments. In the U.S., physicians are typically paid separately from the facility for surgical procedures involving our products. In the U.S., there are distinct billing codes that are used by healthcare providers to report the provision of medical procedures and the use of supplies for specific patients to payors. There are different categories of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes (Category I, II and III) based on the procedure or supply. For 2022, the temporary Category III CPT codes associated with payment rates for existing iStent-related procedures converted to permanent Category I codes for facility fee and physician fee payments furnished in both the hospital outpatient and ambulatory surgery center settings. As compared to the payments rates in effect in 2021 under the Category III CPT code, the CMS 2022 Medicare payment rates reflect a significantly lower physician fee involving procedures of the implantation of trabecular bypass stents, such as our iStent family of products, in conjunction with cataract surgery, while the facility fee schedule related to reimbursement for surgeries that 

11



include implantation of trabecular bypass stents, such as our iStent family of products, in conjunction with cataract surgery, reflects a slight decrease in payment rate to an ambulatory surgery center, and an increase in reimbursements to a hospital. We estimate that approximately 80% of procedures utilizing our trabecular micro-bypass technologies in the U.S. are performed in the ambulatory surgery center setting and the remaining estimated 20% of procedures are performed in the hospital. Even though a permanent billing code has been assigned to a product, there is no guarantee that coverage will be provided.
Additionally, effective in 2022, we obtained a temporary Category III CPT code associated with payment rates for facility fee payments that are lower than anticipated for standalone insertion of an aqueous drainage device in the ambulatory surgery center and hospital setting, which would be the procedure that such facilities would use with our iStent infinite product, which is not yet approved by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration. Prior to expiration of a temporary code, there are two options: submit an application to convert a temporary code to a permanent code or submit an application for a five-year extension of the temporary code. In connection with a transition to a permanent code, both the physician fee and facility fee associated with the procedures using our iStent infinite product will be reevaluated. In some cases, the physician fees and/or facility fees have been decreased at the time codes are transitioned from temporary to permanent. 
There is no published Medicare payment schedule at the national level for physician payment amounts for temporary Category III CPT code products. The physician payment rate is left to the discretion of the regional Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs), with each MAC separately determining coverage and no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained from, or maintained by, the MACs. MACs have in the past, and may in the future, change coverage terms. 
​
Our Photrexa pharmaceutical therapy has received a permanent healthcare common procedure coding system J code and we have obtained temporary Category III CPT code for the professional fees associated with CXL. 
​
In the U.S., no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement exists among third-party payors; coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. In addition, payors continually review new products for possible coverage and existing products for changes in coverage and can, without notice, deny coverage. 
​
International Regulation & Reimbursement
​
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing clinical trials, commercial sales and distribution of our products and reporting of payments to physicians. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain authorization before commencing clinical trials or obtain marketing authorization or approval of a product under the comparable regulatory authorities of countries internationally. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. In addition, certain countries have adopted transparency legislation that requires us to report contracts with or payments made to physicians in those countries and many have enacted anti-kickback laws and regulations, which generally prohibit the offer, receipt, or payment of remuneration in exchange for or to induce the use of our products.
Similar to the trend within the U.S., other major international markets are also moving toward more stringent regulatory frameworks for medical device and drug products. For example, in May 2017, the EU adopted a new regulatory scheme for medical devices under the Medical Device Regulation (MDR). The MDR became effective in May 2021 with a transition period through May 2024 at the latest, and will bring significant new requirements for many medical devices, including enhanced requirements for clinical evidence and documentation, increased focus on device identification and traceability, new definitions and registration of economic operators throughout the distribution chain, and additional post-market surveillance and vigilance, which could result in substantial additional expense.
The EU has also adopted increasingly stringent data protection and privacy rules that have and will continue to have a substantial impact on the use of patient data across the healthcare industry. The EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, became effective in May 2018 and applies across the EU (with the exception of the United Kingdom, which has adopted the UK Data Protection Act 2018 and a substantially equivalent version of the GDPR). The 

12



GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. Failure to comply with the GDPR requirements may result in costly government enforcement actions, private litigation, and negative publicity, each of which could further result in reputation damage and our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could suffer.
Reimbursement
Internationally, reimbursement levels vary significantly by country and by region within some countries. Reimbursement is obtained from a variety of sources, including government-sponsored and private health insurance plans, and combinations of both. Some countries require additional clinical data before granting or expanding coverage and reimbursement for our products. In general, obtaining broad-based reimbursement and adequate payment for new technologies is more difficult in these markets than in the U.S. Many countries require new medical technologies to not only be safe and effective, but also to be able to demonstrate clinical benefits that outweigh the costs when compared to the standard of care. As in the U.S., reimbursement decisions can change, resulting in the elimination or reduction of reimbursement payments, which could adversely affect our financial results and our ability to invest in and grow our business.
Other
Our operations and many of the products we manufacture or sell are subject to extensive regulation by numerous other governmental agencies, both within the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S., apart from the agencies discussed above, our facilities, operations, employees, products (their manufacture, sale, import and export) and services are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Health & Safety Administration, the Department of Labor, Customs and Border Protection, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Treasury, the Department of Justice and others. State agencies also regulate our facilities, operations, employees, products and services within their respective states. Government agencies internationally also regulate public health, product registration, manufacturing, environmental conditions, labor, exports, imports, bribery and corruption and other aspects of our global operations.
These regulatory agencies and any current or future legislation could impact our business operations, reimbursement for our products, and the healthcare environment generally, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Compliance with these regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position to date, but current or new legislation could have such an effect in the future. We cannot estimate the expenses we may incur to comply with potential new laws or changes to existing laws, or the other potential effects these laws may have on our business.
Human Capital Management
Glaukos is committed to developing a comprehensive, cohesive and positive employee experience. We consider talent attraction, development, engagement and retention a key driver of our business success. As of December 31, 2021, we had 727 full-time employees. Our Board of Directors, through the Compensation, Nominating and Governance Committee, retains direct oversight of our human capital management process, including demographics, talent development, employee retention, material aspects of employee compensation as well as diversity and inclusion recruitment, retention and compensation efforts. Additionally, the Compensation, Nominating and Governance Committee assists management with the implementation of the Company’s diversity strategy. We report on human capital matters at each regularly scheduled Board of Directors meeting and periodically throughout the year. The most significant human capital measures or objectives that we focus on in managing our business and our related human capital initiatives include the following:
​

● | Workforce Diversity: We believe that truly innovative companies must find new ways to address the marketplace’s needs and the most effective innovation happens when our workforce represents a diversity of ideas and experiences. We embrace diversity in our employee recruiting, hiring, and

development practices. Our workforce was made up of 37% female employees and 42% racially or ethnically diverse employees as of December 31, 2021, with 32% and 37% of management positions being filled by female and racially or ethnically diverse individuals, respectively. During 2021, of the promotions that were earned within our workforce, 37% were earned by female employees and 52% were earned by racially or ethnically diverse employees.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Inclusion and Belonging: We strive to create a work environment that emphasizes respect, fairness and dignity and do not tolerate discrimination or harassment. Individuals are evaluated based on merit, without discrimination, including discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, citizenship, marital status, gender (including pregnancy), gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, age, disability, veteran status, or other characteristics protected by law. We are committed to providing equal opportunities to every member of our workforce. To further celebrate the rich perspectives and experiences that arise from racial, ethnic, socio-economic, sexual, gender, physical and religious diversity, in 2021 we formed the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Forum, comprised of Glaukos employees from across the globe who serve as an advisory group to help promote our inclusive culture.

​

● | Health, Safety, and Wellness: We are dedicated to the safety and wellbeing of our employees. As the COVID-19 pandemic continued in 2021, we maintained a remote work environment for many of our employees, and continued to provide those employees with the resources necessary to effectively perform their job responsibilities. We retained the use of personal protective equipment and social distancing within our manufacturing and distribution operations. We also offered periodic voluntary COVID-19 viral testing to on-site employees. Further, we continued our COVID-19 pay policies, started in 2020, that provide our employees up to ten additional days of paid leave if they experience COVID-19 exposure or illness or to need time to care for exposed or ill family members.

​

● | Philanthropy and Volunteerism: We created the Glaukos Charitable Foundation to assist the company in its philanthropic endeavors. Glaukos has donated over $10 million worth of its products to assist individuals in need. Additionally, we regularly hold local volunteer events and fundraising campaigns, including approximately 20 in 2021, to encourage our employees to give back to our communities, a commitment that we further support by offering employees paid time off for charitable volunteering. One of our more impactful volunteer events involved Glaukos employees adopting over 140 disadvantaged families globally to help provide a more special holiday experience.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Training and Development: Employees receive regular development feedback through quarterly management reviews during which they are encouraged to cultivate new skills and opportunities. We coach our leaders to facilitate effective conversations and measure the effectiveness of these conversations by surveying our employees. In addition to training and development opportunities, all new employees are required to participate in substantial training seminars to introduce them to Glaukos’ business, pipeline and position within ophthalmology. We value knowledge and continuous improvement and conduct frequent informational sessions to further expose our employees to different departments, projects and business priorities. Additionally, in 2021 we launched a company-wide learning management system to streamline our training process and make learning opportunities even more accessible for our employees worldwide.

​

● | Compensation and Benefits: To attract, retain and recognize talent, we aim to ensure merit-based, equitable compensation practices and strive to provide competitive compensation and benefit packages to our workforce. Employees at all levels are eligible for discretionary cash bonuses. To align employees with the organization’s performance, all U.S. employees are eligible to receive new hire and annual awards of restricted stock units. In furtherance of our commitment to internal pay equity and pay transparency, Glaukos conducts an annual pay equity analysis to evaluate compensation distribution, which analysis is also conducted in connection with new hires, promotions and our annual affirmative action planning process. Despite the difficulties presented by COVID-19, in recent years we expanded our global benefits programs, including broadening our employee assistance program globally, adding elderly and childcare and fertility treatment assistance and introducing parental leave for new and
