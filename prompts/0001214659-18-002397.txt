ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are a biopharmaceutical company pursuing cutting-edge science to develop our proprietary monoclonal antibodies for immunotherapy and oncology treatments. Our lead product candidate is lenzilumab (formerly known as KB003).  We have begun work with leading key opinion leaders in the chimeric antigen receptor T-cell, or CAR-T, therapy field to advance lenzilumab into phase 1b/2 trials for the prevention of neurotoxicity and potentially cytokine release syndrome, or CRS, associated with CAR-T therapy.  There are currently no FDA-approved products for the prevention or treatment of neurotoxicity or prevention of CRS associated with CAR-T therapy.  Additionally, lenzilumab is currently in a phase 1 trial for the treatment of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, or CMML, and potentially subsequent trials for the treatment of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, or JMML, both of which are rare hematologic cancers with high unmet medical need. We are exploring partnering opportunities to enable development of ifabotuzumab (another of our proprietary monoclonal antibodies, formerly known as KB004), as a potential CAR construct and for the potential treatment of certain rare solid and hematologic cancers and other serious diseases.  With a focus on preventing serious and potentially life-threatening side-effects associated with CAR-T therapy and other high-unmet-need conditions for which there are no FDA-approved therapies, we also believe we have the opportunity to benefit from various regulatory incentives, such as orphan drug exclusivity, breakthrough therapy designation, fast track designation and accelerated approval.
 
We were incorporated on March 15, 2000 in California and reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in September 2001 under the name KaloBios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. We completed our initial public offering in January 2013. Effective August 7, 2017, we changed our legal name to Humanigen, Inc.
 
We have undergone a significant transformation since December 2015. As a result of challenges facing us at the time, on December 29, 2015, we filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On June 30, 2016, our Second Amended Plan of Reorganization, dated May 9, 2016, as amended (the “Plan”), became effective and we emerged from our Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. For further information on our bankruptcy and emergence from bankruptcy, see “Bankruptcy.”
 
From the time of our emergence from bankruptcy to August 29, 2017, our lead product candidate was benznidazole for the treatment of Chagas disease, a parasitic illness that can lead to serious and potentially life-threatening long-term heart, intestinal and neurological problems. On June 30, 2016, we acquired certain worldwide rights to benznidazole from Savant Neglected Diseases, LLC, or Savant, and until August 29, 2017, we were primarily focused on the development necessary to seek and obtain approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for benznidazole and the subsequent commercialization, if approved.  According to FDA-issued guidance, benznidazole is eligible for review pursuant to a 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway as a potential treatment for Chagas disease and, if it became the first FDA-approved treatment for Chagas disease, we would have been eligible to receive a Priority Review Voucher, or PRV.
 
However, on August 29, 2017, the FDA announced it had granted accelerated and conditional approval of a benznidazole therapy manufactured by Chemo Research, S.L., or Chemo, for the treatment of Chagas disease and had awarded that manufacturer a neglected tropical disease PRV. Chemo’s benznidazole also received Orphan Drug designation. As a result of FDA’s actions and because we no longer expected to be eligible to receive a PRV with our own benznidazole candidate for the treatment of Chagas disease, we immediately ceased development for benznidazole and began assessing a full range of options with respect to our benznidazole assets and development program. We also began an accelerated scientific assessment of emerging new possibilities for our monoclonal antibody assets and development programs, including potential prophylaxis of CAR-T-related toxicities as the first CAR-T products began receiving approval for marketing in the US.

On December 21, 2017, we reached an agreement with our Term Loan Lenders (as defined below) on a series of transactions, including the transfer and assignment of all of our assets related to benznidazole to an affiliate of one of the Term Loan Lenders, providing for, among other things, the satisfaction and extinguishment of our outstanding obligations under our Term Loan Credit Agreement (as defined below). We refer to these transactions herein as the “Restructuring Transactions.” On February 27, 2018, we completed the Restructuring Transactions. For further information regarding the Restructuring Transactions, see “The Restructuring Transactions.”
 
Since the FDA’s August 29, 2017 announcement relating to benznidazole, we have shifted our primary focus toward developing our proprietary monoclonal antibody portfolio, which comprises lenzilumab and ifabotuzumab, for use in addressing serious and potentially life-threatening unmet needs in oncology. Both of these product candidates are in the early stage of development and will require substantial time, expenses, clinical development, testing, and regulatory approval prior to commercialization. Furthermore, neither of these product candidates has advanced into a pivotal registration study and it may be years before such a study is initiated, if at all.
 
Lenzilumab is a recombinant monoclonal antibody, or mAb, that neutralizes soluble granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, or GM-CSF, a critical cytokine in the inflammatory cascade associated with CAR-T-related side effects and in the growth of certain hematologic malignancies, solid tumors and other serious conditions. We expect to study lenzilumab’s potential in reducing adverse events associated with CAR-T therapy. We have begun to explore lenzilumab’s effectiveness in preventing or ameliorating neurotoxicity associated with CAR-T therapy, and potentially CRS. In addition, we continue dosing in a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with CMML to identify the maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, or recommended Phase 2 dose of lenzilumab and to assess lenzilumab’s safety, pharmacokinetics, and clinical activity.  We have fully enrolled the total 12 patients in the 200, 400 and 600 mg dose cohorts of our CMML trial, and are currently evaluating subjects in the highest dose cohort of 600 mg for continuing accrual. We also plan to review preliminary safety and efficacy results and anticipate completion of the ad hoc interim analysis in the first half of 2018. We may also use the interim data from the lenzilumab CMML Phase 1 study to determine the feasibility of rapidly commencing a Phase 1 study in JMML patients, or to explore progressing the CMML development program. JMML is a rare pediatric cancer, is associated with poor outcomes and a very high unmet medical need for which there are no FDA-approved therapies.
 
Ifabotuzumab is an anti-Ephrin Type-A receptor 3, or EphA3, mAb that has the potential to offer a novel approach to treating solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, serious pulmonary conditions and as a CAR construct. Ifabotuzumab, to our knowledge, is the only anti-EphA3 compound in development.  EphA3 is aberrantly expressed on the surface of tumor cells and stroma cells in certain cancers. We have completed the Phase 1 dose escalation portion of a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in ifabotuzumab in multiple hematologic malignancies for which the preliminary results were published in the journal Leukemia Research in 2016.  An investigator-sponsored Phase 0/1 radiolabeled imaging trial of ifabotuzumab in glioblastoma multiforme, a particularly aggressive and deadly form of brain cancer, has begun at the Olivia-Newton John Cancer Institute in Melbourne, Australia.   We are currently exploring partnering opportunities to enable further development of ifabotuzumab.
 
Lenzilumab and ifabotuzumab were each developed with our proprietary, patent-protected Humaneered® technology, which consists of methods for converting antibodies (typically murine) into engineered, high-affinity antibodies designed for human therapeutic use, typically for chronic conditions.
 
Our Strategy
 
We are a biopharmaceutical company pursuing cutting-edge science to develop our proprietary monoclonal antibodies for immunotherapy and oncology treatments.  We plan to achieve our objectives through the following strategies, which we believe reflect an innovative and responsible business model:

· | Develop lenzilumab for the prevention and treatment of serious and potentially life-threatening CAR-T-related side effects. Lenzilumab is a Humaneered recombinant monoclonal antibody that neutralizes soluble GM-CSF, a critical cytokine involved in the development of serious side-effects associated with CAR-T therapy. GM-CSF is an upstream driver in the paths of multiple diseases. Recent science shows that GM-CSF is the key initiator of inflammatory side-effects, neurotoxicity and CRS, associated with groundbreaking CAR-T cancer therapy. Lenzilumab has shown a favorable safety profile to date and has been studied in more than 100 human subjects in clinical studies - one Phase 1 and two Phase 2 clinical trials - in either healthy adults or adults with various diseases. We also have completed Phase 1 and Phase 1/2 clinical trials in 76 patients with lenzilumab’s chimeric precursor, KB002. The lenzilumab Phase 2 studies included patients with severe asthma and the run‑in safety portion of a clinical trial in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The severe asthma study demonstrated efficacy in patients with eosinophilic asthma, but we did not continue the programs due to strategic considerations and decisions. Pre-clinical animal model work assessing lenzilumab in CAR-T toxicities is being completed. We, in conjunction with leading key opinion leaders are designing a Phase 1b/2 study to explore lenzilumab as a prophylactic treatment to minimize neurotoxicity associated with CAR-T therapy.

· | Development of lenzilumab for the treatment of CMML and JMML. In July 2016, we initiated dosing in a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with CMML to identify the maximum tolerated dose (“MTD”) or recommended Phase 2 dose of lenzilumab and to assess lenzilumab’s safety, pharmacokinetics, and clinical activity. Further, we may initiate a study of lenzilumab in JMML, a rare pediatric form of leukemia, where the primary treatment alternative, in patients who would qualify, would be a bone marrow stem cell transplant. We believe that both CMML and JMML would qualify as orphan conditions, and we intend to seek orphan designation for lenzilumab for both of these conditions. The mechanism of action of lenzilumab may also prove to be of value in multiple other autoimmune rare and orphan conditions. If FDA agrees that JMML is a rare pediatric disease and qualifies for priority review, we may receive a PRV if lenzilumab is approved by FDA for use in JMML. In addition, we may seek breakthrough therapy status which, if granted, would confer various benefits, including a fast track pathway, or separately we may submit for a fast track pathway if breakthrough therapy status is not granted.

· | Partner ifabotuzumab for the treatment of rare adult and pediatric solid tumors and hematologic cancers and serious pulmonary conditions and as a CAR construct. Consistent with our strategic focus, we are now evaluating opportunities to partner ifabotuzumab in rare solid tumors like glioblastoma, pediatric cancers and certain rare hematologic cancer indications. Serious pulmonary conditions also could be a target, according to early data. We believe that some of these conditions would qualify for orphan designation, and ifabotuzumab may receive orphan designation for these conditions. In addition, we are exploring various other opportunities in the oncology field that would utilize ifabotuzumab as the basis of the therapy. These include developing a CAR construct, which could be used as a therapeutic CAR-T therapy; developing bi-specific antibody constructs including ifabotuzumab; utilizing ifabotuzumab as part of a radiopharmaceuticals therapeutic approach; and utilizing ifabotuzumab as part of an Antibody Drug Conjugate, or ADC. We are in discussions with various parties related to these additional opportunities which leverage ifabotuzumab as a platform monoclonal antibody.

Lenzilumab
 
Overview and Mechanism of Action
 
Lenzilumab, previously referred to as KB003, is a recombinant antibody designed to target and neutralize human GM‑CSF, a central actor in leukocyte differentiation, autoimmunity and inflammation. We used our proprietary and patented Humaneered antibody development platform to develop lenzilumab. There is extensive evidence linking GM-CSF expression to serious and potentially life-threatening side-effects in CAR-T therapy. Our primary focus for lenzilumab is exploring its potential to prevent and ameliorate CAR-T-related neurotoxicity and CRS. We are also developing lenzilumab for use in patients with CMML and are assessing plans to investigate its potential use in patients with JMML. In CAR-T related side effects, GM-CSF initiates a signaling cascade of inflammation that results in the trafficking and recruitment of myeloid cells to the tumor site. These myeloid cells produce the cytokines observed in neurotoxicity and CRS, perpetuating the inflammatory cascade. Peer-reviewed publications in leading journals by well-recognized clinical experts have shown that GM-CSF is a biomarker present in patients who suffer serious neurotoxicity as a side-effect of CAR-T therapy. The GM-CSF receptor is expressed on myeloblasts and other progenitor cells, and binding results in differentiation and maturation into monocytes. GM‑CSF is an important part of an inflammatory cascade that stimulates white blood cells (granulocytes, including eosinophils, neutrophils, and macrophages) and maintains them in an active state during infection. However, excessive GM‑CSF may be involved in tissue damage associated with inflammatory diseases. The results of anti‑GM‑CSF in ex-vivo studies suggest lenzilumab has potential in preventing neurotoxicity associated with CAR-T therapy and certain oncology conditions, including CMML and JMML, as well as asthma, RA and other arthritides.

Lenzilumab is a Humaneered version of KB002, a low picomolar affinity, novel chimeric mAb that we licensed from Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, or LICR. Data from our single‑dose, Phase 1 and Phase 1/2 clinical trials with KB002 supported our clinical trials with lenzilumab. In these studies, KB002 appeared to be well tolerated. Lenzilumab targets the same binding site as KB002 and has been shown to be functionally similar and appeared generally safe in previous clinical trials. See “Intellectual Property” Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research for further information on our license with LICR.
 
Development Program
 
We believe that a strong scientific rationale exists for lenzilumab to play an important role in making CAR-T therapy safer, more effective and more routine.  CAR-T cell therapy is currently limited by the risk of life-threatening neurotoxicity and CRS. Both Kymriah® and Yescarta® carry black box warnings in their labels for neurotoxicity and CRS. In the case of more severe neurotoxicity and/or CRS, patients may need to be treated on the Intensive Care Unit, or ICU, in the hospital. Because of the seriousness of these cases, which can affect between approximately 30 – 50 percent of patients receiving CAR-T, physicians planning to administer CAR-T may have to reserve an ICU bed for patients prior to treatment. This can create a significant bottleneck in relation to the hospital’s ability to administer CAR-T. Side effects associated with CAR-T may limit the number of patients that can be treated with CAR-T and also the dosage that can be safely administered affecting efficacy.  We believe higher doses of CAR-T may be more efficacious but can also be associated with a greater risk of side-effects.
 
Actemra (tocilizumab) is an IL-6 receptor antagonist that was recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of severe life-threatening CRS based on a retrospective analysis of pooled outcome data from CAR-T clinical trials of 45 pediatric and adult patients treated with Actemra with or without high-dose corticosteroids. There were no prospective, randomized controlled trials conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tocilizumab for the treatment of severe CRS. Moreover, clinical experience has proven that tocilizumab is not effective for the treatment of neurotoxicity and cases of CRS refractory to tocilizumab have been reported underscoring the need for additional, more effective management strategies to prevent the onset of CAR-T induced neurotoxicity and CRS. It is important to note that tocilizumab is not approved for the prevention of CRS nor for the prevention or treatment of neurotoxicity. Studies have shown that administering tocilizumab prophylactically increases the number of patients who suffer serious neurotoxicity compared with those patients not receiving tocilizumab prophylactically. Further, tocilizumab is not approved for the treatment of mild or moderate cases of CRS.
 
Lenzilumab is in development to specifically address this unmet need and robust scientific rationale exists to support GM-CSF neutralization as a validated target in this setting.  In December 2017, we held a scientific advisory board with leading key opinion leaders in the CAR-T field to validate the scientific rationale of studying lenzilumab’s anti-GM-CSF mechanism to stop CAR-T-related toxicity.  Based on feedback received from the advisory board, we created our lenzilumab development plan to study prevention of the onset of CAR-T-induced neurotoxicity while maintaining or improving CAR-T expansion, persistence and anti-tumor response and potentially reducing the need or duration for ICU stay. To that end, we started preclinical work using validated CRS animal models at the Mayo Clinic. In addition we have begun work with leading key opinion leaders, including MD Anderson Cancer Center, to advance lenzilumab into phase 1b/2 trials for the prevention of neurotoxicity and potentially CRS associated with CAR-T therapy. We expect this trial to start in the summer of 2018. We have benchmarked the studies undertaken in the CAR-T space and regulatory strategies employed and intend to leverage this knowledge in our clinical development and regulatory plans.

We also believe lenzilumab has potential as a therapy for CMML, a rare form of hematologic cancer with no FDA-approved treatment options and a three-year overall survival rate of 20% and median overall survival of 20 months, and JMML, a rare pediatric form of leukemia.  CMML is a clonal stem cell disorder of which monocytosis is a key feature.  CMML has features of MDS, including abnormal, dysplastic bone marrow cells; cytopenia; transfusion dependence; and myeloproliferative neoplasms, including overproduction of white blood cells, organomegaly such as splenomegaly and hepatomegaly and extramedullary disease. Approximately 15% to 20% of CMML cases progress to acute myeloid leukemia, or AML. According to the American Cancer Society, approximately 1,100 individuals in the US are newly diagnosed annually with CMML, with the majority of these new patients being age 60 or older. These patients are typically unsuitable for stem cell transplants. Preclinical studies have shown lenzilumab can cause apoptosis in CMML cells by depriving them of GM-CSF. In July 2016, we initiated dosing in a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with CMML to identify the MTD or recommended Phase 2 dose of lenzilumab and to assess lenzilumab’s safety, pharmacokinetics, and clinical activity. The study has fully enrolled 12 patients. Depending on the results of the CMML study, we also intend to investigate the potential treatment of JMML, a rarer disease, with lenzilumab.  There are approximately 420 new cases of JMML annually in the US and the disease mostly affects children aged four and younger. We believe that lenzilumab may be eligible for a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher if approved for JMML. We also believe lenzilumab in CMML or JMML could qualify for orphan drug designation and potentially several other FDA incentives.
 
An IND for a Phase 1/2 CMML monotherapy study of lenzilumab is in effect. In July 2016, we began to enroll patients in a multicenter, open-label, repeat-dose, Phase 1 study consisting of a dose escalation phase and a dose expansion phase to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and clinical activity of lenzilumab in patients with previously-treated CMML who are no longer responsive to previous treatment.  The primary endpoint of this study is the safety of lenzilumab, as measured by the number of participants with adverse events, at various doses in order to determine a recommended Phase 2 dose. The secondary endpoint is the clinical activity of lenzilumab, as measured by changes in spleen size, blood and bone marrow measurements of disease, clinical symptoms and other measures.
 
Previous clinical studies of lenzilumab include a repeat‑dose, Phase 2 clinical trial of lenzilumab in RA with the inclusion of a safety run‑in portion. On completing the safety run-in portion of this trial, which showed lenzilumab to be well tolerated with no clinically significant adverse events, we reassessed the increasingly competitive RA market and chose to redirect our study of lenzilumab to severe asthma patients inadequately controlled by corticosteroids. Results from a subsequent randomized, double‑blinded, placebo‑controlled, repeat dose, intravenous Phase 2 clinical trial of asthma, revealed that the primary endpoint was not met, although a significant effect was shown in certain pre‑specified subgroups, such as those with eosinophilic asthma. As a result of a strategic shift by the company, we terminated development of lenzilumab in severe asthma.
 
Ifabotuzumab
 
Ifabotuzumab is a Humaneered mAb in which the carbohydrate chains lack fucose, thereby enhancing the targeted cell-killing activity of the antibody. In 2006, we entered into a license agreement with LICR pursuant to which LICR granted to us certain exclusive rights to the ifabotuzumab prototype and EphA3 intellectual property.
 
Ifabotuzumab binds to the EphA3 receptor, which plays an important role in cell positioning and tissue organization during fetal development, but is not thought to play a significant role in healthy adults. EphA3 is a tyrosine kinase receptor aberrantly expressed on the tumor cell surface in a number of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, and is also expressed on the stem cell compartment. This compartment includes malignant stem cells, the vasculature that feeds them, and the stromal cells that protect them. EphA3 expression has been documented in a number of tumor types, including AML, chronic myelogenous leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, MDS, myelofibrosis, multiple myeloma, melanoma, breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, renal cancer, glioblastoma, and prostate cancer. Publications related to certain cancers have indicated that EphA3 tumor cell expression correlates with cancer growth and a poor prognosis.  EphA3 is overexpressed in GBM and, in particular, in the most aggressive mesenchymal subtype.  Importantly, EphA3 is highly expressed on the tumor-initiating cell population in glioma and appears critically involved in maintaining tumor cells in a less differentiated state by modulating mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. EphA3 knockdown or depletion of EphA3-positive tumor cells may reduce tumorigenic potential to a degree comparable to treatment with a therapeutic radiolabelled EphA3-specific monoclonal antibody. Thus, EphA3 may emerge as a functional, targetable receptor in GBM as well as certain lymphomas and leukemias.

Anti-EphA3 treatment has shown encouraging preclinical results in multiple experiment types, including patient primary tumor cell assays, colony forming assays, and xenograft mouse models. Upon binding to EphA3, ifabotuzumab causes cell killing to occur either through antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity, or ADCC, or through direct apoptosis, and in the case of tumor neovasculature, through cell rounding and blood vessel disruption. Given the differential expression pattern of EphA3, ifabotuzumab may have the potential to kill cancer cells and the tumor stem cell microenvironment, providing for long-term responses while sparing normal cells. By developing ifabotuzumab as the backbone for a next generation CAR construct, we may have the ability to target both the tumor and tumor vasculature in a novel manner and build on the experience with current second generation CD19 CAR-T cell therapies.  An investigator-sponsored Phase 0/1 radiolabeled imaging trial of ifabotuzumab in glioblastoma multiforme, a particularly aggressive and deadly form of brain cancer, has begun at the Olivia-Newton John Cancer Institute in Melbourne, Australia. On December 5, 2017, the first patient received ifabotuzumab in a trial that, according to the investigators, will seek to confirm the safety of ifabotuzumab and potentially determine the best dose to effectively penetrate brain tumors. Currently, three patients have received ifabotuzumab in this study and the investigators expect approximately 12 patients to participate in the trial, for which eligibility criteria are recurrent GBM and receipt of only one type of chemotherapy for disease recurrence. Consistent with our new strategic focus, we are now evaluating wider opportunities to partner ifabotuzumab. We are in early discussions with separate and various parties to leverage the unique features of ifabotuzumab to:
 
 
· | Construct a CAR product to potentially be used as CAR-T therapy;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


· | Develop bi-specific antibodies; and
--+------------------------------------


· | Form part of a radiopharmaceutical therapeutic.
--+------------------------------------------------



Prior to our bankruptcy, we were conducting a Phase 1/2 trial of ifabotuzumab in multiple hematologic malignancies.  The most common adverse event attributed to ifabotuzumab in our previous trial was infusion reactions (chills, fever, nausea, hypertension, and rapid heart rate) which is an expected safety finding based on the mechanism of action. The majority of infusion reactions were mild-to-moderate in severity and resolved with temporary stoppage of infusion and/or use of medications to treat symptoms. In 2014, we completed the Phase 1 dose escalation portion of our study, primarily treating patients with AML as well as patients with MDS and myelofibrosis.  We suspended enrollment in that study due to the bankruptcy filing in December 2015.
 
Our Humaneered Technology
 
Our proprietary and patented Humaneered technology platform is a method for converting existing antibodies (typically murine) into engineered, high‑affinity human antibodies designed for therapeutic use, particularly for chronic conditions.  We have developed or in‑licensed targets or research (mouse) antibodies, typically from academic institutions, and then applied our Humaneered technology to them. Lenzilumab and ifabotuzumab are both Humaneered antibodies or antibody fragments. Together, our Humaneered antibodies have been tested clinically in more than 200 patients with no evidence of serious immunogenicity. We believe our Humaneered antibodies are closer to human antibodies than chimeric or conventionally humanized antibodies, are prone to being rejected less and may bind better to the target. Specifically, our Humaneered technology generates an antibody from an existing antibody with the required specificity as a starting point and, we believe, provides the following:

· | retention of identical target epitope specificity of the starting antibody and frequent generation of higher affinity antibodies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | very-near-to-human germ line sequence, which we believe means our Humaneered antibodies are less likely to induce an inappropriate immune response in broad patient populations when used chronically than chimeric or conventionally humanized antibodies, which has proven to be the case in clinical studies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 10
 


 
· | antibodies with physiochemical properties that facilitate process development and formulation (lack of aggregation at high concentration);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | high solubility;
--+-----------------


· | high antibody expression yields; and
--+-------------------------------------


· | an optimized antibody processing time of three to six months.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------



In March 2007, we granted Novartis a non-exclusive license to our proprietary Humaneered technology after applying this technology to several antibodies for them. Under the license agreement, Novartis is able to develop antibodies to create its own therapeutics. In each case, we demonstrated the robustness and versatility of the technology by creating Humaneered antibodies with increased affinity. As we are focused on progressing our current portfolio of antibodies through clinical development and out-licensing, we are not currently dedicating additional resources to the research of additional Humaneered antibodies.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Licensing and Collaborations
 
Savant Agreement
 
On June 30, 2016, we entered into an Agreement for the Manufacture, Development and Commercialization of Benznidazole for Human Use, or the MDC Agreement, with Savant, pursuant to which we acquired certain worldwide rights relating to benznidazole, including certain regulatory and non-intellectual property assets related to benznidazole , any product containing benznidazole and an exclusive license for certain intellectual property assets, including know-how and processes, relating to benznidazole. Savant retains the right to use the licensed intellectual property for veterinary uses. The MDC Agreement provides that we may jointly conduct development activities with Savant with respect to any product containing benznidazole, while we will be solely responsible for commercializing the product. As described above, we are no longer performing any work in respect of benznidazole.
 
As required by the MDC Agreement, we made payments to Savant totaling $2.7 million, consisting of the remaining portion of an initial payment (excluding a previously paid deposit of $0.5 million) in the amount of $2.5 million, an initial monthly joint development program cost payment of $0.1 million, and reimbursement of $0.1 million of Savant’s legal fees. The MDC Agreement provided for regulatory and other milestone payments of up to $21 million if we received approval from FDA and from other non-US regulatory agencies and certain other contingent payments.  Additionally, we would pay Savant royalties in the mid-teens on any net sales of any benznidazole product on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, which royalty will be reduced to the high single digits in the United States if a PRV was not granted subsequent to regulatory approval of any benznidazole product.  The MDC Agreement also provided that Savant is entitled to a portion of the amount we would receive upon the sale, if any, of a PRV regarding any benznidazole product. In addition, we also entered into a security agreement pursuant to which we granted Savant a continuing senior security interest in the assets and rights acquired by us pursuant to the MDC Agreement and certain future assets developed from those acquired assets.  On August 29, 2017 we ceased development for benznidazole and do not anticipate further obligations under the MDC.
 
In July 2017, we commenced litigation against Savant alleging that Savant breached the MDC Agreement and seeking a declaratory judgement.  Savant has asserted counterclaims for breaches of contract under the MDC Agreement and the Security Agreement.  The dispute primarily concerns our right under the MDC Agreement to offset certain costs incurred by us in excess of the agreed upon budget against payments due Savant.  The aggregate cost overages as of December 31, 2017 that we assert are Savant’s responsibility total approximately $3.4 million, net of a $0.5 million deductible.  We assert that we are entitled to offset $2 million in milestone payments due Savant against the cost overages, such that as of December 31, 2017, Savant owed us approximately $1.4 million in cost overages.

The Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research
 
In May 2004, we entered into a license agreement with the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, or LICR, pursuant to which LICR granted to us an exclusive license under intellectual property rights and materials related to chimeric anti-GM-CSF antibodies that formed the basis for the lenzilumab development program. Under the agreement, we were granted an exclusive license to develop antibodies related to LICR’s antibodies against GM-CSF. We are responsible for using commercially reasonable efforts to research, develop, and sell lenzilumab. We pay LICR a quarterly license fee and are obligated to pay to LICR a royalty from 1.5% to 3% of net sales of licensed products, subject to certain potential offsets and deductions. Our royalty obligation applies on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis, and will begin on the first commercial sale of a licensed product in a given country and end on the later of the expiration of the last to expire patent covering a licensed product in a given country (which in the United States, is currently expected in 2024) or 10 years from first commercial sale of such licensed product in the country. We must also pay to LICR a certain percentage of sublicensing revenue received by us. Aggregate payments made to LICR under this license through December 31, 2017 amounted to $1.7 million.
Other Material License Agreements
 
Novartis
 
In April 2007, we entered into an agreement with Novartis granting a non-exclusive license to our proprietary Humaneered technology for use at Novartis’ research sites to develop human antibodies for therapeutic indications. Under the agreement, Novartis was excluded from using the technology against certain targets until March 2012. In accordance with the terms of the agreement, Novartis paid us $30 million and we transferred the know‑how related to making Humaneered antibodies to enable Novartis to internally make its own antibodies. This agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of the last to expire licensed patent, which is currently expected to expire in 2025 in the United States.
 
LICR and ifabotuzumab
 
In 2006, we entered into a license agreement with LICR pursuant to which LICR granted to us certain exclusive rights to the ifabotuzumab prototype and EphA3-related intellectual property. Under the agreement, we obtained rights to develop and commercialize products made through use of licensed patents and any improvements thereto, including human or Humaneered antibodies that bind to or modulate EphA3. We paid LICR an upfront option fee of $0.05 million and a further $0.05 million upon our exercise of the option for the exclusive license outlined above. We are responsible for contingent milestone payments of less than $2.5 million and royalties of 3% of net sales subject to certain potential offsets and deductions. In addition, we are obligated to pay to LICR a percentage of certain payments we receive from any sublicensee in consideration for a sublicense. Our royalty obligation exists on a country‑by‑country and licensed product‑by‑licensed product basis, which will begin on the first commercial sale and end on the later of the expiration of the last to expire patent covering such licensed product in such country, which in the United States is currently expected in 2031, or 10 years from first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. Aggregate payments made to LICR under this license through December 31, 2017 amounted to $0.6 million.
 
BioWa and Lonza
 
In October 2010, we entered into a license agreement with BioWa, Inc., or BioWa, and Lonza Sales AG, or Lonza, pursuant to which BioWa and Lonza granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-bearing, sub-licensable license under certain know-how and patents related to antibody expression and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity enhancing technology using BioWa and Lonza’s Potelligent® CHOK1SV technology.  This technology is used to enhance the cell killing capabilities of antibodies and is currently used by us in connection with our development of ifabotuzumab. Under this agreement, we owe annual license fees, milestone payments in connection with certain regulatory and sales milestones and royalties in the low single digits on net sales of products developed under the agreement. The agreement expires upon the expiration of royalty payment obligations under the agreement, is terminable at will by us upon written notice, is terminable by BioWa and Lonza if we challenge or otherwise oppose any licensed patents under the agreement, and is terminable by either party upon the occurrence of an uncured material breach or insolvency. Three of the United States patents that we license from BioWa, Inc. are the subject of ongoing litigation in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, in which BioWa alleges infringement of its patents.  The defendant in that case has asserted, among its counterclaims, that the patents are invalid. The defendants also petitioned the United States Patent and Trademark Office for inter partes review on the validity of the same three patents, but that request has been denied. The litigation continues with a trial set to begin in June 2018.

Patents and Trade Secrets
 
We use a combination of patent, trade secret and other intellectual property protections to protect our product candidates. We will be able to protect our product candidates from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent they are covered by valid and enforceable patents or to the extent our technology is effectively maintained as trade secrets. Patent and trade secrets are an important element of our business. Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain, maintain, defend and enforce patent rights for and to extend the life of patents covering lenzilumab and ifabotuzumab and our Humaneered technology, to preserve trade secrets and proprietary know how, and to operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We actively seek patent protection, if available, in the United States and select foreign countries for the technology we develop. We have 60 registered patents, including 18 registered in the U.S. and 42 registered in foreign countries. Of the 60 registered patents, 41 are owned by us, 5 are owned jointly with a third party, and 17 are exclusively licensed from a third party.  We also have 17 patent applications pending globally.
 
Using our Humaneered technology, we developed and own a composition of matter patent covering lenzilumab and related anti-GM CSF antibodies that provide patent protection through April 2029 and have additional pending patents in the United States and a number of foreign countries covering various methods of treatment, including in the CAR-T space. We also have current and pending patent applications in the United States and selected foreign countries for anti-EphA3 antibodies and their use, and we developed and own an issued U.S. composition of matter patent covering ifabotuzumab and related anti-EphA3 antibodies, which is currently expected to expire in 2030. The patents to our Humaneered technology cover methods of producing human antibodies that are very specific for target antigens using only a small region from mouse antibodies.
 
We cannot be certain that any of our pending patent applications, or those of our licensors, will result in issued patents. In addition, because the patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions, the patents we own and license, or any further patents we may own or license, may not prevent other companies from developing similar or therapeutically equivalent products.  Patents also will not protect our products if competitors devise ways of making or using these products without legally infringing our patents.  In recent years, several companies have been extremely aggressive in challenging patents covering pharmaceutical products, and the challenges have often been successful. We cannot be assured that our patents will not be challenged by third parties or that we will be successful in any defense we undertake. Failure to successfully defend a patent challenge could materially and adversely affect our business.
 
In addition, changes in patent laws, rules or regulations or in their interpretations by the courts may materially diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
 
We also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors to execute non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements and our employees to execute assignment of invention agreements to us on commencement of their employment. Agreements with our employees also prevent them from bringing any proprietary rights of third parties to us. We also require confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials.

Research and Development
 
We have previously dedicated a significant portion of our resources to our efforts to develop our product candidates, particularly lenzilumab and our former lead product candidate, benznidazole.  We incurred research and development expenses of $11.2 million and $10.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  We anticipate that a significant portion of our operating expenses will continue to be related to clinical development in 2018 as we focus on the development of lenzilumab and ifabotuzumab. We do not currently plan to devote significant or any resources to pure research activities.
Manufacturing
 
We outsource basic development activities, including the development of formulation prototypes, and have adopted a manufacturing strategy of contracting with third parties for the manufacture of drug substance and product. Additional contract manufacturers are used to fill, label, package, and distribute investigational drug products. This allows us to maintain a more flexible infrastructure while focusing our expertise on developing our products.
Sales and Marketing
 
 We do not currently have the sales and marketing infrastructure in place that would be necessary to sell and market products. As our drug candidates progress, while we may build the infrastructure that would be needed to successfully market and sell any successful drug candidate on our own, we currently anticipate seeking strategic alliances and partnerships with third parties.  The establishment of a sales and marketing operation can be expensive, complicated and time consuming and could delay any product candidate launch.
Competition
 
We compete in an industry characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, a changing regulatory and legislative landscape and a strong emphasis on the benefits of intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivities. Our competitors include pharmaceutical companies, other biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other private and public research organizations. We compete with these parties for therapies for neglected and rare diseases and in recruiting highly qualified personnel. Our product candidates, if successfully developed and approved, may compete with established therapies, with new treatments that may be introduced by our competitors, including competitors relying to a large extent on our drug approvals or on our biologics approvals, or with generic copies of our product approved by FDA under an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, referencing our drug products. Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater scientific, research, and product development capabilities, as well as greater financial, marketing, sales and human resources capabilities than we do.
 
In addition, many specialized biotechnology firms have formed collaborations with large, established companies to support the research, development and commercialization of products that may be competitive with ours. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful with respect to their products than we may be in developing, commercializing, and achieving widespread market acceptance for our products.  In addition, our competitors’ products may be more effective or more effectively marketed and sold than any treatment we or our development partners may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses related to developing and supporting the commercialization of any of our product candidates.  Developments by competitors may render our product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive. After one of our product candidates is approved, FDA may also approve a generic version with the same dosage form, safety, strength, route of administration, quality, performance characteristics and intended use as our product. These generic equivalents would be less costly to bring to market and could generally be offered at lower prices, thereby limiting our ability to gain or retain market share.
 
The acquisition or licensing of pharmaceutical products is also very competitive, and a number of more established companies, which have acknowledged strategies to in-license or acquire products, may have competitive advantages as may other emerging companies taking similar or different approaches to product acquisitions.  The more established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash flows, institutional experience and historical corporate reputation.

Lenzilumab and CAR-T-related toxicities competition
  
 Two significant ongoing concerns for clinicians and FDA regarding CAR-T therapy are neurologic toxicity (NT) and CRS. Both Kymriah and Yescarta carry black box warnings in their labels for NT and CRS.
 
There are no approved therapies for the prevention of CAR-T-induced NT and CRS. The CAR-T-cell-therapy-associated TOXicity (CARTOX) Working Group of the FDA currently recommends intensive monitoring, accurate grading and aggressive supportive care, with anti-IL-6 therapy (Genentech’s Actemra, tocilizumab, IL-6-receptor monoclonal antibody that blocks IL-6) and/or corticosteroids. These treatments are reserved for severe cases of CRS to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with CAR-T cell therapy.  Since corticosteroids suppress T-cell function and/or induce T-cell apoptosis, they limit the effectiveness of CAR-T cell therapy; thus use of corticosteroids is limited to only severe cases of CRS refractory to Actemra and severe cases of NT without concurrent CRS. Actemra has been found to be not effective in the prevention or management of CAR-T-induced NT.  In fact, serum IL-6 levels have been shown to increase shortly after administration of Actemra which may increase passive diffusion of IL-6 into the CNS and thereby may increase the risk of NT.
 
FDA approval of Actemra, with or without high dose corticosteroids, for the management of severe cases of CRS was announced in conjunction with approval of Kymriah solely as part of its Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program based on a retrospective analysis of 45 patients across CAR-T clinical trials despite the lack of an IND, NDA or conduct of a prospective trial of Actemra in this setting. Tocilizumab is not approved for the prevention of CRS nor for the prevention or treatment of NT.  Tocilizumab is also not approved for the treatment of mild or moderate cases of CRS.
 
There are no alternative options, to our knowledge, in clinical stage development at this time for the prevention or management of these CAR-T-induced toxicities.  Several experimental approaches are in development in an effort to bring forward next-generation, potentially safer CAR constructs, including introducing suicide genes into CAR-T cells using herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) or inducible caspase-9 (iCasp9) genes with “ON / OFF” switches, RNA-guided DNA targeting technology such as CRISPR/Cas9 system or other epitope-based / gene-editing technology. However, these are all still in early stage development.
 
Lenzilumab and CMML/JMML Competition
 
Stem cell transplant is the only current way to treat and potentially cure patients with CMML or JMML. Typically, adult patients with CMML who are unsuitable for stem cell transplants are frequently treated with injectable formulations of Celgene’s Vidaza® (azacitidine) or Otsuka America Pharmaceutical’s Dacogen® (decitabine), both of which are available as generic formulations.  Given the potential of lenzilumab to also improve constitutional symptoms of patients with CMML or JMML, combination therapy with azacitidine or decitabine may be warranted.  Some patients with high white blood cell counts are treated with hydroxyurea, which was introduced in the 1960s and is available in generic formulations and under the brand names Droxia® and Hydrea®.  There are also several compounds in various stages of development for the treatment of CMML alone or in combination with azacitidine or decitabine, including Celgene’s CC-486 (oral azacitidine) and Revlimid® (lenalidomide), Novartis and Glaxosmithkline’s Promacta® (eltrombopag), Novartis’ Farydak® (panobinostat), Astex Pharmaceutical’s ASTX727, Incyte Corporation and Novartis’ Jafaki® (ruxolitinib), Millenium Pharmaceuticals’s pevonedistat, Stemline Therapeutics’ SL-401 and Kura Oncology’s tipifarnib, amongst others.
 
Ifabotuzumab Competition
 
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain cancer.  Standard treatment involves surgical resection, followed by radiation and temozolomide chemotherapy. Avastin®, lomustine and carmustine are also used to treat recurrent brain cancer. Numerous drugs are under development for GBM and other brain tumors. Therapy is rarely curative due to the infiltrative nature of these tumors and their resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. Immunotherapy with genetically modified T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) targeting interleukin IL-13Rα2, epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII), or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) has shown promise for the treatment of gliomas in preclinical models. But targeting IL-13Rα2 and EGFRvIII is associated with the development of antigen loss variants.

Government Regulation
 
Drug Development and Approval in the U.S.
 
As a biopharmaceutical company operating in the United States, we are subject to extensive regulation by FDA and by other federal, state, and local regulatory agencies. FDA regulates our products under the United States Federal Food and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and their implementing regulations. Under the FDCA, new drugs marketed in the United States generally must be FDA-approved under an NDA. Under the PHSA, an FDA-approved BLA is required to market a biological product, or biologic, in the United States. These laws and regulations set forth, among other things, requirements for preclinical and clinical testing, development, approval, labeling, manufacture, storage, record keeping, reporting, distribution, import, export, advertising, and promotion of our products and product candidates.
Applications Relying on the Applicant’s Clinical Data
 
The approval process for a full NDA under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA, containing full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness for the product, and BLAs under the PHSA require the conduct of extensive studies and the submission of large amounts of data by the applicant. The drug development process for these applications will generally include the following phases:
Preclinical Testing.  Before testing any compound in human subjects in the United States, a company must generate extensive preclinical data. Preclinical testing generally includes laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as toxicological and pharmacological studies in several animal species to assess the quality and safety of the product. Animal studies must be performed in compliance with FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations and the United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act.
 
IND Application.  Human clinical trials in the United States cannot commence until an IND application is submitted and becomes effective. A company must submit preclinical testing results to FDA as part of the IND, and FDA must evaluate whether there is an adequate basis for testing the drug in initial clinical studies in human volunteers. Unless FDA raises concerns, the IND becomes effective 30 days following its receipt by FDA. Once human clinical trials have commenced, FDA may stop the clinical trials by placing them on “clinical hold” because of concerns about the safety of the product being tested, or for other reasons.
 
Clinical Trials.  Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug to healthy human volunteers or to patients, under the supervision of a qualified investigator. The conduct of clinical trials is subject to extensive regulation, including compliance with FDA’s bioresearch monitoring regulations and Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements, which establish standards for conducting, recording data from, and reporting the results of clinical trials. GCP requirements are intended to assure that the data and reported results are credible and accurate, and that the rights, safety, and well-being of study participants are protected.
 
Clinical trials must be conducted under protocols that detail the study objectives, parameters for monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria, if any, to be evaluated. Each protocol is submitted to FDA as part of the IND. In addition, each clinical trial must be reviewed, approved, and conducted under the auspices of an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, at the institution conducting the clinical trial. Companies sponsoring the clinical trials, investigators, and IRBs also must comply with regulations and guidelines for obtaining informed consent from the study subjects, complying with the protocol and investigational plan, adequately monitoring the clinical trial, and timely reporting of adverse events.  Foreign studies conducted under an IND must meet the same requirements that apply to studies being conducted in the United States.  Data from a foreign study not conducted under an IND may be submitted in support of an NDA or BLA if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP and FDA is able to validate the data. A study sponsor is required to publicly post certain details about active clinical trials and clinical trial results on the government website clinicaltrials.gov.

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap with one another:
 
 
· | Phase 1 clinical trials include the initial administration of the investigational drug to humans, typically to a small group of healthy human subjects, but occasionally to a group of patients with the targeted disease or disorder. Phase 1 clinical trials generally are intended to determine the metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2 clinical trials generally are controlled studies that involve a relatively small sample of the intended patient population, and are designed to develop data regarding the product’s effectiveness, to determine dose response and the optimal dose range, and to gather additional information relating to safety and potential adverse effects.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 3 clinical trials are conducted after preliminary evidence of effectiveness has been obtained and are intended to gather additional information about safety and effectiveness necessary to evaluate the drug’s overall risk-benefit profile, and to provide a basis for physician labeling. Generally, Phase 3 clinical development programs consist of expanded, large-scale studies of patients with the target disease or disorder to obtain statistical evidence of the efficacy and safety of the drug at the proposed dosing regimen, or with the safety, purity, and potency of a biological product. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The sponsoring company, FDA, or the IRB may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Further, success in early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials.  Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be subject to alternative interpretations that could delay, limit, or prevent regulatory approval.
 
NDA/BLA Submission and Review
 
After completing clinical testing of an investigational drug or biologic product, a sponsor must prepare and submit an NDA or BLA for review and approval by FDA. NDAs and BLAs are comprehensive, multi-volume applications that include, among other things, the results of preclinical and clinical studies, information about the product’s composition, and the sponsor’s plans for manufacturing, packaging, and labeling the product.  When an NDA or BLA is submitted, FDA conducts a preliminary review to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to be accepted for filing. If it is not, FDA may refuse to file the application and may request additional information, in which case the application must be resubmitted with the supplemental information and review of the application is delayed.
 
FDA performance goals, which are target dates and other aspirational measures of agency performance to which the agency, Congressional representatives, and industry agree through negotiations that occur every five years, generally provide for action on NDA and BLA applications within 10 months of submission or 10 months from acceptance for filing for an NDA involving a new molecular entity or for an original BLA.  FDA is not expected to meet those target dates for all applications, however, and the deadline may be extended in certain circumstances, such as when the applicant submits new data late in the review period.  In practice, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. In some circumstances, FDA can expedite the review of new drugs and biologics deemed to qualify for priority review, such as those intended to treat serious or life threatening conditions that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs.  In those cases, the targeted action date is six months from submission, or for drugs constituting new molecular entities and biologics constituting original biological products, six months from the date that FDA accepts the application for filing.
 
 17
 


As part of its review, FDA may refer an NDA or BLA to an advisory committee for evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. Although FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, the agency usually has followed such recommendations. FDA may also determine that a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to ensure that the benefits of a new product outweigh its risks, and that the product can therefore be approved. A REMS may include various elements, ranging from a medication guide or patient package insert to limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, depending on what FDA considers necessary for the safe use of the drug. Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, NDAs and BLAs must include an assessment, generally based on clinical study data, of the safety and effectiveness of the subject drug or biological product in relevant pediatric populations, unless the requirement is waived or deferred. Receiving orphan drug designation from FDA is one situation where such a requirement may be waived.
 
After review of an NDA or BLA, FDA may determine that the product cannot be approved, or may determine that it can only be approved if the applicant cures deficiencies in the application, in which case the agency endeavors to provide the applicant with a complete list of the deficiencies in correspondence known as a Complete Response Letter, or CRL. A CRL may request additional information, including additional preclinical or clinical data. Even if such additional information and data are submitted, FDA may decide that the NDA still does not meet the standards for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and FDA may interpret data differently than the sponsor interprets them. Additionally, as a condition of approval, FDA may impose restrictions that could affect the commercial success of a drug or require post-approval commitments, including the completion within a specified time period of additional clinical studies, which often are referred to as “Phase 4” studies or “post-marketing requirements.” Obtaining regulatory approval often takes a number of years, involves the expenditure of substantial resources, and depends on a number of factors, including the severity of the disease in question, the availability of alternative treatments, and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials.
 
Post-approval modifications to the drug or biologic product, such as changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require a sponsor to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical or clinical trials. The proposed changes would need to be submitted in a new or supplemental NDA or BLA, which would then require FDA approval.
 
Regulatory Exclusivities
 
Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act
 
In 2010, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA, was enacted, creating an abbreviated approval pathway for biologic products that are biosimilar to, and possibly interchangeable with, reference biological products licensed under a BLA. The BPCIA also provides innovator manufacturers of original reference biological products 12 years of exclusive use before biosimilar versions can be licensed in the United States. This means that FDA may not approve an application for a biosimilar version of a reference biological product until 12 years after the date of approval of the reference biological product (with a potential six-month extension of exclusivity if certain pediatric studies are conducted and the results reported to FDA), although a biosimilar application may be submitted four years after the date of licensure of the reference biological product. Additionally, the BPCIA establishes procedures by which the biosimilar applicant must provide information about its application and product to the reference product sponsor, and by which information about potentially relevant patents is shared and litigation over patents may proceed in advance of approval, although the interpretation of those procedures has been subject to litigation and appears to continue to evolve. The BPCIA also provides a period of exclusivity for the first biosimilar to be determined by FDA to be interchangeable with the reference product.
 
FDA approved the first biosimilar product under the BPCIA in 2015, and the agency continues to refine the procedures and standards it will apply in implementing this approval pathway. FDA has released guidance documents interpreting specific aspects of the BPCIA in each of the last four years.
 
 18
 


Orphan Drug Designation
 
The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of drugs and biological products intended to treat rare diseases or conditions.  Rare diseases and conditions generally are those affecting less than 200,000 individuals in the United States, but also include diseases or conditions affecting more than 200,000 individuals in the United States if there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States of such drug.
 
 If a sponsor demonstrates that a drug, including a biological product, is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, and meets certain other criteria, FDA grants orphan drug designation to the drug for that use.  FDA may grant multiple orphan designations for the same drug for the same indication being developed by multiple different companies, until that drug is approved.  The first drug approved with an orphan drug designated indication is granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity for that indication. During that period, FDA generally may not approve any other application for the same drug for the same indication, although there are exceptions, most notably when the later product is shown to be clinically superior to the product with exclusivity. FDA can also revoke a product’s orphan drug exclusivity under certain circumstances, including when the holder of the approved orphan drug application is unable to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet patient needs.
 
A sponsor of a product application that has received an orphan drug designation is also granted tax incentives for clinical research undertaken to support the application. In addition, FDA will typically coordinate with the sponsor on research study design for an orphan drug and may exercise its discretion to grant marketing approval on the basis of more limited product safety and efficacy data than would ordinarily be required, based on the limited size of the applicable patient population.
 
Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions
 
FDA has implemented a number of expedited programs to help ensure that therapies for serious or life-threatening conditions, and for which there is unmet medical need, are approved and available to patients as soon as it can be concluded that the therapies’ benefits justify their risks. Among these programs are the following:
Fast Track Designation
 
FDA may designate a product for fast track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and where non-clinical or clinical data demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical need for such a disease or condition. A product can also receive fast track review if it is designated as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product, or QIDP, or receives breakthrough therapy designation.
 
For fast track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with FDA and FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product’s NDA before the application is complete, also referred to as a ‘rolling review’. This rolling review may be available if FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a fast track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. Furthermore, FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the complete NDA is submitted. Finally, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by FDA if FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 
Breakthrough Therapy Designation
 
A product may be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the features of fast track designation, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design efficient clinical trials.
 
 19
 


Accelerated Approval
 
Under the accelerated approval pathway, FDA may approve a drug or biologic based on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit; qualifying products must target a serious or life-threatening illness and provide meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments. In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by FDA.
Priority Review
 
FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a drug that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. FDA generally determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed drug represents a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting drug reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and will shorten FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from the standard ten months to a target of an accelerated six months.
 
Created in 2012 under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, and extended with the 21st Century Cures Act in 2016, FDA is authorized under section 529 of the FDCA to grant a PRV to NDA or BLA sponsors who receive approval for a product to treat a rare pediatric disease, defined as a disease that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., and where more than 50% of the patients affected are aged from birth to 18 years. We believe that lenzilumab or other future product candidates that we may develop or acquire may qualify for a PRV under this program.
 
The PRV program allows the voucher holder to obtain priority review for a product application that would otherwise not receive priority review, shortening FDA’s target review period to a targeted six months following acceptance of filing of the NDA, or four months shorter than the standard review period. The voucher may be used by the sponsor who receives it, or it may be sold to another sponsor for use in that sponsor’s own marketing application. The sponsor who uses the voucher is required to pay additional user fees on top of the standard user fee for reviewing an NDA or BLA.
 
 Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy Designation
 
Recently, through the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, Congress also established another expedited program, called a Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy, or RMAT, designation. The Cures Act directs the FDA to facilitate an efficient development program for and expedite review of RMATs. To qualify for this program, the product must be a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or a combination of such products, and not a product solely regulated as a human cell and tissue product. The product must be intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence must indicate that the product has the potential to address an unmet need for such disease or condition. Advantages of the RMAT designation include all the benefits of the Fast Track and breakthrough therapy designation programs, including early interactions with the FDA. These early interactions may be used to discuss potential surrogate or intermediate endpoints to support accelerated approval.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 6 full time equivalents performing various functions, including 4 full time employees, with the remainder consisting of consultants performing mainly regulatory and clinical development functions. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements.  We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.

Bankruptcy
 
In January 2015, shortly after announcing that our Phase 2 clinical trial of a former drug candidate had not met its primary or secondary endpoints, we implemented a cost reduction plan that primarily consisted of workforce reductions. On November 5, 2015, as part of a further effort to reduce operating costs, we announced a restructuring plan that would reduce our workforce and change the focus of our development programs. The restructuring plan provided that we would pursue strategic alternatives, such as our potential sale or a sale of our assets or further restructuring efforts. On November 13, 2015, we announced that after discussions of various strategic alternatives, we concluded that it was unlikely that a viable transaction could be reached within the timeframe allowed by our then-limited cash resources.
 
On November 18, 2015, an outside investor group acquired a majority of our outstanding shares and one of the investors was appointed our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. In December 2015, we issued and sold shares of common stock to investors in a private placement, whom we refer to as the PIPE Investors. Shortly thereafter, on December 17, 2015, our then-Chief Executive Officer and Chairman was arrested on charges of securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy and wire fraud conspiracy, unrelated to our Company. This individual was immediately terminated as our Chief Executive Officer and resigned from our board of directors. Three other directors and our Interim Chief Financial Officer resigned between December 17 and December 28, 2015. Our independent registered accounting firm also resigned on December 8, 2015. Finally, in December 2015, three putative class action lawsuits were filed against us and certain of the PIPE Investors threatened litigation against us for return of the funds they paid in the private placement.
 
As a result of these events and other challenges facing us at the time, on December 29, 2015, we filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The filing was made in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, or the Bankruptcy Court (Case No. 15-12628 (LSS)). During the pendency of our bankruptcy proceedings, we entered into a Debtor-in-Possession Credit and Security Agreement, or the Credit Agreement, with a group of lenders, or the DIP Lenders, pursuant to which we received $3 million for working capital, bankruptcy-related costs, costs related to our plan of reorganization, payment of certain fees to the lenders and other costs associated with the ordinary course of business. On April 1, 2016, we also entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement, or the SPA, with the DIP Lenders. The SPA provided for the sale of our common stock, with share amounts subject to calculation as provided in the SPA, in respect of exit financing in the amount of $11 million to be received upon the Effective Date of the Plan, as defined below. These transactions were approved by the Bankruptcy Court.
 
On May 9, 2016, we filed with the Bankruptcy Court a Second Amended Plan of Reorganization, or the Plan, and related amended disclosure statement pursuant to Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. On June 16, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the Plan.
 
On June 30, 2016 (the “Effective Date”), the Plan became effective and we emerged from our Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. In connection with the emergence, we entered into the MDC Agreement with Savant, pursuant to which we acquired certain worldwide rights relating to benznidazole. On the Effective Date, pursuant to the SPA and in repayment of our obligations under the Credit Agreement, we issued an aggregate of 9,497,515 shares of our common stock to the DIP Lenders. In accordance with the Plan, we also distributed cash payments and issued, or became obligated to issue, promissory notes and shares of our common stock to certain other parties.
 
Restructuring Transactions
 
On December 1, 2017, our obligations matured under the Credit and Security Agreement dated December 21, 2016, as amended on March 21, 2017 and on July 8, 2017 (the “Term Loan Credit Agreement”) with Black Horse Capital Master Fund Ltd., as administrative agent and lender (“BHCMF”), Black Horse Capital LP, as a lender (“BHC”), Cheval Holdings, Ltd., as a lender (“Cheval” and collectively with BHCMF and BHC, the “Black Horse Entities”) and Nomis Bay LTD, as a lender (“Nomis” and, together with the Black Horse Entities, the “Term Loan Lenders”).

On December 21, 2017, we entered into a Securities Purchase and Loan Satisfaction Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) and a Forbearance and Loan Modification Agreement (the “Forbearance Agreement” and, together with the Purchase Agreement, the “Restructuring Agreements”), each with the Term Loan Lenders, in connection with a series of transactions providing for, among other things, the satisfaction and extinguishment of our outstanding obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and the infusion of $3.0 million of new capital. As of February 27, 2018, the date the Restructuring Transactions were completed, the aggregate amount of our obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, including the Bridge Loan, the Claims Advances extended by Nomis Bay (each as discussed below) and all accrued interest and fees, approximated $18.4 million (the “Term Loans”).
 
On February 27, 2018 (the “Restructuring Effective Date”), the Restructuring Transactions were completed in accordance with the Restructuring Agreements. As a result, on the Restructuring Effective Date, we: (i) in exchange for the satisfaction and extinguishment of the entire $18.4 million balance of the Term Loans, including the Bridge Loan, the Claims Advances extended by Nomis Bay (each as discussed below) and all accrued interest and fees, (a) issued to the Term Loan Lenders an aggregate of 59,786,848 shares of our common stock (the “New Lender Shares”), and (b) transferred and assigned to an entity owned 70% by Nomis Bay and 30% by us (the “JV Entity”), all of our assets related to benznidazole (the “Benz Assets”), our former drug candidate, capable of being so assigned; and (ii) issued to Cheval an aggregate of 32,028,669 shares of our common stock (the “New Black Horse Shares” and, collectively with the New Lender Shares, the “New Common Shares”) for total consideration of $3.0 million (collectively, the “Restructuring Transactions”), $1.5 million of which we received on December 22, 2017 in the form of a bridge loan (the “Bridge Loan”).
 
On the Restructuring Effective Date, the aggregate amount of the Term Loans that were deemed to be satisfied and extinguished (i) previously owed to the Black Horse Entities, including the Bridge Loan and all accrued interest and fees, approximated $9.9 million, and (ii) previously owed to Nomis Bay, including certain advances previously extended to us by Nomis Bay totaling $0.1 million (the “Claims Advances”) and all accrued interest and fees, approximated $8.5 million. In addition, on the Restructuring Effective Date, (i) each of the Term Loan Credit Agreement, all promissory notes issued thereunder and the Intellectual Property Security Agreement, dated as of December 21, 2016, by and between us and the Term Loan Lenders, were terminated and are of no further force or effect, and (ii) and all security interests of the Black Horse Entities and Nomis Bay in our assets were released. Although the Term Loans were satisfied and extinguished, if the JV Entity (at the election of Nomis Bay) elects to keep the Benz Assets after the Restructuring Effective Date, Nomis Bay will be obligated to pay or cause the JV Entity to pay $0.3 million in legal fees and expenses owed by us to our litigation counsel, which remain unpaid in our Accounts payable.
 
Upon completion of the Restructuring Transactions, Nomis Bay held 33,573,530 of our common stock, or approximately 31.4% of our outstanding common stock, and the Black Horse Entities collectively held 66,870,851 shares of our common stock, or approximately 62.6% of our outstanding common stock.  Accordingly, the completion of the Restructuring Transactions on the Restructuring Effective Date resulted in a change in control of our company, as the Black Horse Entities and their affiliates owning more than a majority of our outstanding common stock. Dr. Dale Chappell, a member of our board of directors from June 30, 2016 until November 10, 2017, controls the Black Horse Entities and accordingly, will be able to exert control over matters of our company and will be able to determine all matters of our company requiring stockholder approval.
