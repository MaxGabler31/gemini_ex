The following is a description of our business as of December 31, 2021.
OUR SEGMENTS
Wholesale Footwear
Our Wholesale Footwear segment designs, sources and markets our brands and sells our products to department stores, mass merchants, off-price retailers, shoe chains, online retailers, national chains, specialty retailers and independent stores throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe, South Africa, and through our joint ventures and international distributor network. Our Wholesale Footwear business consists of fashion-forward footwear for women, men, and children. Our products are designed and marketed for various lifestyles and include dress shoes, boots, booties, fashion sneakers, sandals and casual shoes. The Wholesale Footwear segment primarily consists of the following brands: Steve Madden®, Steven by Steve Madden®, Madden Girl®, BB Dakota®, Dolce Vita®, DV Dolce Vita®, Betsey Johnson®, GREATS®, Blondo®, Anne Klein®, Mad Love®, Superga, COOL Planet® and Madden NYC™. This segment also includes our private label footwear business. This segment represented 54.8% of total revenue during 2021.
Wholesale Accessories/Apparel
Our Wholesale Accessories/Apparel segment designs, sources and markets our brands and sells our products to department stores, mass merchants, off-price retailers, online retailers, specialty retailers and independent stores throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe, South Africa, and through our joint ventures and international distributor network. Our Wholesale Accessories/Apparel business primarily consists of handbags, apparel, small leather goods, belts, soft accessories, fashion scarves, wraps, gifting and other trend accessories. The Wholesale Accessories/Apparel segment primarily consists of the following brands: Steve Madden®, BB Dakota®, Anne Klein®, Betsey Johnson®, Cejon®, Madden NYC™ and Dolce Vita®. This segment also includes our private label handbag and accessories business. The agreement under which we licensed the Cupcakes & Cashmere® trademark terminated in April 2021. This segment represented 18.4% of total revenue during 2021.
Direct-to-Consumer
Our Direct-to-Consumer segment, which was referred to as the Retail segment in previous filings, consists of Steve Madden® and Superga® full-price retail stores, Steve Madden® outlet stores, Steve Madden® shop-in-shops and directly-operated digital e-commerce websites. Our retail stores are located in regional malls and shopping centers, as well as high streets in major cities across the United States, Canada, Mexico, South Africa, Israel, Taiwan and China. Our stores play an important role in our test-and-react and omnichannel strategy, and also serve as fulfillment and return locations for our e-commerce business. Our stores also serve as a marketing tool that allows us to strengthen global brand recognition and to showcase selected items from our full line of branded and licensed products. In addition to these testing and marketing benefits, we have also been able to leverage sales information gathered at Steve Madden retail stores and our websites to assist our wholesale customers in their order placement and inventory management. We believe that our retail stores, and websites, enhance overall sales and profitability, and our ability to react quickly to changing consumer demands. 
In 2021, we added eight brick-and-mortar stores and closed five brick-and-mortar stores, and one e-commerce website. As of December 31, 2021, we operated 214 brick-and-mortar retail stores, including 147 Steve Madden full-price stores, 66 Steve Madden outlet stores and one Superga store, as well as six e-commerce websites. In addition, during 2021, we closed one concession in Taiwan and opened one concession in China, ending the year with 17 company-operated concessions in international markets. In fiscal year 2022, we expect to open 10 to 12 new brick-and-mortar retail stores in international markets and close three to six locations globally.
In addition to our stores, our Direct-to-Consumer business offers products online through our Steve Madden e-commerce sites in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe, Israel, South Africa and Asia as well as our six e-commerce sites, which include: www.SteveMadden.com, www.DolceVita.com www.betseyjohnson.com, www.Blondo.com, www.GREATS.com and www.Superga-USA.com.
This segment represented 26.1% of total revenue during 2021.
First Cost
Our First Cost segment represents activities of one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries that earns commissions for serving as a buying agent for footwear products under private labels for select national chains, specialty retailers and value-priced retailers. As a buying agent, we utilize our expertise and our relationships with shoe manufacturers to facilitate the production of private label shoes to customer specifications. We believe that operating in the private label market provides us additional non-branded sales opportunities and leverages our overall sourcing and design capabilities. In addition, by leveraging the strength of our Steve Madden brands and product designs, we are able to partially recover our design, product and development costs from our suppliers.
Licensing
Our Licensing segment is engaged in the licensing of the Steve Madden® and Madden Girl® trademarks for use in connection with the manufacturing, marketing and sale of select apparel categories, outerwear, hosiery, jewelry, hair accessories, watches, eyeglasses, sunglasses, umbrellas, bedding, luggage, fragrance and men’s leather accessories. We license the Betsey Johnson® trademark for use in connection with the manufacturing, marketing and sale of women's and children’s apparel, hosiery, swimwear, slippers, fragrance and beauty, sleepwear, activewear, medical scrubs, jewelry, watches, eyeglasses, sunglasses, bedding and bath, luggage, umbrellas and self-care bath and body products. Most of our license agreements require the licensee to pay us a royalty based on actual net sales, a minimum royalty in the event the specified net sales targets are not achieved and a percentage of sales for advertising the brand.
Corporate
Our Corporate activities do not constitute a reportable segment and include costs that are not directly attributable to the segments. These costs are primarily related to our corporate executives, corporate finance, corporate social responsibility, legal, human resources, information technology, cybersecurity and other shared costs.
For additional information on our segments, refer to Note T – Segment Information in the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.

PRODUCT DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
We have established a reputation for our creative designs, marketing and trend-right products at affordable price points. Our future success will substantially depend on our ability to continue to anticipate and react quickly to changing consumer demands. To meet this objective, we have developed what we believe is an unparalleled design team and process. Our design team strives to create designs that are true to our DNA, reflect current or anticipated trends and can be manufactured in a timely and cost-effective manner. Most new products are tested in select Steve Madden retail stores and on www.stevemadden.com. Based on these tests, among other things, management selects products that are then offered for wholesale and retail distribution worldwide. We believe that our design and testing processes combined with our flexible sourcing model provide our brands with a significant competitive advantage and allows us to mitigate the risk of incurring costs associated with the production and distribution of less desirable designs.
PRODUCT SOURCING AND DISTRIBUTION
We source each of our product lines separately based on the individual design, style and quality specifications of the products in such product lines. We do not own or operate any foreign manufacturing facilities; rather, we use agents and our own sourcing office to source our products from independently owned manufacturers primarily in China and also in Cambodia, Mexico, Brazil, Vietnam, India, Italy and other European nations. We have established relationships with a number of manufacturers and agents in each of these countries. We have not entered into any long-term manufacturing or supply contracts. We believe that a sufficient number of alternative sources exist for the manufacture of our products.
We continually monitor the availability of the principal raw materials used in our footwear, which are currently available from a number of sources in various parts of the world. We track inventory flow on a regular basis, monitor sell-through data and incorporate input on product demand from wholesale customers.
The manufacturers of our products are required to meet quality, human rights, safety and other standard requirements. We are committed to the safety and well-being of the workers throughout our supply chain.
Our products are manufactured overseas and most of our products are shipped via ocean freight carriers to ports principally to our third-party distribution facilities in California and to a lesser extent in New Jersey, and via truck from Mexico to our third-party distribution facility in Texas. We rely to a lesser extent on air carriers for the shipping of products. Once our products arrive in the U.S., we distribute them mainly from six third-party distribution centers, four located in California, one located in Texas, and one located in New Jersey. Our products are also distributed through a Company-operated distribution center located in Canada and through our third-party distribution facility in Mexico and Europe. By utilizing distribution facilities specializing in fulfillment for certain wholesale customers and Steve Madden retail stores we believe that our consumers are served more promptly and efficiently. Suppliers of products for our businesses in Canada, Mexico, Europe and South Africa, and our joint ventures in Israel, Taiwan and China ship to ports in the respective countries, and products for our overseas distributors are shipped to freight forwarders primarily in China and Mexico where the distributor arranges for subsequent shipment. See Item 1A “Risk Factors” below for a discussion of the risk of supply chain disruptions. 
DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS
We distribute our products principally through department stores, mass merchants, off-price retailers, shoe chains, online retailers, national chains and specialty retailers and independent stores in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe and other international markets. In addition, we sell our products in our Company-owned retail stores in the United States, Canada, Mexico and South Africa, under our joint ventures Israel, Taiwan and China, and on our e-commerce websites. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our two Wholesale segments and our Retail segment generated net sales of approximately $1,365,997 and $487,906, or 73% and 26% of our total revenue, respectively. Each of these distribution channels is described below.
Department Stores. We currently sell our products to approximately 4,500 doors of 15 department store retailers throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe and other select international markets. Our major accounts include Nordstrom, Inc., Macy's, Inc., and Dillard's, Inc. We provide merchandising support to our department store customers, including in-store fixtures and signage, supervision of displays and merchandising of our various product lines. Our wholesale merchandising effort includes the creation of in-store concept shops in which we showcase a broader collection of our branded 
products. These in-store concept shops create an environment that is consistent with our image and are designed to enable the retailer to display and sell a greater volume of our products per square foot. In addition, these in-store concept shops encourage longer term commitment by the retailer to our products and enhance consumer brand awareness.
In addition to merchandising support, our key account executives maintain weekly communications with their respective accounts to guide them in placing orders and to assist them in managing inventory, assortment and retail sales. We also leverage our sell-through data gathered at our retail stores to assist department stores in allocating their open-to-buy dollars to the most popular styles in the product line and phasing out styles with weaker sell-through, which, in turn, reduces markdown exposure at the end of the season.
Off-Price Retailers. We currently sell to off-price retailers throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe and other select international markets. Our major accounts include The TJX Companies, Inc., Ross Stores, Inc. and Burlington Stores, Inc.
Mass Merchants and National Chains. We currently sell to national chains and mass merchants throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico and other select international markets. Our major accounts include Walmart Inc., Target Corporation and Kohl's Corporation.
Shoe Chains/Specialty Retailers. We currently sell to shoe chains and specialty retailers throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe and other select international markets. Our major specialty store accounts include DSW Designer Brands, Famous Footwear and Shoe Carnival. We offer our shoe chain customers similar merchandising, sell-through and inventory tracking support offered to our department store customers.
Online Retailers. We currently sell to pure-play online retailers throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe and other select international markets. Our major accounts include Amazon.com, Inc., Zalando SE and ASOS.
E-Commerce Websites. We operate six e-commerce website stores (Steve Madden, Dolce Vita, Betsey Johnson, Blondo, GREATS and Superga,) where customers can purchase a variety of styles of our Steve Madden Women's, Steven, Madden Men's, Dolce Vita, Betsey Johnson, Blondo, GREATS and Superga products and BB Dakota x Steve Madden apparel, as well as select styles of Madden Girl and Steve Madden kids products. For additional information about our digital sales, refer to the above description of our Direct-to-Consumer segment.
Steve Madden and Superga Retail Stores. As of December 31, 2021, we operated 147 Steve Madden full-price stores within the United States, Canada, Mexico and South Africa and under our joint ventures in Israel, Taiwan and China. We also operated 66 Steve Madden outlet stores within the United States, Canada and Mexico and under our joint ventures in Israel and Taiwan as well as one Superga store in the United States. For additional information about our stores, refer to the description of our Direct-to- Consumer segment.
International Distributors. In addition to the countries and territories mentioned above, our products are available in many other countries and territories worldwide via retail selling and distribution agreements. Under the terms of these agreements, the distributors and retailers purchase product from us and are generally required to open a minimum number of stores each year and to pay a fee for each pair of footwear purchased and an additional sales royalty as a percentage of sales or a predetermined amount per unit of sale. Most of the distributors are required to purchase a minimum number of our products within specified periods. The agreements currently in place expire on various dates and include automatic renewals at the distributors' option provided certain conditions are met. These agreements are exclusive in their specific territories, which include certain European countries, the Middle East, South and Central America and various countries in Asia.
CUSTOMERS
Our wholesale customers consist principally of department stores, mass merchants, off-price retailers, online retailers, shoe chains, national chains, specialty retailers and independent stores. These customers, in no particular order, include: Nordstrom, Macy's, Dillard's, DSW, The TJX Companies, Ross Stores, Burlington Stores, Amazon.com, Walmart, Target and Kohls.. 
For the year ended December 31, 2021, two customers represented approximately 14.0% and 10.6% of total revenue. At December 31, 2020, two customers were 19.3% and 18.1% of total accounts receivable. The Company did not have any other customers who accounted for more than 10% of total revenue or any other customers who accounted for more than 10% of total accounts receivable.
COMPETITION
The fashion industry is highly competitive. We compete with specialty shoe, apparel and accessory companies as well as companies with diversified footwear product lines, such as Aldo, Sam Edelman, Dr. Martens and Vince Camuto. Our competitors may have greater financial and other resources than we do. We believe effective marketing and advertising, favorable brand image, fashionable styling, high quality, value and fast manufacturing turnaround are the most important competitive factors, and we intend to continue to employ these elements in our business. However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
MARKETING AND SALES 
We have focused on creating an integrated-brand building program to establish our Company as a leading designer of fashion footwear for style-conscious women, men and children. Principal marketing activities include social media and digital marketing efforts, influencer marketing, public relations, including product and brand placements in lifestyle and fashion magazines and digital outlets, in-store promotions, and events, as well as public and media appearances by our founder and Creative and Design Chief, Steven Madden. We continue to promote our e-commerce websites where customers can purchase Steve Madden®, Steven®, Dolce Vita®, Betsey, Johnson®, Blondo®, GREATS® and Superga® products and BB Dakota x Steve Madden® apparel, as well as select styles of Madden Girl® products. 
MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (MIS) OPERATIONS
Sophisticated information systems are essential to our ability to maintain our competitive position and to support our growth. Our Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system is an integrated system that supports our wholesale business in the areas of finance and accounting, manufacturing-sourcing, purchase order management, customer order management and inventory control. All of our North American wholesale businesses (other than Canada, which has a separate ERP system) and our Asia first cost and sourcing operations are operated through this ERP system. Our warehouse management system is utilized by the majority of our third-party logistics providers and is fully integrated with our ERP system. A point-of-sale system for our U.S. retail stores is integrated with a retail inventory management/store replenishment system. We have transitioned our e-commerce software to a major cloud-based provider. Complementing all of these systems are ancillary systems and third-party information processing services, including, among others, supply chain, business intelligence/data warehouse, Electronic Data Interchange, credit card processing and payroll. We undertake updates of all of these management information systems on a periodic basis in order to ensure that our functionality is continuously improved. In 2019, we invested $8.2 million in a new data and recovery center, with substantially all of the project completed in 2021.
TRADEMARKS 
Our strategy for the continued growth of our business includes expanding our presence beyond footwear, accessories and apparel through the selective licensing of our brands. We consider our Company-owned trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and have registered many of our marks in the United States and 149 other countries and in numerous International Classes. From time to time, we adopt new trademarks and new logos and/or stylized versions of our trademarks in connection with the marketing of new product lines. We believe that these trademarks have significant value and are important for purposes of identifying our Company, the marketing of our products and the products of our licensees, and distinguishing them from the products of others. 
Trademarks we believe to be most significant to our business include: Steve Madden®, Steven®, Madden Girl®, MaddenNYC®, Betsey Johnson®, LUV BETSEY by Betsey Johnson Design®, Dolce Vita®, DV®, DV Dolce Vita®, MadLove®, Blondo®, Blondo Waterproof plus Heart®, SM Pass®, COOL Planet®, BB Dakota® and GREATS®. We license our Steve Madden® and Madden Girl® trademarks for use in connection with the manufacture, marketing and sale of select apparel categories, outerwear, hosiery, jewelry, hair accessories, watches, eyeglasses, sunglasses, umbrellas, bedding, luggage, fragrance and men’s leather accessories. We license the Betsey Johnson® trademark for use in connection with the manufacture, marketing and sale of women's and children’s apparel, hosiery, swimwear, slippers, fragrance and beauty, sleepwear, activewear, medical scrubs, jewelry, watches, eyeglasses, sunglasses, bedding and bath, luggage, umbrellas and medical scrubs, self-care bath and body. Most of our license agreements require the licensee to pay us a royalty based on actual net sales, a minimum royalty in the event that specified net sales targets are not achieved and a percentage of sales for advertising the brand.
In addition to the licensing of our trademarks, we in-license the trademarks of third parties for use in connection with certain of our product lines. Generally, these licensing arrangements require us to make advertising payments to the licensor as 
well as royalty payments equal to a percentage of our net sales and/or a minimum royalty and in some cases additional payments in the event that specified net sales targets are not achieved. 
For additional information on our licensing arrangements, refer to Note B – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note P – Commitments, Contingencies and Other in the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.
HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES 
As of February 1, 2022, we employed approximately 3,500 employees globally, with approximately 2,100 of these employees located in the United States and 1400 located internationally. Of these employees, approximately 2,400 work full-time and approximately 1,100 work part-time. Most of our part-time employees work in the Direct-to-Consumer segment. None of our employees are represented by a union. Our management considers relations with our employees to be good. We have never experienced a material interruption of our operations due to a labor dispute. 
Culture 
Steve Madden is for the bold, expressive and ambitious. Our core values – authenticity, initiative, tenacity, humility and trust are key to our competitive edge and are embedded throughout all levels of our Company. They motivate our growth, inspire our innovation, define our culture and set the standard for all of our actions. 
•Authenticity: Show up to work as your true self 
•Initiative: Act upon good ideas quickly and be ready to iterate 
•Tenacity: Look at problems from all sides and be resourceful 
•Humility: Think from the perspective of others and always be open to learning
•Trust: Build strong relationships with good will and integrity
Career Development 
The fashion landscape is constantly shifting and evolving, which makes it especially important for us to invest in the ongoing career development of our employees. In service of this objective, we constantly seek out, promote and improve upon internal programs and processes that make it possible for employees to reach their full potential. Some examples of this focus include our ongoing professional development relationship with the University of Arizona Global Campus, our tuition reimbursement program, our internal employee learning opportunities, and external conference and workshop offerings around specific industry content as well as leadership, coaching, and management training in general. In addition, in 2021 we launched SM Learning Sessions, a monthly, company-wide training and development program where we invite internal and external content providers to present on various topics. Mentoring, annual performance evaluations and feedback are also key elements of our career development efforts at our Company. 
Diversity and Inclusion 
We believe that recruiting, employing and retaining people from all backgrounds, ethnicities, genders, lifestyles and belief systems have been the cornerstones of meeting the needs of our diverse consumer base and building a global business. By embracing a diverse and inclusive workplace, we create an environment that offers all our employees opportunities to succeed. We want all our employees to be as successful as they can be and to reach their full potential no matter who they are, where they are from or what they believe. In the spirit of this core belief, we strive to build an increasingly inclusive culture where all employees feel free to express themselves and have opportunities to grow. Since 2020, we engaged in the following diversity initiatives, among others: 
•we established a Diversity and Inclusion Council made up of key leaders in our Company to oversee the implementation of our detailed Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan;
•employees formed two employee resource groups - one for Black employees and allies called Black Sole and one for LGBTQ employees and allies called SM Pride;
•we signed the Open to All pledge with other major brands and retailers; 
•we joined the Black in Fashion Council;
•we implemented Company-wide Diversity and Inclusion training;
•we joined Hive Diversity and are partnering with Historically Black Colleges and Universities to establish diverse pipelines of talent and expand our recruiting; and 
•we launched Adaptive Kids footwear, soon to expand to adults. 
Wellness 
We see personal health and fitness of our employees as key to long-term professional success, which is why we offer benefits and programs focused on physical, emotional and financial well-being. These include mindfulness and meditation training, financial wellness seminars, health fairs, discounted gym memberships, free flu shots, paid-time-off to receive COVID-19 vaccination and boosters, on-site COVID testing and on-site discounted food. We also offer an Employee Assistance Program with a range of programs, resources and tools that can help with myriad issues. To help manage work-life balance, we offer a paid membership to Care.com so employees can find childcare, senior care, special needs care and other related services. 
THE STEVE MADDEN CORPORATE FOUNDATION
In December 2021, the Company formed The Steve Madden Corporate Foundation, a donor-advised fund established under Fidelity Charitable and managed by Rockefeller Capital Management. As part of the Company's charitable giving strategy, we made a $1 million contribution at the end of 2021.
GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS 
Our business is subject to various United States federal state, and local and foreign laws and regulations, including environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. In addition, we may incur liability under environmental statutes and regulations with respect to the contamination of sites that we own or operate or previously owned or operated (including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites and neighboring properties, or other persons) and the off-site disposal of hazardous materials. We believe our operations are in compliance with the terms of all applicable laws and regulations and our compliance with these laws and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.
COVID-19 
The health and safety of our team members is of the highest importance. Our focus on the safety of our team members is evident in our initial and ongoing response to COVID-19 starting back in March 2020. We initially closed down all stores to ensure the safety of our customers and retail associates, and then we added working from home flexibility for our corporate positions that can be accomplished remotely. The Company continues to grant flexible work options through added resources and implementation of a hybrid working environment. We increased cleaning protocols, implemented onsite temperature screening, upgraded our HVAC systems, provided personal protective equipment and related supplies as needed, established new spacing and schedules to maximize social distancing while at work, and have also provided regular communications regarding impacts of COVID-19, including health and safety protocols and procedures. We have also provided our employees with additional paid time off to receive their Covid-19 vaccines and booster, and we are also providing on-site COVID testing. For more information about the impact of COVID-19 on our business, refer to Note D – Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.
SEASONALITY AND OTHER FACTORS 
Our operating results are subject to some variability due to seasonality and other factors. For example, the highest percentage of our boot sales occur in the fall and winter months (our third and fourth fiscal quarters) and the highest percentage of our sandal sales occur in the spring and summer months (our first and second fiscal quarters). Historically, some of our businesses, including our Retail segment, have experienced holiday retail seasonality. Our diverse range of product offerings, however, provides some mitigation to the impact of seasonal changes in demand for certain items. In addition to seasonal fluctuations, our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the weather, the timing of holidays and larger shipments of footwear, market acceptance of our products, pricing and presentation of the products offered and sold, the hiring and training of additional personnel, inventory write downs for obsolescence, the cost of materials, the product mix among our wholesale, retail and licensing businesses, the incurrence of other operating costs and factors beyond our control, such as general economic conditions and actions of competitors. Revenue levels in any period are also impacted by customer decisions to increase or decrease their inventory levels in response to anticipated consumer demand. Our customers may cancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice to us.
BACKLOG
We had unfilled wholesale customer orders of approximately 839,381 and $310,198, as of February 1, 2022 and February 1, 2021, respectively. Our backlog at a particular time is affected by a number of factors, including seasonality, timing of market weeks and wholesale customer purchases of our core products through our open stock program. Accordingly, a comparison of backlog from period to period may not be indicative of eventual shipments.
