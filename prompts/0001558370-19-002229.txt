     ITEM 1.              BUSINESS
     General
     Bancorp of New Jersey, Inc., is referred to herein as “we” or the “Company”. The Company is a one-bank holding company incorporated under the laws of the State of New Jersey in November, 2006 to serve as a holding company for Bank of New Jersey, referred to as the “Bank.”  (Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to the “Company” in this annual report shall be deemed to refer also to the Bank).  The Company was organized at the direction of the board of directors of the Bank for the purpose of acquiring all of the capital stock of the Bank.  On July 31, 2007, the Company became the bank holding company of the Bank. 
     During the third quarter of 2014, the Bank formed BONJ-New Jersey Investment Company, a New Jersey corporation; BONJ- Delaware Investment Company, a Delaware corporation; and BONJ REIT Inc., a New Jersey corporation.  These subsidiaries were formed as part of the establishment by the Company of a real estate investment trust to reduce the Company’s effective corporate tax rate.
     The Bank is a commercial bank formed under the laws of the State of New Jersey on May 10, 2006.  The Bank operates from its corporate office at 750 East Palisade Avenue, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, 07632, and its nine branch offices located at 1365 Palisade Avenue, Fort Lee, New Jersey, 07024, 204 Main Street, Fort Lee, New Jersey, 07024, 401 Hackensack Avenue, Hackensack, New Jersey, 07601, 458 West Street, Fort Lee, New Jersey, 07024, 320 Haworth Avenue, Haworth, New Jersey, 07641, 104 Grand Avenue, Englewood, NJ 07631, 354 Palisade Avenue, Cliffside Park, NJ 07010, 585 Chestnut Ridge Road, Woodcliff Lake, NJ 07677 and 750 East Palisade Avenue, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, 07632.  
     The Company is subject to the supervision and regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, sometimes referred to as the “FRB.”  The Bank is supervised and regulated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or “FDIC” and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance or “NJDOBI”.  The Bank’s deposits

are insured by the FDIC up to applicable limits.  The operation of the Company and the Bank are subject to the supervision and regulation of the FRB, FDIC, and the NJDOBI.  The main office of the Bank is located at 1365 Palisade Avenue, Fort Lee, NJ, 07024 and the telephone number is (201) 944-8600. 
     Business of the Company
     The Company’s primary business is ownership and supervision of the Bank.  The Company, through the Bank, conducts a traditional commercial banking business, accepting deposits from the general public, including individuals, businesses, non-profit organizations, and governmental units.  The Bank makes commercial loans and consumer loans.  In addition, the Bank provides other customer services and makes investments in securities, as permitted by law.  The Bank continues to offer community-oriented relationship banking in an area that is presently dominated by larger, statewide and national institutions.  Our goal remains to establish and retain customer relationships by offering a broad range of traditional financial services and products, competitively-priced and delivered in a responsive manner to businesses, professionals, and individuals in the local market.  As a locally operated community bank, the Bank seeks to provide superior customer service that is highly personalized, efficient, and responsive to local needs.  To better serve our customers and expand our market reach, we provide for the delivery of certain financial products and services to local customers and to a broader market through the use of mail, telephone, and internet banking.  The Bank strives to deliver these products and services with the care and professionalism expected of a community bank and with a special dedication to personalized customer service.
     The specific objectives of the Bank are:
    
· | To provide local businesses, professionals, and individuals with banking services responsive to and determined by the local market;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | For bank management to be accessible to and engaged with its customers, shareholders and communities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | To attract deposits and loans by competitive pricing; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------


· | To provide a reasonable return to shareholders on capital invested.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------

      Market Area
     The principal market for our deposit gathering and lending activities is within Bergen County in New Jersey.  The market is dominated by offices of large statewide and interstate banking institutions.  The market area has a relatively affluent population base of potential customers for our services and a diversified mix of commercial businesses and residential neighborhoods. In order to meet the demands of this market, the Company operates its corporate office in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey and nine branch offices, three in Fort Lee, one in Hackensack, one in Haworth, one in Englewood, one in Cliffside Park, one in Woodcliff Lake, and one in Englewood Cliffs, all in Bergen County, New Jersey. We offer convenient branch hours, online banking, mobile banking and remote deposit capture for commercial customers.      Competition
     The banking business remains highly competitive and is increasingly more regulated. The profitability of the Company depends upon the Bank’s ability to compete in its market area.  The Bank continues to face considerable competition in its market area for deposits and loans from other depository institutions.  The Bank faces competition in attracting and retaining deposit and loan customers, and with respect to the terms and conditions it offers on its deposit and loan products.  Many of its competitors have greater financial resources, broader geographic markets, and greater name recognition, and are able to provide more services and finance wide-ranging advertising campaigns.
     The Bank competes with local, regional, and national commercial banks, savings banks, and savings and loan associations.  The Bank also competes with money market mutual funds, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, stock brokerage firms, regulated small loan companies, credit unions, and issuers of commercial paper and other securities. In addition, the banking industry in general has begun to face competition for deposit, credit and money management products from non-bank technology firms, or fintech companies, which may offer products independently or though relationships with insured depository institutions.

     Concentration
     The Company is not dependent for deposits or exposed by loan concentrations to a single customer or a small group of customers the loss of any one or more of which would have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition of the Company.  As a community bank however, our market area is concentrated in Bergen County, New Jersey, and 91.3% of our loan portfolio was collateralized by real estate, primarily in our market area, as of December 31, 2018.     Employees
     At December 31, 2018, the Company employed eighty one full-time equivalent employees.  None of these employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.  The Company believes its relations with employees to be good.     Supervision and Regulation
     General
     The Company and the Bank are each extensively regulated under both federal and state law.  These laws restrict permissible activities and investments and require compliance with various consumer protection provisions applicable to lending, deposit, brokerage and fiduciary activities. They also impose capital adequacy requirements and condition the Company’s ability to repurchase stock or to receive dividends from the Bank or pay dividends to its shareholders. The Company is also subject to comprehensive examination and supervision by the FRB and the Bank is also subject to comprehensive examination and supervision by NJDOBI and the FDIC.  These regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the operations of the Company and the Bank. This supervisory framework could materially impact the conduct and profitability of the Company’s and Bank’s activities. Federal and state banking regulators have the authority to initiate informal or formal enforcement actions against the Company and the Bank. 
     To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions. Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking industry are frequently raised at both the state and federal level. The likelihood and timing of any changes in these laws and regulations, and the impact such changes may have on the Company and the Bank, are difficult to ascertain. A change in applicable laws and regulations, or in the manner such laws or regulations are interpreted by regulatory agencies or courts, may have a material effect on our business, operations and earnings.
     Bank Holding Company Act
     The Company is registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHCA”), and is subject to regulation and supervision by the FRB. The BHCA requires the Company to secure the prior approval of the FRB before it owns or controls, directly or indirectly, more than five percent (5%) of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of, any bank or savings bank, or merges or consolidates with another bank or savings bank holding company. Further, under the BHCA, the activities of the Company and any nonbank subsidiary are limited to those activities which the FRB determines to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto, and prior approval of the FRB may be required before engaging in certain activities. In making such determinations, the FRB is required to weigh the expected benefits to the public such as greater convenience, increased competition and gains in efficiency, against the possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, and unsound banking practices.
     The BHCA was substantially amended by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”), which among other things permits a “financial holding company” to engage in a broader range of non-banking activities, and to engage on less restrictive terms in certain activities than were previously permitted. These expanded activities include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and sales, and merchant banking activities, among other activities. To become a financial holding company, the Company and the Bank must be “well capitalized” and “well managed” (as defined by federal law), and have at least a “satisfactory” Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) rating.  GLBA also imposes certain privacy requirements on all financial institutions and their treatment of consumer information.  At this time, the Company has not elected to become a financial holding company, as we do not engage in any non-banking activities which would require us to be a financial holding company.

     There are a number of restrictions imposed on the Company and the Bank by law and regulatory policy that are designed to minimize potential loss to the depositors of the Bank and the FDIC insurance fund in the event the Bank should become insolvent.  For example, FRB policy and regulation require a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions and to commit resources to support such institutions in circumstances where it might not do so absent such policy and regulation. The FRB also has the authority under the BHCA to require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or to relinquish control of a non-bank subsidiary upon the FRB’s determination that such activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness and stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company.
     Any capital loan by the Company to the Bank is subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other indebtedness of the Bank.  In addition, in the event of the Company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the Company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of the Bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.
     The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDIA”) provides that, in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution (including the claims of the FDIC as a subrogee of insured depositors) and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution.  If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including the Company, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution.
     Supervision and Regulation of the Bank
     The operations and investments of the Bank are also limited by federal and state statutes and regulations. The Bank is subject to the supervision and regulation by the NJDOBI and the FDIC. The Bank is also subject to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state law, including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the types, amount and terms and conditions of loans that may be originated, and limits on the type of activities in which the Bank may engage and the investments it may make. Under the GLBA, the Bank may engage in expanded activities (such as insurance sales and securities underwriting) through the formation of a “financial subsidiary.”  In order to be eligible to establish or acquire a financial subsidiary, the Bank must be “well capitalized” and “well managed” and may not have less than a “satisfactory” CRA rating. At this time, the Bank does not engage in any activity which would require it to maintain a financial subsidiary.
     The Bank is also subject to federal laws that limit the amount of transactions between the Bank and its nonbank affiliates, including the Company. Under these provisions, transactions (such as a loan or investment) by the Bank with any nonbank affiliate are generally limited to 10% of the Bank’s capital and surplus for all covered transactions with such affiliate or 20% of capital and surplus for all covered transactions with all affiliates. Any such extensions of credit, with limited exceptions, must be secured by eligible collateral in specified amounts. The Bank is also prohibited from purchasing any “low quality” assets from an affiliate.  The Dodd-Frank Act imposed additional requirements on transactions with affiliates, including an expansion of the definition of “covered transactions” and increasing the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained.
     Securities and Exchange Commission
     The Company is also under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for matters relating to the offering and sale of its securities and is subject to the SEC’s rules and regulations relating to periodic reporting, reporting to shareholders, proxy solicitations, and insider-trading regulations.     Monetary Policy
     The earnings of the Company are and will be affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies. The monetary policies of the FRB have a significant effect upon the operating results of commercial banks such as the Bank.  The FRB has a major effect upon the levels of bank loans, investments and deposits through its open market operations in United States government securities and through its regulation of, among other things, the discount rate on borrowings of member banks and the reserve requirements 

 
  6

 
against member banks’ deposits. It is not possible to predict the nature and impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies.
 Deposit Insurance
     The Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. 
     On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law.  The Dodd-Frank Act changed the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits held by the depository institution to the depository institution’s average total consolidated assets less average tangible equity, eliminating the ceiling on the size of the deposit insurance fund (“DIF”) and increasing the floor on the size of the DIF.  The Dodd-Frank Act established a minimum designated reserve ratio (“DRR”) of 1.35 percent of the estimated insured deposits, mandates the FDIC to adopt a restoration plan should the DRR fall below 1.35 percent, and provides dividends to the industry should the DRR exceed 1.50 percent.
     On February 7, 2011, the Board of Directors of the FDIC approved a final rule on Assessments, Dividend Assessment Base and Large Bank Pricing (the “Final Rule”).  The Final Rule implements the changes to the deposit insurance assessment system as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act.  The Final Rule became effective April 1, 2011.
     The Final Rule changed the assessment base for insured depository institutions from adjusted domestic deposits to the average consolidated total assets during an assessment period less average tangible equity capital during that assessment period.  Tangible equity is defined in the Final Rule as Tier 1 Capital and shall be calculated monthly, unless, like us, the insured depository institution has less than $1 billion in assets. In that case, the insured depository institution calculates the Tier 1 Capital on an end-of-quarter basis.  Parents or holding companies of other insured depository institutions are required to report separately from their subsidiary depository institutions.
     The Final Rule retains the unsecured debt adjustment, which lowers an insured depository institution’s assessment rate for any unsecured debt on its balance sheet.  In general, the unsecured debt adjustment in the Final Rule will be measured to the new assessment base and will be increased by 40 basis points.  The Final Rule also contains a brokered deposit adjustment for assessments.  The Final Rule provides an exemption to the brokered deposit adjustment to financial institutions that are “well capitalized” and have composite CAMEL ratings of 1 or 2.  CAMEL ratings are confidential ratings used by the federal and state regulators for assessing the soundness of financial institutions.  These ratings range from 1 to 5, with a rating of 1 being the highest rating.
     The Final Rule also creates a new rate schedule that intends to provide more predictable assessment rates to financial institutions.  The revenue under the new rate schedule will be approximately the same.  Moreover, it indefinitely suspends the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends from the insurance fund when it reaches 1.5 percent of insured deposits, to increase the probability that the fund reserve ratio will reach a sufficient level to withstand a future crisis.  In lieu of the dividend payments, the FDIC has adopted progressively lower assessment rate schedules that become effective when the reserve ratio exceeds 2 percent and 2.5 percent.
     The Dodd-Frank Act made permanent the $250,000 limit for federal deposit insurance.
     The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments.  A significant increase in insurance assessments would likely have an adverse effect on our operating expenses and results of operations.  Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future.
     Deposit insurance may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed the FDIC.
     Dividend Restrictions
     Under applicable New Jersey law, the Company is not permitted to pay dividends on its capital stock if, following the payment of the dividend, (1) it would be unable to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business or (2) its total assets would be less than its total liabilities. Further, it is the policy of the FRB that bank holding companies should pay dividends only out of current earnings and only if future retained earnings would be consistent with the Company’s capital, asset quality, liquidity and financial condition. As part of its supervisory authority, the FRB may 

 
  7

 
impose informal or formal restrictions on the Company’s ability to pay dividends, including requiring the non-objection of the FRB to payment of any dividends, distribution of interest or creating new debt.
 Since it has no significant independent sources of income, the ability of the Company to pay dividends is dependent on its ability to receive dividends from the Bank. Under the New Jersey Banking Act of 1948, as amended (the “Banking Act”), a bank may declare and pay cash dividends only if, after payment of the dividend, the capital stock of the bank will be unimpaired and either the bank will have a surplus of not less than 50% of its capital stock or the payment of the dividend will not reduce the bank’s surplus.  The FDIC prohibits payment of cash dividends if, as a result, the institution would be undercapitalized or the Bank is in default with respect to any assessment due to the FDIC.
     Risk-Based Capital Requirements
     The federal banking regulators have adopted certain risk-based capital guidelines to assist in assessing capital adequacy of a banking organization’s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets and transactions, such as letters of credit, and recourse agreements, which are recorded as off-balance sheet items. Under these guidelines, nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit-equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages, which range from 0% for assets with low credit risk, such as certain US Treasury securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures.
     A banking organization’s risk-based capital ratios are obtained by dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk adjusted assets. The regulators measure risk-adjusted assets, which include off-balance-sheet items, against both total qualifying capital, Common Equity Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 capital.
    
· | “Common Equity Tier 1 Capital” includes common equity and minority interest in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill and other intangibles, subject to certain exceptions and retained earnings.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | “Tier 1”, or core capital, includes common equity, non-cumulative preferred stock and minority interest in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill and other intangibles, subject to certain exceptions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      These requirements apply to all insured depository institutions and to bank holding companies with at least $3 billion in consolidated assets. Therefore, these requirements only apply to the Bank, not the Company, at this time. 
     In July 2013, the federal banking agencies issued final rules to implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rules call for the following capital requirements:
    
· | A minimum ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5%.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6%.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


· | A minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8%.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


· | A minimum leverage ratio of 4%.
--+--------------------------------

      In addition, the final rules establish a common equity tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets applicable to all banking organizations. If a banking organization fails to hold capital above the minimum capital ratios and the capital conservation buffer, it will be subject to certain restrictions on capital distributions, including stock repurchases, and discretionary bonus payments. The phase-in period for the capital conservation and countercyclical capital buffers for all banking organizations began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level, and was fully phased in at 2.5% on January 1, 2019.
     The final rules allow community banks to make a one-time election not to include accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) in regulatory capital and instead use the existing treatment under the general risk-based capital rules that excludes most AOCI components from regulatory capital. The opt-out election was required to be made in the first call report or FR Y-9 series report that is filed after the financial institution becomes subject to the final rule. On March 19, 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted a resolution to “opt-out” of the inclusion of the components of AOCI in regulatory capital.
     Consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act, the rules replace the ratings-based approach to securitization exposures, which is based on external credit ratings, with the simplified supervisory formula approach in order to determine the appropriate risk weights for these exposures. Alternatively, banking organizations may use the existing gross-up approach to assign securitization exposures to a risk weight category or choose to assign such exposures a 1,250 percent risk weight.

 Under the rules, mortgage servicing assets (MSAs) and certain deferred tax assets (DTAs) are subject to stricter limitations than those applicable under the prior general risk-based capital rule. The new rules also increase the risk weights for past-due loans, certain commercial real estate loans, and some equity exposures, and makes selected other changes in risk weights and credit conversion factors.
     Failure to meet applicable capital guidelines could subject a banking organization to a variety of enforcement actions including:
    
· | limitations on its ability to pay dividends;
--+---------------------------------------------


· | the issuance by the applicable regulatory authority of a capital directive to increase capital, and in the case of depository institutions, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, as well as the measures described under FDICIA as applicable to undercapitalized institutions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      At December 31, 2018, the Bank met its capital requirements with a ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 11.17%; a ratio of tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 11.17%; a ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 12.26%; and a leverage ratio of 10.06%. As can be seen from these ratios, the Bank also satisfied its capital conservation buffer. 
     Prompt Corrective Action
     In addition to the required minimum capital levels described above, Federal law establishes a system of “prompt corrective actions” which Federal banking agencies are required to take, and certain actions which they have discretion to take, based upon the capital category into which a Federally regulated depository institution falls.  Regulations set forth detailed procedures and criteria for implementing prompt corrective action in the case of any institution which is not adequately capitalized.  Under the rules, an institution will be deemed “well capitalized” if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0 percent, (iii) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5.0 percent, (iv) has a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6.5%, and (v) meets certain other requirements. An institution will be classified as “adequately capitalized” if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.0 percent, (iii) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4.0 percent, has a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 4.5%, and (v) does not meet the definition of “well capitalized.” An institution will be classified as “undercapitalized” if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 percent,  (iii) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of  less than 4.0 percent, or (iv) has a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution will be classified as “significantly undercapitalized” if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0 percent,  (iii) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 3.0 percent, or (iv) has a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of less 3.0%. An institution will be classified as “critically undercapitalized” if it has a tangible equity to total assets ratio that is equal to or less than 2.0 percent. An insured depository institution may be deemed to be in a lower capitalization category if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating.
     The prompt corrective action rules require an undercapitalized institution to file a written capital restoration plan, along with a performance guaranty by its holding company or a third party.  In addition, an undercapitalized institution becomes subject to certain automatic restrictions including a prohibition on payment of dividends, a limitation on asset growth and expansion, in certain cases, a limitation on the payment of bonuses or raises to senior executive officers, and a prohibition on the payment of certain “management fees” to any “controlling person.”  Institutions that are classified as undercapitalized are also subject to certain additional supervisory actions, including: increased reporting burdens and regulatory monitoring; a limitation on the institution’s ability to make acquisitions, open new branch offices, or engage in new lines of business; obligations to raise additional capital; restrictions on transactions with affiliates; and restrictions on interest rates paid by the institution on deposits.  In certain cases, bank regulatory agencies may require replacement of senior executive officers or directors, or sale of the institution to a willing purchaser.  If an institution is deemed to be “critically undercapitalized” and continues in that category for four quarters, the statute requires, with certain narrowly limited exceptions, that the institution be placed in receivership.
     As of December 31, 2018, the Bank was classified as “well capitalized.”  This classification is primarily for the purpose of applying the federal prompt corrective action provisions and is not intended to be and should not be interpreted as a representation of overall financial condition or prospects of the Bank.

 Community Reinvestment Act
     The CRA requires that banks meet the credit needs of all of their assessment area (as established for these purposes in accordance with applicable regulations based principally on the location of branch offices), including those of low income areas and borrowers.  The CRA also requires that the FDIC assess all financial institutions that it regulates to determine whether these institutions are meeting the credit needs of the community they serve. Under the CRA, institutions are assigned a rating of “outstanding,” “satisfactory,” “needs to improve” or “unsatisfactory”.  The Bank’s record in meeting the requirements of the CRA is made publicly available and is taken into consideration in connection with any applications with Federal regulators to engage in certain activities, including approval of a branch or other deposit facility, mergers and acquisitions, office relocations, or expansions into non-banking activities.  As of December 31, 2018, the bank maintains a “satisfactory” CRA rating.     USA Patriot Act
     Under the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT) Act, financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships as well as enhanced due diligence and “know your customer” standards in their dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers.  Under the USA PATRIOT Act, financial institutions must establish anti-money laundering programs meeting the minimum standards specified by the Act and implementing regulations. The USA PATRIOT Act also requires the Federal banking regulators to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution’s anti-money laundering activities when reviewing bank mergers and bank holding company acquisitions.
     The Bank has implemented the required internal controls to ensure proper compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act.
     Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
     The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 comprehensively revised the laws affecting corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation and corporate reporting for entities, such as the Company, with equity or debt securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”). Among other things, Sarbanes-Oxley and its implementing regulations have established membership requirements and responsibilities for our audit committee, imposed restrictions on the relationship between the Company and its outside auditors (including restrictions on the types of non-audit services our auditors may provide to us), imposed responsibilities for our external financial statements on our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, and expanded the disclosure requirements for our corporate insiders.  The requirements are intended to allow stockholders to more easily and efficiently monitor the performance of companies and directors. The Company and its Board of Directors have, as appropriate, adopted or modified the Company’s policies and practices in order to comply with these regulatory requirements and to enhance the Company’s corporate governance practices.
     Pursuant to Sarbanes-Oxley, the Company has adopted a Code of Conduct and Ethics applicable to its Board, executives and employees.  This Code of Conduct can be found on the Company’s website at www.bonj.net.
     Dodd-Frank Act
     The Dodd-Frank Act became law on July 21, 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act implements far-reaching changes across the financial regulatory landscape.
     The Dodd-Frank Act creates the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), which is an independent organization within the Federal Reserve System with broad authority to regulate the consumer finance industry including regulated financial institutions such as us, and non-banks and others who are involved in the consumer finance industry.  The CFPB has exclusive authority through rulemaking, orders, policy statements, guidance and enforcement actions to administer and enforce federal consumer finance laws, to oversee non federally regulated entities, and to impose its own regulations and pursue enforcement actions when it determines that a practice is unfair, deceptive or abusive (“UDA”).  The federal consumer finance laws and all of the functions and responsibilities associated with them were transferred to the CFPB on July 21, 2011. While the CFPB has the exclusive power to interpret, administer and enforce federal consumer finance laws and UDA, the Dodd-Frank Act provides that the FDIC continues to have examination and enforcement powers over insured depository institutions like us that have less than $10 billion in assets. The Dodd-Frank Act also gives state attorneys general the ability to enforce federal consumer protection laws.

 The Dodd-Frank Act also:
    
· | Applies the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements to most bank holding companies (“BHCs”) that apply to insured depository institutions;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Requires BHCs and banks to be both well-capitalized and well-managed in order to acquire banks located outside their home state and requires any BHC electing to be treated as a financial holding company to be both well-managed and well-capitalized;

· | Changes the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits held by the depository institution to the depository institution’s average total consolidated assets less tangible equity, eliminates the ceiling on the size of the DIF and increases the floor of the size of the DIF.

· | Expands insider transaction limitations through the strengthening of loan restrictions to insiders and the expansion of the types of transactions subject to the various limits, including derivative transactions, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and securities lending or borrowing transactions. Restrictions are also placed on certain asset sales to and from an insider to an institution, including requirements that such sales be on market terms and, in certain circumstances, approved by the institution’s board of directors; and

· | Strengthens the previous limits on a depository institution’s credit exposure to one borrower which limited a depository institution’s ability to extend credit to one person (or group of related persons) in an amount exceeding certain thresholds. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the scope of these restrictions to include credit exposure arising from derivative transactions, repurchase agreements, and securities lending and borrowing transactions.

      While designed primarily to reform the financial regulatory system, the Dodd-Frank Act also contains a number of corporate governance provisions that affect public companies with securities registered under the Exchange Act.  The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Securities and Exchange Commission to adopt rules which may affect our executive compensation policies and disclosure.  It also imposes a requirement that our independent auditor attest to and report on management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting.
     Although a significant number of the rules and regulations mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act have been finalized, including rules regulating compensation of residential mortgage loan originators and mortgage loan servicing practices, and defining qualified mortgage loans, many of the new requirements called for have yet to be implemented and will likely be subject to implementing regulations over the course of several years. In addition, certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that were implemented have been amended. Given the uncertainty associated with the manner in which the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will be implemented by the various agencies, the full extent of the impact such requirements will have on financial institutions’ operations is unclear.  The Dodd-Frank Act could require us to make material expenditures, in particular personnel training costs and additional compliance expenses, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. It could also require us to change certain of our business practices, adversely affect our ability to pursue business opportunities that we might otherwise consider pursuing, cause business disruptions and/or have other impacts that are as of yet unknown to us.  Failure to comply with these laws or regulations, even if inadvertent, could result in negative publicity, fines or additional expenses, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flow.
     Ability to Repay and Qualified Mortgage Rule
     Pursuant to the Dodd Frank Act, the CFPB issued a final rule on January 10, 2013 (which became effective January 10, 2014), amending Regulation Z as implemented by the Truth in Lending Act, requiring mortgage lenders to make a reasonable and good faith determination based on verified and documented information that a consumer applying for a mortgage loan has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms. Mortgage lenders are required to

determine consumers’ ability to repay in one of two ways. The first alternative requires the mortgage lender to consider the following eight underwriting factors when making the credit decision:
    
· | current or reasonably expected income or assets;
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | current employment status;
--+---------------------------


· | the monthly payment on the covered transaction;
--+------------------------------------------------


· | the monthly payment on any simultaneous loan;
--+----------------------------------------------


· | the monthly payment for mortgage-related obligations;
--+------------------------------------------------------


· | current debt obligations, alimony, and child support;
--+------------------------------------------------------


· | the monthly debt-to-income ratio or residual income; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------


· | credit history.
--+----------------

      Alternatively, the mortgage lender can originate “qualified mortgages,” which are entitled to a presumption that the creditor making the loan satisfied the ability-to-repay requirements. In general, a “qualified mortgage” is a mortgage loan without negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or terms exceeding 30 years. In addition, to be a qualified mortgage, the points and fees paid by a consumer cannot exceed 3% of the total loan amount. In addition, the borrower must satisfy certain debt to income ratio requirements. Loans which meet these criteria will be considered qualified mortgages, and as a result the originator will be deemed to have satisfied the ability-to-repay requirement. Qualified mortgages that are “higher-priced” (e.g. subprime loans) garner a rebuttable presumption of compliance with the ability-to-repay rules. 
     Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act.
     The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (“EGRRCPA”), adopted in May of 2018, was intended to provide regulatory relief to midsized and regional banks. While many of its provisions are aimed at larger institutions, such as raising the threshold to be considered a systemically important financial institution to $250 billion in assets from $50 billion in assets, many of its provisions will provide regulatory relief to those institutions with $10 billion or more in assets, as well as to those institutions with less than $10 billion in assets. Among other things, the EGRRCPA increased the asset threshold for depository institutions and holding companies to perform stress tests required under Dodd Frank from $10 billion to $250 billion, exempted institutions with less than $10 billion in consolidated assets from the Volcker Rule, raised the threshold for the requirement that publicly traded holding companies have a risk committee from $10 billion in consolidated assets to $50 billion in consolidated assets, directed the federal banking agencies to adopt a “community bank leverage ratio”, applicable to institutions and holding companies with less than $10 billion in assets, and to provide that compliance with the new ratio would be deemed compliance with all capital requirements applicable to the institution or holding company, and provided that residential mortgage loans meeting certain criteria and originated by institutions with less than $10 billion in total assets will be deemed to meet the “ability to repay rule” under the Truth in Lending Act. In addition, the EGRRCPA limited the definition of loans that would be subject to the higher risk weighting applicable to High Volatility Commercial Real Estate.
     Many of the regulations needed to implement the EGRRCPA have yet to be promulgated by the federal banking agencies, and so it is still uncertain how full implementation of the EGRRCPA will affect the Company and the Bank.
     Federal Home Loan Bank Membership
     The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (“FHLBNY”).  Each member of the FHLBNY is required to maintain a minimum investment in capital stock of the FHLBNY.  The Board of Directors of the FHLBNY can increase the minimum investment requirements in the event it has concluded that additional capital is required to allow it to meet its own regulatory capital requirements.  Any increase in the minimum investment requirements outside of specified ranges requires the approval of the Federal Housing Finance Agency.  Because the extent of any obligation to increase our investment in the FHLBNY depends entirely upon the occurrence of a future event, potential payments to the FHLBNY is not determinable.
     Additionally, in the event that the Bank fails, the right of the FHLBNY to seek repayment of funds loaned to the Bank shall take priority (a “super lien”) over all other creditors.

 Other Laws and Regulations
     The Company and the Bank are subject to a variety of laws and regulations which are not limited to banking organizations. For example, in lending to commercial and consumer borrowers, and in owning and operating its own property, the Bank is subject to regulations and potential liabilities under state and federal environmental laws.
     We are heavily regulated by regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels.  We, like most of our competitors, have faced and expect to continue to face increased regulation and regulatory and political scrutiny, which creates significant uncertainty for us and the financial services industry in general.
