 Item 1.        Business. 
 Overview
             We design, develop and sell software and services that enable enterprises and telecommunication service providers to deliver Unified Communications (UC) services, including voice, video, messaging and collaboration functionality, over their Internet Protocol, or IP, based networks. We are capitalizing upon numerous industry trends, including the rapid adoption of mobile technology, the proliferation of bring-your-own-device to work programs, the need for secure business communications, the need for centralized provisioning, the migration towards cloud-based services and the migration towards all IP networks. We are also capitalizing on a trend where communication services such as Skype and WhatsApp are becoming more available over-the-top (OTT) of the incumbent operators networks or enterprise networks (a.k.a. Internet OTT providers). We offer our solutions under perpetual license agreements that generate one-time license revenue and under subscription license agreements that generate recurring license revenue. We sell our solutions through our own online store, through third-party online stores, directly using our in-house sales team and through channel partners. Our channel partners include original equipment manufacturers, value added distributers and value added resellers. Enterprises typically leverage our solutions to increase employee productivity and to reduce certain communication costs. Telecommunication service providers typically deploy our solutions to supplement and add value to their traditional services. Our original equipment manufacturers and value added resellers typically integrate our solutions into their products and then sell a bundled solution to their end customers, which include both telecommunication service providers and enterprises. 
             Our business model is based on winning new customers, expanding sales of new and existing products and services to existing customers, and renewing subscriptions and software support agreements. We target business customers of all sizes and across a broad range of industries, including call centers, financial services, government, retail, technology and telecommunications. We have sold software and services to more than 700 different customers in over 73 countries, including some of the worlds largest businesses, global financial institutions and leading telecommunication service providers (where each customer has purchased at least $10,000 of software and services). 
             We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 18, 2003. 
             Our principal executive offices are located at Suite 300, 505 Burrard Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V7X 1M3. Our telephone number is (604) 320-3344. Our website address is www.counterpath.com.

 Industry
             The telecommunication industry is undergoing a fundamental transition from legacy circuit switched networks to packet switched networks that are more flexible and economical to operate. At the same time, consumers and businesses are rapidly adopting new mobile and cloud communication technologies. We believe enterprises want to capitalize upon these trends by launching innovative OTT services to increase employee mobility, increase employee productivity, and reduce certain communication costs. At the same time, telecommunication service providers are facing a number of threats, including the commoditization of their legacy voice businesses, the decline in short message service (SMS) revenues, regulatory changes that increase competition in certain areas and reduce certain revenues, and the proliferation of third party OTT services such as Skype, WhatsApp and Zoom that are intermediating customer relationships and reducing certain revenue streams. Given these factors, some telecommunication service providers are looking to defend their businesses by launching their own innovative OTT services to counter some of the threats they are facing, and to possibly create new revenue streams. In addition, both enterprises and telecommunication service providers are looking to simplify their IT operations by procuring cloud-based services rather than purchasing systems outright and running them independently. The migration towards cloud-based services typically reduces up-front capital expenditures and simplifies IT operations.

            Enterprises are adopting mobile technology at a rapid pace. In fact, according to International Data Corporation, an industry research organization, 1.4 billion smartphones were shipped in 2018. We believe enterprises want to leverage mobile technology to increase employee productivity and to reduce certain costs. At the same time, bring-your-own-device to work programs are becoming common in the workplace, enabling enterprises to reduce up-front technology acquisition costs, while allowing employees to work on the device of their choice. This rapid penetration of mobile technology in the work place, coupled with need to support and manage an increasingly diverse set of mobile devices, creates new challenges for IT organizations, including the need to extend the corporate IT environment to the mobile device, the ability to provide and manage corporate applications remotely, and the need for secure communications. IT departments are often challenged to provide users with the benefits of mobility, while simultaneously satisfying enterprise security and compliance requirements. Our solutions address these issues by enabling enterprises to launch what we call Enterprise OTT Services. Our Bria® mobile and tablet softphones allow mobile workers to leverage the full suite of corporate PBX (Private Branch Exchange) functionality as if they were in the office and connected to the secure enterprise network, while our Bria Desktop softphones enable users to cost-effectively replace or augment their traditional desk phones. Our Stretto Platform™ simplifies the IT managers job by enabling the efficient provisioning and management of the enterprises softphones. 
             Enterprises are also adapting to the new and increasingly complex environment by shifting away from purchasing stand-alone software applications and running them on in-house servers, to purchasing cloud-based services. This typically reduces capital spending and simplifies operations by reducing the number of servers and applications IT staff must install, configure, manage and support. Our Stretto Platform can be purchased as cloud based services that generate recurring revenue for our company. We also offer a complete cloud-based solution to small, medium and large businesses. For small businesses, we launched a subscription service known as Bria Teams, delivering centralized provisioning, messaging and screen sharing from the cloud, along with up to three Bria softphones per user; this solution is available exclusively through our on-line store. For the medium and large-sized businesses we offer Brio StrettoTM which is sold through channel partners and our direct sales team under a subscription licensing agreement and includes our Bria softphones and access to our Stretto Platform Provisioning Module. Brio Stretto enables enterprises to quickly launch unified communications services using our solutions, without deploying additional server hardware in the datacenter. 
             Telecommunication service providers, including cable, wireless and Voice over IP operators are also facing a shifting landscape driven by new technology and changing subscriber habits. Some wireline and cable subscribers are cutting the cord and cancelling their home-phone service in favour of cellular service. At the same time, video OTT services such as Apple TV and Netflix are gaining significant traction, leading some subscribers to cancel their television service or down grade to less expensive bundles, placing additional pressure on top-line revenues at some service providers. Mobile subscribers, on the other hand, are scaling back their use of certain services such as SMS and international long-distance voice in favour of third-party OTT services such as WhatsApp and WeChat. We believe many telecommunication service providers aim to strengthen subscriber relationships, reduce churn and prevent or slow revenue erosion by launching their own, superior, white labelled Operator OTT Services with unique value added features that are difficult for third-parties to replicate. Our Operator Solutions enable service providers to provision single identity, one number services that increase a subscribers usage of their home or cellular phone number, convergence services that facilitate call handoff between different access networks, Voice over IP services for inexpensive long-distance calling when roaming, and messaging services for efficient communications.
 Products
             Our solutions range from software products to cloud based services. Our software products include applications for smartphones, tablets and desktop computers, a Software Development Kit (SDK) for software developers seeking to add voice, video and messaging capabilities to their existing applications, and server-based software solutions for provisioning, managing and supporting softphones and for deploying advanced messaging and collaboration services. Many of these software products are also available to customers in the form of cloud based hosted services.

Softphones
             Our softphone applications support voice, video, messaging, presence and collaboration services over IP networks. Our softphone applications have undergone rigorous interoperability testing against leading PBXs, SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) application servers and IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) cores, ensuring that our softphone applications can be readily deployed in our customers networks. In addition to maintaining certification with leading SIP infrastructure vendors (such as Cisco, Avaya and Genesys), our softphones are tightly integrated with solutions from Salesforce.com, Microsoft, Oracle, AirWatch (a VMware company), and Blackberry (formerly Good Technologies), to name a few. We have performed integration with leading USB headset and Bluetooth device vendors, including Poly, Jabra, Logitech and Sennheiser, to provide advanced levels of functionality when deployed in conjunction with CounterPath products. 

 | Bria Desktop (Windows, Mac) and Bria Mobile (iOS, Android) 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | The Bria softphone suite enables consumers and business users to make VoIP audio and video calls, send Instant Messages and manage their presence, share their screen and collaborate with other users, all in an easy-to-use software application. The product suite works on desktop computers and laptops, smartphones, Chromebooks and tablets (including Windows tablet devices such as Microsoft Surface Pro), using various operating systems. 
 | Using the latest technology and SIP standards, our softphone applications provide business users with carrier-grade communication solutions that can be tailored to meet the needs of any size organization. For larger customers, we offer the ability to customize our softphone application by allowing our customers to include their corporate logos and branding, as well as to select specific features to be included. We have developed our on-line Branding Portal to allow customers to efficiently customize their applications. 
 | X-Lite 
 | X-Lite is a standards-based VoIP softphone application that runs on desktop computers. X-Lite interoperates with enterprise and carrier infrastructure equipment from major vendors, but excludes some key functionality offered in our commercial products, such as the ability to: brand the product, support multiple languages, import contacts, centrally provision the softphone, utilize premium codecs, or support multiple accounts. 
 | X-Lite is offered free of charge, is available for download on our website and may not be redistributed to third parties. We believe that offering X-Lite for free is an effective marketing tool for our company, as it allows potential customers to test and evaluate our software. We also believe offering X-Lite for free supports our business by encouraging companies that develop SIP compliant equipment, such as phones, video phones, network gateways, multipoint conference units and conference servers to test their equipment against our softphone. We believe this testing improves interoperability, facilitates our sales, and helps build positive brand recognition. The X-Lite graphical user interface supports advertising that could potentially be used to generate revenue in the future. While we advertise our commercial products on the X-Lite softphone user interface, we do not currently generate revenue from third-party advertising on X- Lite. 
 | Software Development Kit (SDK) 
 | Our SDK is targeted at developers that are seeking to build a unique communication application or incorporate advanced unified communications capabilities into their existing applications. For example, there is market demand within the healthcare vertical for adding unified communication capabilities to healthcare applications that were originally designed for managing prescriptions and tracking appointments for patients. We are targeting a number of industries, including the retail, healthcare and call- center verticals.

Our SDK delivers standards-compliant voice, video and messaging capabilities for desktop, tablet and mobile devices, and can be integrated into existing customer applications with a minimal amount of development effort. Our SDK can also be deployed with our Stretto Platform for customers seeking to leverage Stretto capabilities such as centralized provisioning or other advanced softphone metrics. Our SDK is used in our own softphone products, thereby delivering the benefit of our experience in deploying millions of SIP softphone clients. As an important differentiator, we provide customers with direct access to our engineering team, to ensure technical issues are quickly resolved. 
 Stretto Platform
 The Stretto Platform (Stretto) is a carrier-grade software platform for enterprises and service providers; it is also a key component of our Stretto Collaboration, Bria Teams and Brio Stretto products. 
 The Stretto Platform is agnostic to existing network elements, enabling deployments to be made on top of existing session border controllers, IMS components, VoIP switches, PBXs and cloud communication services. 
 The Stretto Platform includes a number of modules that can be separately purchased by customers, including:
 
o | Stretto Collaboration: Stretto Collaboration combines audio, video, screen-sharing, and messaging in one virtual meeting that extends the Bria softphone experience. Stretto Collaboration also offers the ability to manage video settings during a live session including the video layout, camera selection and video quality. Other features include convenient join, screen share, team messaging, and audio and video conferencing. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o | Provisioning: The Provisioning module enables the IT or operations staff of an organization to deploy, provision, and manage ongoing configuration upgrades to Bria softphones. The organization can control over 250 settings, including default codec selection, NAT traversal settings and keep-alive timer values as specified by IT or operations staff. This module is responsible for authenticating end users, and includes integration with the enterprises existing directory services using protocols such as LDAP and OAuth. 
o | User Experience Metrics: The User Experience Metrics module enables the IT or operations staff of an organization to record and analyze critical analytics and Voice Quality Monitoring (VQM) data that summarizes service quality, device usage, feature usage, and device characteristics. 
o | Help Desk Assistant: The Help Desk Assistant module enables the IT help-desk staff of an organization to directly access an end-users Bria application for trouble shooting. 
o | Push Notification: The Push Notification module enables our Bria mobile application to eliminate high battery drain during daily use, while ensuring that users never miss incoming calls or messages. The Push Notification module wakes our Bria softphone application on the end users mobile device when an incoming call, message or voicemail is pushed from a network to the client. Push Notification is becoming increasingly important to our customers, as both Apple and Google become more aggressive in managing power consumption by applications. 
o | XMPP Messaging and Presence: The XMPP Messaging and Presence delivers standards- compliant secure messaging and presence services, and the ability to synchronize messages across all of the users devices. 

Bria Teams and Brio Stretto
 Our Bria Teams and Brio Stretto products combine the Bria client suite for desktops, Chromebooks, smartphones, and tablets with our cloud-hosted Stretto Platform. Bria Teams was launched in 2018 as a subscription service, delivering centralized provisioning, messaging and screen sharing from the cloud, along with up to three Bria Softphones per user; this solution is available exclusively through our on-line store. For medium and large businesses, we offer Brio Stretto, which is sold through channel partners and our direct sales team.

Bria Teams is a solution targeted at small businesses allowing them to cost effectively extend the benefits of unified communications softphone technology to all employees, across all devices and networks with the aim of increasing the productivity and responsiveness of every employee. By simplifying the provisioning process, team administrators can quickly and easily configure team members via the cloud; users simply download our Bria Teams application to each of their devices, enter their credentials and within seconds, can start collaborating with fellow employees, partners and customers. Bria Teams delivers a suite of hosted collaboration services including Instant Messaging and Presence, Screen Sharing and Virtual Meeting Room capabilities to broaden our value beyond traditional softphones. Bria Teams was the recent recipient of Corp Americas North American Excellence award for Best Unified Communications Provider  North America & Unified Communications-as-a-Service (UCaaS) Product of the Year.
 Using our Brio Stretto, enterprises, service providers and telecommunication channel partners are able to leverage the Stretto Platform for procuring, distributing, provisioning and managing Bria Stretto clients from the cloud, as well as offering hosted messaging and collaboration solutions. The Stretto Platform provides customers with an easy-to-use system accessible through either the Stretto Administrator web interface or an API. Most softphone settings, outside of some user preferences, are hidden; instead the softphone relies on our Provisioning Module to provision these settings remotely. This enables administrators to centrally manage all of their communications across all device platforms. 
 The softphone clients in our Bria Teams and Brio Stretto offerings are updated with the most current release and available as a free download from the Apple iTunes store, Google Play, or direct download links (for desktop). Our softphone offers high-quality VoIP communications, delivered in an intuitive user interface, and includes premium features such as video calling, messaging and presence and premium audio and video codecs. 
 Brio Stretto also provides customers with access to hosted messaging and hosted collaboration services.
 Sales and Marketing
             We derive revenue from the sale of software licenses, software customization services, technical support services associated with the software licenses, implementation services, training services, and cloud based services. We recognize perpetual software and services revenue at the time of delivery, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. We recognize software as a service revenue over the term of the service contract, which is generally twelve months. 
             We focus on selling our software products to enterprises, to telecommunication service providers, and to channel partners who would then typically resell our products to enterprises or telecommunication service providers. Our customers include: (1) small, medium and large sized businesses; (2) telecommunications service providers and Internet telephony service providers; (3) channel partners, including original equipment manufacturers, value added distributors and value added resellers, serving the telecommunication market; and (4) end users who purchase our applications directly from our online store or from third party online stores. To date, we have sold software and services to more than 700 different customers in over 73 countries, including some of the worlds largest businesses, global financial institutions and leading telecommunication service providers (where each customer has purchased at least $10,000 of software and services).
             We typically work with our larger customers to streamline the process of delivering our software to their end users. This includes customization and pre-configuring the information required to connect to the customers network and enabling or disabling certain features of our products. Our software products are typically co-labelled with our brand and our customer's brand, or privately labelled with our customers brand. Co-labelling of our products means that the user interface that displays on the device screen for the end user to see remains as is, but the customers brand is also placed on the user interface. Private labelling of our products means that the customer can request that we change any and all features of the user interface and can remove all references to our company from the user interface. We receive professional service revenue for configuration and customization of our software.

Marketing
             Our products are marketed through a variety of means including by:
 
 | our customers and partners; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | advertising on our website, social media channels and search engines; 
 | direct market campaigns; 
 | co-marketing with our partners, suppliers and customers;

Intellectual Property
             We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as customary contractual protections to protect our intellectual property. 
             We own or hold the exclusive license to 22 U.S. patents with counterparts granted or pending in other jurisdictions around the world. In addition, we are pursuing two in-house developed patent applications with counterparts pending in other jurisdictions around the world. 
             We also hold a number of registered trademarks in the United States. 
             In addition to the protections described above, we generally control access to, and use of our proprietary software and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls. These controls include contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and partners. Our software is protected by U.S. and certain international copyright laws. 
             We have acquired certain patent rights from Inception Holdings including a patent for maintaining Internet voice communication to mobile devices where the IP address changes from location to location. We also hold exclusive rights to a patent which is a continuation to previously granted patents. This patent explains communication methods between mobile and packet networks using a gateway connected to both networks preserving single identity on both networks. We also hold the exclusive right to certain technologies developed at Columbia University for which we pay a license fee of 5% of net revenues where the technologies are incorporated into the products we sell. We incorporate a number of third party software programs into our software applications pursuant to license agreements. 
             We may not receive competitive advantages from the rights granted under our patents and other intellectual property rights. Our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies, duplicate our proprietary technologies or design around the patents owned or licensed by us. Our existing and future patents may be circumvented, blocked, licensed to others or challenged as to inventorship, ownership, scope, validity or enforceability. Furthermore, our pending and future patent applications may not be issued with the scope of claims sought by us, if at all, or the scope of claims we are seeking may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technologies. Moreover, we have adopted a strategy of seeking limited patent protection with respect to the technologies used in or relating to our products. If our products, patents or patent applications are found to conflict with any patents held by third parties, we could be prevented from selling our products, our patents may be declared invalid or our patent applications may not result in issued patents. In foreign countries, we may not receive effective patent, copyright and trademark protection. We may be required to initiate litigation in order to enforce any patents issued to us, or to determine the scope or validity of a third partys patent or other proprietary rights. In addition, in the future we may be subject to lawsuits by third parties seeking to enforce their own intellectual property rights, as described in Risk Factors - Risks Associated with our Business and Industry  We may in the future be subject to damaging and disruptive intellectual property litigation that could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the continued viability of our company and We could lose our competitive advantages if we are not able to protect any proprietary technology and intellectual property rights against infringement, and any related litigation could be time consuming and costly. 
 10

            We license our software pursuant to agreements that impose restrictions on customers ability to use the software, such as prohibiting reverse engineering and limiting the use of copies. We also seek to avoid disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute nondisclosure and assignment of intellectual property agreements and by restricting access to our source code. Other parties may not comply with the terms of their agreements with us, and we may not be able to enforce our rights adequately against these parties. 
 Research and Development
             Development of our products is primarily done through our Canadian wholly-owned subsidiary, CounterPath Technologies Inc., and our U.S. wholly-owned subsidiary, CounterPath, LLC. Our research and development team consists of a core software development department and a quality assurance department. Core software development is responsible for designing, developing and maintaining our software across our supported operating systems. Quality assurance is responsible for testing the software before release to customers on all of our platforms. Total research and development expenditures for the year ended April 30, 2019 were $5,547,587 (2018- $5,506,887).
 After Sales Service and Support
            We sell our software on an as-is or limited warranty basis to end users, and we are not required to update or upgrade the software nor are we generally responsible for failure of our software to work on our customers computer network; however, we offer two levels of renewable annual support to our non-end user customers for a specified percentage of the software license fees. Basic support includes product bug-fixes, eight (8) a.m. to eight (8) p.m. (Eastern Time), telephone support and email support during the one-year period following the date of sale. Bug-fixes are software updates which fix a known deficiency in the software product. Our extended support includes basic support and product upgrades. Product upgrades are separate from bug-fixes and include new or enhanced product features. For additional fees, we provide professional services, which include assisting our customers in customizing, deploying and implementing our applications. We currently maintain a support forum on the Internet at www.support.counterpath.com and product user manuals are available online at www.counterpath.com.
Warranty
            In circumstances where we provide a warranty on our software, we warrant that our software will perform substantially in accordance with the materials accompanying the software for periods of up to twelve months from the date of sale to cover defects in workmanship. 
Audio and Video Codecs
             Our softphone applications are integrated with audio and video codecs, which are licensed by third-parties either as free open source software or under a royalty bearing license. A codec is a software application that encodes and decodes audio or video data according to a specification. 
 11

Competition
             There are numerous developers that compete with our company for market share. Small software development companies typically compete on the basis of price, while large original equipment manufacturers typically compete by selling their proprietary software applications as a component to an overall proprietary communications system. We compete by offering applications with extensive features that are compatible with a broad spectrum of communication systems and with various devices and operating systems. 
Government Approval
             We have obtained Export Commodity Classification Numbers from the United States government for our software that contains encryption technology. We use these classifications to determine whether export licenses are required to export our software to foreign countries. We are not aware of any permits that are specific to our industry which are required in order for our company to operate or to sell our products and services in such jurisdictions. 
Employees
             As of April 30, 2019, we employed 93 people, comprised of 88 people employed full-time, 30 of whom are engaged in sales and marketing, 31 in research and development, 19 in services and support, and 8 in general and administration, and 5 individuals employed part-time in research and development. We also contracted with 22 contractors. We are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements and we consider relations with our employees to be excellent. 
             We hire full-time employees and contractors who are authorized to work in the United States through our wholly-owned subsidiary, CounterPath, LLC. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, CounterPath Technologies Inc. employs full-time employees and contractors who are authorized to work in Canada.
