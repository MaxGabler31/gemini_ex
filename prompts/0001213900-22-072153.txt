Item 1. Business
Company Overview



Zedge builds digital marketplaces and friendly competitive games around content that people use to express themselves. Our leading products include Zedge Ringtones and Wallpapers, a freemium digital content marketplace offering mobile phone wallpapers, video wallpapers, ringtones, and notification sounds which historically was branded as Zedge Premium, and GuruShots, a skill-based photo challenge game. Our vision is to connect creators who enjoy friendly competitions with a community of prospective consumers in order to drive commerce.



We are part of the ‘Creator Economy,’ where over 1 billion people create and share their content across social platforms, mobile, and video games, and content marketplaces. Within this group of individuals, over 200 million identify as creators, people who use their influence, skill, and creativity to amass an audience and monetize it. Furthermore, approximately 12% of full-time creators earn more than $50,000 per year, and 10% of influencers earn more than $100,000 per year. We view the Creator Economy as an untapped opportunity for Zedge to expand its business, especially as we execute by connecting our gamers with our marketplace.



The Zedge Ringtones and Wallpapers app (which is named “Zedge Wallpapers” in the App Store), which we refer to as our “Zedge App,” is a marketplace offering a wide array of mobile personalization content including wallpapers, video wallpapers, ringtones, and notification sounds, and is available both in Google Play and the App Store. As of July 31, 2022, our Zedge App has been installed nearly 569 million times since inception and, over the past two years, has had between 32.0 and 36.3 million monthly active users (“MAU”). MAU is a key performance indicator (“KPI”) that captures the number of unique users that used our Zedge App during the final 30 days of the relevant period. Our platform allows creators to upload content to our marketplace and avail it to our users either for free or for a price, via ‘Zedge Premium.’ In turn, our users utilize the content to personalize their phones and express their individuality.



In fiscal 2022 we introduced several new customer facing product features including ‘NFTs Made Easy’ and social and community features, all meant to improve customer engagement, MAU, and revenue growth over the long term. In addition, due to developments outside of our control, we migrated to a new ad mediation platform - Applovin MAX -, which monopolized internal resources and delayed the completion of other product initiatives we had planned for in fiscal 2022. Applovin paid us a one-time $2 million integration bonus and their performance has been on-par or better than our prior platform. Following the transition, work resumed on the delayed development and most have been rolled out as of September 30, 2022.



The Zedge App’s monetization stack consists of advertising revenue generated when users view advertisements when using the Zedge App or surfing our website, the in-app sale of Zedge Credits, our virtual currency, that is used to purchase Zedge Premium content, and a paid-subscription offering that provides an ad-free experience to users that purchase a monthly or annual subscription. As of July 31, 2022, we had 692,000 active paying subscribers.



In late 2021 we introduced NFT functionality to a limited number of Zedge Premium creators via ‘NFTs Made Easy’. Over time we believe this product enhancement has the potential to drive significant artist growth and revenue production. ‘NFTs Made Easy’ is an eco-friendly platform that enables artists and consumers to sell and purchase NFTs within the Zedge App even though they may lack deep knowledge and proficiency in the crypto space. All transactions are made using Zedge Credits.

In April 2022, we acquired GuruShots Ltd (“GuruShots”) a recognized category leader focused on gamifying the photography vertical. GuruShots offers a platform spanning iOS, Android, and the web that provides a fun, educational and structured way for amateur photographers to compete in a wide variety of contests showcasing their photos while gaining recognition with votes, badges, and awards. We estimate that the total addressable market of amateur photographers using their smartphones to take and publicly share artistic photos is 30-40 million people per month and that the market is still in its infancy. Every month, GuruShots stages more than 300 competitions that result in players uploading in excess of 1 million photographs and casting close to 4.5+ billion “perceived votes,” which are calculated by multiplying the number of votes that each player casts by a weighting factor based on various factors related to that user. To improve engagement, GuruShots has adopted a set of retention dynamics focused on individual, team and community dynamics that create a sense of belonging, inspiration, recognition, improvement, and competition.



Today, GuruShots utilizes a ‘Free-to-Play’ business model that leads to strong monetization with the purchase of resources that are used to give paying players an edge while still maintaining a fair and competitive experience for all participants. Over the past six years, the monthly average paying player spend has increased in excess of 14% annually to more than $55 per player.



As we look to the future, we are advancing several initiatives that we expect will drive user growth, increase engagement, drive in-app purchases, and advance our in-game economy. Some of these include:




● | On-Boarding. Revamping the customer onboarding experience in order to maximize first time purchasers by immediately drawing new players into simplified photo competitions that are limited to a small audience taking place in a short time duration. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Subscriptions. Introducing value-adds that we can bundle into a subscription. For example, we started testing a feed of short and engaging instructional videos that offer players techniques for improving their photographs. If users engage with this content, we expect to bundle it into a paid subscription. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Economy. Evolving the game economy by maturing the game’s progression mechanics and features, earn and spend dynamics, and introducing soft and premium currencies tied to resources and benefits. Furthermore, we hope to introduce an advertising layer in the monetization stack in the future. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We market GuruShots to prospective players, primarily via paid user acquisition channels, and utilize a host of creative formats including static and video ads in order to promote the game. Our marketing team invests material resources in analyzing all attributes of a campaign ranging from the creative assets, offer acquisition channel, and platform (i.e., iOS, Android, and web), just to name a few, with the goal of determining whether a specific campaign is likely to yield a profitable customer. When we unearth a successful combination of these variables we scale up until we experience diminishing returns. Ultimately, we believe that the efforts we are making to advance the product coupled with the investment in user acquisition can significantly increase GuruShots’ player base.



Beyond our commitment to growing both the Zedge App and GuruShots on a standalone basis, we believe that there are many potential synergies that we can capitalize on that exist between the two businesses. Specifically, we plan to enable the ability for GuruShots players to become Zedge Premium artists and sell their photos to our audience of 30+ million MAU as standard digital images or NFTs. In addition, we look to benefit from the experience that the GuruShots team possesses and test gamifying the Zedge App. We believe that successful gamification can contribute to increasing engagement, retention, and lifetime value, all critical KPIs for our business. Longer term, we believe that there are complementary content verticals that lend themselves to gamification.



In August 2021, we acquired Emojipedia Pty Ltd (“Emojipedia”), the world’s leading authority dedicated to providing up-to-date and well-researched emoji definitions, information, and news as well as World Emoji Day and the annual World Emoji Awards, and Emojitracker, which provides real time visualization of all emoji symbols used on Twitter. Emojipedia receives approximately 46.4 million monthly page views and has approximately 7.6 million monthly active users of which approximately 45.19% are located in well-developed markets. It is the top resource for all things emoji, offering insights into data and cultural trends. As a voting member of the Unicode Consortium, the standards body responsible for approving new emojis, Emojipedia works alongside major emoji creators including Apple, Google, Facebook, and Twitter.

We believe that Emojipedia provides growth potential to the Zedge App, and it was immediately accretive to earnings. In the past year, we have made many changes to Emojipedia including migrating to a new ad mediation platform, redesigning the Emojipedia website, and introducing localized versions of Emojipedia in Spanish, French, German, Italian, and Portuguese. We will continue to enhance this offering and are exploring new features including a native mobile offering as well as additional monetization opportunities.



Our Strategy



Our vision is to connect creators who enjoy friendly competitions with a community of prospective consumers in order to drive commerce.



Our Strategic Flywheel



Our long-term strategy calls for creating a flywheel that leverages the synergies of a “gaming and marketplace” dynamic across our portfolio, engaging communities of consumers with content that can function on a multitude of online and mobile platforms including social networks, messaging, and gaming. This is unlike the existing dynamic that many gaming platforms offer to players, who can create and sell virtual goods that are valuable only within the context of that particular ecosystem. Although the foundation of our strategy is currently centered around the Zedge App and GuruShots, over time we expect to expand into other content verticals that have relevance beyond gameplay.







Using our current products as an example, GuruShots is a skill-based game that attracts creators (mainly, amateur photographers) with friendly photo competitions in which they compete to gain recognition and pedigree. We believe that adding the ability to sell their content to the Zedge App’s 30+ million MAU is an attractive benefit that enables players not only to have fun, but also to earn money while doing so. This dual purpose will likely improve user growth, engagement, retention, and monetization while simultaneously expanding our relevance to a broader community interested in high-quality photographs. If our assumptions are correct, we will have a flywheel that drives the aforementioned KPIs while also enabling us to expand into new verticals (through internal development or acquisition), gamify them, and add new content to our marketplace.



Executing this strategy calls for concentrating our efforts on the following goals:




● | Continue growing our user base, profitably. We expect to continue devoting resources to growing our user base profitably by: 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | studying our users’ needs and enhancing our products to meet those needs; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | developing and offering new features and services that are attractive to both new and existing users; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | investing in paid user acquisition campaigns that yield profitable customers, based on empirical data and focused, primarily, on well-developed markets; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | expanding our reach by collaborating with strategic partners. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Improve monetization. Continue developing monetization methods that will help us grow, including advancements of the in-app economy, NFTs, subscription models, e-commerce, and new advertising products, implementations, and optimizations. We believe that our products and customer base are attractive to advertisers, brands, artists, and players and will yield new monetization opportunities. In addition, we expect that we will be able to capitalize on cross marketing our suite of products to this customer base. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Ongoing product and technology investment in and across our product suite. We plan to make continued, selected investments in product feature sets and functionality in order to both maintain our existing user base and attract new users. In addition, we envision applying our product expertise to verticals that we currently do not have in our portfolio, as well as gamifying the Zedge App. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Better utilize data to improve user acquisition and customer engagement. We plan to better utilize data to scale profitable user acquisition and improve the use of our product through personalized recommendations and content feeds, enhanced search and content discovery, and optimized pricing. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Building our marketplace into a best-of-breed platform for artists and creators. Our goal is to build our marketplace into one that artists view as prioritizing their needs and addressing all aspects of their marketing and revenue generation goals including, but not limited to, ease in managing their virtual storefront, promotion, education, reporting, and distribution. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increase our marketing efforts for our Zedge App. Historically, we haven’t invested materially in marketing initiatives for our Zedge App. Going forward, we envision the need to better promote our Zedge App and to amplify our Zedge App’s value proposition to artists and individual creators. We envisage these creators and influencers and brands self-promoting their availability on our Zedge App in order to extend their reach, generate incremental income and drive more end-user traffic to our platform. Furthermore, we also plan to scale up paid user acquisition focusing on users that we believe can yield profitable customers, and also continue to invest in app store optimization, search, marketing automation, social marketing, and community management in order to retain and expand our Zedge App’s customer base. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Diversify our revenue stack. Historically, the majority of our revenue has been derived from advertising. We plan to diversify our revenue by developing a subscription offer and introducing advertising into GuruShots. Furthermore, we expect to further our NFT offering, opening up the potential for trading revenue as well as revisiting print on demand, particularly with GuruShots’ player’s content. We also have a set of product initiatives specific to Emojipedia that will enable new revenue streams from this asset. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Selectively pursue strategic investments, partnerships, and acquisitions. On a selective basis, we will look to invest in, partner with, or purchase entities that can provide synergistic growth opportunities for our Zedge App and otherwise. For example, in April 2022 we acquired GuruShots and in August 2021 we acquired Emojipedia. Each of these acquisitions offers new growth opportunities both on a stand-alone basis as well as on an integrated and synergistic basis that we believe can impact our business in a materially positive fashion. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Competitive Advantages



We believe that the following competitive strengths will drive the growth of our business:




● | Large, global customer base. We benefit from having a large customer base. As of July 31, 2022, we had approximately 40 million MAU spanning across all of our products, of which approximately 27% were in well-developed markets and 73% were in emerging markets. Typically, customers in well-developed markets monetize at a material premium when compared to those in emerging markets. The Android version of our Zedge App is available in 17 languages and Emojipedia is available in 19 languages. We possess a highly diversified portfolio of content and attribute this in part to our global reach which makes us attractive to creators interested in meeting various customer tastes and preferences. In addition, our diverse customer base attracts advertisers seeking customers that have adequate disposable income to purchase their products and services. Our Zedge App’s large customer base is also a draw to artists and brands looking to market their content to a critical mass of users. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Leading global provider of mobile personalization content. Our Zedge App has a global customer base of approximately 32 million MAU, enabling users to easily personalize their mobile phones with a wide variety of free, high-quality ringtones, wallpapers, notification sounds, video wallpapers, custom app icons (only available for iOS), and NFTs. We believe that our Zedge App is well positioned for continued leadership in the personalization space. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Deep Knowledge of Gaming. We have leaders with years of experience in building and operating games of skill across digital platforms including iOS, Android, and web.

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Combining Gaming and a Real-world Activity. We have years of experience in combining game dynamics with a real-world activity. In the case of GuruShots the real-world activity is photography. Successfully combining these is non-trivial and requires a great deal of expertise and understanding that the team has acquired over the years. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | High-quality products. We do our best to provide our customers with high-quality products and superior user experiences. We prioritize our customers’ needs and believe that this focus is critical for our long-term growth and expansion. We invest significant resources in product development, design, and usability. We beta test product enhancements extensively and closely monitor customer feedback to ensure that we meet users’ needs. To date, our Zedge App has received more than 11 million reviews in Google Play where it boasts a 4.6 star rating out of a maximum of 5 stars. GuruShots has a 4.5 star rating in the App Store albeit from a universe of several thousand reviews. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Human Capital. We have a team of highly experienced professionals that take pride and ownership in their work product.

Competition



We face competition in all aspects of our business and especially from other digital marketplaces and gaming companies. In running our business, we need to account for:

● | Consumers. We compete for consumers’ leisure time, attention, and spending versus alternative forms of entertainment that are available to them as well as against online platforms and marketplaces that offer utility and content for mobile phone personalization. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Content creators. There are many online platforms that offer content creators an eco-system in which they can make their content available to consumers. Some of these platforms may have better incentives, paid or other, that may potentially make them more attractive than our marketplace. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Advertisers. We face significant competition in securing spend from advertisers. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Other Game Developers. Game developers that offer more engaging and interesting games. These competitors, many of whom we may not be aware of, may be more proficient at capitalizing on user acquisition channels in order to gain access to large user bases and their network effects to expand virally and quickly. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Alternative options and products for mobile personalization and emojis. There are many other marketplaces and platforms that offer mobile personalization content, games, and emoji resources, some of whom are better funded than we are. We believe that we possess a competitive advantage because of our: 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | large user base; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


○ | “one-stop shop” approach to mobile personalization, which avails customers of ringtones, wallpapers, notification sounds, and video wallpapers within the same Android app; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | flexibility that allows the customer to selectively choose what they would like to personalize without handing over the core elements of the native operating system to a third party and overwhelming the user with a myriad of complex options; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | large content catalog; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | recognized and well-respected brands; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | proprietary recommendation engine; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | market ranking and longevity. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Rapid-Paced and Changing World of Mobile App Development. The mobile app eco-system changes quickly and regularly with new apps capturing massive audiences competing for consumer’s time, mindshare, and money. This is an ongoing competitive threat requiring us to do our best to adapt as necessary to remain relevant and meaningful. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our History



In 2003, Tom Arnoy, Kenneth Sundnes, and Paul Shaw launched a consumer website at www.zedge.net that people used to upload and download ringtones.





6







In December 2006, IDT Corporation acquired 90% of Zedge. Zedge Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 2008, and our name was changed to Zedge, Inc. in 2016.



In 2009, we introduced the Android version of our Zedge App. The Zedge App provided ease of use by negating the need for customers to first download a ringtone or wallpaper to their computer and then upload that content to their mobile phone.



We launched the iOS version of our Zedge App in 2013, followed by the launch of the Windows Mobile Zedge App in 2014.



During 2014 and 2015, our Zedge App introduced app icons, social sharing features, and marketing automation capabilities, and expanded the number of languages supported.



In 2016, IDT Corporation spun off our stock to its stockholders, and our Class B Common Stock was listed on the NYSE American with the ticker symbol “ZDGE”.



In March 2018, we completed the launch of Zedge Premium, a section of our marketplace where artists can launch a virtual store and market, distribute, and sell their digital content, including wallpapers, video wallpapers, ringtones, and notification sounds to our users.



In January 2019, we started offering freemium Zedge App Android users the ability to convert into paying subscribers in exchange for removing unsolicited advertisements from our Zedge App. As of July 31, 2022, we had approximately 692,000 active subscribers. In fiscal 2023, we expect to launch subscriptions on iOS.



In August 2020, Jonathan Reich was promoted to Chief Executive Officer, and Yi Tsai was promoted to Chief Financial Officer.



On August 1, 2021, we acquired Emojipedia, the world’s leading authority dedicated to providing up-to-date and well-researched emoji definitions, information, and news as well as World Emoji Day and the annual World Emoji Awards, and Emojitracker, which provides real time visualization of all emoji symbols used on Twitter.



On December 14, 2021, we launched ‘NFTs Made Easy’ an NFT offering for artists and consumers that provides ease of use and negates the need for cryptocurrency experience and know-how. An artist only needs to upload their content as they normally would in the Zedge Premium Creator’s Portal, check the NFT option, and Zedge handles the rest seamlessly, from minting to gas fees. Additionally, consumers can buy the NFTs simply by using Zedge Credits purchased in their local currency.



On April 12, 2022, we acquired GuruShots, a recognized category leader that fuses photography with mobile gaming. GuruShots, headquartered in Israel, offers a platform spanning iOS, Android, and the web that gamifies photography by providing a fun, educational, and structured way for amateur photographers - essentially anyone with a mobile phone - to compete in a wide variety of contests showcasing their photos while gaining recognition with votes, badges, and awards. On a monthly basis, GuruShots users currently cast close to 4.5 billion “perceived votes” in more than 300 competitions. GuruShots currently generates revenue from selling digital resources that, if used skillfully, can provide additional visibility to competitors’ photographs, a critical factor in securing votes for competitive ranking.

Our Technology



Our eco-system is powered by a scalable distributed platform that is comprised of both open source and proprietary technologies centered on content management and discovery, web and app development, data mining and analytics, deep learning, mobile content/device compatibility, advertising, and reporting. We have built a robust platform that allows us to ideate, test, and launch where warranted by the outcome and we have embraced machine learning throughout our technology stack in order to improve content recommendations and relevancy. From an end user’s perspective, our platform minimizes response latency while maximizing content relevancy and discoverability. We optimize our platform by utilizing systems, algorithms, and heuristics that organize our content based on real user data and that renders the content in a relevant fashion. With GuruShots, we have added open source and proprietary technologies around gamification, including ranking algorithms that ensure fair exposure to all content in a competition, and real-time voting/ranking functionality at scale. Our infrastructure provides a fully redundant production environment in a cloud-hosted, virtual-server environment.
Intellectual Property



Our trademarks, copyrights, domain names, proprietary technology, know-how, and other intellectual property are vital to our success. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state, and common law rights in the United States and other countries, as well as contractual restrictions. We enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with our employees and business partners. The agreements we enter into with our employees also provide that all software, inventions, developments, works of authorship, and trade secrets created by them during the course of their employment are our property.



We have been granted trademark protection for “Zedge” in the United States, European Union, United Kingdom, India, and Canada, “Tonesync” in the European Union and the United Kingdom, “We Make Phones Personal,” and “Zedge, Everything You” in the United States and a stylized “D” logo in the European Union and the United Kingdom. We also have applied for trademark protection for “Tattoo your phone,” and “NFTs Made Easy” in the United States, a stylized “D” logo in the United States, Canada and India, and have obtained a copyright registration for our flagship app, Zedge. In addition, we have registered, amongst others, the following domain names: www.zedge.net and www.zedge.com.



On August 1, 2021, we acquired Emojipedia. As part of this acquisition, we acquired trademark registrations for “Emojipedia” in the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Australia, and trademark registrations for “World Emoji Day” in the United States and the United Kingdom. We also acquired the following domain name registrations: www.emojipedia.com and www.emojipedia.org.



On April 12, 2022, we acquired GuruShots Ltd. As part of this acquisition, we acquired, all intellectual property rights associated with, and encompassed within the GuruShots mobile and web-based applications, including the following domain name: GuruShots.com. In addition, we have applied for trademark protection for “GuruShots” in the United States, and have filed copyright applications for the GuruShots mobile and web-based applications.



Human Capital



Our headcount totaled 93 as of July 31, 2022, including 32 added from the GuruShots acquisition.

Facilities 



As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we ceased having a physical office in the United States in 2020. Yet, we still address commercial operations including accounting and finance, and business development from the New York area. In 2021, our Norwegian operations moved into a smaller Trondheim, Norway facility, with approximately 3,800 square feet of space, accommodates our product, design, and technology teams, and is under lease through March 2024. In May of 2022, we entered into a one-year sublease agreement for approximately 2,300 square feet of space for our team in Vilnius, Lithuania. We lease 1,550 square feet of space in Tel Aviv, Israel that accommodates the GuruShots team. That lease is due to expire in October 2024. Our servers are hosted in leased data centers in different geographic locations in the United States.
