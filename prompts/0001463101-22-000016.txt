Our Company
We are a global energy technology company. We deliver smart, easy-to-use solutions that manage solar generation, storage and communication on one platform. We revolutionized the solar industry with our microinverter technology and we produce a fully integrated solar-plus-storage solution. To date, we have shipped more than 42 million microinverters, and approximately 1.9 million Enphase residential and commercial systems have been deployed in more than 130 countries.
COVID-19 Update
We are actively monitoring, evaluating, and responding to developments relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in substantial manufacturing or supply chain problems, disruptions in local and global economies, volatility in the global financial markets, overall reductions in demand, delays in payment, restrictions on the shipment of our products, or other ramifications. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on further developments, including the duration and spread of the virus and its variants, impact on our end-customers’ spending, volume of sales, impact on our partners, suppliers, and employees and actions that may be taken by governmental authorities. The global supply chain and the semiconductor industry are experiencing challenges. We have seen supply chain challenges and logistics constraints increase, including component shortages, which have, in certain cases, caused delays in critical components and inventory and have resulted in increased costs. We continue to work to minimize the effects from supply chain constraints. Given the dynamic nature of these circumstances, the full impact of COVID-19 and other macroeconomic factors on our ongoing business, results of operations and overall financial performance cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Further information relating to the risks and uncertainties related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may be found in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Industry Background
Historically, traditional central inverters were the only inverter technology used for solar photovoltaic (“PV”) installations. In an installation consisting of a traditional central inverter, the solar PV modules are connected in series strings. In a large installation, there are multiple series strings connected in parallel. The aggregated voltage from each of these strings is then fed into a large central inverter. We believe that traditional central inverters have a number of design and performance challenges limiting innovation and their ability to reduce the cost of solar power systems, including the following:
•Productivity limits. If solar modules are wired using a traditional central inverter—group or “string” of modules are wired in series, and an entire string’s output is limited by the output of the lowest-performing module. Because of its string design, there is a single point of failure risk with the traditional central inverter approach.
•Reliability issues. Traditional central inverters are the single most common component of solar installations to fail, resulting in system downtime and adversely impacting total energy output. As a result, central inverters typically carry warranties of only 5 to 10 years.
•Complex design and installation requirements. The central inverter-based solar PV installation requires greater effort on the part of the installer, both in terms of design and on-site labor. Central inverter installations require string design and calculations for safe and reliable operation, as well as specialized equipment such as direct current (“DC”) combiners, conduits and disconnects. In addition, the use of high-voltage DC requires specialized knowledge and training and safety precautions to install central inverter technology.
•Lack of monitoring. The majority of solar installations with central inverter technology offer limited monitoring capabilities. If a module in a central inverter system fails or is not performing to specification, the resulting loss of energy can go unnoticed for an extended period of time.
•Safety issues. Central inverter solar PV installations have a wide distribution of high-voltage (600 volts to 1,000 volts) DC wiring. If damaged, DC wires can generate sustained electrical arcs, reaching temperatures of more than 5,000 °F. This creates the risk of fire for solar PV installation owners and injury for installers and maintenance personnel.
Enphase Energy, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 6


These challenges of traditional central inverters have a direct impact on the cost and expected return on investment of solar installations to both installers and system owners:
•Installer. Solar PV installers aim for simple installation design, fast installation times and maximum system performance and predictability. The installation of high-voltage DC central inverter technology, however, requires significant preparation, precautionary safety measures, time-consuming string calculations, extensive design expertise and specialized installation equipment, training and knowledge. Together, these factors significantly increase complexity and cost of installation and limit overall productivity for the installer.
•System owner. Solar power system owners aim for high energy production, low cost, high reliability, and low maintenance requirements, as well as reduced fire risks. With traditional central inverters, owners often are unable to optimize the size or shape of their solar PV installations due to string design limitations. As such, they experience performance loss from shading and other obstructions, can face frequent system failures and lack the ability to effectively monitor the performance of their solar PV installation. In addition, central inverter installations operate at high-voltage DC which bears significant fire risks. Further, due to their large size, central inverter installations can affect architectural aesthetics of the house or commercial building.
The solar industry is transitioning from solar only systems to complete energy management solutions, which consist of solar-plus storage and load control.
Our Products
We design, develop, manufacture and sell home energy solutions that manage energy generation, energy storage and control and communications on one intelligent platform. We have revolutionized the solar industry by bringing a systems approach to solar technology and by pioneering a semiconductor-based microinverter that converts energy at the individual solar module level and, combined with our proprietary networking and software technologies, provides advanced energy monitoring and control. This is vastly different than a central inverter system using string modules, with or without an optimizer, approach that only converts energy of the entire array of solar modules from a single high voltage electrical unit and lacks intelligence about the energy producing capacity of the solar array. The Enphase Energy System, powered by IQ™ Microinverters and IQ™ Batteries, our current generation integrated solar, storage, and energy management offering, enables self-consumption and delivers our core value proposition of yielding more energy, simplifying design and installation, and improving system uptime and reliability. The IQ family of microinverters, like all of our previous microinverters, is fully compliant with NEC 2014 and 2017 rapid shutdown requirements. Unlike string inverters, this capability is built-in, with no additional equipment necessary.
The Enphase Energy System brings a high technology, networked approach to solar generation plus energy storage, by leveraging our design expertise across power electronics, semiconductors and cloud-based software technologies. Our integrated approach to energy solutions maximizes a home’s energy potential while providing advanced monitoring and remote maintenance capabilities. The Enphase Energy System with IQ uses a single technology platform for seamless management of the whole solution, enabling rapid commissioning with the Enphase Installer App™; consumption monitoring with Enphase IQ Gateway™ with IQ Combiner+™, Enphase App™, a cloud-based energy management platform, and our IQ Battery™. System owners can use the Enphase App to monitor their home’s solar generation, energy storage and consumption from any web-enabled device. Unlike some of our competitors, who utilize a traditional inverter, or offer separate components of solutions, we have built-in system redundancy in both PV generation and energy storage, eliminating the risk that comes with a single-point of failure. Further, the nature of our cloud-based, monitored system allows for remote firmware and software updates, enabling cost-effective remote maintenance and ongoing utility compliance.
The Enphase IQ7™ microinverter and Enphase IQ7+™ microinverter, part of our seventh-generation IQ product family, support high-powered 60-cell and 72-cell solar modules and integrate with alternating current (“AC”) modules. Our IQ7X™ microinverter addresses 96-cell PV modules up to 400W DC and with its 97.5% California Energy Commission (“CEC”) efficiency rating, is ideal for integration into high power modules.
During 2020, we started shipping our IQ7A™ for high-power monofacial and bifacial solar modules to customers in Australia and Europe. Our IQ7A microinverters, which began shipping to customers in North America in November 2019, support up to 450W high-power modules, targeting high-power residential and commercial applications. Our customers will be able to pair the IQ7A microinverter with monofacial or bifacial solar modules, up 
Enphase Energy, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 7


to 450 W, from solar module manufacturers who are expected to introduce high-power variants of their products in the next three years.
AC Module (“ACM”) products are integrated systems which allow installers to be more competitive through improved logistics, reduced installation times, faster inspection and training. We continue to make steady progress with our ACM partners, including SunPower Corporation, Panasonic Corporation of North America, LONGi Solar, Solaria Corporation, Hanwha Q CELLS, and Maxeon Solar Technologies, Sonnenstromfabrik (CS Wismar GmBH), and DMEGC Solar.
We introduced our Enphase IQ Battery storage systems, with usable and scalable capacity of 10.1 kWh and 3.4 kWh, based on Ensemble OS™ energy management technology, which powers the world’s first grid-independent microinverter-based storage system to customers in North America during the second quarter of 2020. The Enphase IQ™ Battery storage systems feature Enphase embedded grid-forming microinverters that enable the Always-On capability that keeps homes powered when the grid goes down, and the ability to save money when the grid is up. These systems are now compatible with both new and existing Enphase IQ solar systems with M-series™, IQ6™ and IQ7™ microinverters. In January 2021, we announced expanded compatibility of the Enphase Energy System with our M-series microinverters and string inverters. The expanded compatibility provides approximately 300,000 additional Enphase system owners with the possibility of achieving grid-agnostic energy resilience through the Enphase Upgrade Program. The program provides solar installers the opportunity to renew engagements with the installed base of Enphase system owners through microinverter, solar, and energy storage upgrades, and reflects our continued commitment to reliability, service, and long-term customer relationships.
We started production shipments of Enphase IQ Batteries to customers in North America during the second quarter of 2020, to customers in Germany during the second quarter of 2021, and to customers in Belgium in October 2021.
During the second quarter of 2021, we introduced Load Control for our Enphase IQ Battery storage systems. Load control allows homeowners to decide what gets power in their home in the event of a grid outage, with the ability to choose up to four loads. These loads will be on when the grid is present and shed automatically in the event of a grid failure. We began shipping our IQ Load Controller™, which includes updated features, in December 2021. This product will make installation simpler and save time for installers
On October 21, 2021, we announced that our home energy systems will soon integrate with most leading models of home standby AC generators, providing enhanced performance and a glitch-free transition for homeowners during power outages. Homeowners can also monitor real-time power flow, start and stop their generator remotely, set quiet hours to prevent their generator from operating until their batteries fall below a designated threshold, and control it all with the Enphase App. The new feature functions without a generator automatic transfer switch and eliminates the power glitches that reset home electronic appliances when switching to generator power.
On October 25, 2021, we announced our Enphase Energy System with IQ8™ solar microinverters for customers in North America and started shipping IQ8 products in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our investment in custom application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips has resulted in a software-defined microinverter smart enough to form a microgrid, a self-sufficient energy system that serves a discrete geographic footprint. Many homeowners often assume that their solar systems will function if the sun is shining, even during a utility outage. This has unfortunately not been true until the introduction of IQ8. Now, with IQ8 homeowners can realize the true promise of solar — to make and use their own power. IQ8 solar microinverters can provide Sunlight Backup during an outage, even without a battery.
In 2021, we announced our participation in the ConnectedSolutions program which is an incentive program implemented by two utilities in the Northeast region of the U.S. to reduce electrical demand during high-use periods. Enphase Storage customers in Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island can sign-up, monitor, track money earned, and control participation in the program using the Enphase App. In addition, we announced during the third quarter of 2021 our participation in Hawaiian Electric’s Battery Bonus grid services program. This program offers a new incentive for homeowners on the island of Oahu to install a new home battery. These grid services programs enable utilities to leverage the IQ Battery instead of turning on polluting peaker plants, while generating an income stream for the IQ Battery owner. Facilitating grid services participation for our customers intended to reduce the lifetime cost of Enphase IQ Batteries and help drive increased demand.

Recent Acquisitions
In January of 2021, we acquired Sofdesk Inc. (“Sofdesk”), which provides design and proposal software. In March of 2021, we acquired the solar design services business of DIN Engineering Services LLP (“DIN”), which provides proposal and permitting services, and is focused on automating the creation of permit plan sets to further expand the installer base. We acquired 365 Pronto, Inc (“365 Pronto”) in December of 2021, which offers a predictive software platform dedicated to simplifying the cleantech service landscape by matching cleantech asset owners to a local and on-demand workforce of service providers. On December 31, 2021, we acquired ClipperCreek, Inc. (“ClipperCreek”), which offers electric vehicle (EV) charging solutions for residential and commercial customers in the U.S. The increasing penetration of EVs has implications for home energy management, as households not only consume significantly more power with an EV, but also have a large battery that can be used for both backup and grid services. This acquisition leverages our power conversion and software platform to manage loads and resources within the home.
Our home energy systems are architected to efficiently manage generation, storage, and consumption resources in the home to ensure the best customer experience. During 2021, we also introduced generator compatibility and grid services products as part of our home energy systems. These systems are integrated with most leading models of home standby AC generators, providing enhanced performance and a glitch-free transition for homeowners during power outages. Homeowners can also monitor real-time power flow, start, and stop their generator remotely, set quiet hours to prevent their generator from operating until their batteries fall below a certain state of charge, and control it all with the Enphase App.

Intellectual Property
We operate in an industry in which innovation, investment in new ideas and protection of our intellectual property rights are critical for success. We protect our technology through a variety of means, including through patent, trademark, copyright and trade secrets laws in the U.S. and similar laws in other countries, confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements. As of December 31, 2021, we had 250 issued U.S. patents, 79 issued foreign patents, 71 pending U.S. patent applications and 60 pending foreign counterpart patent applications. Our issued patents are scheduled to expire between years 2022 and 2046. There are no significant patents expiring in 2022.
We have licensed certain technologies for application in hardware and software in our products. Such licenses are generally fully-paid, royalty-free licenses. Given the volume and pace of new patents worldwide, it may become necessary in the future to license intellectual property on terms that are yet unknown to us, and that may be less favorable than licenses in the past. In addition, we license open source software from various third parties for use in hardware and software. Such open source software is licensed under open source licenses and we take efforts to maintain compliance with such licenses.
We continually assess the need for patent protection for those aspects of our technology that we believe provide significant competitive advantages. A majority of our patents relate to DC to AC power conversion, energy storage devices, and related energy environments.
With respect to proprietary know-how that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests. We believe that many elements of our microinverter and storage manufacturing processes involve proprietary know-how, technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications, including technical processes, test equipment designs, algorithms and procedures.
We own or have rights to various trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and in other countries, including Enphase, the Enphase “e”, IQ, Ensemble OS, Encharge, Envoy, Enpower and Enlighten. We rely on both registration of our marks as well as common law protection where available.
All of our research and development personnel have entered into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us. These agreements address intellectual property protection and require our employees to assign to us all of the inventions, designs and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us.
We also require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our technology or business plans.
As part of our overall strategy to protect our intellectual property, we may take legal actions to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property or from otherwise gaining access to our technology.
Government Regulations
Our business activities are global and are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws, rules and regulations. For example, substantially all of our import operations are subject to complex trade and customs laws, regulations and tax requirements such as sanctions orders or tariffs set by governments through mutual agreements or unilateral actions. In addition, the countries in which our products are manufactured or imported may from time to time impose additional duties, tariffs or other restrictions on our imports or adversely modify existing restrictions. Changes in tax policy or trade regulations, the disallowance of tax deductions on imported merchandise, or the imposition of new tariffs on imported products, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures and results of operations.
Privacy and Security Laws
There are privacy and data security laws to which we are currently subject, and/or may in the future be subject. Every U.S. state, members of the European Economic Area, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Brazil, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, China, and many other jurisdictions in which we operate have adopted privacy and data security laws and regulations which impose significant compliance obligations.
Enphase Energy, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 11


The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which is wide-ranging in scope, imposes several requirements relating to a variety of matters, including the control over personal data by individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the documentation we must maintain, the security and confidentiality of the personal data, data breach notification, and the use of third-party processors in connection with the processing of personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data outside of the EU, provides an enforcement authority and authorizes the imposition of large penalties for noncompliance, including the potential for significant fines. The GDPR requirements apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries, including employee information. The GDPR has increased our responsibility and potential liability in relation to all types of personal data that we process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR, which could divert management’s attention and increase our cost of doing business. However, despite our ongoing efforts to bring our practices into compliance with the GDPR, we may not be successful either due to various factors within our control or other factors outside our control.
Additionally, we are governed by a California state privacy law called the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), which contains requirements similar to GDPR for the handling of personal information of California residents. The CCPA establishes a privacy framework for covered businesses, including an expansive definition of personal information and data privacy rights for California residents. The CCPA includes a framework with potentially severe statutory damages and private rights of action. The CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the CCPA), and new ways for such consumers to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and to allow for a new cause of action for data breaches. Further, California voters approved a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) in the November 3, 2020 election. Effective starting on January 1, 2023, the CPRA will significantly modify the CCPA, including by expanding the consumers’ rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information. The CPRA also creates a new state agency that will be vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA and the CPRA. New legislation proposed or enacted in various other states will continue to shape the data privacy environment nationally. For example, on March 2, 2021, Virginia enacted the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“CDPA”), which becomes effective on January 1, 2023, and on June 8, 2021, Colorado enacted the Colorado Privacy Act (“CPA”) which takes effect on July 1, 2023. The CPA and CDPA are similar to the CCPA and CPRA, but aspects of these state privacy statutes remain unclear, resulting in further legal uncertainty.
The GDPR, CCPA, CPRA, CPA and CDPA exemplify the vulnerability of our business to the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data. Other states in the U.S. have passed or are considering privacy laws, and additional countries have in recent years implemented new privacy laws. Our compliance costs and potential liability may increase with this scattered regulatory environment.
Seasonality
Historically, the majority of our revenues are from the North American and European regions which experience higher sales of our products in the second, third and fourth quarters and have been affected by seasonal customer demand trends, including weather patterns and construction cycles. The first quarter historically has had softer customer demand in our industry, due to these same factors. Although these seasonal factors are common in the solar sector, historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance. 
Government Incentives
U.S. federal, state, and local government bodies, as well as non-U.S. government bodies provide incentives to owners, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of solar energy systems to promote solar energy in the form of rebates, tax credits, lower VAT rate and other financial incentives such as system performance payments, payments for renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation and exclusion of solar energy systems from property tax assessments. The market for on‑grid applications, where solar power is used to supplement a customer’s electricity purchased from the utility network or sold to a utility under tariff, often depends in large part on the availability and size of these government subsidies and economic incentives, which vary by geographic market and from time to time, thus helping to catalyze customer acceptance of solar energy as an alternative to utility-provided power. The disallowance or changes in government subsidies or economic incentives could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
Our revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019 and first quarter of 2020 was positively impacted by the scheduled phase-down of the investment tax credit for solar projects under Section 48(a) (the “ITC”) of the Internal Revenue 
Enphase Energy, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 12


Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). The Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act of 2008 provided a 30% federal tax credit for residential and commercial solar installations through December 31, 2019, which was reduced to a tax credit of 26% for any solar energy system that began construction during 2020 through December 31, 2022, and 22% thereafter to December 31, 2023 before being reduced to 10% for commercial installations and 0% for residential installations beginning on January 1, 2024. As a result, several of our customers explored opportunities to purchase products in 2019 to take advantage of safe harbor guidance from the IRS published in June 2018, allowing them to preserve the historical 30% investment tax credit for solar equipment purchased in 2019 for solar projects that are completed after December 31, 2019.

Compensation Philosophy
Our compensation philosophy creates the framework for our rewards strategy. We have a pay-for-performance culture that ties compensation to the performance of the individual and our company. We provide competitive compensation programs that focus on the following five key elements:
•Pay-for-performance: Reward and recognize leading contributors and high potential employees by paying market competitive total direct compensation, which includes base salary, quarterly bonus or commission, and stock-based compensation;
•External market-based research: Pay levels that are competitive with respect to the labor markets and industries in which we compete for talent;
•Internal equity: Maintaining internally consistent and non discriminatory pay and pay practices;
•Fiscal responsibility: Providing programs in line with economic conditions and our company’s financial health; and
•Legal compliance: Ensure the organization is legally compliant in all states and countries in which we operate.
Health and Wellness
We invest in our employees through high-quality benefits and various health and wellness initiatives. Our benefits packages provide a balance of protection along with the flexibility to meet the individual needs of our employees.
