Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a leading online visibility management software-as-a-service platform. We enable companies globally to identify and reach the right audience for their content, in the right context, and through the right channels. Online visibility represents how effectively companies connect with consumers across a variety of digital channels, including search, social and digital media, digital public relations, and review websites. The evolving online landscape and information overload from online content have made it increasingly difficult for companies to understand and manage their online visibility. Our proprietary software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) platform enables us to aggregate and enrich trillions of data points collected from over 200 million unique domains. Our platform enables our customers to understand trends and act upon unique insights to improve their online visibility, drive high-quality traffic to their websites and social media pages, as well as online listings, distribute highly targeted content to their customers, and measure the effectiveness of their digital marketing campaigns. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, our differentiated platform empowered over 537,000 and 404,000 active free customers, respectively, and over 82,000 and 67,000 paying customers, respectively, in over 145 and 142 countries, respectively. 
As interactions between companies and their customers continue to shift online, managing a company’s online visibility has become critical. With over 4.9 billion internet users in the third quarter of 2020, according to Internet World Stats, and consumers worldwide spending an average of over six and a half hours per day online, according to GlobalWebIndex, digital channels are essential for customer engagement. While these digital channels have made it easier for companies to have an online presence, with so many different sources of media competing for customers’ attention, it has become increasingly difficult for companies to be discovered by, and engage with, their customers. Most companies do not have the technology or resources to effectively ingest, aggregate, process, and analyze the vast amount of fragmented data from these diverse sources at scale to derive actionable insights. Companies often attempt to address individual aspects of online visibility, such as search engine optimization (“SEO”), search engine marketing (“SEM”), content marketing, social media management (“SMM”), digital public relations (“PR”), and competitive intelligence, among others. Fully integrated solutions are more likely to drive long-term traffic improvement than siloed approaches, offering more comprehensive functionality and insights, and combining strategies across owned, earned, and paid media.
Our fully integrated SaaS platform leverages our proprietary technology, differentiated data, and actionable insights to improve online visibility. We utilize machine learning capabilities to synthesize broad and deep data sets to derive actionable insights and analytics. Our ability to aggregate, crawl, and process massive data sets, including search engine, website traffic, backlink, online advertising, panel, and social media data, combined with our ability to obtain data from our customers through APIs, enables our software to generate a comprehensive view of a company’s online visibility profile and identify the specific keywords, advertisements, third-party websites, and content that are driving traffic. Our SaaS platform creates significant network effects as we grow the number of our customers and our customers provide us with more data. By combining our customer data with our own market data, we are able to improve our algorithms and, in turn, increase the accuracy of our metrics and analytics. We also integrate with third-party solutions to create comprehensive end-to-end workflows across the entire marketing funnel. These workflows include analyzing trends, identifying potential opportunities to optimize visibility, creating high-quality content efficiently, helping customers assess different marketing approaches, executing campaigns regularly, and measuring the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns. As a result, we empower companies to improve their online visibility across key channels through a holistic strategy.
In a highly fragmented market with a myriad of network- and channel-specific solutions, our differentiated and integrated platform provides comprehensive insights into a company’s online visibility. 
Some large technology platforms including Google and Facebook offer their own solutions but are incentivized to prioritize their own paid channels, lack independence, and do not operate across rival networks. Meanwhile, individual solutions targeted at addressing one or a subset of business problems, or point solutions, rely on limited, channel-specific data, providing only partial, incomplete perspectives. Our technology collects, aggregates, and enriches a broad set of fragmented data across networks and channels, which we leverage to derive valuable and actionable insights that we provide our customers. As our data assets grow, our ability to provide insights improves, attracting more customers to our platform and enabling us to invest in new and existing products, thereby further strengthening our competitive position. According to G2.com, Inc. (“G2”), our platform is listed as a leader in the “all segments” category, comprised of reviewers from each of the small-business, mid-market and enterprise segments (as G2 defines such categories), across 19 product categories, including SEO, competitive intelligence, marketing analytics, content analytics, and social media analytics, which reinforces the strategic advantages of providing a comprehensive solution. G2 ranks different products and vendors based on reviews gathered from its user community (subject to certain minimum requirements concerning sample size and reviewer composition), as well as data aggregated from online sources and social networks, to which it applies its proprietary algorithm to calculate satisfaction and market presence scores ranging from 0 to 100 from which the products are ranked.
We offer our solutions on a multi-price point, recurring subscription basis, which provides incremental levels of access to our over 50 products, tools, and add-ons across online visibility management. Some customers start using our products, tools, and add-ons on a free basis before purchasing a subscription to receive premium functionality and additional user licenses. Our compelling value proposition, effective go-to-market strategy, and recurring revenue model drives efficient unit economics. These attributes have enabled us to cost-effectively acquire over 82,000 paying customers as of December 31, 2021 and over 67,000 paying customers as of December 31, 2020, spanning a broad range of industries and geographies.
We utilize a highly efficient, low-touch sales approach focused on driving customers to our platform through a self-service model, allowing our sales team to focus on retention and account expansion. Our multi-price point structure also drives meaningful upsell opportunities through higher usage limits, greater product functionality, additional user licenses, and product add-ons, as reflected by our dollar-based net revenue retention rate of 126% and 114% as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and our compounded average annual revenue growth rate of over 50% between the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2021. We have introduced several new add-on offerings, which have enabled us to grow our ARR per paying customer from $2,123 as of December 31, 2020 to $2,584 as of December 31, 2021. We define ARR as the daily revenue of all paid subscription agreements that are actively generating revenue as of the last day of the reporting period multiplied by 365, except that we calculate the ARR from Prowly’s customers as the monthly recurring revenue as of the last month of the reporting period multiplied by 12. We include both monthly recurring paid subscriptions, which renew automatically unless cancelled, as well as the annual recurring paid subscriptions so long as we do not have any indication that a customer has cancelled or intends to cancel its subscription and we continue to generate revenue from them. 
Our success is driven by our experienced leadership team and culture of continuous innovation. We have been led by our co-founders, Oleg Shchegolev and Dmitry Melnikov, since our inception 13 years ago. Our culture is driven by a collaborative and innovative leadership style, which has allowed us to expand from a single product in 2008 to our comprehensive online visibility management SaaS platform comprised of over 50 products, tools, and add-ons today.
Our capital efficient model has enabled us to grow to $213.1 million in ARR as of December 31, 2021 from $144.2 million in ARR as of December 31, 2020. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, our revenue was $188.0 million and $124.9 million, respectively, representing growth of 51%. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, our net loss was $3.3 million and $7.0 million, respectively.
The Benefits of Our Solution
The key benefits of our solution include:
•Robust, proprietary technology platform. We developed our technology platform over the last 13 years, leveraging machine learning to aggregate, cleanse, and analyze an immense amount of proprietary and third-party unstructured data. Our data assets include over 200 million domains, 21 billion keywords, click stream panel data from billions of events per week, over 41 trillion backlinks, over 17 billion URLs crawled per day on average, 310 million Google Display Network banner advertisements, and a range of data aggregated from social media networks, all of which scale continuously as customers use our platform.
•All-in-one SaaS solution to provide comprehensive online visibility. Our software products cover key aspects of online visibility, including SEO, SEM, content, advertising, competitive research, SMM, and digital PR. Our comprehensive solution is built with differentiated insights into traffic sources for specific sites, analysis of drivers of traffic to a company’s and its competitors’ websites, the keywords that are driving this traffic, and the effectiveness of a company’s content marketing strategy. 
•End-to-end workflows with third-party integrations. Our platform maintains a range of seamless third-party integrations for data, workflow, and reporting capabilities, enabling our customers to manage every critical step in optimizing their online visibility. Notable integrations include Google Analytics, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Domo, Yext, and Microsoft Outlook.

•Strong value proposition. Our comprehensive product suite delivers differentiated insights through a singular platform that enables companies to efficiently manage online visibility, reduce traffic acquisition costs, promote consumer engagement, minimize the cost associated with managing multiple third-party vendors, and acquire new customers.
Our Growth Strategies
The key elements of our growth strategy include:
•Acquire new customers. We expect to continue to target new customers who have not yet adopted online visibility management solutions and those who are currently using our free offering. Our sales model for new customers is highly efficient due to our low-friction, self-service onboarding capabilities that allow us to acquire new customers with relatively low sales investment. Additionally, we monitor the conversion of free customers to paying customers.
•Expand the use of our platform by our existing paying customer base. Our substantial base of over 82,000 paying customers as of December 31, 2021 presents a significant opportunity to increase monetization. We expect to continue to grow our revenue from our existing customers as they seek to add premium features and additional user licenses, as reflected by our dollar-based net revenue retention rate of 126% as of December 31, 2021.
•Continue to innovate and develop new products and features. We continue to invest in research and development to enhance our platform and release new products and features while bolstering one of the largest independent data sets for online visibility. We maintain close 
relationships with our customer base who provide us with frequent and real-time feedback, which we leverage to rapidly update and optimize our platform. The release of new products, tools, add-ons, and features has enabled us to drive higher monetization over time as we have increased our ARR per paying customer to $2,584 as of December 31, 2021 from $2,123 as of December 31, 2020. For example, we released our premium competitive intelligence tool in the first quarter of 2019 and in three years have scaled it to over $11.1 million in ARR.
•Pursue opportunistic M&A. Our management team expects to continue to allocate resources to identify, evaluate, and execute strategic acquisitions. For example, we acquired Prowly.com Sp. z o. o. (“Prowly”) in August 2020 to expand our technological capabilities and solutions offerings. Prowly significantly accelerated our product expansion into the digital PR software space and added four new product categories, as defined by G2, to our product portfolio. 
Our Platform
Our SaaS platform has been purpose-built to help companies manage their online visibility and ensure they identify and reach the right audience in the right context and through the right channels. We utilize proprietary technology and machine learning capabilities to aggregate, cleanse, and analyze broad and deep datasets to derive differentiated insights and analytics for our customers to manage their online visibility. Our unique set of data assets have been developed over the last 13 years as our network of customers has grown and includes over 200 million domains, 21 billion keywords, click stream panel data from billions of events per week, over 41 trillion backlinks, over 17 billion URLs crawled per day on average, 310 million Google Display Network banner advertisements, and a range of data aggregated from social media networks.
We obtain data through a mix of proprietary and third-party data sources. Our data sources include:
•Data we collect from websites algorithmically through our proprietary data collection techniques, including web crawling of third-party websites; 
•Data purchased from independent third-party data providers, which includes clickstream data, search engine data, online advertising data, and data from social media sources; and
•Reference data that our customers grant us access to, which includes our customers’ website and social media data. We obtain social media data through APIs that connect to social media platform operators, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, and LinkedIn. 
We integrate with a wide range of third-party solutions to seamlessly create comprehensive end-to-end workflows across the key components of a company’s online strategy. These workflows include analyzing trends, identifying potential opportunities, creating high-quality content efficiently, helping customers assess different marketing approaches, executing campaigns regularly, and measuring the effectiveness of their digital marketing campaigns. Our intuitive, easy-to-use platform prioritizes customer experience and collaboration to empower companies to develop a holistic strategy for their online visibility across key channels.
We have developed our technology platform over the last 13 years. Since our founding in 2008, our platform has evolved through technology innovation as we have added new products, tools, and features. We currently offer over 50 digital online visibility products, tools, and add-ons across SEO, SEM, content marketing, market research, advertising research, local marketing, reporting, social media management, and digital PR.
Our Business Model
We offer our paid products and tools to customers via monthly or annual subscription plans, as well as one-time and ongoing add-ons. Our subscription-based model enables customers to select a plan based on their needs and license our platform on a per month basis. We currently have three paid subscription tiers for our core product, Pro, Guru, and Business, as well as several add-ons for an incremental cost. We offer time-limited free trials, which allow prospective customers to test the functionality of our Pro or Guru plans for a limited period of time. At the end of the trial period, prospective customers either become paying customers or are switched to free customers.
Free. Our free offering grants access to our platform and limits the number of results, keywords to track, and projects. Free accounts help generate demand for our paid offerings as active free customers experience the capabilities and functionality of our platform and are prompted to upgrade to a paid membership when they reach free customer usage limits.
Pro. Pro provides access to our platform and ongoing software updates. With Pro, customers have the ability to run their SEO, PPC, and SMM projects with over 50 advanced tools and features.
Guru. Guru provides the same features as Pro, with the addition of Content Marketing Platform, historical data, extended limits, and Google Data Studio Integration. 
Business. Business provides all of the same features as Guru, plus white label reports, API access, extended limits and sharing options, and share of voice metric. 
We have a demonstrated track record of upgrading customers to higher price point plans. Customers upgrade to higher price point plans to increase usage limits and add features, including content marketing tools and historical data tracking. Within our subscription tiers, customers have the ability to purchase increased usage limits by adding the ability to create additional projects, keywords to track, and user licenses without moving to a higher price point plan. Our dynamic pricing model enables our customers to tailor a plan that is suitable for their strategic needs and affords us the ability to expand within our customer base as customers seek additional functionality from our platform. Paying customers who discontinue their subscriptions have the option to return as paying customers at a future time, continue to use our products and tools that are available to free customers, or discontinue using our products and tools entirely.
Additionally, we offer add-ons that are not included in our subscription plans and are sold on a one-time or monthly basis depending on the add-on. Our add-ons include: local listing management tools, 
Market Explorer, our competitive intelligence tool, and Semrush Marketplace, which can enhance customers’ existing subscriptions.
Sales & Marketing
Our customer acquisition model is focused on promoting our brand, increasing market awareness of our platform and products, and driving customer demand, and a strong sales pipeline. We utilize our products to manage our online visibility and reach our prospective customers. Additionally, we use several other online marketing initiatives, including online advertising, webinars, blogs, podcasts, ebooks, customer success studies, and the Semrush Academy to build our brand and engage with our customer community. The Semrush Academy is a free online learning program that offers 48 courses across three languages, has served over 630,000 students, and has issued over 235,000 certificates. The Semrush Academy increases our brand awareness within the marketing community and helps us crowdsource best practices and innovations that we use to improve our existing offerings, advance new products, grow our brand, and engage with the marketing community. 
After attracting a prospective customer to our site, we utilize a highly efficient, low-touch sales approach focused on driving customers to our platform through a self-service model. Customers often begin using our products either on a free basis or immediately become paying customers. Our sales team is largely focused on driving increased subscriptions of existing paying customers by encouraging our customers to fully recognize the potential benefit from the comprehensive platform we offer. We strive to increase monetization from paying customers as they seek to add additional features within our higher priced subscription plans, purchase additional user licenses, purchase add-ons, and renew existing subscriptions. 
Our sales organization is comprised of sales development representatives, onboarding specialists, sales executives, and our customer success team.
•Sales development representatives engage free customers to help them better understand our software and lead them towards a purchase that aligns with their specific needs.
•Onboarding specialists focus on engaging new paid customers to help them better understand our software and lead them towards products, tools, and add-ons that align with their unique use cases.
•Sales executives are responsible for managing customer engagement and increasing monetization of existing paying customers.
•Our customer success team is responsible for product demonstrations and training, assisting with onboarding and implementing our solutions, and ongoing client support.
We maintain partnerships with agencies and affiliates to further increase brand awareness and generate customer demand. Our agency partners have the ability to use tools to onboard clients onto our platform and are paid a commission. Our Semrush affiliate programs further increase our brand awareness and help generate customer demand by offering a commission on each new subscription, renewal of subscription or trial activation through an affiliate’s promotion. These relationships collectively accounted for less than 10% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021.
As of December 31, 2021, we had 371 full-time employees in our sales and marketing organization.
Product and Development
Our product and development team has delivered high-quality products and new capabilities to increase the functionality of our platform and maximize the value we deliver to our customers. Our 
product development organization plays a critical role in maintaining the effectiveness and differentiation of our technology in an evolving landscape and maximizing retention of our existing customers. Our online visibility management platform depends on innovating new tools and features to continually improve our offerings. We work closely with our customers and partners to understand their needs and incorporate their feedback as we innovate our platform.
We invest substantial resources in research and development to continue to drive our technology innovation. Our research and development efforts are focused on designing, testing, and refining our products, as well as operating and scaling our technology infrastructure. We will continue our investment to improve and increase our data assets, the accuracy of results, and the integration of new data assets. We plan to focus research and development investments to increase the functionality of our online visibility platform in order to adapt to the latest changes in the digital marketing landscape and ensure our platform maintains leading technology innovations. Research and development expenses accounted for $24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.
