ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Delphi Technologies PLC (“Delphi Technologies,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”) is a leader in the development, design and manufacture of vehicle propulsion systems that optimize engine performance, increase vehicle efficiency, reduce emissions, improve driving performance, and support increasing electrification of vehicles. We are a global supplier to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) of both light vehicles (passenger cars, trucks, vans and sport-utility vehicles) and commercial vehicles (light-duty, medium-duty and heavy-duty trucks; commercial vans; buses and off-highway vehicles). In addition, we manufacture and sell our products and provide value added services to leading aftermarket companies, including independent retailers and wholesale distributors.
On December 4, 2017, Delphi Technologies became an independent publicly-traded company, formed under the laws of Jersey, as a result of the separation of the Powertrain Systems segment, which included the aftermarket operations, from Aptiv PLC, formerly known as Delphi Automotive PLC (the “Former Parent”). References hereinafter to “Delphi Technologies,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” include the results of the Powertrain Systems segment. The separation was completed in the form of a pro-rata distribution to the Former Parent’s shareholders of 100% of the ordinary shares of Delphi Technologies PLC (the “Separation”). 
Our product portfolio includes advanced gasoline and diesel fuel injection systems, actuators, valvetrain products, sensors, electronic control modules and power electronics technologies. We believe our product portfolio enables our customers to meet regulatory requirements for reduced emissions and improved fuel economy and provide additional power for more in-vehicle functionality.

Our Segments
Our business operates in two segments, which are grouped on the basis of similar product, market and operating factors:
Powertrain Systems. This segment offers high quality components and complete engine management systems to help optimize performance, emissions and fuel economy.
Internal Combustion Engine (“ICE”) Products:

• | Our gasoline fuel injection systems portfolio includes a full suite of fuel injection technologies that deliver greater efficiency for traditional and hybrid vehicles with gasoline combustion engines. Our Gasoline Direct Injection (“GDi”) technology provides high precision fuel delivery for optimized combustion, which lowers emissions and improves fuel economy.


• | Our diesel fuel injection systems portfolio provides enhanced engine performance at an attractive value. Our common rail fuel injection system is the core technology for both commercial and light vehicle applications.


• | Our ICE products also include an array of highly engineered products for traditional combustion and hybrid electric vehicles, including variable valve timing, variable valve actuation, smart remote actuators, powertrain sensors, ignition products, canisters, and fuel handling products. These products often complement and enhance the efficiency improvements delivered by our fuel injection systems technologies.

Electronics & Electrification Products:

• | Our electronics portfolio consists of gasoline and diesel control modules, local control units and power electronics. The control modules, containing as much as one million lines of software code, are key components that enable the integration and operation of powertrain products throughout the vehicle. As the electrification increases, our proprietary solutions, including supervisory controllers and software, DC/DC converters and inverters, provide better efficiency, reduced weight and lower cost for our OEM customers while also making these and other components easier to integrate. Additionally, manufacturers are choosing to combine power electronic functionality into one unit, enabling more effective packaging and a lower total cost solution while increasing Delphi Technologies’ content per vehicle. These products are expected to experience increased demand as vehicle electrification accelerates.

Aftermarket. Through this segment we sell aftermarket products and services to independent aftermarket customers and original equipment service customers. Our aftermarket product portfolio includes a wide range of solutions covering the fuel injection, electronics and engine management, maintenance, and test equipment and vehicle diagnostics categories. Our aftermarket business provides a recurring and stable revenue base as replacement of many of these products is non-discretionary in nature. The growth in the number of vehicles in all regions of the world, along with the increasing average age of vehicles and a greater number of miles driven annually in certain regions collectively represent trends that are expected to lead to growing demand for our aftermarket products.
Growth Strategies
Our strategy is to continue to accelerate the development of market-relevant technologies that solve our customers’ increasingly complex challenges and leverage our lean, flexible cost structure to deliver margin expansion and revenue, earnings and cash flow growth over the long-term. Our technologies include a portfolio of innovations for future propulsion that are focused on industry-leading systems to meet regulatory requirements for reduced emissions and improved fuel economy, as well as provide additional power for more in-vehicle functionality. We seek to grow our business through the execution of the following strategies, among others:

• | Expand Leadership in Technologies that Solve Our Customers’ Most Complex Propulsion Challenges. We are focused on providing technologies and solutions that solve some of our customers’ biggest propulsion-related challenges, including helping our customers meet increasingly stringent global regulatory requirements while also enhancing vehicle performance. We believe we have strong positions in fuel injectors, fuel pumps, and complete fuel-injection systems, including software and controls. Additionally, we provide leading technology solutions in the areas of electronics and electrification, including engine control modules and power electronics, where we see growth over the long-term driven by increasing levels of electrification. Our power electronics technologies include products such as high-voltage inverters, DC/DC converters and on-board chargers that convert electricity to enable hybrid and electric vehicle propulsion systems. Our comprehensive portfolio of powertrain products combined with our proprietary software and controls, enables industry-leading propulsion systems for internal combustion engines, hybrids and electric vehicles.


• | Focused Regional Strategies To Best Serve Our Customers’ Needs. The combination of our global operating capabilities and our portfolio of advanced technologies help us serve our global customers’ local needs. We have a presence in all major global regions and have positioned ourselves as a leading supplier of advanced vehicle propulsion technologies, including electrification, that are tailored to satisfy our customers’ needs in each region. We believe our focus on providing customer solutions to meet increasingly stringent emissions and fuel efficiency regulations will collectively drive greater demand for our products and enable us to experience growth over the long-term.


• | Continue to Enhance Aftermarket Position. Globally we plan to expand margins by focusing on higher value product lines such as electronics and services, which include diagnostics and remanufacturing. We expect that demand for these product lines will grow faster than the overall aftermarket industry as the electronics content of new vehicles continues to increase, providing a strong foundation to gain scale profitably in the future. In addition, we expect to benefit from Aftermarket growth in key regions around the world, especially China, as the average age of vehicles increases and expands the need for replacement products.


• | Leverage Our Lean and Flexible Cost Structure to Deliver Earnings and Cash Flow Growth. We recognize the importance of maintaining a lean and flexible business model in order to deliver earnings and cash flow growth. We intend to improve our cost competitiveness by leveraging our enterprise operating system, continuously increasing operational efficiency, maximizing manufacturing output and rotating our facilities to best-cost countries. We have

6

ongoing processes and resources dedicated to further improvement of our operations, and we expect to use our cash flow to reinvest in our business to drive growth.
Our Industry
The automotive and commercial vehicle parts industry provides components, systems, subsystems and modules to OEMs for the manufacture of new vehicles, as well as to the aftermarket for use as replacement parts. Overall, we expect long-term growth of global vehicle production in the OEM market. In 2018, global vehicle production (including light and commercial vehicles) decreased 1% versus the previous year, reflecting a decrease of 4% in China and 1% in Europe, consistent production in North America and an increase of 4% in South America.
Demand for automotive components in the OEM market is generally a function of the number of new vehicles produced in response to consumer demand, which is primarily driven by macro-economic factors such as credit availability, interest rates, fuel prices, consumer confidence, employment and other trends. In the commercial vehicle market, OEM demand for components is also tied to vehicle production, which is driven by industrial production, the amount of freight tonnage being transported and the availability of credit and interest rates, among other factors. Although OEM demand is tied to actual vehicle production, we have the opportunity to grow faster by further penetrating business with existing customers and in existing markets, gaining new customers and increasing presence in global markets. Growth over the long-term can be achieved through product alignment to favorable macro trends such as increasingly stringent regulations and growing consumer demand for electrification; however unfavorable macro trends, such as the recent moderations in the level of economic growth in China, may slow this growth. The number of vehicles utilizing electrification is expected to grow to more than 35% of global vehicle production by 2025, as compared to just five percent today. 
Heightened Regulatory Environment
OEMs continue to focus on improving fuel efficiency and reducing emissions in order to meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements in various markets. Authorities in the European Union, the United States (“U.S.”), China, India, Japan, Brazil, South Korea and Argentina have already instituted regulations requiring further reductions in emissions and/or increased fuel economy. Authorities have also initiated legislation or regulation that would further tighten standards through 2020 and beyond. In order to comply with these regulations, OEMs and suppliers must find ways to improve fuel injection and combustion efficiency, engine management, electrical power consumption, vehicle weight and integration of alternative powertrains (e.g., electric/hybrid propulsion). As a result, we are continuing to develop innovations that result in improvements in fuel economy, emissions and performance from gasoline and diesel internal combustion engines and permit engine downsizing without loss of performance.
Standardization of Sourcing by OEMs
Many OEMs are continuing to adopt global vehicle platforms to increase standardization, reduce per-unit cost and increase capital efficiency and profitability. As a result, OEMs are selecting suppliers that have the capability to manufacture products on a worldwide basis as well as the flexibility to adapt to regional variations. Suppliers with global scale and strong design, engineering and manufacturing capabilities are best positioned to benefit from this trend. OEMs are also increasingly looking to their suppliers to simplify vehicle design and assembly processes to reduce costs. As a result, suppliers that sell vehicle components directly to manufacturers have assumed many of the design, engineering, research and development and assembly functions traditionally performed by vehicle manufacturers. Suppliers that can provide fully-engineered solutions, systems and pre-assembled combinations of component parts, such as Delphi Technologies, are positioned to leverage the trend toward system sourcing.
Shorter Product Development Cycles To Benefit Strong Suppliers
OEMs are requiring suppliers to respond faster with new designs and product innovations. Suppliers with strong technologies, global engineering and development capabilities, such as Delphi Technologies, will be best positioned to meet OEM demands for rapid innovation.

Increasing Demand for Electronics
Vehicles are increasingly complex in their design, features, level of integration of mechanical and electrical components and increasing levels of software necessary to deliver their functionality. Electronics integration, which generally refers to products and systems that combine integrated circuits, software algorithms, sensor technologies and mechanical components within the vehicle, will allow OEMs to achieve substantial reductions in weight and mechanical complexity. In turn, this results in enhanced fuel economy, improved emissions control and better vehicle performance. We are well positioned to benefit from accelerating industry demand for electronics integration and vehicle electrification. Moreover, our proprietary power electronics solutions enable all levels of electrification, allow our OEM customers to improve efficiency and reduce weight, which helps vehicles drive cleaner, better and further.
Competition
The automotive parts industry remains extremely competitive in light of constantly evolving market dynamics. The industry in which we compete has attracted, and may continue to attract, new entrants in areas of evolving vehicle technologies. Although OEMs prefer to maintain relationships with suppliers that have a proven record of performance, they rigorously evaluate suppliers on the basis of product quality, price, reliability and timeliness of delivery, product design capability, technical expertise and development capability, new product innovation, financial viability, application of lean principles, operational flexibility, customer service and overall management.
Customers
Our business is diversified across end-markets, regions, customers, vehicle platforms and products. We sell our products and services to the major global automotive and commercial vehicle OEMs in every region of the world. We also sell our products and services to the worldwide aftermarket for replacement parts, including the aftermarket operations of our OEM customers and to other distributors and retailers. Our global customer base includes 23 of the largest light vehicle OEMs, several of the largest commercial vehicle OEMs, and members of all of the global automotive aftermarket trading groups, which include most of the leading aftermarket retailers and wholesale distributors around the world. Our ten largest platforms in 2018 were with nine different OEMs. In addition, in 2018 our solutions were found in the majority of the top twenty platforms in each of the regions in which we operate. Further, 72% of our Powertrain Systems segment’s net sales were related to light vehicles and 28% of the segment’s net sales were focused on the commercial vehicle market, which is typically on a different business cycle than the light vehicle market. Our revenue base is also geographically diverse, and in 2018, 44% of our net sales were derived from Europe, 28% from North America, 25% from Asia Pacific and 3% from South America. In addition, we had no customers with greater than 10% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. 
Supply Relationships with Our Customers
We typically supply products to our OEM customers through purchase orders, which are generally governed by general terms and conditions established by each OEM. Although the terms and conditions vary from customer to customer, they typically contemplate a relationship under which our customers place orders for their requirements of specific components supplied for particular vehicles but are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us. These relationships typically extend over the life of the related vehicle. Prices are negotiated with respect to each business award, which may be subject to adjustments under certain circumstances, such as commodity or foreign exchange escalation/de-escalation clauses or for cost reductions achieved by us. During 2018, we communicated to our customers that trade tariff costs are not included in our current agreements. We continue to discuss the implications of tariff costs with our customers. The terms and conditions typically provide that we are subject to a warranty on the products supplied; in most cases, the duration of such warranty is coterminous with the warranty offered by the OEM to the end-user of the vehicle. We may also be obligated to share in all or a part of recall costs if the OEM recalls its vehicles for defects attributable to our products.
Individual purchase orders are terminable for cause or non-performance and, in most cases, upon our insolvency and certain change of control events. In addition, many of our OEM customers have the option to terminate for convenience on certain programs, which permits our customers to impose pressure on pricing during the life of the vehicle program and issue purchase contracts for less than the duration of the vehicle program, potentially reducing our profit margins and increasing the risk of our losing future sales under those purchase contracts. We manufacture and ship based on customer release schedules, normally provided on a weekly basis, which can vary due to cyclical automobile production or dealer inventory levels.
Although customer programs typically extend to future periods, and although there is an expectation that we will supply certain levels of OEM production during such future periods, customer agreements including applicable terms and conditions do not necessarily constitute firm orders. Firm orders are generally limited to specific and authorized customer purchase order releases placed with our manufacturing and distribution centers for actual production and order fulfillment. Firm orders are typically fulfilled as promptly as possible from the conversion of available raw materials, sub-components and work-in-process 
8

inventory for OEM orders and from current on-hand finished goods inventory for aftermarket orders. The dollar amount of such purchase order releases on hand and not processed at any point in time is not believed to be significant based upon the time frame involved.

Materials
We procure our raw materials from a variety of suppliers around the world. Generally, we seek to obtain materials in the region in which our products are manufactured in order to minimize transportation and other costs. As of December 31, 2018, we have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry inventories of such raw materials in excess of those reasonably required to meet our production and shipping schedules.
Commodity cost volatility, most notably related to various metals, is a challenge for us and our industry. As such, we continually seek to mitigate both inflationary pressures and our material-related cost exposures using a number of approaches, including combining purchase requirements with customers and/or other suppliers, using alternate suppliers or product designs and negotiating cost reductions and/or commodity cost contract escalation clauses into our vehicle manufacturer supply contracts. Our overall success in passing commodity cost increases on to our customers has been limited. 
Research, Development and Intellectual Property
We maintain technical engineering centers in major regions of the world to develop and provide advanced products, processes and manufacturing support for all of our manufacturing sites, and to provide our customers with local engineering capabilities and design development on a global basis. As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 5,000 scientists, engineers and technicians around the world.
We believe that our engineering and technical expertise, together with our emphasis on continuing research and development, allow us to use the latest technologies, materials and processes to solve problems for our customers and to bring new, innovative products to market. We believe that continued engineering activities are critical to maintaining our pipeline of technologically advanced products. We seek to effectively manage fixed costs and efficiently rationalize capital spending by critically evaluating the profit potential of new and existing customer programs, including investment in innovation and technology. We maintain our engineering activities around our focused product portfolio and allocate our capital and resources to those products with distinctive technologies.

We currently hold more than 3,100 active patents and patent applications. While no individual patent or group of patents, taken alone, is considered material to our business, taken in the aggregate, these patents provide meaningful protection for our products and technical innovations. We are actively pursuing marketing opportunities to commercialize and license our technology to both automotive and non-automotive industries and we have selectively taken licenses from others to support our business interests. These activities foster optimization of intellectual property rights.
Environmental Compliance
We are subject to the requirements of environmental and safety and health laws and regulations in each country in which we operate. These include laws regulating air emissions, water discharge, hazardous materials and waste management. We have an environmental management structure designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements globally. Although it is our intent to comply with all such requirements and regulations, we cannot provide assurance that we are at all times in compliance. Environmental requirements are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Accordingly, we cannot assure that our future environmental costs and liabilities will not be material.
Certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances. At this time, we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at certain of our present and former facilities. In addition, there may be soil or groundwater contamination at several of our properties resulting from historical, ongoing or nearby activities.
At December 31, 2018, the undiscounted reserve for environmental investigation and remediation was approximately $3 million. We cannot assure that our eventual environmental remediation costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves. In the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

Seasonality
Our business is moderately seasonal, as our primary North American customers historically reduce production during the month of July and halt operations for approximately one week in December. Our European customers generally reduce production during the months of July and August and for one week in December. Our Chinese customers generally reduce production during the Chinese New Year that occurs during the first quarter of each year. Shut-down periods in the rest of the world generally vary by country. In addition, automotive production is traditionally reduced in the months of July, August and September due to the launch of parts production for new vehicle models. Accordingly, our results reflect this seasonality.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 21,000 workers: 9,000 salaried employees, 10,000 hourly employees and 2,000 contract and temporary workers. Our employees are represented worldwide by numerous unions and works councils, including the European Works Council and local trade unions such as Unite, U.K., CFE-CGC France and C.T.M. in Mexico.
