Item 1. | Business

Overview
Quad/Graphics is a leading marketing solutions provider. The Company leverages its strong print foundation as part of a much larger, robust integrated marketing platform that helps marketers and content creators improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their marketing spend across offline and online media channels. With a consultative approach, worldwide capabilities, leading-edge technology and single-source simplicity, the Company believes it has the resources and knowledge to help a wide variety of clients in multiple vertical industries, including retail, publishing and healthcare.
Quad/Graphics was founded in Pewaukee, Wisconsin, as a Wisconsin corporation, in 1971 by the late Harry V. Quadracci. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately 21,100 full-time equivalent employees in North America, South America, Europe and Asia, and served a diverse base of approximately 6,900 clients from 147 facilities located in 17 countries, as well as investments in printing operations in Brazil and India.
The Company is on a transformative journey that it describes in evolutions. Each new evolution expands the Company's offerings and creates enhanced value for its clients. Quad 1.0 covered a period of tremendous organic growth that began with its founding in 1971. During this 40-year period, the Company grew rapidly through greenfield growth, built a premier manufacturing and distribution platform equipped with the latest technology, established its reputation as one of the industry's foremost innovators and created a Company culture based on strong values that remains in place today.
Quad 2.0 began in 2010 and continues today with Quad/Graphics' ongoing role as a disciplined industry consolidator. Quad/Graphics saw an opportunity to participate in industry consolidation in response to economic and industry pressures following the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009, which severely impacted print volumes. Through a series of consolidating acquisitions, the Company was able to enhance and expand its product offerings, while removing inefficient and underutilized capacity, pulling out costs and transitioning work to more efficient facilities.
Quad 3.0 evolved when the seismic shifts in today's multichannel marketing environment provided the opportunity for Quad/Graphics to expand its offering as a marketing solutions provider to create greater value for its clients in two distinct ways:

• | The Company will continue to leverage its strong print foundation and expand its integrated marketing platform to help marketers and content creators create, integrate, deploy and measure content more efficiently and effectively.


• | To fuel Quad 3.0, the Company is supported by an engaged workforce with the latest in manufacturing technology to drive continued productivity improvements. The Company believes this will strengthen its core manufacturing platform to be the strongest and most sustainable platform in the industry, with the goal of remaining the industry's high-quality, low-cost producer.

Industry and Competition
According to a September 2017 Dun & Bradstreet First Research report, the U.S. advertising services industry is forecasted to grow at an annual compounded rate of 4% between 2017 and 2021, as compared to the printing industry which is in secular decline. This opportunity for growth supports Quad/Graphics' 3.0 transformation and a review of both the marketing services and printing industries is set forth below.
The marketing services industry is highly fragmented. According to the September 2017 Dun & Bradstreet First Research report, the top 50 companies in the U.S. advertising and marketing services industry generate less than 40% of industry revenue. Services in this industry include advertising for print, broadcast and online media (about 25% of industry sales); public relations (12%); and direct marketing (10%). Other services include display advertising, media buying (reselling advertising time or space), and media representation (selling advertising time or space on behalf of media outlet owners). The U.S. advertising and marketing services industry includes about 38,000 establishments (single-location companies and units of multi-location companies), with combined annual revenue of about $100 billion.
The commercial print industry is also highly fragmented. According to the June 2017 Printing in the U.S. IBISWorld industry report, the United States commercial printing industry, in the aggregate, generates an estimated $76 billion in annual revenue, employs nearly 400,000 people and is comprised of approximately 46,000 companies. The report also states that the four largest printing companies account for less than 15% of total commercial print industry annual revenue in the United States, with Quad/Graphics being the second largest. Although there has been significant industry consolidation, particularly in the past decade, the largest 400 U.S. printers represent less than half of the total industry revenue in the U.S., according to the December 2017 Printing Impressions PI400 rankings.
In addition to being highly fragmented, competition in the printing industry remains intense, and the Company believes that there are indicators of heightened competitive pressures. The industry has excess manufacturing capacity created by continued declines in industry volumes which, in turn, have created accelerated downward pricing pressures. The Company faces competition due to the increased accessibility and quality of digital alternatives to traditional delivery of printed documents through the online distribution and hosting of media content, and the digital distribution of documents and data. The Company faces competition from print management firms that look to streamline processes and reduce the overall print spend of the Company's clients. The Company believes the commercial print industry has moved toward a demand for shorter print runs, faster product turnaround and increased production efficiency of products with lower page counts and increased complexity. This, combined with increases in postage expenses and the increased use of alternative digital marketing technologies, has led to excess manufacturing capacity in the print industry, and this excess capacity has allowed certain larger printers, like Quad/Graphics, with economies of scale, strong balance sheets and access to capital markets, the ability to install more efficient equipment, take advantage of consolidating acquisition opportunities to remove excess, inefficient and/or underutilized capacity, and reduce overall costs.
Competition in both the marketing services and print industries is affected by real gross domestic product growth, as economic activity and advertising spending are key drivers of consumer demand. In times of economic prosperity, advertisers may increase spending to build brand awareness and to drive sales. Conversely, in times of global economic uncertainty and budget pressures, advertisers may reduce spending or shift their spend to other forms of media. For print specifically, magazine publishers, facing diminished advertising pages, reduce total page counts; catalog marketers reduce page counts, circulation and frequency of print campaigns; retailers curb investments in store inventory and cut back on retail insert newspaper circulation and advertising; and other advertisers reduce their direct mail volume, particularly in the banking, insurance, credit card, real estate and nonprofit industries. It is possible that these customers instead decide to move advertising spend to digital alternatives.
Marketing services providers face pressure to satisfy major clients' needs, as the win or loss of a major client account can impact revenue significantly. Another challenge facing marketing service providers relates to public concern and general annoyance with advertising methods. For example, data collection of personal information for marketing purposes is an issue under scrutiny from federal legislation, and marketing service providers can face restrictions on certain types of data they collect.
 3

The Company faces competition in the advertising and marketing services industry based on access to a skilled workforce, pricing, adapting quickly to new technology, creating unique and effective campaigns and offering superior customer service. Across Quad/Graphics' range of printed products, competition is based on total price of printing, materials and distribution; quality; distribution capabilities; customer service; access to a highly skilled workforce; availability to schedule work on appropriate equipment; on-time production and delivery; and state-of-the-art technology to meet a client's business objectives, including the ability to adopt new technology quickly.
As consumer media consumption habits change, marketing services providers face increased demand to offer complete marketing services across both traditional and digital channels. As new advertising channels emerge, marketing services providers must offer not only traditional marketing services, such as for television, newspapers, print publications and radio, but they must also offer services for digital channels, such as mobile, internet search, internet display and video, to create effective multichannel campaigns for their clients.
Quad/Graphics believes that traditional business users of print and print-related services are focused on generating and tracking the highest returns on their marketing spend. The Company believes that its clients receive the greatest return on their marketing and advertising dollars when they effectively use data to go after the appropriate customers and integrate digital alternatives with customized print products in a targeted, multichannel marketing campaign driven by an overall marketing strategy. Quad/Graphics believes it is well positioned to help its clients navigate through this changing media landscape and create innovative ways to connect online and offline channels.
Seasonality
The Company is subject to seasonality in its quarterly results as net sales and operating income are higher in the third and fourth quarters of the calendar year as compared to the first and second quarters. The fourth quarter is typically the highest seasonal quarter for cash flows from operating activities and Free Cash Flow due to the reduction of working capital requirements that reach peak levels during the third quarter. Seasonality is driven by increased magazine advertising page counts, retail inserts, catalogs and books primarily due to back-to-school and holiday-related advertising and promotions. The Company expects this seasonality impact to continue.
Strategy
Quad/Graphics believes employee pride, combined with a relentless quest to create a better way, builds the opportunity to invent new ideas that drive improved performance and shared success for all. To accomplish this vision, Quad/Graphics remains focused on its consistent mission to achieve the following:
Walk in the Shoes of Clients
The Company reinforces that all employees, regardless of job title, are part of Quad/Graphics' client experience team. As such, all employees are responsible for meeting the needs of its clients every day, making it easy to work with Quad/Graphics, and making the client experience enjoyable at every touchpoint. In Quad 3.0, the Company is focused on supplementing client print-execution conversations with consultative solutions that will improve a client's business through process efficiencies and marketing spend effectiveness. To accomplish this, a key component of Quad/Graphics' client-facing strategy is to strengthen relationships at different levels inside a client's organization so the Company can better understand, anticipate and satisfy a client's needs. In Quad 3.0, Quad/Graphics seeks to become an invaluable strategic partner for its clients, helping them successfully navigate today's constantly changing multichannel media landscape through innovative data-driven solutions, created and executed across multiple channels. The Company also believes its proactive thought leadership in key issues facing its clients, such as integrating marketing services and postal reform, will foster loyalty to the Quad/Graphics brand.

Grow the Business Profitably
Key components of this strategy center on Quad/Graphics' ability to grow in Quad 3.0, at a time when industry headwinds continue, and are as follows:

• | Ongoing innovation and investment to integrate offline and online media, in support of the Company's Quad 3.0 value proposition of helping clients create, integrate, deploy and measure content more efficiently and market more effectively. This includes process investments to help clients optimize workflows through audit and discovery services; streamlined content creation to help reduce overall production and distribution costs and improve speed-to-market; and platform investments in variable printing and data management to bridge the traditional analog and digital marketing worlds to help clients precisely segment, execute and measure more personal, one-on-one relevant brand experiences via multichannel campaigns that engage consumers at the right place and time to generate greater market penetration and lift in response. 


• | Organic growth, in which the Company leverages knowledge from existing client relationships in key growth vertical industries to develop complementary products and services that help brand owners market more efficiently and effectively across media channels. Quad/Graphics is also focused on ensuring it has the right talent in the best positions to have strategic marketing conversations with its clients that facilitate understanding their needs, developing tailored solutions and growing market share. 


• | Disciplined acquisitions, that take many different forms. For example, the Company intends to continue to transform its existing product lines while expanding into higher growth product and service categories that help bolster the Company's ability to create value for its clients, as well as pursue value-driven industry consolidating acquisitions and/or acquisitions that help accelerate the Company's transformation in Quad 3.0. 

Strengthen the Core
Quad/Graphics uses a disciplined return on capital framework and historically has made significant investments in its print manufacturing platform and data management capabilities that have resulted in what it believes is the most integrated, automated, efficient, innovative and modern manufacturing platform and distribution network in the industry. The Company's continued focus to strengthen its core manufacturing platform through investments to streamline, automate and improve efficiencies and throughput, while reducing labor costs, promotes sustainable cash flow and continued value creation. Further, a commitment to Lean Enterprise and a disciplined culture of continuous improvement is a high priority throughout the Company and supports its goal of strengthening the production and distribution functions for core product lines to remain the industry's high-quality, low-cost producer.
Engage Employees
Quad/Graphics' strategy to engage employees builds upon its mission to attract, retain and develop employees throughout their entire career journey with the Company. All three elements combine to support Quad/Graphics' ongoing Quad 3.0 transformation, and build on key aspects of its distinct and transparent corporate culture. This includes strong and lasting Company values, an organization-wide entrepreneurial spirit and opportunity-seeking mentality where employees are encouraged to take pride and ownership in their work, take advantage of continuous learning programs to advance in their careers, share knowledge by mentoring others and innovate solutions to drive performance. With the encouragement to do things differently, be something greater and create a better way, the Company believes its employees are more fully engaged in producing better results for clients and advancing the Company's strategic goals, while supporting community activities, initiatives and organizations that impact the quality of life near Quad/Graphics facilities. As Quad/Graphics continues to expand its integrated marketing platform in Quad 3.0, the Company believes this creates possibilities for each employee that are advantageously distinct from other employers.

Enhance Financial Strength and Create Shareholder Value
Quad/Graphics follows a disciplined approach to maintaining and enhancing financial strength to create shareholder value, which is essential given ongoing printing industry challenges. This key strategic goal is centered on the Company's ability to maximize net earnings, Free Cash Flow and operating margins; maintain consistent financial policies to ensure a strong balance sheet, liquidity level and access to capital; and retain the financial flexibility needed to strategically allocate and deploy capital as circumstances change. The priorities for capital allocation and deployment are adjusted based on prevailing circumstances and what the Company thinks is best for shareholder value creation at any particular point in time. Those priorities currently include the following: (1) deleveraging the Company's balance sheet through debt and pension liability reductions; (2) making compelling investments that drive profitable organic growth and productivity in the Company's current business, as well as executing on acquisitions through a disciplined approach that includes expansion into higher-growth products and services that help accelerate the Company's transformation in Quad 3.0, and pursuing value-driven industry consolidation; and (3) returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Competitive Advantages
Quad/Graphics' primary strategic goals are powered by three key competitive advantages that the Company believes distinguishes itself from its competitors: a commitment to ongoing innovation, a commitment to platform excellence, and a commitment to its people and lasting culture.
Commitment to Ongoing Innovation
At the forefront of innovation for more than 46 years, Quad/Graphics believes its commitment to ongoing innovation drives its vision to create a better way.
In Quad 3.0, the Company will continue to innovate through an expanded integrated marketing platform to help clients create, integrate and measure offline and online media more efficiently and effectively. One of the ways the Company will achieve this vision is through continued expansion of its BlueSoHo business, which offers multichannel marketing services with an emphasis on helping brands work smarter, produce faster and be more agile. As an independent brand, BlueSoHo also enables Quad/Graphics to capture new business among brand owners who understand the benefits of fully orchestrated cross-media programs. Specifically, BlueSoHo helps plan, produce and activate marketing campaigns in the channels most likely to drive engagement and response with the goal of turning shoppers into buyers and buyers into loyal brand advocates. To strengthen its integrated marketing platform, Quad/Graphics seeks out strategic partnerships with companies on the cutting edge of digital marketing. These partnerships bring together a company that is an expert at optimizing spend offline, with companies that are doing the same online, using robust analytics to deliver highly-relevant, consistent messages—at scale—to consumers across print and digital channels.
To further support its marketing solutions thought leadership, Quad/Graphics conducts annual quantitative research called, Customer Focus®™. This extensive survey, conducted by a third party, provides consumer insight on singular and integrated media usage. The survey reveals the unique characteristics of special demographic, generational, gender and socio-economic groups and how they consume advertising and marketing messaging, and their attitudes and engagement preferences in a number of industry segments. According to survey data, print remains a strong driver across generations. This active response to print has influenced magazine publishers to increase usage of custom product covers to enhance reader engagement and retailers who primarily use digital channels—such as online-only retailers, or electronic-retailers—to incorporate print into their marketing strategy. Further, Quad/Graphics is able to combine the insights from Customer Focus®™ and use its proprietary segmentation tool, called Accelerated Insights®, to leverage client data and create hyper-personalized online and offline campaigns. The ability to generate content that is relevant to the consumer is one way the Company believes it can help its clients influence consumer behavior, lift response and enhance return on investment.

In Quad 3.0, the Company remains committed to innovation throughout its print manufacturing and distribution processes to better serve its clients and remain the industry's high-quality, low-cost producer. Over the last five years, Quad/Graphics has invested an average of 2.7% of its annual net sales for capital expenditures. This investment has resulted in what the Company believes is the most advanced and efficient platform in the industry and has allowed the Company to reduce the amount invested in recent years without impacting its leading technological excellence. 
To improve internal processes, enhance client service levels and further drive efficiencies, the Company has consistently focused on the rapid adoption of technological innovations. In the early years, the Company integrated its imaging, manufacturing and distribution networks into a single platform using a networked information technology infrastructure. This platform—connected via Quad/Graphics' own Smartools® proprietary enterprise resource planning ("ERP") system—provides seamless, real-time information flow across sales and estimating, production planning, scheduling, manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, invoicing, reporting and customer service. In Quad 3.0, the Company extended its spirit of innovation with business process management tools that further simplify and improve existing internal workflows. This includes pricing, job specifications and client acceptance to streamlining and automating the hand-offs between departments throughout the entire order workflow through invoicing. Quad/Graphics has also applied robotic process automation to automatable tasks to streamline data processing and report generation. This allows employees to focus on value-adding tasks, while the robotic process completes the transactional, repetitive functions. Quad/Graphics also leverages artificial intelligence ("AI") where appropriate, for example in labor management, scheduling and predictive maintenance where AI is used to better predict when machine maintenance is needed.
A commitment to innovation and creating a better way to do business has also helped to expand Quad/Graphics vertically-integrated non-print capabilities, such as data management, imaging, logistics and distribution, ink manufacturing (Chemical Research\Technology), paper procurement, and equipment research and design. This approach to business gives the Company a competitive advantage in delivering lower costs for its clients, enhancing customer service levels and allowing substantial control over critical links in the overall print supply chain to help it control the quality, cost and availability of key inputs in the printing process. In addition, QuadMed, the Company's health and wellness subsidiary, was founded in 1990 to create a better way to address the Company's own employees' needs for quality, cost-effective healthcare. Today, QuadMed provides employer-sponsored healthcare solutions on a national level to employers of all sizes, including private and public sector companies. These solutions include, but are not limited to, on-site and near-site healthcare clinics, occupational health services, telemedicine, and health and wellness programs.
Commitment to Platform Excellence
Quad/Graphics continues to invest in equipment and leading-edge technology to ensure its manufacturing platform remains the strongest and most sustainable in the printing industry and that it continues to support a vast range of traditional and digital print solutions, finishing techniques and distribution capabilities to create value for its clients in Quad 3.0. At the same time, the Company has continued to strengthen its platform by removing excess, under-utilized capacity and by consolidating work into facilities where it can achieve the greatest manufacturing and distribution efficiencies. Over the past seven years, the Company has closed 41 manufacturing plants representing nearly 13 million square feet of under-utilized production capacity. This commitment to consolidating work into fewer facilities to maximize capacity is one key way Quad/Graphics maintains platform excellence and remains the industry's high-quality, low-cost producer.
The Company has continuously invested in its print manufacturing platform through modern equipment and automation, which reduces labor costs, maximizes labor productivity and increases throughput. The Company's investment in its manufacturing platform has consistently been based on evaluating the economic useful life of the underlying equipment rather than focusing on the potential mechanical life of the equipment. This discipline is critical in an industry in which technological change can create obsolescence well before the end of the mechanical life of equipment. To remain the industry's high-quality, low-cost producer, Quad/Graphics makes a concerted effort to treat all costs as variable and maintains a stringent focus on achieving productivity improvements and sustainable cost reductions through a variety of Continuous Improvement and Lean Enterprise programs in both manufacturing and administrative areas.

Another key aspect of the Company's modern manufacturing platform is the combination of its footprint of mega plants (facilities greater than one million square feet) that produce a number of different products under one roof; mega zones where multiple facilities in close geographic proximity are managed as one large facility; and smaller strategically located facilities. The Company has continued to evolve its platform by equipping facilities to be product line agnostic, which enables the Company to maximize equipment utilization. Quad/Graphics believes that the large plant size of certain of its key printing facilities allows the Company to drive savings in certain product lines (such as publications and catalogs) due to economies of scale and from investments in automation and technology. 
Quad/Graphics is also able to leverage the volume of products running through its plants for further client distribution savings by coordinating and consolidating shipments from single mega plants or multiple plants that create a mega zone, and then routing those shipments directly to thousands of local newspapers, United States Postal Service ("USPS") processing facilities or other distribution facilities. In addition, each major United States metropolitan area is within one day's drive of at least one of the Company's strategically located facilities, providing its clients the flexibility to print closest to their end consumers.
Postal rates are a significant component of many clients' cost structures, and Quad/Graphics believes that postal costs influence the number of pieces that its clients print and mail. Therefore, the Company has invested significantly in its mail preparation and distribution capabilities to mitigate increasing postage costs, and to help clients successfully navigate the ever-changing postal environment. The Company performs an analysis of mail list data as part of its logistics services, which allows it to reduce client freight costs for shipments to newsstands and postal centers, while providing a high level of dependability and rapid response times that are crucial to the delivery of time-sensitive materials. Further, the Company manages mail distribution of most of its clients' products to maximize efficiency and reduce these costs, and its co-mail program is the largest in the print industry, based on information published by or otherwise made available from competitors. Quad/Graphics' co-mail program involves the sorting and bundling of printed products to be mailed to consumers, in order to facilitate better integration with the USPS. In return, the USPS offers significant work-sharing discounts for this sorting, bundling and drop-shipping. Quad/Graphics co-mailed approximately 4.0 billion publications, catalogs and direct marketing pieces in 2017. Due to the continuously increasing costs of utilizing the USPS and to help control costs for its customers, Quad/Graphics has launched a pilot project revolving around alternate delivery strategies for customers' products that result in Quad/Graphics managing delivery directly to the consumer and bypassing the USPS as a delivery method. 
The Company is in the midst of a three-year plan to transform some of its platform from conventional web offset presses to modern digital presses that will give marketers and publishers a full range of options to produce and deliver relevant direct mail and other commercial products faster and more cost-effectively. For example:

• | The Company has invested in its technology-enabled direct mail platform to provide innovative front-end toolsets and data workflows; industry-best back-end logistics and postal optimization; and a diverse production platform that is highly leveraged on personalization technologies serving the needs of today's leading marketers. Personalization and targeting create the opportunity to reach the right recipients with a relevant message at the right time which, in turn, helps its clients increase consumer response rates, maximize their return on print spending and reduce overall costs. Built over many years, Quad/Graphics' data-driven, one-to-one direct marketing platform includes in-house capabilities to analyze mailing list data, demographic data, consumer transaction data and other consumer-specific data to help its clients create targeted and personalized printed materials. 


• | The Company also continues to transform its book platform through the rapid implementation of digital press technology and integrated systems, and the creation of On-Q™, a proprietary demand-driven ordering system that helps clients better manage ordering and inventory. Quad/Graphics is helping book publishers with increased customization and versioning capabilities; faster time-to-market; reduced waste, inventories and obsolescence; and lower fixed costs.

• | Recent investments in digital press technology for QuadPackaging, the Company's high-end folding carton packaging business, has enabled it to enter markets in which it previously was not as competitive, such as private label packaging. With its digital press platform, QuadPackaging is able to cost-competitively accommodate shorter runs with quicker turns. 

Commitment to People and Lasting Culture
Quad/Graphics believes that its employees do not just make a difference—they are the difference. The Company believes this is a key competitive advantage that is not easily replicated by its competitors given its long-standing culture.
Quad/Graphics believes that its distinct corporate culture, which evolved from a core set of values conceived by the late founder Harry V. Quadracci, drives thoughtful decision-making, especially with regard to its disciplined approach to managing operations, creating solutions that redefine print in a multichannel media marketplace, and better positioning the Company to prevail in the dynamic and competitive printing industry. The Company fosters an entrepreneurial environment by inspiring and empowering employees to own projects and enact solutions that advance the Company's goals. Employees in the United States also may have a beneficial ownership interest in Quad/Graphics through Company stock held in an employee stock ownership plan, enhancing their sense of ownership. The Company believes that it is this sense of employee engagement and distinct corporate culture that drives its disciplined approach to all aspects of its business.
The Company demonstrates its commitment to employee engagement in a variety of ways, including the following:

• | Offering employees a competitive compensation and benefits package;


• | Providing employees with a safe work environment with robust safety training and accountability programs;


• | Offering continuous learning and career advancement opportunities, such as through registered mechanical and electrical apprenticeship programs, youth apprenticeship programs, the Company's own Accelerated Career Training program for production employees, digital media training, affinity groups and leadership development training;


• | Promoting employee health and wellness through a variety of personal improvement programs and facilities, including the Company's own QuadMed primary care clinics;


• | Acting on employee feedback garnered through regular surveys and open forums at department and company-wide meetings;


• | Offering an employee referral program and investing in technology and improved processes to facilitate an easy hiring and on-boarding process; and


• | Fostering pride through employee recognition programs, employee and family events, community outreach activities and support, a history of environmental commitments, such as effective management of resources and reducing waste, and adhering to a published code of ethics.

Quad/Graphics is led by an experienced management team with a proven track record in the printing industry that is committed to preserving the Company's values-based culture. The senior management team includes individuals with long tenure with the Company augmented with seasoned industry talent realized through strategic hiring or recent acquisitions, further supplemented by managers and employees committed to advancing print solutions in coordination with the ever-evolving multichannel media landscape. The Company believes the experience and stability of senior management, paired with next-generation entrepreneurially minded employees, will contribute to its long-term success as it continues on its path forward.

Quad/Graphics also enjoys a competitive advantage in consistent, stable leadership that is focused on making decisions in the best long-term interest of the Company. It is able to do this because of the Quadracci family voting control, which enables the Company to manage its strategy and disciplined financial policy by being able to make decisions today that could benefit the Company years from now and avoid the pitfalls of short-term decision making that could potentially jeopardize the stability and longevity of the Company.
Quad/Graphics' leaders believe in a disciplined financial approach to maximize earnings and Free Cash Flow, and to maintain a strong balance sheet. Continuous Improvement and Lean Manufacturing methodologies are among the tools that Quad/Graphics uses to improve manufacturing productivity, simplify and streamline processes and to ultimately maximize operating margins. The Company applies these same methodologies to its selling, general and administrative functions to create a truly Lean Enterprise. The Company has been working diligently to lower its cost structure by consolidating its manufacturing platform into its most efficient facilities, as well as realizing purchasing, mailing and logistics efficiencies by centralizing and consolidating print manufacturing volumes and eliminating redundancies in its administrative and corporate operations. Quad/Graphics believes that its focused efforts to be the high-quality, low-cost producer generates increased Free Cash Flow and allows the Company to maintain a strong balance sheet through debt and pension liability reductions. The Company's disciplined financial approach also allows it to maintain sufficient liquidity as well as to reduce refinancing risk, with the nearest significant debt maturity not occurring until January 2021.
Segments
Quad/Graphics is a leading marketing solutions provider. The Company leverages its strong print foundation as part of a much larger, robust integrated marketing platform that helps marketers and content creators improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their marketing spend across offline and online media channels. The Company's operating and reportable segments are aligned with how the chief operating decision maker of the Company currently manages the business. The Company's operating and reportable segments, including their product and service offerings, and a "Corporate" category are as follows:
•United States Print and Related Services
•International
•Corporate
United States Print and Related Services
The United States Print and Related Services segment is predominantly comprised of the Company's United States printing operations and is managed as one integrated platform. This includes retail inserts, publications, catalogs, special interest publications, journals, direct mail, books, directories, in-store marketing and promotion, packaging, newspapers, custom print products, other commercial and specialty printed products and global paper procurement, together with marketing and other complementary services, , including consumer insights, audience targeting, personalization, media planning and placement, process optimization, campaign planning and creation, pre-media production, videography, photography, digital execution, print execution and logistics. This segment also includes the manufacture of ink. The United States Print and Related Services segment accounted for approximately 91%, 91% and 92% of Quad/Graphics' consolidated net sales in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
International
The International segment consists of the Company's printing operations in Europe and Latin America, including operations in England, France, Germany, Poland, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico and Peru, as well as investments in printing operations in Brazil and India. This segment provides printed products and marketing and other complementary services consistent with the United States Print and Related Services segment. The International segment accounted for approximately 9%, 9% and 8% of the Company's consolidated net sales in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Corporate
Corporate consists of unallocated general and administrative activities and associated expenses including, in part, executive, legal and finance, as well as certain expenses and income from frozen employee retirement plans, such as pension benefit plans.
For additional financial information by segment and geographic area, see Note 21, "Segment Information," and Note 22, "Geographic Area and Product Information," to the consolidated financial statements, respectively, in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a discussion of the risks attendant to the Company's foreign operations, see the risk factor titled "There are risks associated with the Company's operations outside of the United States" in Item 1A, "Risk Factors," of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Clients
Quad/Graphics enjoys long-standing relationships with a diverse base of clients, which includes both national and regional corporations in North America, South America, Europe and Asia. The Company's clients include industry-leading blue chip companies that operate in a wide range of industries and serve both businesses and consumers, including retailers, publishers and direct marketers. The Company's relationships with its largest clients average around 20 years in duration.
In 2017, Quad/Graphics served approximately 6,900 clients, and its 10 largest clients accounted for approximately 16% of consolidated sales, with none representing more than 5% individually. The Company believes that its large and diverse client base, broad geographic coverage and extensive range of printing and print-related capabilities are competitive strengths.
Patents, Trademarks and Trade Names
Quad/Graphics operates research and development facilities that support the development of new equipment, process improvements, raw materials and content management, and distribution technologies to better meet client needs and improve operating efficiencies. The Company continues to innovate within the printing and print-related industry and, as a result, has developed what it believes to be one of the most powerful patent portfolios in the print industry.
Quad/Graphics currently holds or has rights to commercialize a wide variety of worldwide patents and applications relating to its business. The Company intends to continue to file patent applications that it believes will help ensure the continued strength of the Company and its portfolio. Additionally, the Company markets products, services and capabilities under a number of trademarks and trade names. Quad/Graphics aggressively defends its intellectual property rights and intends to continue to do so in the future.
Raw Materials
The primary raw materials that Quad/Graphics uses in its print business are paper, ink and energy. At this time, the Company's supply of raw materials is readily available from numerous vendors; however, based on market conditions, that could change in the future. The Company generally buys these raw materials based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the procurement process.
The majority of paper used by the Company is supplied directly by its clients. For those clients that do not directly supply their own paper, the Company makes use of its purchasing efficiencies to supply paper by negotiating with leading paper vendors, uses a wide variety of paper grades, weights and sizes, and does not rely on any one vendor. In addition, the Company generally includes price adjustment clauses in sales contracts for paper and other critical raw materials in the printing process. Although these clauses generally mitigate paper price risk, higher paper prices and tight paper supplies may have an impact on client demand for printed products. The Company's working capital requirements, including the impact of seasonality, are partially mitigated through the direct purchasing of paper by its clients.

The Company produces the majority of ink used in its print production, allowing it to control the quality, cost and supply of key inputs. Raw materials for the ink manufacturing process are purchased externally from a variety of vendors.
The Company generally cannot pass on to clients the impact of higher electric and natural gas energy prices on its manufacturing costs, and increases in energy prices result in higher manufacturing costs for certain of its operations. The Company mitigates its risk through natural gas hedges when appropriate. In its logistic operations, however, the Company is able to pass a substantial portion of any increase in fuel prices directly to its clients.
Environmental Stewardship
As the owner, lessee or operator of various real properties and facilities, Quad/Graphics is subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air emissions; waste generation, handling, management and disposal; sanitary and storm water discharge; and remediation of contaminated sites. Historically, compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Compliance with existing or new environmental laws and regulations may require the Company to make future expenditures.
Quad/Graphics strives to be the leader in the printing industry in adopting new technologies and processes to minimize the Company's impact on the environment. The Company believes it has long been known for its environmental stewardship. Quad/Graphics' proactive approach to incorporate holistic practices has also positively impacted operating costs through the reduction of waste, energy use, and emissions, as well as through the implementation of water conservation solutions. The Company has also undertaken steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from its manufacturing processes and to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions in its fleet of Company-owned tractor trailers.
