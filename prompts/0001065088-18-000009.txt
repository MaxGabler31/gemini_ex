ITEM 1: BUSINESS 
Overview
eBay Inc. was formed as a sole proprietorship in September 1995 and was incorporated in California in May 1996. In April 1998, we reincorporated in Delaware, and in September 1998, we completed the initial public offering of our common stock. Our principal executive offices are located at 2025 Hamilton Avenue, San Jose, California 95125, and our telephone number is (408) 376-7400. Unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, when we refer to “we,” “our,” “us” or “eBay” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we mean the current Delaware corporation (eBay Inc.) and its California predecessor, as well as all of its consolidated subsidiaries. When we refer to “eBay Inc.” we mean our Marketplace, StubHub and Classifieds platforms.
eBay Inc. is a global commerce leader, which includes our Marketplace, StubHub and Classifieds platforms. Collectively, we connect millions of buyers and sellers around the world. The technologies and services that power our platforms are designed to enable sellers worldwide to organize and offer their inventory for sale, and buyers to find and purchase it, virtually anytime and anywhere. Our Marketplace platforms include our online marketplace located at www.ebay.com, its localized counterparts and the eBay mobile apps. We believe that these are among the world’s largest and most vibrant marketplaces for discovering great value and unique selection. Our StubHub platforms include our online ticket platform located at www.stubhub.com, its localized counterparts and the StubHub mobile apps. These platforms connect fans with their favorite sporting events, shows and artists and enable them to buy and sell millions of tickets whenever and wherever they want. Our Classifieds platforms include a collection of brands such as mobile.de, Kijiji, Gumtree, Marktplaats, eBay Kleinanzeigen and others. Offering online classifieds around the world, these platforms help people find whatever they are looking for in their local communities.
Our platforms are accessible through a traditional online experience (e.g., desktop and laptop computers), from mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets) and via our application programming interfaces or APIs (platform access for third party software developers). Our multi-screen approach offers downloadable, easy-to-use applications for iOS and Android mobile devices that allow access to ebay.com and some of our other websites and vertical shopping experiences. In addition, our platform is increasingly based on open source technologies that provide industry-standard ways for software developers and merchants to access our APIs, to develop software and solutions for commerce.
Our Strategy
Delivering the best choice, the most relevance and the most powerful selling platform
Our strategy is to drive the best choice, the most relevance and the most powerful selling platform for our buyers and sellers. We focus on connecting buyers and sellers through simplified experiences to make it easier for users to list, find and buy items. 
On our Marketplace platform, our strategy is to drive the best choice by attracting and retaining sellers and brands that bring differentiated inventory to eBay and provide our consumers with great selection and value. This includes new, everyday items as well as rare and unique goods, with a majority of items available with free shipping and delivery in three business days or less. To help deliver the most relevance, we are innovating new shopping experiences tailored to each user’s interests, passions and shopping history. Leveraging the foundation of structured data - our initiative to better understand, organize and leverage inventory on eBay - we are delivering more personalized, discovery-based user experiences and making it easier for customers to find inventory both on and off eBay. We focus on offering the most powerful selling platform for our business and consumer sellers by continuing to expand adoption of our Seller Hub product, while adding new capabilities to enable sellers to build their businesses and drive profitable sales on eBay.
The eBay brand is one of our most important strategic assets.  In 2017, we activated a new, global brand platform – Fill Your Cart With Color – intended to facilitate increased consideration of eBay to drive more traffic and new buyers to our platforms.  As part of this effort, we rolled out local campaigns in North America, Europe and Australia using multiple channels, including television, digital and social.  This is the first time the company has adopted a truly global brand approach, and we view this as a long-term initiative that will require on-going investment as the brand evolves. 
As one of the world’s largest ticket marketplaces, StubHub connects people through inspiring live experiences. Event-goers can find more than 10 million live sports, music, theater and other events in more than 40 countries on our StubHub platforms, and can browse, buy and sell anytime, anywhere through desktop and mobile devices. We continue to extend StubHub’s reach by focusing on supply expansion, which includes increasing consumer selling on our site, and broadening StubHub’s international footprint to provide consumers a global major events catalog.
A world leader in online classifieds, eBay Classifieds is designed to help people list their products and services, generally for free, find whatever they are looking for in their local communities and trade at a local level. eBay Classifieds Group’s brands offer both horizontal and vertical experiences, such as motors, real estate and jobs. We offer a personalized classifieds experience and focus on expanding our value proposition by leveraging data and analytics to improve customer relevance and growing the classifieds opportunity on mobile.
Business model and pricing
On our eBay and StubHub platforms, our business model and pricing are designed so that our business is successful primarily when our sellers are successful. We make money primarily through fees collected on successfully closed sales. On our Classifieds platform, we monetize our business primarily through advertising. 
The size and scale of our platforms are designed to enable our buyers and sellers to leverage our economies of scale and capital investment, for example in sales and marketing, mobile, customer acquisition and customer service.
Our offerings for buyers and sellers
We provide a number of features for our buyers and sellers that are designed to build trust, make users more comfortable buying and selling on our platforms and reward our top sellers for their loyalty. 
For our buyers, we believe that eBay sellers offer some of the best value and deals available for a number of consumer products. This year we introduced Price Match Guarantee, which allows buyers to feel comfortable knowing that they are getting the best price on the more than 80,000 items where we match the prices of our competitors in key regions worldwide. We also unveiled eBay Authenticate, in which sellers can have their luxury items, such as high-end handbags, authenticated by eBay, enabling customers to shop for exclusive goods with confidence. Additionally, the majority of our transactions in the U.S., the U.K. and Germany continue to include free shipping. 
eBay Money Back Guarantee covers most items purchased on the eBay platform in a number of countries, including the U.S., the U.K., Germany and Australia, through a qualifying payment method and protects most buyers with respect to items that are not received or are received but not as described in the listing. Some purchases, including some vehicles, are not covered. eBay Money Back Guarantee provides coverage for the purchase price of the item, plus original shipping costs, for a limited period of time from the date of delivery and includes a streamlined interface to help buyers and sellers navigate the process.
For our sellers, eBay’s Top Rated Seller program rewards qualifying sellers with fee discounts and improved search standing for qualifying listings if they are able to maintain excellent customer service ratings and meet specified criteria for shipping and returns. We believe that sellers who fulfill these standards help promote our goal of maintaining an online marketplace that is safe and hassle-free.
We also help our sellers gain added visibility and velocity for their inventory. This year, we began to scale the eBay Promoted Listings product, which is designed to enable sellers to increase the visibility of item listings on eBay to have a better chance of selling. We also removed some competing third-party product listing ads on the eBay platform in select locations. 
eBay regularly evaluates pricing relative to alternatives in the market in order to remain competitive. In 2017, we implemented a number of changes to our policies and pricing in an effort to better incent sellers to deliver better buyer experiences. At the same time, we continued to invest in more tools and new programs to help grow the overall seller ecosystem. 
We offer choice to buyers and sellers across a number of dimensions.
For sellers, this includes:

• | Sellers can choose to list their products and services through fixed price listings or an auction-style format on our platforms. The fixed price format on eBay allows buyers and sellers to close transactions at a pre-determined price set by the seller. Sellers also are able to signal that they would be willing to close the transaction at a lower price through the Best Offer feature. Additionally, our auction-style format allows a seller to select a minimum price for opening bids.


• | Sellers can list items that are new, refurbished and used, and common and rare on our Marketplace platforms.


• | Sellers can use Promoted Listings to improve the visibility of their item listings so that items have a better chance of standing out and selling faster.


• | Sellers can list luxury items, such as high-end handbags, through eBay Authenticate, giving buyers greater confidence in the luxury item they are purchasing.

For buyers, this includes:

• | Buyers can search for and purchase items that are new, refurbished and used, and common and rare on our Marketplace platforms, in categories such a Parts and Accessories, Fashion and Electronics.


• | Buyers can filter searches for items by one-, two- and three-day delivery through eBay Guaranteed Delivery.


• | Buyers can have greater confidence in purchasing high-end handbags through eBay Authenticate.


• | Buyers also can have items shipped to them through multiple shipping options offered by sellers. For certain items purchased from certain retailers, buyers can pick up items they purchased online or through mobile devices in one of the retailer’s physical stores (which we refer to as in-store pickup).
