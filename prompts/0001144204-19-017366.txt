Business Development
 
Paradise, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida in September, 1961 as Canaveral Utilities and Development Corporation. After the acquisition and merger of several other assets, the Corporation was renamed Paradise Fruit Company, Inc. in February 1964, and the corporate name was changed again to Paradise, Inc. during July 1993. There have been no bankruptcies, receiverships, or similar proceedings during the corporation’s history. There have been no material reclassifications, mergers, consolidations, purchases or sales of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of business during the past three years.
 
The Company’s operations are conducted through two business segments. These segments, and the primary operations of each, are as follows:
 

Business Segment | Operation 
-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Candied Fruit | Production of candied fruit, a basic fruitcake ingredient, sold to manufacturing bakers, institutional users, and retailers for use in home baking. Also, based on market conditions, the processing of frozen strawberry products for sale to commercial and institutional users such as preservers, dairies, drink manufacturers, etc. 
Molded Plastics | Production of plastic containers for the Company’s products and other molded plastics for sale to unaffiliated customers.

For further segment information, refer to Note 8 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.
 
The Company knows of no other manufacturer in the Western Hemisphere whose sales of glace’ (candied) fruit is equal to those of Paradise, Inc. While there is no industry-wide data available, management estimates that the Company sold approximately 85% of all candied fruits and peels consumed in the U.S. during 2018. The Company knows of two major competitors; however, it estimates that neither of these has as large a share of the market as the Company’s.
 
In terms of candied fruit dollar sales, during 2018, approximately 20% were shipped to manufacturing bakers and other institutional users, with the balance being sold through supermarkets and other retail outlets for ultimate use in the home.
 
Sales to retail outlets are usually generated through food brokers operating in exclusively franchised territories. This method of distribution is widely accepted in the food industry because of its efficiency and economy.
 
The principal raw materials used by the Company are fruits, fruit peels, corn syrups and plastic resins. Most of these materials are readily accessible from a number of competitive suppliers. The supply and prices with respect to fruits, fruit peels and corn syrup may fluctuate with growing and crop conditions, factors common to all agricultural products. Feedstock for some plastic resins is petroleum related and may be subject to supply and demand fluctuations in this market.
 
The trademarks “Paradise”, “Dixie”, “Mor-Fruit”, “Sun-Ripe - Holiday Fruit “SR”,” and “Pennant Holiday Fruit” are registered with the appropriate Federal and State authorities for use on the Company’s candied fruit. These registrations are kept current, as required, and have a value in terms of customer recognition.
 
The demand for fruit cake materials is highly seasonal, with over 85% of sales in these items occurring during the months of September, October and November. However, in order to meet delivery requirements during this relatively short period, the Company must process candied fruit and peels for approximately ten months during the year. Also, the Company must acquire the fruits used as raw materials during their seasonal growing periods. These factors result in large inventories, which require financing to meet relatively large short-term working capital needs.
 
During 1993, and through another wholly owned subsidiary, the Company launched an enterprise for the growing and selling of strawberries, both fresh and frozen. Plant City, Florida, the location of the Company’s manufacturing facilities and main office, styles itself as the “The Winter Strawberry Capital” because of the relatively large volume of fruit that is grown and harvested locally, mostly from December through April of each season. However, once competing fresh berries from the West Coast of the USA begin finding their way to market, the price of Florida fruit begins to diminish, and local growers have no other market for their product.
 
While there are significant freight cost advantages in the sale and marketing of local strawberries to customers in the eastern U.S., growers and producers on the West Coast, from southern California to Washington State, still dominate pricing and marketing conditions. The Company estimates more than 90% of total U.S. strawberry production is located in that area.

Therefore, Paradise, Inc. limits growing and selling of strawberries to years in which basic supply and demand statistics, such as West Coast harvest predictions and frozen strawberry prior year inventory carryovers, lead to a reasonable anticipation of profitability.
 
In the molded plastics segment of business, sales to unaffiliated customers continue to strengthen. This trend began several years ago when management shifted its focus from the sale of high volume, low profit “generics” to higher value added custom applications.
 
Some molded plastics container demand is seasonal, by virtue of the fact that a substantial portion of sales are made to packers of food items and horticultural interests, with well defined growing and/or harvest seasons.
 
In the opinion of management, the seasonal nature of some plastics sales does not have a significant impact upon the working capital requirements of the Company.
 
During the first several months of the year, the Company contracts with certain commercial bakers for future delivery of quantities representing a substantial portion of the sales of fruit cake materials to institutional users. Deliveries against these contracts are completed prior to the close of the fiscal year ending December 31.
 
It is a trade practice to allow some supermarket chains to return unopened cases of candied fruit products that remain unsold at year-end, an option for which they normally pay a premium. A provision for the estimated losses on retail returns is included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements, for the year during which the sales are made.
 
With the continuing acquisitions, mergers and other consolidations in the supermarket industry, there is increasing concentration of candied fruit buying activity. During 2018, the Company derived 12% of its consolidated net sales from Walmart Stores, Inc. This customer is not affiliated with Paradise, Inc. in any way. The loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on operating earnings.
 
The molded plastics industry is very large and diverse, and management has no reasonable estimate of its total size. Many products produced by the Company are materials for its own use in the packaging of candied fruits for sale at the retail level. Outside sales represent approximately 90% of the Company’s total plastics production at cost. During 2018, the Company derived 12% of its consolidated net sales from Aqua Cal, Inc. The loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on operating earnings.
 
In the above business segments, it is the opinion of management that price, which is to include the cost of delivery, is the largest single competitive factor, followed by product quality and customer service.

Given the above competitive criteria, it is the opinion of management that the Company is in a favorable position.
 
Over the years, the Company has made capital investments in order to comply with the growing body of environmental regulations. These have included the building of screening and pretreatment facilities for water effluent, the redesign and rebuilding of one processing department in order to improve the control of the quality of air emissions, and removing certain underground fuel storage tanks to approved above ground locations. All of these facilities are permitted by governmental authorities at various levels, and are subjected to periodic testing as a condition of permit maintenance and renewal. All required permitting is currently in effect, and the Company is in full compliance with all terms and conditions stated therein.
 
By local ordinance, it is required that all water effluent is metered, tested and discharged into a municipal industrial waste treatment plant. During 2018, costs for this discharge approximated $300,000, and management estimates that all expenses directly related to compliance with environmental regulations total well over $325,000 annually, which includes costs for permits, third party inspections and depreciation of installations.
 
The Company employs between 95 - 150 people, depending upon the season.
 
The Company conducts operations principally within the United States. Foreign activities are not material.
