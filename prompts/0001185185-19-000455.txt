ITEM 1. Business
Description of Business
 
Altitude International, Inc. (the “Company”) (formerly known as Titan Computer Services, Inc.) was incorporated on July 13, 1994 in the State of New York.
 
On June 27, 2017, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (“Share Exchange”) with Altitude International, Inc, a Wisconsin corporation (“Altitude”). Altitude was incorporated on May 18, 2017, under the laws of the state of Wisconsin. Altitude specializes in creating properly engineered, membrane-based designs for simulated altitude training equipment. The product line ranges from personal at home use machines to fully integrated environmental rooms and chambers. The Company changed its name on June 4, 2018 to “Altitude International, Inc.” to reflect its current operations.
The Exchange
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange, the Company agreed to issue 6,102,000 shares of its common stock to the individual shareholders of Altitude on a pro rata basis in exchange for receive 100% of the shares of Altitude. Following the Share Exchange, Altitude is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
Corporate History
 
Following the Exchange, the Company, through its operating subsidiary Altitude, specializes in creating uniquely-engineered, membrane-based designs for simulated altitude training environments. The product line ranges from personal at home use machines to fully integrated environmental rooms and chambers. Through a license agreement with Sporting Edge UK, a brand well-established in the United Kingdom, the Company intends to expand its technology into the American marketplace, where the appetite for increasing performance in elite athletes, professional sports, equine sports, and universities and colleges is immense.
Competition
 
Currently, the membrane-based technology is not being well used in the United States. In North America, there exists some companies that provide altitude training masks, but the equipment is on a much smaller scale intended for personal use. This type of equipment employs PSA technology, which has reliability issues and a restricted altitude capacity.
Marketing and Customers
 
Altitude has focused its efforts on building a customer base with elite athletes, professional sports teams, universities, and health and fitness chains.

It is essential that potential customers can be accessed easily and quickly, but this is often difficult.  Getting access to an organization can be difficult and getting to the right person even more so.  Altitude has two strategies to achieve this:
 
A strategic partnership with Woodway, who will be the distributor of Altitude products in all of North, Central and South America in all markets save Equestrian and Health & Fitness clubs.  This gives immediate access, at the right level, to every university, college, hospital and professional sports team in the USA and many more in other parts of the territory.  The traditional delays and costs associated with assembling a large and trained sales team are avoided as are the expenses associated with running such a large team.  Altitude is pleased to be working with Woodway, a world leader in treadmill sales and a company that even has a special treadmill installed in the International Space Station.
 
A small network of ambassadors are associated with the Company, including:
 

• | Robert Kanuth | Businessman and ex-Harvard basketball star 
--+----------------------+---------------------------------------------
• | Landon Adler | Ex-professional basketball player 
• | Jonathan Goldfarb | Ex world top-50 tennis player 
• | Ron Turner | Football coach from a famous coaching family
• | Lesley Visser | Outstanding sportscaster and media icon 
• | Professor Greg Whyte | Internationally renowned Sports Physiologist

 
We hope that our ambassadors will help us access decision makers at the highest level who are pre-disposed to listen to our message.  We hope their work, alongside the marketing being undertaken by Woodway and our licensed Altitude technology and training protocols will help grow the business.
 
A demonstration facility is already installed in Wisconsin and a second such facility is planned for Florida, so that customers can experience the environment first hand.
 
Principal Agreements Affecting Our Ordinary Business
 
Altitude has several agreements in place related to its business operations.
 
Revised Sporting Edge UK Licensing Agreement
 
Altitude has a Revised Licensing Agreement with Sporting Edge UK that grants a license to Altitude to use Sporting Edge UK’s proprietary technology related to properly engineered, membrane-based designs for simulated altitude training equipment. The annual license fee under the revised agreement is $1.00 per year. The product line ranges from personal at home use machines to fully integrated environmental rooms and chambers. Altitude has the licensing rights to use all technology to manufacture the products and to sell them (directly or through distributors) in the following territories:

● | The Continent of North America, Central America, The Continent of South America.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Other territories as may be agreed from time to time, on a temporary or permanent basis.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Woodway Agreement
 
Altitude and Woodway USA Inc. entered into an Amended and Restated Sole Distribution Agreement in June 2017. Pursuant to the terms of that Agreement, Woodway will be the sole Distributor of Altitude products in all of North, Central and South America in all markets save Equestrian and Health & Fitness clubs.  As part of the Sole Distribution Agreement, Woodway will raise awareness and understanding of the Products in the Territory by way of seminars, briefings, demonstrations, presentations, advertising and other sales activities.
Business Strategy
 
The Company seeks to set itself apart from other altitude training technology by introducing to elite athletes, health and fitness clubs, and profession sports teams novel training techniques proven to increase performance. The Company has developed technology and training protocols that make possible large improvements in fitness and performance in normal room environments. The well-financed sports market of North America offers the Company opportunities to manufacture and distribute its products to a welcoming customer base.

The 2019 Business Plan is centered on several concurrent activities. These activities include, but are not limited to: sales support material development, market technology education and select market penetration. While these elements are considered concurrent, the order listed depicts a priority of operation for the plan.
 
In general, the US market lags behind Europe with respect to utilizing simulated altitude as a training and recovery technology. As Altitude intends to bring the US into the main stream of performance altitude training, certain information and awareness thresholds must be crossed. Specifically, collateral material must be created that reflects US centric market trends and that depict the current knowledge base for the technology.
 
Targeted groups of credible and trend setting end-users must be identified and exposed to the state-of-the-science as it relates to the training and recovery attributes of hypoxic induced physiological adaptation. Initially these groups will consist of elite athletes and professionals, advanced collegiate programs and therapeutic medical professionals.
 
The educational process will be carefully aligned with a focused sales program. The intent of the sales program will be to advance the technology by sales of Altitude systems to high visibility and influential organizations. These organizations and their market positions will serve as the launching platform for Altitude in the US.
 
As noted above, while these actions are somewhat concurrent, the focus of the Company will be on developing the US message and collateral marketing material. Starting quarter two the focus will move towards education and sales. While the education process must technically occur in advance of sales, it is anticipated that the lag time between the two steps will be short. This being said, it should be noted that the process of education, sales and delivery/commissioning is expected to be 3 to 9 months on any given system.
 
Industry Operating Environment
 
Whether at the Olympic level or in professional and college teams, top level sports require individuals to perform at their maximum potential.  Margins between success and failure are small--the difference between first and last in the Tour de France is three percent--and athletes constantly seek to close the gap between success and failure.
 
Many American athletes currently engage in altitude training by travelling to elevations of about 6,000ft to train in air with decreased oxygen levels. Though this type of training has its benefits, it does not come without costs.  Traveling creates a disruption to an athlete’s normal training schedule as well as considerable economic costs to travel and train in those locations.  Altitude WI’s licensed technology allows for all the benefits of altitude training without the disruptions of travel.
 
U.S. suppliers of altitude training equipment exist but they use an entirely different technology that almost entirely focuses on a mask-based approach.   This cumbersome approach is not favored by the athletes and impedes normal breathing patterns.  Altitude’s approach is to create room environments that are not only precisely controllable for simulated altitude level, but also for temperature and humidity – allowing the climate of almost any location on the planet to be replicated.  This allows many combinations of altitude, heat and humidity stresses to be created and also provides for pre-acclimatization of players about to compete outside their normal climate zone.  These additional stresses deliver increased benefits compared to altitude training alone.
 
Development
 
The product designs licensed from Sporting Edge UK are proven and cover a wide range of room sizes.  The only requirement is to change from metric to imperial sizes where necessary.
 
There are three unique elements to the Altitude proposition:
 

● | Sophisticated Touch Screen control systems capable of integrating the control of simulated altitude, temperature and humidity.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A unique design of Air Separation Unit with only a single active part that provides for ultra-reliable operation and a design life of greater than fifteen years.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Proven training protocols that allow the desired training benefits to be achieved.

Altitude has leased space in the Woodway facility in Waukesha, Wisconsin to undertake the manufacture of systems.  The work will primarily consist of the assembly of components into the unique licensed designs.  Initial recruitment of technically-capable persons will be necessary, followed by short training blocks to pass on the required skills.  At least one person is likely to visit the UK to see systems in operation and obtain hands-on experience of the manufacturing requirement.  Woodway is an engineering-based company and provides the perfect environment to establish an operation which is in many ways similar to their own.  In addition, many aspects of infrastructure – goods handling, welfare facilities, etc. – can be accessed immediately without expense to Altitude.
