Item 1.Business.
Our Company
Merit Medical Systems, Inc. is a leading manufacturer and marketer of proprietary medical devices used in interventional, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, particularly in cardiology, radiology, oncology, critical care and endoscopy. We strive to be the most customer-focused company in healthcare. Each day we are determined to make a difference by understanding our customers’ needs and innovating and delivering a diverse range of products that improve the lives of people and communities throughout the world. We believe that long-term value is created for our customers, employees, shareholders, and communities when we focus outward and are determined to deliver an exceptional customer experience.
Merit Medical Systems, Inc. was founded in 1987 by Fred P. Lampropoulos, Kent W. Stanger, Darla Gill and William Padilla. Initially we focused our operations on injection and insert molding of plastics. Our first product was a specialized control syringe used to inject contrast solution into a patient’s arteries for a diagnostic cardiac procedure called an 

1



angiogram. Since that time, our products and product lines have expanded substantially, both through internal research and development projects and through strategic acquisitions.


Business Strategy
Our business strategy focuses on five target areas as follows:

● | enhancing global growth and profitability through research and development, sales model optimization, cost discipline and operational focus;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | optimizing our operational capability through lean processes, cost effective environments and asset utilization;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We conduct our operations through a number of domestic and foreign subsidiaries and representative offices. Our principal offices are located at 1600 West Merit Parkway, South Jordan, Utah, 84095, and our telephone number is (801) 253-1600. We maintain an internet website at www.merit.com.
COVID-19 Pandemic
​
During the last two years, the COVID-19 pandemic has had an unsteady but significant impact on our business, suppliers, customers, employees, families and communities. Measures designed to contain the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, border closures, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, business limitations and shutdowns continued through the year. In addition, we continued to execute, and enhance, protocols to promote the safety of our employees in the workplace while producing essential medical products. 
​
In efforts to contain the spread of the virus, many of our hospital customers prioritized their efforts on their COVID-19 response, diverting their focus and resources away from their normal operations and restricting access to their sites. In 2021, these restrictions were generally reduced, and we were able to achieve the highest annual revenue in the history of the Company. However, lingering effects continue, including unpredictable freight and other logistical expenses and obstacles, and the responses of government authorities and our customers vary from region to region. Please refer to the discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic under the heading “The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted our business and operations around the world and may continue to materially and adversely impact our business, operations and financial results.” set forth below in Item 1A “Risk Factors.”
​

Marketing and Sales
​
Target Market/Industry. Our principal target markets are peripheral intervention, cardiac intervention, interventional oncology, critical care and endoscopy. Within these markets our products are used in the following clinical areas: diagnostic and interventional cardiology; interventional radiology; neurointerventional radiology; vascular, general and thoracic surgery; electrophysiology; cardiac rhythm management; interventional pulmonology; interventional nephrology; orthopedic spine surgery; interventional oncology; pain management; breast cancer surgery; outpatient access centers; intensive care; computed tomography; ultrasound; and interventional gastroenterology.
According to statistics published by the National Center for Health Statistics, cardiovascular disease continues to be a leading cause of death and a significant health problem in the U.S. Treatment options range from dietary changes to surgery, depending on the nature of the specific disease or disorder. Endovascular techniques, including angioplasty, stenting and endoluminal stent grafts, continue to represent important therapeutic options for the treatment of vascular disease. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women and is the second leading cause of cancer death among women. We derive a large percentage of our revenues from sales of products used during percutaneous diagnostic and interventional procedures such as angiography, angioplasty and stent placement, and we intend to pursue additional sales growth by building on our existing market position in both core technology and accessory products.
Marketing Strategy. Traditionally, as part of our product sales and marketing efforts, we attend major medical conventions throughout the world pertaining to our target markets and invest in market development including physician training, peer-to-peer education, and patient outreach. Due to the various restrictions imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, during 2020 and 2021 most medical conventions in which we have participated were virtual meetings. Additionally, we work closely with major healthcare facilities and physicians involving our primary target markets in the areas of training, therapy awareness programs, clinical studies and ongoing product research and development.
In general, our target markets are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries. We plan to continue to develop and launch innovative products to support clinical trends and to address the increasing demands of these markets. 
Product Development Strategy. Our product development is focused on identifying and introducing a regular flow of profitable products that meet customer needs. To stay abreast of customer needs, we frequently seek suggestions from health care professionals working in the fields of medicine in which we offer or develop products. Suggestions for new products and product improvements may also come from engineers, marketing and sales personnel, physicians and technicians who perform clinical procedures.
When we believe that a product suggestion demonstrates a sustainable competitive advantage, meets customer needs, fits strategically and technologically with our business and has a good potential financial return, we generally assemble a “project team” comprised of individuals from our sales, marketing, engineering, manufacturing, legal and quality assurance departments. This team works to identify the customer requirements, integrate the design, compile necessary documentation and testing, and prepare the product for market introduction. We believe that one of our competitive strengths is our capacity to conceive, design, develop and introduce new products.

U.S. and International Sales. Sales of our products in the U.S. accounted for 57%, 57% and 58% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In the U.S., we have a dedicated, direct sales organization primarily focused on selling to end-user physicians, hospitals and alternate site facilities (e.g., office-based labs), major buying groups and integrated healthcare networks.

Internationally, we employ sales representatives and contract with independent dealer organizations and custom procedure tray manufacturers to distribute our products worldwide, including territories in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Oceania, Central and South America, Mexico and Canada. In 2021, our international sales grew 12.6% over our 2020 international sales and accounted for 43% of our net sales. 

Our largest non-U.S. market is China, which represented 13% of our net sales in 2021 and reported net sales of $138.2 million, $113.2 million, and $113.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We maintain a distribution center and administrative office in Beijing. We also have small sales offices in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Hong Kong. We sell our products through more than 500 distributors in mainland China, who are responsible for reselling our products, primarily to hospitals. We use the “modified direct” sales approach in China, employing sales personnel throughout China who work with our distributors to promote the clinical advantages of our products to clinicians and other decision makers at hospitals.

Beginning in 2020, we experienced a significant disruption of our business throughout the world as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and this disruption continued through 2021. We are unable to calculate the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, and we are unable to predict whether we will continue to be affected by it, but we have seen a material adverse impact on our global operations and financial condition, primarily in 2020. However, in 2021, we saw significant growth in global sales compared to 2020 as the demand for our products increased when many of the medical procedures delayed from 2020 were performed and the restrictions put in place in response to the pandemic were generally reduced. For further discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, please refer to disclosure under the heading “The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted our business and operations around the world and may continue to materially and adversely impact our business, operations and financial results.” set forth in Item 1A “Risk Factors.”
In Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA), we have both direct and modified direct sales operations. Such sales operations are active throughout the region, including the largest markets in Western, Southern, Central and Eastern Europe and the emerging markets within EMEA.

Our direct sales personnel are principally engaged in each of our divisions. Marketing teams responsible for each division operate clinical education programs, often directed by leading subject matter personnel, who provide technical instruction on techniques and therapies to physicians, nurses and technologists. We are currently conducting education programs specific to radial access, spinal intervention, surgical grafts, wire-free tumor localization and electrophysiology.
We require our international dealers to store products and sell directly to customers within defined sales territories. Each of our products must be approved for sale under the laws of the country in which it is sold. International dealers are responsible for compliance with applicable anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as well as all applicable laws and regulations in their respective countries.
We consider training to be a critical factor in the success of our sales force. Members of our sales force are trained by our clinical marketers, our staff professionals, consulting physicians, and senior field trainers in their respective territories.
OEM Sales. Our global OEM Division sells components and finished devices, including molded components, sub-assembled goods, custom kits and bulk non-sterile goods, to medical device manufacturers. These products may be combined with other components and products from other companies and sold under a Merit or customer label. Products sold by our OEM Division can be customized and enhanced to customer specifications, including packaging, labeling and a variety of physical modifications. Our OEM Division serves customers with a staff of regional sales representatives based in the U.S., Europe and Asia, and a dedicated OEM Engineering and Customer Service Group.

Customers
We provide products to hospitals and alternate site-based physicians, technicians and nurses. Hospitals and acute care facilities in the U.S. purchase our products through our direct sales force, distributors, OEM partners, or custom procedure tray manufacturers who assemble and combine our products in custom kits and packs. Outside the U.S., hospitals and acute care facilities generally purchase our products through our direct sales force, or, in the absence of a sales force, through independent distributors or OEM partners.
Research and Development

Our research and development operations have been central to our historical growth, and we believe they will be critical to our continued growth. In recent years, our commitment to innovation led to the introduction of several new products, improvements to our existing products and expansion of our product lines, as well as enhancements and new equipment in our research and development facilities.
We continue to develop new products and make improvements to our existing products utilizing many different sources. In 2021, our Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President of Global Research & Development worked closely with our sales and marketing teams to incorporate feedback from physicians and clinicians in the field, which contributed to innovative new products and improvements to our existing products.
In 2021, we completed projects that resulted in the newest additions to our product lineup: SCOUT Mini Reflector, Temno Elite™, OneVac™ Evacuated Drainage Bottle, Siege 027 and the BlueFire Infiltration System.
Currently, we have research and development facilities in California, Texas, Utah, Ireland, France, and Singapore.
Manufacturing
We manufacture many of our products using our proprietary technology and our expertise in plastic injection and insert molding. We generally contract with third parties for the tooling of our molds, but we design and own most of our molds.  We have also received various International Standards Organization (“ISO”) certifications for many of our facilities; for further details, please refer to Item 1. “Business - Sustainability” below. Merit Sensor Systems, Inc. (“Merit Sensors”) develops and markets silicon pressure sensors to a range of enterprises and presently supplies the sensors we use in our digital inflation devices and blood pressure sensors.
​
Given the specialization of our manufacturing personnel and processes in our Utah and Ireland facilities, we possess the capability to strategically shift the manufacture of more technologically advanced products to those facilities and use the manufacturing capacity of our other facilities for more commoditized products. The actual determination of manufacturing location will be based upon multiple factors, including technological capabilities, market demand, acquisition and integration activities and economic and competitive conditions.
​
We currently produce and package all of our embolic products. Manufacturing of our embolic products includes the synthesis and processing of raw materials and third-party manufactured compounds.
​
We have packaging and manufacturing facilities located in Texas, Virginia, Utah, Mexico, Brazil, Ireland, France, The Netherlands, and Singapore. See Item 2. “Properties.”
We ship our products through distribution centers located in Virginia, Utah, Canada, Brazil, The Netherlands, United Kingdom (“UK”), South Africa, Russia, South Korea, India, New Zealand, Japan, China and Australia.
​
Competition
The medical products industry is highly competitive. Many of our competitors are much larger than us and have access to greater resources. We also compete with smaller companies that sell single or limited numbers of products in specific product lines or geographies. We compete globally in several market areas, including radiology; diagnostic and 

9



interventional cardiology; interventional radiology; neurointerventional radiology; vascular, general and thoracic surgery; electrophysiology; cardiac rhythm management; interventional pulmonology; interventional nephrology; orthopedic spine surgery; interventional oncology; pain management; outpatient access centers; intensive care; computed tomography; ultrasound; and interventional gastroenterology.
The principal competitive factors in the markets in which our products are sold are quality, price, value, product features, customer service, breadth of line, and customer relationships. We believe our products have achieved market acceptance primarily due to the quality of materials and workmanship of our products, clinical outcomes, their innovative design, our willingness to customize our products to fit customer needs, and our prompt attention to customer requests. Some of our primary competitive strengths are our relative stability in the marketplace; a comprehensive, broad line of ancillary products; and our history of introducing a variety of new products and product line extensions to the market on a regular basis.
Our primary competitors in our peripheral intervention market are Teleflex Incorporated (“Teleflex”), Cook Medical Incorporated (“Cook Medical”), Medtronic plc (“Medtronic”), Boston Scientific Corporation (“Boston Scientific”), and Becton, Dickinson and Company (“BD”). Our primary competitors in our cardiac intervention market are BD, Teleflex, Medtronic, Abbott Laboratories, Terumo Corporation, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation, Cook Medical, and Boston Scientific. Our primary competitors in our spine market are Medtronic, Stryker Corporation, and Johnson & Johnson. Our primary competitors in our oncology market are BD, Hologic, Inc., Argon Medical Devices, Inc. and Cook Medical. Our primary competitors in our endoscopy market are Getinge AB, Boston Scientific, Cook Medical, and Olympus Corporation.
Based on available industry data, with respect to the number of procedures performed, we believe we are a leading provider of digital inflation technology in the world. In addition, we believe we are one of the market leaders in the U.S. for analog inflation devices. We believe we are a market leader in the U.S. for control syringes, radar localization, waste-disposal systems, embolic beads, tubing and manifolds. Although we believe our recent and planned additions to these product lines will help us compete even more effectively in both the U.S. and international markets, we cannot give any assurance that we will be able to maintain our existing competitive advantages or compete successfully in the future.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
Raw materials essential to our business are generally purchased worldwide and are normally available in quantities adequate to meet the needs of our business. Where there are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials has not historically had a material adverse effect on our financial results; however, current fluctuations and uncertainties in supply chain, transportation logistics, and freight expenses could result in disruptions in our operations and materially impact our financial results. 
Proprietary Rights and Litigation
We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property. We have a number of U.S. and foreign-issued patents and pending patent applications, including rights to patents and patent applications acquired through strategic transactions, which relate to various aspects of our products and technology. The duration of our patents is determined by the laws of the country of issuance and, for the U.S., is typically 20 years from the date of filing of the patent application. As of December 31, 2021, we owned approximately 1,600 U.S. and international patents and patent applications. This number decreased in 2021 because we abandoned certain patents that were expected to expire before we could obtain regulatory approval and commercialize the related products. As a result, we were able to avoid paying the significant annuities and maintenance and prosecution fees required to keep those patents alive. 
​
Additionally, we hold exclusive and non-exclusive licenses to a variety of third-party technologies covered by patents and patent applications. In the aggregate, our intellectual property assets are critical to our business, but no single patent, trademark or other intellectual property asset is of material importance to our business.
​

The Merit® name and logo are trademarks in the U.S. and other countries. In addition to the Merit name and logo, we have used, registered or applied for registration of other specific trademarks and service marks to help distinguish our products, technologies and services from those of our competitors in the U.S. and foreign countries. See Item 1. “Business - Products” above. The duration of our trademark registrations varies from country to country; in the U.S. we can generally maintain our trademark rights and renew any trademark registrations for as long as the trademarks are in use. As of December 31, 2021, we owned approximately 650 U.S. and foreign trademark registrations and trademark applications. We increased our trademark applications in 2021 in an effort to protect our trademark rights in jurisdictions outside the U.S. 
​
There is substantial litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry. At any given time, we may be involved as either a plaintiff or a defendant, as well as a counter-claimant or counter-defendant, in patent, trademark, and other intellectual property infringement actions. If a court rules against us in any intellectual property litigation we could be subject to significant liabilities, be forced to seek licenses from third parties, or be prevented from marketing certain products. In addition, intellectual property litigation is costly and may consume significant time of employees and management.
​
Regulation 
​
Corporate Integrity Agreement. In October 2020, we entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement (“CIA”) with the Office of Inspector General (“OIG”), a five-year agreement that was a condition of our settlement with the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”). The CIA subjects us to certain compliance, monitoring, reporting, certification, oversight and training obligations. The CIA requires, among other matters, that we (i) maintain a compliance officer, a compliance committee, board review and oversight of certain federal healthcare compliance matters and compliance and disclosure programs; (ii) establish compliance policies and procedures to meet the requirements of all federal health care programs and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”); (iii) provide management certifications and compliance training and education; (iv) engage an independent review organization to conduct a thorough review of our systems, policies, processes and procedures related to promotional materials, product evaluations, consulting agreements, trainings provided to healthcare professionals, sponsorships, grants and charitable contributions; (v) implement a risk assessment and internal review process; (vi) establish a disclosure program for whistleblowers; (vii) increase oversight of the interactions between our sales personnel and healthcare providers; and (viii) report or disclose certain events and physician payments. We recently completed our first reporting year under the CIA and are in the process of implementing certain recommendations made by the independent review organization. 
​
Our failure to comply with our obligations under the CIA could result in monetary penalties and our exclusion from participation in federal health care programs.
​
The foregoing description of the CIA is qualified in their entirety by the full terms of the CIA, which is attached as Exhibit 10.46  hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
​
Regulatory Approvals. Our products and operations are global and are subject to regulations by the FDA and various other federal and state agencies, as well as by foreign governmental agencies. These agencies enforce laws and regulations that control the design, development, testing, clinical trials, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising, marketing, distribution, and post-market surveillance of our medical products.
​
The time required to obtain approval by the FDA and other foreign governmental agencies can be lengthy and the requirements may differ. In particular, in May 2017, the EU adopted Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (“MDR”), which replaced Council Directive 93/92/EEC (“MDD”) as of May 26, 2021. Under transitional provisions, medical devices with notified body certificates issued under the MDD prior to May 26, 2021 may continue to be placed on the market for the remaining validity of the certificate or until May 26, 2024, whichever is first. After the expiry of any applicable transitional period, only devices that have been CE marked under the MDR may be placed on the market in the EU. We are preparing to comply with these new regulations before the transitional period expires. However, there will be products that we will instead choose to discontinue or postpone introduction in the EU. This decision will depend on a number of factors, including changing business strategies, timing and cost of obtaining MDR certification, availability of necessary data and the capacity of Notified Bodies. The MDR includes increasingly stringent requirements in multiple areas, such as pre-

11



market clinical evidence, review of high-risk devices, labeling and post-market surveillance. Under the MDR, pre-market clinical data will now be required to obtain CE Mark approval for high-risk, new and modified medical devices. 
​
U.S. and global counter-part regulatory approval processes for medical devices are expensive, uncertain and lengthy. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary regulatory approvals for any product on a timely basis or at all. Delays in receipt of or failure to receive such approvals, the loss of previously received approvals, or the failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
​
In May 2020, we received the CE mark for the Merit Wrapsody Endoprosthesis, and we are pursuing regulatory approval in the U.S. and elsewhere. We are conducting a large, multinational pivotal human clinical trial of the Wrapsody Endoprosthesis, which is required for us to obtain approval from the FDA and some international regulatory agencies. Human clinical trials of a medical device are often required for regulatory clearance or approval for devices and are expensive, time-consuming and uncertain. 
​
Quality System Requirements. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and its counterpart non-U.S. laws require us to comply with quality system regulations (“QSR”) pertaining to all aspects of our product design and manufacturing processes, including requirements for packaging, labeling, record keeping, personnel training, supplier controls, design controls, complaint handling, corrective and preventive actions and internal quality system auditing. The FDA and foreign regulators enforce these requirements through periodic inspections of medical device manufacturers. These requirements are complex, technical and require substantial resources to remain compliant. Our failure or the failure of our suppliers to maintain compliance with these requirements could result in the shutdown of our manufacturing operations or the recall of our products, or could restrict our ability to obtain new product approvals or certificates from the FDA that are necessary for export of our products to foreign countries. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business. If one of our suppliers fails to maintain compliance with our quality requirements, we may have to qualify a new supplier and could experience manufacturing delays as a result. We also could be subject to injunctions, product seizures, or civil or criminal penalties.
Labeling and Promotion. Our labeling and promotional activities are also subject to scrutiny by the FDA and foreign regulators. Labeling includes not only the label on a device, but also includes any descriptive or informational literature that accompanies or is used to promote the device. Among other things, labeling violates the law if it is false or misleading in any respect or it fails to contain adequate directions for use. Moreover, product claims that are outside the approved or cleared labeling violate the FDCA and other applicable laws. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials constitute promotion of an uncleared or unapproved use, or otherwise violate the FDCA, it could request that we modify our promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a notice of violation, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fines or criminal penalties. Allegations of off-label promotion can also result in enforcement action by federal, state, or foreign enforcement authorities and trigger significant civil or criminal penalties, including exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and liability under the False Claims Act, discussed further below.
Our product promotion is also subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), which has primary oversight of the advertising of unrestricted devices, including FDA-cleared devices. The Federal Trade Commission Act prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, as well as unfair or deceptive practices such as the dissemination of any false or misleading advertisement pertaining to medical devices. FTC enforcement can result in orders requiring, among other things, limits on advertising, corrective advertising, consumer redress, rescission of contracts and such other relief as the FTC may deem necessary.
In addition, under the federal Lanham Act and similar state laws, competitors and others can initiate litigation relating to advertising claims.
Import Requirements. To import a medical device into the U.S., the importer must file an entry notice and bond with the U.S. Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”). All devices are subject to FDA examination before release from the CBP. Any article that appears to be in violation of the FDCA may be refused admission and a notice of detention and hearing may be issued. If the FDA ultimately refuses admission, the CBP may issue a notice for redelivery and assess 

12



liquidated damages for up to three times the value of the lot. Additionally, the laws of the U.S. require imported articles to have their labels accurately marked with the appropriate country of origin, the violation of which may result in confiscation, fines and penalties.
Export Requirements. Products for export are subject to foreign countries’ import requirements and the exporting requirements of the exporting countries’ regulating bodies, as applicable. International sales of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. that are not approved or cleared by the FDA for use in the U.S., or are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements and we may not be able to export such products.
Foreign countries often require, among other things, an FDA certificate for products for export, also called a Certificate to Foreign Government. To obtain this certificate from the FDA, the device manufacturer must apply to the FDA. The FDA certifies that the product has been granted clearance or approval in the U.S. and that the manufacturing facilities were in compliance with the QSR at the time of the last FDA inspection.
Additionally, the export of our products is subject to restrictions due to trade and economic sanctions imposed by the U.S., the EU and other governments and organizations. The U.S. Departments of Justice, Commerce, State and Treasury and other federal agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals for violations of economic sanctions laws, export control laws, and other federal statutes and regulations, including those established by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). Under these laws and regulations, as well as other export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations, various government agencies may require export licenses and may seek to impose modifications to business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned persons or entities. With the U.S. and other countries exploring export sanctions in response to military exercises and escalating tensions in certain parts of the world, any such export restrictions may affect the company’s business in certain regions of the world.

Additional Post-Market Requirements. As a medical device manufacturer, we are subject to other post-market requirements in multiple jurisdictions, including (i) product listing, (ii) establishment registration, (iii) Unique Device Identification (“UDI”), and (iv) reports of corrections and removals. We are also subject to regulations that require manufacturers to report to the FDA, or an equivalent foreign regulatory body, any incident in which their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device were to recur. Our obligation to report a complaint is triggered on the date on which we become aware of an adverse event and the nature of the event. The FDA also regularly inspects companies to determine compliance with the QSRs and other post-market requirements. Please refer to our discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with these post-market requirements under the heading “Our products may cause or contribute to adverse medical events that we are required to report to the FDA or other governmental authorities, and if we fail to do so, we may be subject to sanctions that may materially harm our business.” set forth in Item 1A “Risk Factors.”
Reimbursement. Our products are generally used in medical procedures that are covered and reimbursed by governmental payers, such as Medicare, and/or private health plans. In general, these third-party payers cover a medical device and/or related procedure in which the device is used only when the payer determines that healthcare outcomes are supported by medical evidence and the device and procedure is medically necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of the patient’s illness or injury. Even if a device has received clearance or approval for marketing by the FDA or, for uses outside of the U.S., a similar foreign regulatory agency, there is no certainty that third-party payers will cover and reimburse for the cost of the device and/or related procedures involving the use of the device. Because of increasing cost-containment pressures, some private payers in the U.S. and government payers in foreign countries may also condition payment on the cost-effectiveness of the device and/or procedure. Even if coverage is available, third-party payers may place restrictions on the circumstances in which they provide coverage or may offer reimbursement that is not sufficient to cover the cost of our products. If healthcare providers such as hospitals and physicians cannot obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products or the procedures in which they are used, this may affect demand for our products and our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could suffer a material adverse impact.
Anti-Corruption Laws. Our international operations are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”), the U.K. Bribery Act and other foreign anti-corruption laws. The FCPA prohibits offering, paying, or promising to pay 

13



anything of value to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or maintaining an improper business advantage. The FCPA also requires that we maintain fair and accurate books and records and devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. In certain countries, the individuals and entities that we regularly interact with may meet the definition of a foreign government official for purposes of the FCPA. As part of our compliance program, we train our U.S. and international employees, and we also train and monitor foreign third parties with whom we contract (e.g., distributors), to comply with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws. Failing to comply with the FCPA or any other anti-corruption law could result in fines, penalties or other adverse consequences. 
As we expand our international operations, we continue to increase the scope of our compliance programs to match the risks relating to the potential for violations of the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws. Our compliance program includes (i) policies addressing not only the FCPA, but also the provisions of a variety of anti-corruption laws in multiple foreign jurisdictions, (ii) provisions relating to books and records that apply to us as a public company, and (iii) effective training for our personnel and relevant third parties.
Transparency Laws. The U.S. Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and similar state laws, also include annual reporting and disclosure requirements for device manufacturers aimed at increasing the transparency of the interactions between device manufacturers and healthcare providers. Reports submitted under these new requirements are placed in a public database. Several other jurisdictions outside the U.S. have also adopted or begun adopting similar transparency laws. In addition to the burden of establishing processes for compliance, if we fail to provide these reports, or if the reports we provide are not accurate, we could be subject to significant penalties.
Anti-Kickback Statutes. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons and entities from, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce the purchase, order, lease, or recommendation of a good or service for which payment may be made in whole or part under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid, unless the arrangement fits within one of several statutory exemptions or regulatory “safe harbors.” The definition of remuneration has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash and waivers of payments. Violations can result in significant penalties, imprisonment and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Exclusion of a manufacturer would preclude any federal healthcare program from paying for the manufacturer’s products. Under the Affordable Care Act, a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute is deemed to be a violation of the False Claims Act, which is discussed in more detail below. A party’s failure to fully satisfy the obligations of a regulatory “safe harbor” provision may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities.
In addition to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, many states have their own anti-kickback laws. Often, these laws closely follow the language of the federal law, although they do not always have the same exceptions or safe harbors. In some states, these anti-kickback laws apply with respect to all payers, including commercial health insurance companies.
Government officials continue their vigorous enforcement efforts on the sales and marketing activities of pharmaceutical, medical device and other healthcare companies, including the pursuit of cases against individuals or entities that allegedly offered unlawful inducements to potential or existing customers to procure their business. Settlements of these government cases have involved significant fines and penalties and, in some instances, criminal proceedings.
False Claims Laws. The False Claims Acts prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a claim paid. The Civil False Claims Act can be violated without actual knowledge and only requires reckless disregard or deliberate ignorance, while the Criminal False Claims Act requires a higher knowledge standard of actual knowledge and intent to violate. Manufacturers can be held liable under the False Claims Acts, even if they do not submit claims to the government, if they are found to have caused the submission of false claims (e.g., by third parties such as healthcare providers). The Civil False Claims Act also includes whistleblower provisions that allow private citizens to bring suit against an entity or individual on behalf of the U.S. and to recover a portion of any monetary recovery. Many of the recent, highly publicized settlements in the healthcare industry relating to sales and marketing practices have been cases brought under the Civil False Claims Act. Most states also have adopted statutes or regulations similar to the federal laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Sanctions under the federal False Claims Acts and similar state laws may include civil monetary penalties, treble damages, criminal fines and/or imprisonment.

14



Labor Standards Laws. We are also subject to corporate social responsibility (“CSR”) laws and regulations which require us to monitor the labor standards in our supply chain, including the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, the UK Modern Slavery Act, and U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulations regarding Combating Trafficking in Persons. These CSR laws and regulations may impose additional processes and supplier management systems and have led certain key customers to impose additional requirements on medical device companies, including audits, as a prerequisite to selling products to such customers, which could result in increased costs for our products, the termination or suspension of certain suppliers, and reductions in our margins and profitability.
Privacy and Security. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (the “HITECH Act”), and accompanying rules, require certain entities, referred to as “covered entities” (including most healthcare providers and health plans), to comply with established standards, including standards regarding the privacy and security of protected health information (“PHI”). Many state laws also regulate the use and disclosure of health information and require notification in the event of a breach of such information.
The EU has adopted a single EU privacy regulation, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). The GDPR can have an extraterritorial scope and, in particular, applies to the processing of personal data in the context of the activities of an establishment of a company (controller or a processor) in the EU, regardless of whether the processing takes place in the EU or not. In addition, it applies to the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the EU by a controller or processor not established in the EU, where the processing activities are related to: (a) the offering of goods or services, irrespective of whether a payment of the data subject is required, to such data subjects in the EU; or (b) the monitoring of their behavior as far as their behavior takes place within the EU. The GDPR provides for a harmonization of the data protection regulations throughout the EU. It imposes a strict data protection compliance regime with severe penalties of up to the greater of 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year or €20 million (whichever is higher) and includes new rights such as the “portability” of personal data. Although the GDPR applies across the EU without a need for local implementing legislation, it contains a number of opener clauses enabling the EU Member States to provide for additional legislation. In addition, local data protection authorities still have the ability to interpret the GDPR, which has the potential to create inconsistencies on a country-by-country basis. We have implemented changes to our business practices to comply with the GDPR.
As a consequence of Brexit, the GDPR no longer directly applies in the UK. However, the UK Data Protection Act 2018 remains in force, which incorporates the GDPR into UK legislation with some minor amendments to take account of the UK's departure from the EU. Thus, we remain subject to the applicable provisions of the GDPR in the UK. 
The People’s Republic of China has introduced a comprehensive personal information protection regime by establishing a unified, cross-sector legislation, as the EU does with the GDPR. This legislation, called the Personal Information Protection Law (“PIPL”), went into effect on November 1, 2021, and has many aspects that are similar to the GDPR. The PIPL sets rules for the processing activities such as collection, use, sharing, transfer, and disclosure of personal information in China. It also applies to the personal information processing activities outside of China if relevant business operators (a) aim at providing products or services to individuals in China; or (b) engage in analyzing and evaluating the behavior of individuals in China. Among others, the PIPL requires companies as personal information processors (which can be viewed as equivalent to data controllers under the GDPR) to obtain informed consents from the data subjects for the processing activities of their personal information, and separate consents under certain circumstances such as cross-border transfer of personal information. The PIPL also requires storage of personal information locally in China if the company is certified as a critical information infrastructure operator (“CIIO”) or processing personal information exceeding a certain volume threshold. Further, the PIPL grants statutory rights to data subjects, such as the right to information, the right to withdraw consents, the right of data portability, and the right to refuse automated decision-making. In addition, the PIPL also imposes a number of new administrative requirements on the personal information processors, including, among others, designating a data protection officer if certain conditions are met, signing data processing agreements with entrusted processors (which can be viewed as equivalent to data processors under the GDPR), preparing data breach notices, conducting a personal information impact assessment as required, and obtaining regulatory approval for certain cross-border data transfer activities. Violations of the PIPL may incur severe penalties, including a fine of up to RMB 50 million or 5% of the company's annual turnover in the preceding year, revocation of the company’s license to do business in China, and personal liabilities for company executives. As the PIPL is new and relevant implementation rules are to be finalized 

15



and released, we are in the process of implementing changes to our business practices to comply with the PIPL while monitoring further developments in the law.
We post on our websites our privacy notices, policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of user data. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy notices or policies or with any applicable regulatory requirements or orders, or privacy, data protection, information security or consumer protection-related privacy laws and regulations in one or more jurisdictions could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions, subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase the costs and complexity of compliance, and adversely affect our business. Data protection, privacy and information security have become the subject of increasing public, media and legislative concern. For example, California’s Consumer Protection Act went into effect on January 1, 2020, giving consumers the right to demand certain information and actions from companies who collect personal information. This enhanced scrutiny and legal requirements could result in costly compliance efforts and potentially result in fines, harm to reputation, or other consequences. If our customers were to reduce their use of our products and services as a result of these concerns, our business could be materially harmed. As noted above, we are also subject to the possibility of security and privacy breaches, which themselves may result in a violation of these privacy laws.
CARES Act. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) was signed into law. The $2.2 trillion economic stimulus bill contains numerous tax law changes. The CARES Act established a program with provisions to allow U.S. companies to defer the employer’s portion of social security taxes between March 27, 2020 and December 31, 2020 and pay such taxes in two installments in 2021 and 2022. As permitted by the CARES Act we have deferred payment of the employer’s portion of social security payroll tax payments and made a payment equal to one half of the deferred amount during the year ended December 31, 2021. 
Seasonality

Our worldwide sales have not historically reflected a significant degree of seasonality; however, customer purchases have historically been lower during the third quarter of the year, as compared to other quarters. This reflects, among other factors, lower demand during summer months in countries in the northern hemisphere.

Sustainability
In recent years, the sustainability of our business has become a key focus of our management team. Under the oversight of our Board of Directors, we have created a cross-functional Corporate Sustainability Council that is driving long-term Environment, Social and Governance (“ESG”) goals across our enterprise. These efforts have included proactive actions to address both risks and opportunities related to our sustainability program, as we strive for continued growth and profitability. 
The majority of our products are disposable medical devices and are generally disposed of after a single use due primarily to the risks of exposing patients to bloodborne pathogens capable of transmitting disease or other potentially infectious materials. Additionally, repeated sterilization to address such risks is not possible because it may adversely affect the quality of the materials used in many of our products and result in the failure of our product to function properly if used in multiple medical procedures. Consequently, many of our used products will likely end up in a medical waste disposal facility at the end of their usefulness. We continue to look for opportunities to deliver sustainable, long-term growth of our business. Our sustainability practices are an integral component of our business strategy, and our sustainability activities are reviewed and approved by senior management and our Board of Directors. 

16



By assessing our sustainability opportunities, we have developed areas of focus where we are positioned to make a positive impact. These include programs designed to reduce waste, improve efficiency, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and protect the environment. Our sustainability values in action include:
​

• | achievement of ISO 14001 certification at eight of our largest manufacturing facilities with a continued goal of achieving this certification at all our manufacturing and major distribution facilities (ISO 14001 is the international standard that specifies requirements for an effective environmental management system);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | achievement of ISO 45001 certification at five of our eight largest manufacturing facilities, and our goal is to achieve this certification at all our manufacturing facilities in 2023 (ISO 45001 is the international standard that specifies requirements for an effective safety management system);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | achievement of ISO 50001 certification at our Galway and Singapore facilities, and our goal is to achieve ISO 50001 certification at all our manufacturing facilities by the end of 2023 (ISO 50001 is the international standard that specifies requirements for an effective energy management system);

• | transition to re-usable pallets and methods to move products in bulk containers, reducing intra-company shipping materials;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reduction in packaging materials by implementing product family packaging reviews to consolidate shipments by better understanding our customers’ purchasing practices—these reviews often allow us to increase quantities per box, eliminate the usage of intermediate packaging, reducing film thickness and use original product packaging where possible;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | transition from paper work orders to electronic work orders through our internally designed eWorq program—at full completion, this project will save millions of pieces of paper and thousands of plastic sleeves annually—currently we are working to implement this program at our largest manufacturing facilities in South Jordan, Utah and Tijuana, Mexico during 2022, with plans to continue the roll-out to other sites thereafter;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of recycling programs where our employees recycle materials, including food waste, paper, cardboard, food and beverage containers, scrap metal, and pallets, and re-use of our plastic scrap waste leftover from our manufacturing process of our molded parts;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | placement of free car charging stations for employees who have transitioned to electric vehicles;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | installation of efficient heating and cooling systems that operate on variable efficiency drives, increasing our energy efficiency at our headquarters in South Jordan, Utah and our transition to Light Emitting Diode (“LED”) lighting in our manufacturing facilities; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | operation of an environmental tracking system at our world-wide facilities to facilitate monthly reporting and accountability for energy, water, waste, recycling, and scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gas emissions metrics—this system supports our 2030 operational sustainability goals.

​
Human Capital Management
​
As of December 31, 2021, we had 6,446 employees located in approximately 40 different countries in a variety of different roles. In the highly competitive medical device industry, we consider attracting, developing, and retaining talented people in technical, operational, marketing, sales, research, management, and other positions to be critical to our overall long-term growth strategy. Our ability to recruit and retain such talent depends on several factors, including compensation and benefits, talent development, career opportunities, and work environment. We invest in our people and cultivate a company culture committed to supporting a diverse and inclusive workforce.

17



​
Diversity and Inclusion. Our goal is to create a diverse and inclusive global culture that reflects the diversity of the customers we serve and encourages an environment where employees feel welcomed, respected, and valued. With this goal in mind, in late 2020 the Company hired its first Chief Human Resources Officer who, in part, has been charged with working with our leadership team to strengthen and enhance our diversity and inclusion efforts company wide. We are committed to providing equal opportunity in all aspects of employment. In the U.S., we are an equal opportunity/affirmative action employer committed to making employment decisions without regard to race, religion, ethnicity or national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, disability, protected veteran status or any other characteristics protected by law. Over 50% of our U.S. employee population identifies as non-white. To further promote a culture of inclusion, during 2021 we started the Women’s Leadership Initiative (“WLI”), our first ever affinity group led by women and open to all Merit employees. The WLI contributes to our long-term strategies by promoting a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion through (i) sponsoring professional development activities focused on overcoming barriers and restraints to the advancement of women’s careers, (ii) facilitating external interactions with organizations and thought leaders, and (iii) providing resources focused on improving diversity, equity, and inclusion. 
Employee Engagement. The engagement of our workforce is critical to delivering on our competitive strategy, and we place high importance on informed and engaged employees. We communicate frequently with our employees through a variety of communication methods, including video and written communications, town hall meetings, and our company intranet, and we acknowledge individual contributions to Merit by celebrating milestones of service in five-year increments. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we strengthened our communication platforms. Our employee communications during the pandemic have kept our employees informed on critical priorities, important actions being taken by management in response to the pandemic, and continued efforts to protect employee health, safety and well-being. In addition, the human resource team expanded with the hiring of a Senior Director of Internal Communications, to specifically focus on improving employee communications. 
​
Compensation and Benefits. Because our mission is to create innovative medical devices that improve lives, we aim to hire and develop employees who want to build something special through hard work, team effort, and commitment. That is why we provide all our employees with competitive benefit packages and strive to provide the most cost-effective medical benefits and wellness programs. As a result of our focus on competitive health and wellness benefits, we have achieved our seventh consecutive year of zero health care plan cost increases for our U.S. employees who participate in our group healthcare plans. Our benefits include competitive pay, annual incentive awards and bonus opportunities, healthcare and retirement benefits, an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, paid time off and sick leave, paid parental leave, flexible work schedules, remote working opportunities, and a wellness program. 
​
Talent Development. In 2021, we hired our first ever Vice President of Global HR Operations to focus on global programs around employee performance, development and engagement. To improve employee performance, we have begun building out a global performance management program which will be officially launched in 2023 alongside our new human resources information system. Employee development programs are being executed at different regional and local levels with a focus on management and leadership development.  
​
We have also invested time and resources to strengthen employee engagement. For example, we have partnered with Gallup, a global research and worldwide leader on the topic of engagement, to support efforts in understanding our employee sentiment worldwide. To accomplish this, we are developing a program for surveying employees on a regular basis and creating manager action plans based on the feedback of those surveys.
​
Community. Our employees are actively involved in their communities and supporting causes. At our headquarters, we provide an onsite garden where employees take part in growing and distributing produce to employees and to the local community. Employees also actively support causes by raising awareness and funds for non-profit organizations. Areas that our employees have supported in recent years include Breast Cancer Awareness Month, Heart Health Month, children’s charities and supporting those in need. In 2021, we resumed our support of humanitarian missions and medical education conferences, albeit in a limited fashion considering restrictions imposed in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. We were able to partner with the Heineman-Robicsek Medical Outreach group to provide critical products to support its medical mission to Belize. As the world continues to move forward considering the new normal presented by the COVID-

18



19 pandemic, we are anxious to resume our historical volume of support for bringing healthcare to underserved areas of the globe.
​
Wellness. Wellness is at the foundation of creating a positive employee experience. At our company headquarters in Utah, we have an onsite medical clinic available for our employees and their families where we provide preventative and general medical care. The clinic also currently provides employees with COVID-19 vaccination shots, boosters, and testing. In addition, we have a Chief Wellness Officer dedicated to designing programs and initiatives that support the physical, emotional, and mental health of our employees. This year, we launched a wellness committee and created a “Get Healthy” wellness program available to all sites across the globe. Programs include providing health information from health and nutrition experts, newsletters with wellness and nutrition tips, and activities promoting health and wellbeing such as walking groups. Some programs include suicide prevention awareness, on-site diabetes screenings, immunizations, lifestyle modification to prevent diseases, tobacco cessation, breast cancer awareness, and our Smart Choice meal program designed by our onsite nutritionist and chef to provide free heart healthy meals to employees in our Utah headquarters.

COVID-19 Response; Health and Safety. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of our manufacturing employees have continued to work from our facilities, where we have adopted health screening, implemented social distancing and personal protective equipment requirements, enhanced food service, cleaning and sanitation procedures, and modified workspaces to reduce the potential for disease transmission, and implemented a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for our U.S. employees. Most employees who do not require access to our facility to perform their work have been working from home during the pandemic, without a significant impact to productivity.

Information Security
We maintain strong cybersecurity systems to guard against unauthorized access, malicious software, corruption of data, disruption of our networks and systems and unauthorized release of confidential information. We employ an experienced and dedicated information security team, follow industry best practices, and work with our employees globally to create awareness and mitigate cyber risk. On an ongoing basis, we assess risks and implement procedures and practices designed to improve the security, confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems. We voluntarily engage third-party security auditors to test our systems and controls at least annually against the most widely recognized security standards and regulations. We have developed and continue to implement a continuing cyber awareness training program which is designed to increase awareness of cybersecurity threats throughout our company and reduce the risk of human error. We conduct periodic phishing testing on all our employees with e-mail access and emphasize information security in training events and programs we host throughout the year. 
We have established controls and procedures to escalate enterprise-level issues, including cybersecurity matters, to the appropriate management levels within our organization and our Board of Directors, or members or committees thereof, as appropriate. Our Board of Directors is responsible for enterprise risk management, including our approach to managing cybersecurity risk, and has delegated oversight responsibility to its Audit Committee. The Audit Committee regularly reviews information security risks and receives reports from our Chief Technology Officer and other members of the Company’s management regarding those risks. Under our framework, cybersecurity issues are analyzed by subject matter experts for potential financial, operational, and reputational risks, based on, among other factors, the nature of the matter and breadth of impact. Matters determined to present potential material impacts to the Company’s financial results, operations, and/or reputation are immediately reported by management to our Board of Directors or its Audit Committee, as appropriate, in accordance with our escalation framework. In addition, we have established procedures to ensure that management responsible for overseeing the effectiveness of disclosure controls is informed in a timely manner of known cybersecurity risks and incidents that may materially impact our operations and that timely public disclosure is made as appropriate. We maintain cyber insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms, conditions and limitations, cover certain aspects of cybersecurity risks; however, such insurance coverage may be unavailable or insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk. During the last three years, we have not experienced a material security breach and, as a result, we have not incurred any material expenses from such a breach. Furthermore, during such time, we have not been penalized or paid any amount under any information security breach settlement.
