Customers
 We sell our products primarily to customers in the semiconductor capital equipment industry, and we also have sales to the consumer, medical, energy, industrial, and research equipment industries. The majority of our revenue is in the semiconductor capital equipment industry, which is highly concentrated, and we are therefore highly dependent upon a small number of customers. Our two largest customers in fiscal year 2017, 2016 and 2015 were Applied Materials, Inc. and Lam Research Corporation, each of which accounted for more than 10.0% of our total sales in fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015. As a group, our respective year’s top two customers accounted for 84.4%, 82.2% and 77.0% of the Company’s sales for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The composition of our most significant customers has changed from time to time based on various factors, including acquisition activity by our customers.
 We have successfully qualified as a supplier with each of our customers who require it. This lengthy qualification process involves the inspection and audit of our facilities and evaluation by our customers of our engineering, documentation, manufacturing and quality control processes and procedures. Our customers generally place orders with suppliers who have met and continue to meet their qualification criteria.
 Customer Business Management
 We sell and support our products through our Customer Business Management organization which, as of December 29, 2017, consisted of approximately 102 customer relationship directors, managers and support staff. Our customer relationship directors are responsible for establishing sales strategy and setting the objectives for specific customer accounts. Each customer relationship manager is dedicated to a specific customer account and is responsible for maintaining strong working relationships with that customer. Customer relationship managers work closely with customers and in many cases provide on-site support. Customer relationship managers often attend customers’ internal meetings related to production and engineering design and quality to ensure that customer expectations are interpreted and communicated properly to our operations group. Customer relationship managers also work with our customers to identify and meet their cost and design-to-delivery cycle time objectives.
 We have dedicated business development managers responsible for new business development for gas delivery systems and other critical subsystems. Our new business development managers initiate and develop long-term, multilevel relationships with customers and work closely with customers on new business opportunities throughout the design-to-delivery cycle. Our customer relationship organization includes technical sales support for order placement, spare parts quotes and production status updates. We have a technical relationship representative located at each of our manufacturing facilities. 
 We integrate new business wins into our facilities via a rigorous product transition process, working in concert with our customers to ensure all product production and test requirements are identified, documented, and validated. We employ the same process at all our sites, enabling products to smoothly transition into and between our sites as needed to support customer demand. 
 In addition, we have developed a service and support infrastructure to provide our customers with service and support 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Our dedicated global field service engineers provide customer support through the performance of on-site installation, servicing and repair of our subsystems.
 Technology Development
 We engage in ongoing technology development efforts in order to remain a technology leader for gas delivery systems and to further develop our expertise in other critical subsystems. Our design engineering and new product engineering groups support our technology development activities. Our technology development group works closely with our customers to identify and anticipate changes and trends in next-generation equipment. Our technology development group participates in customer technology partnership programs that focus on process application requirements for gas and liquid delivery systems and other critical subsystems. These development efforts are designed to meet specific customer requirements in the areas of subsystem design, materials, component selection and functionality. Our technology development group also works directly with our suppliers to help them identify new component technologies and make necessary changes in, and enhancements to, the components that we 
 7


integrate into our products. Our analytical and testing capabilities enable us to evaluate multiple supplier component technologies and provide our customers with a wide range of appropriate component and design choices for their gas delivery systems and other critical subsystems.
 Our analytical and testing capabilities also help us anticipate technological changes and requirements in component features for next-generation gas delivery systems and other critical subsystems. We are developing additional features to improve the performance and functionality of our gas delivery systems and other critical subsystems. Our technology development and new product engineering expenses were approximately $11.7 million, $9.9 million and $9.6 million for the 2017, 2016 and 2015 fiscal years, respectively. We perform our technology development activities principally at our facilities in Hayward, California.
 Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in part on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technology and to conduct our business without infringing the proprietary rights of others. Our business is largely dependent upon our design, engineering, manufacturing and testing know-how. We also rely on a combination of trade secrets and confidentiality provisions, and to a much lesser extent, patents, copyrights and trademarks, to protect our proprietary rights. We have four patents with various expiration dates ranging from 2019 to 2034 as a result of our acquisition of Marchi in February 2015. We have no pending U.S. patents. Intellectual property that we develop on behalf of our customers is generally owned exclusively by those customers.
 We require our employees, suppliers and potential business partners to enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements before we disclose to them any sensitive or proprietary information regarding our products, technology or business plans. We require employees to assign to us proprietary information, inventions and other intellectual property they create, modify or improve.
 Competition
 Our industry is highly fragmented. When we compete for new business, we face competition from other suppliers of gas delivery systems and other critical subsystems as well as the internal manufacturing groups of our customers. Customers that have elected to outsource their gas delivery systems and other critical subsystems could elect in the future to develop and manufacture these subsystems internally, leading to further competition.
 Our principal competitor for our gas delivery systems is Ichor Systems, Inc., and our principal competitors for other critical subsystems are Flex Ltd., Foxsemicon Integrated Technology Inc. and Celestica Inc. Some of these competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that could adversely affect sales of our current and future products. In addition, the limited number of potential customers in our industry further intensifies competition. The primary competitive factors in our industry are price, technology, quality, design-to-delivery cycle time, reliability in meeting product demand, service and historical customer relationships. We anticipate that increased competitive pressures will cause intensified price-based competition and we may have to reduce the prices of our products. In addition, we expect to face new competitors as we enter new markets.
 Employees
 As of December 29, 2017, we had 2,747 employees, of which 466 were temporary. Of our total employees, there were 23 in engineering, 16 in technology development, 102 in sales and support, 1,740 in direct manufacturing, 700 in indirect manufacturing and 166 in executive and administrative functions. These figures include 1,051 employees in Asia and 349 employees in Europe. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we have not experienced any work stoppages.
