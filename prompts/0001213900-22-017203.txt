A major factor that provides technical strength and reliability to Cuentas’ project is the fintech ecosystem that it has developed. The foundation of Cuentas’ ecosystem is the fintech-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual platform license and source code from CIMA Telecom, Inc. (“CIMA”) that Cuentas acquired for an aggregate value of $9 Million of capital stock of the Company. We believe that this platform has been proven to be a robust, reliable transactional, marketing, financial and predictive, Tier-1 transactional platform Cuentas’ ecosystem integrates the proprietary CIMA platform via dedicated APIs with Sutton Bank (the issuing bank), IDology (AML & KYC) and InComm (Processor, Load Network & 3rd Party Digital Products).



Cuentas’ Mobile App includes a Mobile Wallet (“Wallet”), Digital Store (“Store”) and is linked with a Prepaid Mastercard® which can be used for ATM withdrawals, online purchases and in-person purchases.



Account holders may deposit funds to their account via (a) no-cost Direct Deposit, (b) no-cost fund transfers from other Cuentas account holders, or (c) for a small charge, using InComm’s VanillaLoad network in over 200,000 locations at major retailers like Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, Dollar General, and more.



Once account holders have available funds, they can use their Cuentas Prepaid Mastercard® wherever prepaid Mastercards are accepted worldwide and at most ATMs in the U.S., and many international ATMs.



Account holders may use the funds in their wallet to purchase discounted gift cards in the Cuentas Digital Store. Product categories in the Digital Store include Digital Gift Cards, Transit Cards, Mobile Phone Recharges (the “TopUps”) and Western Union International Remittances. Digital gift cards include Amazon Cash, Sony Playstation, Xbox, Karma Koin, Burger King, Bass Pro Shops and more. Transit products include or will include OMNY in New York, TAP in Los Angeles, GoCT in Connecticut and The Rapid from Grand Rapids, Michigan. Additional transit products will be available as InComm rolls them out. Cuentas account holders may purchase Mobile Phone Recharges (TopUps) which allow them to recharge their own or someone else’s Verizon, AT&T or other mobile phones in the U.S. or in many foreign countries – in real time. Account holders may make real phone calls using the Cuentas ILD Rewards balance (Loyalty Program) or funds in their wallet - actual phone calls that are made directly from their phone to any mobile phone or land line worldwide.  



The Latino Market 



The name “Cuentas” is a Spanish word that has multiple meanings and was chosen for strategic reasons, to develop a close relationship with the Spanish speaking population. It means “Accounts” as in “bank accounts” and it can also mean “You can count on me” as in “Cuentas conmigo”. Additionally, it can be used to “Pay or settle accounts” (saldar cuentas), “accountability” (rendición de cuentas), “to be accountable” (rendir cuentas) and other significant meanings.



The 2020 U.S. Census showed the Hispanic Latino population at over 62 million and at 18.7% of the total U.S. population. The FDIC defines the “unbanked” “as those adults without an account at a bank or other financial institution and are considered to be outside the mainstream for one reason or another. The Company believes that the Hispanic and Latino demographic generally have had more identification, credit, and former bank account issues more so than any other U.S. minority group leading to more difficulty in obtaining a traditional bank account.



Cuentas Mobile App and Wallet



The Cuentas Mobile App and Wallet are positioned to service the Hispanic, Latino and immigrant demographics with comprehensive financial products. Additionally, we are able to accept various forms of U.S. and some foreign government issued identification to confirm qualification for opening an account with the Cuentas’ app. The Cuentas’ app is able to accept SSN or ITIN with U.S. identification, Matricula Consular or other qualified government issued forms of identification.
The Cuentas Prepaid Mastercard® - General-Purpose Reloadable (GPR) Card



The Cuentas Prepaid GPR Card allows each account holder to have a personalized Cuentas Mastercard® and an associated Cuentas Account with the Mobile App, Digital Wallet, Digital Store and Long Distance Telecom services included. It acts as a comprehensive banking solution which enables access to the U.S. financial system for those who are unbanked or underbanked, while also enabling greater functionality than a traditional bank account. The cardholders’ deposited funds are protected in an FDIC-insured bank account at Sutton Bank.

The Cuentas Business Model



The Cuentas business model provides or, we expect will provide, for multiple revenue sources, many of which are synergistic market segments and provide unified financial and social functionality to forgotten segments of society.



The Cuentas Mobile Wallet has several potential revenue streams. We expect that the Company will receive monthly maintenance fees, reload fees, ATM fees and commissions for products sold as well as interchange and network fees from Mastercard & Pulse. Cuentas’ strategy is to provide excellent value to consumers while charging reasonable fees and commissions to produce profitability. We believe that monthly fees of $4.50 which we will charge per user will generate reasonable revenue. Cuentas provides account recharge capabilities to account holders via the nationwide VanillaLoad network owned by InComm as it is available in many big box retailer chains such as Walmart, Walgreens, CVS, Dollar Store and others.



We expect that The Cuentas Digital Store will produce revenue each time that consumers purchase third party gift cards, digital access, mass transit tickets and mobile phone top-ups (U.S. and international). Additionally, International remittances provided by the industry-leader Western Union “by Cuentas” are available and International Bill Pay should be available in 2022. Both services should be major revenue driving factors for Cuentas as they provide reliable, low-cost solutions to our target audience.



Cuentas expects to offer rewards for free long distance calling to its account holders (“Cuentas Rewards”) who are given credits upon activation to be able to make real international calls to land lines or mobile phone worldwide, not like internet calling which can be unreliable and poor quality. If successful, we can expand the Rewards program in the future. Our target demographic uses both internet and prepaid calling services to communicate with family members around the U.S. and in their country. This added benefit is designed, at a very low cost, to provide extra benefits to our accountholders, which should help to maintain and solidify valuable relationships with them.



Prepaid Debit Card Market Overview



The Research and Markets report titled “Prepaid Card Market: Payment Trends, Market Dynamics, and Forecasts 2020 - 2025” released in January 2020 states that, “[i]n the United States, prepaid cards remain the preferred choice for the unbanked market segment....” It also states that “[t]he move towards a cashless society is substantial, further driving the prepaid card market.”



Cuentas is strategically positioned in the prepaid marketplace with a focus on the Hispanic, Latino and immigrant demographics.



Cuentas has identified Activation Fees as an important issue to our target demographic, so we offer “no-cost” registration and activation with a personalized Prepaid Mastercard® sent directly to the consumer, and we charge a monthly fee of $4.50 15 Days after activation and every 30 days thereafter. As previously mentioned, we also model our offering with empathy and consideration for our target demographic, keeping fees and costs reasonably low so they will be able to justify and appreciate the benefits provided by the Cuentas Mobile App, Wallet & Prepaid Mastercard®.



The Cuentas Technology platform



The Cuentas technology platform is comprised of CIMA Group’s Knetik and Auris software platforms (the “CIMA Licensed Technology”). The platform is built on a powerful integrated component framework delivering a variety of capabilities accessible by a set of industry standard REST-based API endpoints. In addition to handling electronic transactions such as deposits and purchasing, the platform has the capability of organizing virtual currencies into wallets, essentially future proofing it in today’s evolving financial environment. It enables the organizing of the user’s monetary deposits into a tree-based set of wallets, through strictly enforced user permissions, to delineate proper controls in a tiered monetary asset organizational structure, thus providing a sound basis for family and/or corporate control and distribution of funds across individuals.

The platform also contains a sound and proven gamification engine, capable of driving user behaviors in a manner that entices and rewards using incentivization based on proven behavioral science patterns. At the heart of this gamification engine lies a proven and robust rules engine that can easily integrate and modify process flows and orchestrations between disparate platforms, allowing for a quick and easy integration of complex, orchestrated integrations between internal process automation and invocations of external systems. The platform provides Android and iOS software for users to execute a wide variety of transactions including, but not limited to, account balances, account transfers and in-app purchases. User messaging are also integrated and are achieved via SMS, email, in-app messaging, and voice.



The user management application uses rich metadata CRM and single sign-on (“SSO”) to track user behavior and personalize the user experience. It is fully integrated with our Strategic Partners, scalable and manages the digital ecosystem entitlements. The platform can process both physical and virtual goods, digital assets, real time currency value exchange, virtual currency support with current exchange rates and support nontraditional assets, in addition to credit card, POS, debits, and digital wallet management.



The unique rules engine is capable of all aspects of gamification: badging, questing, leveling, points consumption, leader boards, loyalty and reward points and personalization with tracking and messaging to support behavior management. Business intelligence is used for reporting and communication of product management via Rate Deck Management, Pinless ANI Recognition, IV and Call Flows and Access Number Management. The platform has redundant reporting for enhanced billing and fraud control and integrates customer service with Business Intelligence and platform integrity.

Interactive Communications International, Inc. (“InComm”)



Cuentas has multiple agreements with InComm including: (a) Processing services, (b) Resale of 3rd party Digital gift cards, (c) Resale of InComm Digital Solutions, and (d) Reload Commission Agreement. The agreements are effective through July 2024 and then renew automatically for 1 year periods. InComm is an instrumental partner of Cuentas as it provides the operational core of Cuentas’ transaction processing platform, the cash reload component and access to many third party products and services.



On July 23, 2019, the Company entered into a 5 year Prepaid Services Agreement with InComm (the “InComm PSA”) to power and expand the Company’s Mobile App, Mobile Wallet and GPR card. InComm is a supplier of 3rd party gift and digital content cards and Cuentas currently resells a variety of these products through its Mobile App’s Digital Store and Cuentas-SDI distribution network, with possible expansion in the future.



Under the InComm PSA, InComm is the prepaid card processor and through its VanillaLoad network, allows the Company’s cardholders for a small fee, to reload their Cuentas Mobile Wallet through a nationwide network of retailers including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Walgreens, CVS Pharmacy, Rite Aid, Dollar General and many more. In addition, the Company plans to extend the cash reload component of the Wallet through a select number of “bodegas” in the Cuentas-SDI network to increase its market penetration and profitability.

Under the InComm PSA, InComm provides processing services, telephone support, data storage services, account servicing, reporting, output and hot carding services to the Company. Processing services consist mainly of authorization and transaction processing services. InComm also processes authorizations for transactions made with or on prepaid products, along with any payments or adjustments made to prepaid products. InComm also processes the Company’s data and post entries in accordance with the specifications. Data storage services consist mainly of storage of the Company’s data in a format that is accessible online by the Company through APIs designated by InComm, subject to additional API and data sharing terms and conditions. InComm also provides Web/API services for prepaid Cuentas GPR applications and transactions.



The Cuentas Ecosystem



Cuentas’ goal is to offer the consumer a one-stop shop, easy to use, Mobile App & Mobile wallet with Mastercard® rails that can provide new, important financial services and solve many of their daily needs and desires while saving the users time and money.



Approved Cuentas accountholders will have a Prepaid Mastercard® acceptable wherever Mastercard® debit cards are accepted and can have their paychecks or certain government benefits checks directly deposited to their account associated with the card, with funds available for use on the card up to 2 days earlier than standard direct deposits. Furthermore, the Cuentas card has ATM access through the nationwide Pulse Network which provides access to over 500,000 ATMs in the U.S. and many more worldwide. (source: pulsenetwork.com)



The Cuentas Digital Store in the Mobile App will allow accountholders to purchase certain mainstream gift cards for use in a variety of stores, online portals and transit agencies – many at discounted prices. Accountholders can also “Top Up” or prepay their mobile phone accounts and also do the same for friends & family living in the US or overseas.

Cuentas Mobile 



Cuentas Mobile is our Mobile Virtual Network Operator (“MVNO”) trade name, which provided Cuentas Mobile branded mobile phones along with attractively priced prepaid voice, text, and data mobile phone services to a limited customer base. Cuentas, through M&M is negotiating to sell mobile services as an MVNO throug an operator on the largest 5G nationwide network from one of the top 3 mobile carriers. Cuentas Mobile will continue to operate a virtual telecommunications network providing mobile voice, text, and data services with essentially the same quality as other MVNOs such as Cricket, Boost, Simple, Ultra, Mint, and Lyca Mobile which have been successful at creating brands, without owning the towers, hardware or network. Cuentas is currently reactivating distribution through grass roots retailers that normally interact with Cuentas’ target audience, specifically offering low-cost mobile phone service with the ability to make international calls to specific Spanish speaking countries in Central and South America.



We believe that our potential customers will migrate away from legacy telephone and banking systems to enhanced mobility solutions. The Company’s technological advantage and the synergies created by its combination of a reloadable debit card and a holder of mobile virtual network operator rights will make its products increasingly useful to unbanked, under-banked, under-served and other emerging niche markets.



Meimoun & Mammon LLC



Meimoun & Mammon LLC (“M&M”) is a retail provider of domestic and international long-distance voice, text, and data telephony services to consumers in the United States and throughout the world. M&M holds International and Domestic Section 214 authority issued by the FCC. M&M operates the retail Tel3 business as a separate division. Tel3 has been a prepaid long distance provider for many years and provides direct and indirect access to Latino and immigrant communities across the US as it provides them with quality international communications services. The majority of revenue generated by the company so far has come from this division.
Regulatory Compliance



We operate in an ever-evolving and complex legal and regulatory environment. We, the products and services that we offer and market, and those for which we provide processing services, are subject to a variety of federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, including, but not limited to: federal communications laws and regulations; foreign jurisdiction communications laws and regulations; federal anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the Patriot Act, the BSA, anti-terrorist financing laws and anti-bribery and corrupt practice laws and regulations in the U.S., and similar international laws and regulations, including the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act in Canada; state unclaimed property laws and money transmitter or similar licensing requirements; federal and state consumer protection laws, including the CARD Act, and the Dodd-Frank Act, and regulations relating to privacy and data security; and foreign jurisdiction payment services industry regulations.



Our subsidiary M&M is subject to regulation by the FCC and other government agencies and task forces. M&M holds International and Domestic Section 214 licenses issued by the FCC, which may be suspended or revoked by the FCC if M&M does not strictly comply with all applicable regulations and the terms and conditions under which the International and Domestic Section 214 licenses were issued. M&M is also subject to certain foreign jurisdiction communications laws and regulations as it provides limited access to its prepaid calling platform internationally . We believe that we, including our subsidiaries, are currently operating in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, but there is no certainty that laws and regulations affecting our business will not change. Any such change of laws and regulations applicable to our business might adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and achieve profitable operating results.

At the federal level, Congress and federal regulatory agencies have enacted and implemented new laws and regulations that affect the prepaid industry, such the CARD Act and FinCEN’s Prepaid Access Rule. Moreover, there are currently proposals before Congress that could further substantially change the way banks, including prepaid card issuing banks and other financial services companies, are regulated and are permitted to offer their products to consumers. Non-bank financial services companies, including money transmitters and prepaid access providers, are now regulated at the federal level by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), which began operations in July 2011, bringing additional uncertainty to the regulatory system and its impact on our business. We are increasingly facing more stringent anti-money laundering rules and regulations, compliance with which may increase our costs of operation, decrease our operating revenues and disrupt our business. Sutton bank performs routine AML, KYC, OFAC in consultation with Cuentas and IDology and other compliance review and searches throughout Cuentas’ registration and operational processes. Abuse of our prepaid products for purposes of financing sanctioned countries, terrorist funding, bribery or corruption could cause reputational or other harm that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Failure to comply with, or further expansion of, consumer protection regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Failure by us to comply with federal banking regulation may subject us to fines and penalties and our relationships with our issuing banks may be harmed.



Most states regulate the business of sellers of traveler’s checks, money orders, drafts and other monetary instruments, which we refer to collectively as money transmitters. While many states expressly exempt banks and their agents from regulation as money transmitters, others purport to regulate the money transmittal businesses of bank agents or do not extend exemptions to non-branch bank agents. In those states where we are required to be licensed, we are subject to direct supervision and regulation by the relevant state banking departments or similar agencies charged with enforcement of the money transmitter statutes and must comply with various restrictions and requirements, such as those related to the maintenance of certain levels of net worth, surety bonding, selection and oversight of our authorized delegates, permissible investments in an amount equal to our outstanding payment obligations with respect to some of the products subject to licensure, recordkeeping and reporting, and disclosures to consumers. We are also subject to periodic examinations by the relevant licensing authorities, which may include reviews of our compliance practices, policies and procedures, financial position and related records, various agreements that we have with our issuing banks, retail distribution partners and other third parties, privacy and data security policies and procedures, and other matters related to our business. As a regulated entity, Cuentas may incur significant costs associated with regulatory compliance. We anticipate that compliance costs and requirements will increase in the future for our regulated subsidiaries and that additional subsidiaries will need to become subject to these or new regulations. If we fail to maintain our existing money transmitter licenses or permits, or fail to obtain new licenses or permits in a timely manner, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.



Marketing



The Cuentas Mobile App, Mobile Wallet and Prepaid Mastercard® will be predominantly marketed via digital and traditional media channels. Cuentas expects to use a combination of internal resources as well as third parties for our marketing efforts.



The digital marketing placements will include social media, SEO (Search Engine Optimization), internet, geo fencing, online streaming providers, influencers, and other digital providers. Traditional marketing efforts include media such as radio, TV, print, billboards, bus wraps, bus benches, TV, radio, etc.



Media spends is distributed amongst these marketing vehicles and adjusted as acquisition data is received. Our initial program is to test creative, geo targeting and formats. Once feedback is analyzed, spending will be optimized to enhance efficiency and cost of acquisition. Vertical market integration and partnerships will also be developed to augment growth and stability.



Marketing strategies for customer acquisition will focus on key markets, targeted audiences, lifestyle fit, brand awareness, key metrics and go-to-market plans. The proposed acquisition of the SDI companies, if acquired,will expand the current target demographic of unbanked, underbanked and underserved Hispanic and Latino groups to also include the Asian, African, Middle East and European immigrant populations in the U.S .



Marketing to Hispanic & Latino groups will initially focus on those populations that have settled in Southern California, Texas, New York, Florida, Arizona and New Mexico.

Proposed Acquisition



On January 5, 2022, we signed a Binding Letter of Intent (the “Original LOI”) with Mango Tel LLC (“Mango Tel”), SDI Black, and Sohel Kapadia and Saheda Kapadia (collectively the “Owners”), for the potential acquisition of 100% of the assets of Mango Tel LLC and SDI Black 011 for a purchase price of $3.2 million. On February [9], 2022, we signed an amended Binding Letter of Intent amending the Original LOI (collectively, the “LOI”) to reflect that we would only purchase SDI Black (and not purchase Mango Tel which determination was made following our initial due diligence review of Mango Tel) for a purchase price of $2.95 million. The LOI provides that we will deposit $2 million into an escrow account while a definitive purchase and sale agreement is drafted and negotiated. To date, we have not made this deposit into escrow and we do not currently expect to make this deposit (if at all) until the company obtains additional financing. Pursuant to the agreement, we will acquire substantially all of the assets of SDI Black, which also include Black Wireless MVNO, Black 011 Long distance platform and operations and the SDI Black distribution platform and network of over 31,000 bodegas and convenience stores (the “Purchased Assets”). We expect to form a company (“Newco”) into which all of the Purchased Assets shall be transferred following the. As part of the LOI, SDI Black and the Owners have agreed to apply the purchase price paid by us to amounts due to repay U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loans taken by SDI Black and the sellers shall pay an additional $1,000,000 towards repayment of additional SBA loans. We have also agreed to offer employment agreements to certain Fisk/SDI key employees.



SDI Black and the Owners have agreed to indemnify and hold us harmless from and against any liability for any amount owing to SDI Black’s creditors with respect to the Purchased Assets or the business operation of SDI Black being transferred to us pursuant to the LOI, which liability arose prior to the transfer of the Purchased Assets and business operations from SDI Black to us. We have agreed to indemnify and hold SDI Black harmless from and against any liability for any amount owing with respect to the Purchased Assets and business operations of SDI Black transferred by SDI Black to us pursuant to the LOI, which liability arises subsequent to the transfer of the Purchased Assets and business operations from SDI Black to use under the LOI.



We are currently continuing our due diligence review of SDI and have not yet began negotiating the terms of a definitive purchase and sale agreement. Accordingly, we cannot provide any assurance that we will effect a transaction with SDI Black on the terms described above or at all or, if we are able to consummate such a transaction, that the terms of any such transaction will be favorable to our stockholders. See “Risk Factors” for further discussion surrounding the LOI and the transactions contemplated thereby.
