Item 1. Business
Overview
NantHealth, Inc. (“NantHealth” or the “Company”) provides enterprise solutions that help businesses transform complex data into actionable insights. By offering efficient ways to move, interpret, and visualize complex and highly sensitive information, we help our customers in healthcare, life sciences, logistics, telecommunications, and other industries, to automate, understand, and act on data while keeping it secure and scalable.
NantHealth’s product portfolio comprises the latest technology in payer/provider collaboration platforms for real-time coverage decision support (Eviti and NaviNet) and data solutions that include multi-data analysis, reporting and professional services offerings (Quadris). In addition, The OpenNMS Group, Inc. ("OpenNMS"), a NantHealth subsidiary, helps businesses monitor and manage network health and performance. Altogether, we generally derive revenue from software as a service ("SaaS') subscription fees, support services, professional services, and revenue sharing through collaborations with complementary businesses.
We believe we are uniquely positioned to benefit from multiple significant market opportunities as healthcare providers and payers transition from fee-for-service to value-based reimbursement models. They need solutions that increase operational efficiency, manage costs, improve care collaboration and accelerate their pursuit of evidence-based clinical practice. We also believe that our core business lines enable opportunities to create data analytics services and assets which further drive value and efficiency for our customers. We are investing to further integrate big data and automated intelligence technologies within our core business lines and to create new product and service offerings.
On July 22, 2020, NantHealth entered into an assignment agreement with Cambridge Equities, L.P. ("Cambridge") to acquire approximately 91% of OpenNMS. In August 2021, NantHealth purchased the remaining 9% of outstanding OpenNMS common stock that it previously did not purchase on July 22, 2020. The acquisition of OpenNMS, an enterprise-grade open-source network monitoring company, expands and diversifies NantHealth’s software portfolio and service offerings, adding AI technologies, and enhancing cloud and SaaS capabilities. We believe OpenNMS will provide NantHealth customers with a new set of services to maintain reliable network connections for critical data flows that enable patient data collaboration and decision making at the point of care. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional information.
We Are Uniquely Positioned to Address Transformative Shifts across the Healthcare Continuum
The shift to digital transformation. The proliferation of data is well-known across all industries, and this is particularly true in healthcare. Every medical device, network and platform is creating and consuming data at a staggering rate. We believe this presents both a challenge and an opportunity. The abundance of data makes it overwhelming to manage, and an even greater challenge is to extract business value embedded in data. Turning data into something businesses can use to their advantage can be a complex, manual task, and the time, effort and energy required can zero out the benefits. If businesses are unable to extract meaning, then data continues to accumulate, becoming a hindrance to business efficiency and effectiveness. It is precisely because it is challenging to make data actionable, that it becomes an opportunity for businesses to build competitive advantage.
We believe we possess six key capabilities needed to help our customers unlock the value that resides in their data to deliver the right care at the right time and place. NantHealth has the ability to: 1) move data efficiently, 2) interpret it accurately, 3) visualize it intuitively while keeping the data 4) safe, 5) secure and 6) scalable. That is what we do at NantHealth. We provide enterprise solutions that help businesses transform complex data into actionable insights. These capabilities are delivered through a comprehensive suite of products and services unique to NantHealth. In addition to the acquisition of OpenNMS, which added network monitoring to our solutions catalog, we are expanding our data science capabilities and AI competencies to drive further innovation across our existing product lines and to explore new product and service offerings in the data analytics field.
The shift to value-based care and evidence-based medicine. The efficiency and effectiveness of the current healthcare system is often hindered by the complex, dynamic interplay of three uncoordinated and segregated domains: the knowledge domain, the care delivery domain, and the payer domain. The disparate nature of these domains, and their often-inconsistent incentives and conflicting priorities, can inhibit interoperability and coordination. We believe three simultaneous, transformative shifts are highlighting these critical deficiencies of the current healthcare environment:
- 5 -


1.A rapid evolution from traditional fee-for-service to patient-centered and patient-empowered, value-based models driven by quantifiable measures of outcomes relative to cost. Unsustainable escalating healthcare costs, which we believe are due to broken fee-for-service models, are driving many stakeholders and governments toward alternative delivery models. Despite significant investments in electronic health records ("EHRs") and other technologies designed to enable the transition to more value-based care, we believe that, in a fee-for-service model, the economic incentives generally discourage coordination among healthcare stakeholders and encourage volume-driven (rather than outcomes-driven) decision-making. This model results in healthcare and financial data that remains largely segregated into “walled gardens.” Thus, patient data often remains static and cannot be easily shared or interpreted due to siloed legacy proprietary platforms that lack interoperability.
2.The rise of evidence-based care to ensure patients receive the most effective care at the most appropriate cost. As drug prices soar and the overall expense of cancer and autoimmune care increases, unnecessary or inappropriate therapy has never been more costly. We believe leveraging the ever-evolving body of evidence-based standards of care can drive better and more efficient outcomes for members. Evidence-based care eliminates unwarranted variability by applying nationally accepted treatment standards at the moment of clinical prescribing, ensuring that compliance takes place at the front-end of care as opposed to the back-end review after treatment has begun. Evidence-based treatment that offers the best-expected outcome at a better cost than a competing therapy also supports the transformative shift to value-based care that benefits all parties.
3.Growing focus on health equity and the personalized care path members and patients need. Recent events, including the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on communities of color, have raised awareness of the healthcare industry’s need to move towards a care delivery system that views members holistically. For example, we understand a cancer patient’s journey may be impacted by factors outside of the care system, like socioeconomic status – the neighborhoods and environments in which they work and live, and barriers such as internet, transportation, and healthy food availability. Access to information and social trust of patients differ, and those differences are too often put aside in the current standard of care thinking.
We believe these shifts, and the associated challenges, require advanced technology systems and data expertise that our customers cannot quickly and easily develop on their own. Our unique portfolio of technology solutions allows us to collect, interpret and deliver data insights that help our customers improve their businesses, provide decision support with a comprehensive knowledge base of evidence-based treatment options, and help both payers and providers effectively transition to value-based care. Given the magnitude of these shifts and the difficulty involved in addressing the associated challenges, we believe our solution platforms serve to position NantHealth at the forefront of multiple market opportunities. We have invested significant capital, software development, data and healthcare expertise over a decade to develop, acquire and integrate the components that we believe address many of the challenges faced by stakeholders across the continuum of care.
Our Strategy
Our goal is to become the leading provider of solutions that enable enterprises to leverage actionable data insights. In the healthcare space, we seek to facilitate payer and provider collaboration, and to leverage clinical data and knowledge towards delivering improved patient outcomes and more effective treatment decisions for critical illnesses. To accomplish this goal, we plan to deploy NantHealth solutions designed to address and accelerate the transformational shifts occurring in healthcare (empowering the extraction of value from the growing abundance of data and supporting the evolution from traditional fee-for-service to value-based models), while also expanding our network monitoring solution capabilities to support the underlying infrastructure necessary to enable transformational shifts in healthcare and other industries. The key elements of our strategy include:
•Leveraging NantHealth's key capabilities delivered through a comprehensive suite of solutions to unlock value from data. NantHealth’s solution capabilities include:

•Increasing sales of NantHealth solutions to healthcare payers, providers, and self-insured employers. We are marketing NantHealth solutions to healthcare payers and providers transitioning from fee-for-service reimbursement models to value-based care models in pursuit of improved patient outcomes and lower costs. We believe we are positioning NantHealth as a next-generation payer intermediary and partner with healthcare payers and self-insured employers as they roll out value-based model partnerships and transition to value-based precision care.
•Growing the market for open source-based network monitoring services across industries and across sites of care within the health care sector. We are working to grow the on-premise install base for the OpenNMS network monitoring platform and expand sales of OpenNMS maintenance, support and professional service offerings. We are also expanding the OpenNMS service suite to include SaaS based monitoring services and easier to manage “no-touch” remote appliance services (including home-based devices).
•Developing new features and functionality for NantHealth solutions. We are continuing to make significant R&D investments to create new features and functionality within NantHealth’s solutions. For example, we are exploring the expansion of our Eviti decision support product line to cover additional diseases and chronic conditions and are furthering the integration of artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML)-based analytics into our network monitoring solutions to provide insights into alarm/event correlation, anomaly detection, and root cause analysis (RCA). We are also continuing the development of data analytics capabilities and assets so that we can expand the products and services offered to our healthcare customers and partners.
•Complementing internal growth with strategic acquisitions. We believe opportunities exist for us to enhance our competitive position by acquiring additional companies with complementary products and technologies and/or acquiring rights to proprietary products or technologies from third parties.
Our Industry
Today, the explosion in the quantity, frequency and complexity of data and the ability to measure data in terms of outcomes relative to cost, demands mature, specialized software platforms, and expertise to address transformative shifts and challenges.
Every device, network and platform is creating and consuming data at a staggering rate, making it overwhelming to manage, and extract business value embedded in the data.
Nearly 100% of C-level executives surveyed by PricewaterhouseCoopers said they see data on customers as “critical or important” to getting an edge on competitors in the years ahead. Businesses must learn how to uncover actionable insights hidden in their data, or risk being left behind. But turning bits and bytes of data into something businesses can use to their advantage can be a complex, manual task that involves the ability to:
•Connect systems
•Normalize data
•Interpret outputs
•Make it actionable
Developing the capabilities needed for businesses to undertake the challenge of managing, analyzing, and interpreting data is difficult. Those able to tap the insights hidden within their data and make it actionable for their employees, stakeholders and customers will unearth a new source of value and differentiation.
In the U.S. healthcare industry, a rapid evolution from traditional fee-for-service to patient-centered and patient-empowered, value-based models driven by quantifiable measures of outcomes relative to cost.
In response to the rising cost of healthcare, government and private payers and providers are introducing value-based care models. In value-based models, providers assume increased levels of clinical and financial responsibility for patient outcomes, instead of being reimbursed strictly based on the quantity of services provided. We believe that healthcare platforms that efficiently assist healthcare stakeholders to transition to these value-based models will be best positioned to capture this opportunity.

Challenges associated with the adoption of value-based models
The healthcare continuum can be viewed as an aggregation of three distinct domains:
•The knowledge domain, including academic centers, scientific institutions and companies that discover and commercialize medical and scientific knowledge;
•The care delivery domain, including hospitals, community practices, physicians and other constituents that deliver healthcare to patients; and
•The payer domain, including insurers, governments and self-insured employers that administer and provide funding to the healthcare system.
The disparate and fragmented nature of these domains and economic incentives under traditional fee-for-service models frequently result in overtreatment, high costs and suboptimal patient outcomes. Fee-for-service models are as a general matter inherently site-centric, volume driven, reactive in nature and uncoordinated. In contrast, value-based models are generally more patient-centric, outcomes-focused, proactive and coordinated across the care continuum.
Despite a clear need, the design and implementation of next-generation interoperable systems has been limited due to reliance on legacy, site-specific, fee-for-service technology systems and infrastructure. Since the passage of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (“HITECH”) Act in 2009, providers and payers have made significant investments in EHRs, and other technologies meant to enable the transition to value-based care. Despite extensive investment and coordination, the introduction of value-based models has been limited due to the shortcomings of legacy, proprietary systems and the reliance on unstructured data that hinders interoperability and cannot be sufficiently shared or manipulated to produce actionable findings. Value-based models require collection and analysis of longitudinal treatment, outcomes and financial data at the patient level, regardless of treatment site. Critically, these systems must also securely safeguard patient data in compliance with stringent Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) and other privacy regulations. We believe that there is a significant need for interoperability platforms that dynamically access, normalize, integrate and update information from disparate sources across the healthcare continuum in real time. Secure interoperability platforms can allow for more comprehensive solutions development that proactively connect, deliver business and clinical intelligence and enable enhanced provider and patient engagement.
Managing massive volumes of data requires specialized infrastructure, and making data meaningful and actionable requires it to be processed by advanced systems operating in scalable and reliable environments.
The network monitoring market is moving away from corporate managed, on-premise solutions towards hybrid and cloud solutions with a focus on platform services expansion and AI/ML-based analytics to provide intelligent alarm/event management.
Key trends include:
•Expansion of the network edge to include internet of things components and the migration of the network core to the cloud requires that network performance monitoring and diagnostics tools provide visibility in hybrid environments, including edge and cloud network monitoring.
•Implementation of cloud native applications and microservices for platform management and orchestration to optimize performance and cost in the cloud.
•Increasing appetite for flexible deployment models include SaaS and on-demand pricing, and use of virtual machines, software appliances, and hardware appliances to enable these deployments.
•Evolution of traditional network monitoring platforms beyond the basic levels of infrastructure monitoring, and incorporating APIs for easy extension of additional services such as Digital Experience Monitoring, flows/flowlogs, and other applications that support business users and understanding of end-user experience.
•Increasing focus on AI/ML advanced analytics to support artificial intelligence for IT operations ("AIOps") (e.g., for anomaly detection and event correlation and RCA).
•Focus on network security and alignment between network operations and security operations.
With our highly scalable, reliable, and extensible platform solution for network monitoring, OpenNMS is well positioned to address these market trends. Our zero touch appliance solution enables remote monitoring of edge components and enables additional hybrid and cloud integrations. Our traffic analysis (flows) and route monitoring solutions provide deep understanding of network performance. Our Architecture for Learning Enabled Correlation (ALEC) AI/ML solution provides valuable insights and visualizations for interpreting complex faults/alerts.

Our Market Opportunity
We believe the increasing focus on managing, analyzing and interpreting the large amounts of generated data, and on value-based reimbursement models and evidence-based, personalized medicine will drive validation and adoption of NantHealth solutions. 
Proliferation of Data: Over 44T gigabytes of data have been amassed by companies as of 2020, with a projected 581% increase in new data by 2025. Given the challenges and specialized capabilities required to manage, analyze, and derive insights from the vast amounts of data, we believe we are uniquely positioned to address this market need.

Cost of Cancer Care: Recent statistics show that 39.5% of Americans will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lives, resulting in an estimated cost of $246 billion by 2030. As the cost of cancer care continues to grow, there will be an ongoing need to balance cost efficiency with improved outcomes. Our evidence-based decision support solutions can help providers and payers better manage oncology care for the patients and members they serve. 
Transition to Digital: Reports show that medical communications are still reliant on faxes, phone calls, emails and other manual channels. Recent research suggests that around 70% of health-care organizations still use faxes. Our payer/provider collaboration platforms can significantly improve the efficient, accurate and timely exchange of information.
Management of Complex Networks: Today's enterprise requires insights and analytics regarding network performance and availability in order to maintain uptime across multiple environments, geographies and devices.
Focus on Security: Government buyers continue to have a very strong interest in products incorporating zero trust network access due to the executive order on improving the nation’s cybersecurity. In the private sector, interest in zero trust grew more than 230% in 2020. To meet this need, OpenNMS is adopting zero trust architecture principles for its suite of products.
Open Platform: Due to the rapid pace of innovation and the changing nature of enterprise networks due to the pandemic, buyers are looking to leverage technologies and technology platforms that are open and extensible. This allows them to plan and respond to the increasing number of changes and additional complexities of their environments.

Product Overviews
Eviti Connect and Eviti Advisor
The rapid advancement of molecular and biometric medicine is overwhelming many physicians’ cognitive ability, while uncoordinated, non-evidence-based treatment plans are increasing costs and reducing the quality of care.
Eviti, our decision support platform, provides evidence-based clinical decision support, which is a critical element to ensure optimal treatment regimens. Eviti is a SaaS-based clinical decision support solution that centralizes clinical content, treatment cost data from Medicare reimbursements and treatment toxicity data. The clinical content is curated by our dedicated team of clinicians, including oncologists and nurses, who convert published literature and clinical trials into structured information that can be used for decision support. The Eviti Connect product is sold to health plans and utilizes the platform to offer pre-authorization automation that helps payers and providers navigate the complexities of cancer care, making it easier to identify and validate oncology treatment regimens suited to each patient. The Eviti Advisor product is offered to providers and allows physicians to access the Eviti platform’s comprehensive library of evidence-based treatment standards and protocols to better inform treatment decisions and readily stay abreast of the latest advances in cancer care.
Eviti provides value to our customers through its access to over 8,900 federally-registered clinical trials updated weekly and over 4,500 evidence-based treatment regimens for the treatment of cancer arising from over 40 different anatomical locations. Over the past ten years, Eviti has saved health plan customers several hundred million dollars by directing providers to evidence-based protocols at the point of prescribing. Unique to the care delivery domain, physicians also benefit from improved claim processing by using the Eviti Connect product, which issues a pre-authorization “Eviti code” when the physician chooses an approved evidence-based clinical pathway, thereby validating appropriate treatment and pre-adjudicating the claim. This is an important step in that payers and providers are collaborating on high-value, evidence-based clinical pathways as opposed to non-value-added reimbursements and denials of payments. Eviti Connect is typically sold to health plans on a per member (or life) per month basis. These health plans sponsor the solution and provide Eviti free of charge to oncologists and their staffs.
As Eviti evolves, we expect to expand the platform’s capacity beyond regimen decisions to help providers and payors deliver the right care, in the right time and in the right place across the cancer patient's entire life cycle of care. In addition, we have already expanded the Eviti platform to another disease state, autoimmune. As one pharmacy benefit manager ("PBM") studied data on its 15 million commercially insured members in 2019 and 2020, it found that fewer than 1% of members had an inflammatory autoimmune condition such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. However, drugs treating these conditions accounted for nearly 20% of drug spend in the medical and pharmacy benefit. (source: Drugs for autoimmune disorders account for a growing part of pharmacy spend: Prime Therapeutics | FierceHealthcare).

NantHealth has achieved delegated entity licensure/certification for utilization management in 10 states, enabling the expansion of Eviti Connect to include fully delegated services in these jurisdictions and others that do not require special licensure. Offering this service helps our payer customers reduce operational costs and increase efficiency by centralizing activities related to utilization management reviews and communications. We will continue to pursue delegated entity status in additional states as we expand the value Eviti brings to our customers.
The snapshot of our system below illustrates how different cancer treatment options for a patient is presented to compare treatments across a variety of metrics, including expected treatment outcome, plan compliance and costs. By providing the oncologist with this comparison, we believe Eviti drives compliance and a greater number of treatments to be in accordance with evidence-based medicine.

Our Relationship with Allscripts
On August 3, 2017, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc. ("Allscripts"), pursuant to which we agreed to sell to Allscripts substantially all of the assets of the Company’s provider/patient engagement solutions business, including our FusionFX solution and components of its NantOS software connectivity solutions. The sale was completed on August 25, 2017. 
Concurrent with the sale to Allscripts and as contemplated by the asset purchase agreement, we and Allscripts modified the amended and restated mutual license and reseller agreement dated June 26, 2015, which was further amended on December 30, 2017, such that, among other things, we committed to deliver a minimum of $95.0 million of total bookings over a ten-year period (“Bookings Commitment”) from referral transactions and sales of certain Allscripts products under this agreement. We also agreed that Allscripts shall receive at least $0.5 million per year in payments from bookings (the “Annual Minimum Commitment”). If the total payments received by Allscripts from bookings during such period are less than the Annual Minimum Commitment, we shall pay to Allscripts the difference between the Annual Minimum Commitment and the total amount received by Allscripts from bookings during such period. In the event of a Bookings Commitment shortfall at the end of the ten-year period, we may be obligated to pay 70% of the shortfall, subject to certain credits. We will earn 30% commission from Allscripts on each software referral transaction that results in a booking with Allscripts. We account for the Bookings Commitment at its estimated fair value over the life of the agreement and, as of December 31, 2021, we estimate the total liability to be $35.7 million.

NantHealth solutions and technology platforms are used by key healthcare stakeholders, including healthcare providers, payers, self-insured employers, academic institutions and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and our network monitoring solutions are used by stakeholders in the logistics, telecommunication, and other industries, to automate, understand, and act on data while keeping it secure and scalable. NantHealth solutions, coupled with our engagement methodology, is designed to be tailored to meet the large-scale needs of governmental organizations and private entities while remaining convenient, intuitive and configurable at the user level. We believe that this provides us with a significant advantage over a siloed, single vendor approach, which often requires the removal or replacement of existing information technology infrastructure and applications.
Our total revenue was $62.6 million and $73.2 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were two and four customers, respectively, each accounting for more than 10% of our revenue.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales organization is primarily comprised of direct sales executives and pre-sales support teams organized by account type and domain and subject matter expertise. We also leverage strategic reseller arrangements and a channel relationship coverage team.
•Direct sales organization: We leverage domain and subject matter expertise, market credibility, thought leadership, and relationships of our executives, senior management, and product leaders in our sales efforts. Our direct sales organization is by product ownership. These direct coverage teams include both sales professionals searching for new accounts and customer engagement sales professionals responsible for developing existing accounts. Furthermore, sales professionals have unique expertise and specialized coverage for health plans, self-insured employers, health systems, and individual providers. Our account management organization is responsible for the continuity of current customer relationships and the expansion of those relationships to include additional solutions and services.
We have a pre-sales organization that includes clinical, business and technical customer alignment teams to support our sales organization in addition to executive sponsorship with members of our senior management team.

•Resale and channel partnership: In the United States, we have entered into strategic resale arrangements with major partners, including EHR vendors (including Allscripts), in-hospital medical devices manufacturers and health plans who resell our solutions to their customer base. Internationally, we have entered into resale arrangements with other strategic distributors to accelerate our market adoption. Reseller revenue in 2021 and 2020 was $1.0 million and $2.9 million, respectively. OpenNMS’ partnerships extend globally. These are a mixture of Value-added resellers (VARs) and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). These strategic relationships allow OpenNMS capabilities to be integrated with other propositions as we look to grow market share.
We also maintain business relationships with individuals and organizations that promote or support our sales or services. We refer to these individuals and organizations as our channel partners. These channel partners generally do not make sales directly like our resale partners, but instead provide us with leads that we use to develop new business through our direct sales force. These relationships enable access to broader hospital and physician customers, leading software solutions and multiple cross-selling opportunities.
We complement our sales efforts with a marketing organization that plans and execute marketing and communication strategies that are centered on initiatives that drive awareness of our company and solutions. These initiatives include educating the market about our company broadly, as well as solutions-specific campaigns for lead generation. Marketing efforts also include participation in speaking engagements and strategic interfacing with key business and trade media personnel. We employ a broad array of specific events to facilitate these initiatives, including, but not limited to, sponsorship and partnership of key industry conferences such as the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society ("HIMSS") and/or America's Health Insurance Plan ("AHIP") events and customer-focused programs such as key partner user groups.
Our sales cycle can vary significantly and typically ranges from 6 months to 18 months from initial contact to contract execution. The sales cycle significantly differs based on the domain, type of solution and size of the customer. Implementation, training and professional services are normally rendered based on a mutually agreed upon timetable.

We believe we will compete favorably despite competing against a broad, diverse set of businesses and with increasing competition as other established and emerging companies enter our industry, customer requirements evolve, and new products and technologies are introduced. Moreover, some of our actual and potential competitors have certain advantages over us, such as greater financial, technical, marketing, research and development and other resources, stronger brand and business user recognition, larger installed customer bases, larger intellectual property portfolios and broader global distribution and presence.
Research and Development
Our research and development efforts consist primarily of new product research and development, significant product improvements, the development of our knowledge base, the development of our online tools, such as our online portal and mobile applications, and the improvement and augmentation of our data and analytics infrastructure.
Our ability to compete and attract new customers depends, in large part, on our continuous commitment to rapidly introduce new applications, technologies, features, and functionality. Our research and development team is responsible for the design and development of our applications and software tools. We follow state-of-the-art practices in software development using modern programming languages, data storage systems, and other tools.
Research and development expenses were $19.7 million and $17.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
We expect that our overall research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to innovate our informational technology capabilities, develop additional products, and expand our data management resources.
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including through a combination of patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, whether developed internally or acquired from third parties. Further, our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology, inventions, and improvements; to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; to defend and enforce our proprietary rights, and to operate without infringing on the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.
We have processes for protecting our intellectual property rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing patent and trademark applications and requiring our employees, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements. We control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology, continuing innovation, and acquisition and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the field of and healthcare technology products and services.
We have developed and acquired patents and patent applications and we possess substantial know-how, copyrights and trade secrets relating to the development and commercialization of healthcare technology products and services. In January 2016, we acquired NaviNet, a leading payer-provider collaboration platform, and in February 2018 we acquired NantHealth Labs, Inc. (formerly Liquid Genomics, Inc.) a liquid tumor profiling company. As part of these and other acquisitions, we acquired patents and other intellectual property. As of December 31, 2021, our patent portfolio consisted of the following matters relating to our proprietary technology and inventions: (i) twenty (20) issued U.S. utility patents and two (2) issued U.S. design patents; (ii) eighteen (18) pending U.S. utility patent applications; (iii) eighteen (18) issued patents outside the United States; and (iv) three (3) patent applications pending in jurisdictions outside the United States. Five (5) of these assets are jointly owned. However, our patent applications may not result in issued patents, and, even if issued, the patents may be challenged and invalidated. Moreover, our patents and patent applications may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or developing competing products. 
We estimate that our issued U.S. patents will expire on dates ranging from 2022 to 2036. If patents are issued on our pending U.S. patent applications, the resulting patents are projected to expire on dates ranging from 2026 to 2040. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
- 16 -


We may also rely on trade secrets and copyrights to protect our technology. However, trade secrets and copyrights are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our technology and product candidates, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with those who have access to our confidential information and proprietary rights agreements with those who develop our technology, including our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators, and advisors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Although we have confidence in these individuals, organizations, and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or may be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators, and advisors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop applications with the same functionality as our applications. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult, and protection of our rights through civil enforcement mechanisms may be expensive and time consuming.
Companies in our industry often own a number of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, and enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property or other rights. We may face allegations in the future that we have infringed the patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights of others. We expect that we and others in our industry will continue to be subject to third-party infringement claims as the functionality of applications in different industry segments overlaps. A third party might make a claim of infringement against us at any time. 
For this and more comprehensive risks related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and products, please see the section captioned “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
Human Capital and Culture
Our key human capital management objectives are focused on attracting, retaining, and developing the highest quality talent. To support these objectives, our human resources programs are designed to develop talent to prepare them for critical roles and leadership positions for the future; reward and support employees through competitive pay, benefit, and recognition programs; enhance our culture through efforts aimed at making the workplace more engaging and inclusive; acquire talent and facilitate internal talent mobility to create a high-performing, diverse workforce; engage employees as brand ambassadors of our products and services; and evolve and invest in technology, tools, and resources to enable employees at work.
We view our employees and company culture as integral to the successful execution of our vision and mission. As a result, our leadership team prioritizes establishing trusting relationships with our customers, our partners, and each other. We encourage our employees to “rise up” to the challenge and believe that this collective mindset has enabled us to attract and retain some of the best minds in technology, bioscience and healthcare to build and advance our offering. Our core values, which we seek to reflect in our work are:
•Clarity: conveying our mission clearly, coherently and intelligibly, and empowering our stakeholders with information required to make good decisions.
•Empathy: understanding and sharing the feelings of others by putting yourself in another’s place.
•Collaboration: working with others to create solutions.
•Pioneering: exploring and developing original solutions that make a meaningful impact on our community, the market, or society at large.
•Community: creating a feeling of identity and fellowship with others resulting from common values and goals.
•Integrity: always being honest, honorable and accountable with adherence to moral and ethical principles.
As of December 31, 2021, we employed a total of 340 employees in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Our global workforce is comprised of approximately 96% full-time and 4% part-time employees. Employee engagement and retention are core tenets of our leadership focus and are monitored and measured as gauges of our corporate performance and organizational health.
None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.

Government Regulation
The healthcare industry and the practice of medicine are governed by an extensive and complex framework of federal and state laws, which continue to evolve and change over time. The costs and resources necessary to comply with these laws are high. Our profitability depends in part upon our ability, and that of our affiliated providers and independent contractors, to operate in compliance with applicable laws and to maintain all applicable licenses. A review of our operations by courts or regulatory authorities could result in determinations that could adversely affect our operations, or the healthcare laws and regulations could change in a way that restricts our operations. To the extent any of our employees or third-party contractors engages in any misconduct or activity in violation of an applicable law, we may be subject to increased liability under the law or increased government scrutiny. If any such action is instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, such action could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions. Complying with any new legislation and regulations could be time-intensive and expensive, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business. 
As a digital health company, our operations are subject to comprehensive United States federal, state and local and international regulation in the jurisdictions in which we do business. Our ability to operate profitably will depend in part upon our ability, and that of our affiliated providers, to maintain all necessary licenses, permits, certifications, or other regulatory authorizations and to operate in compliance with applicable laws and rules. Those laws and rules continue to evolve, and we therefore devote significant resources to monitoring developments in healthcare and medical practice regulation. As the applicable laws and rules change, we are likely to make conforming modifications in our business processes from time to time. In some jurisdictions where we operate, neither our current nor our anticipated business model has been the subject of formal judicial or administrative interpretation. There has been heightened governmental scrutiny over healthcare costs and healthcare fraud and abuse in the digital health, telehealth and telemedicine space, including recent notable enforcement actions involving electronic healthcare records service providers. We cannot be assured that a review of our business by courts or regulatory authorities will not result in determinations that could adversely affect our operations or that the healthcare regulatory environment will not change in a way that impacts our operations.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, state and federal regulatory authorities have temporarily loosened or waived certain regulatory requirements in order to increase the availability of telehealth services for the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency. For example, many state governors issued executive orders permitting physicians and other health care professionals to practice in their state without any additional licensure or by using a temporary, expedited or abbreviated licensure or registration process so long as they hold a valid license in another state. In addition, changes were made to the Medicare and Medicaid programs (through waivers and other regulatory authority) to increase access to telehealth services by, among other things, increasing reimbursement, permitting the enrollment of out of state providers and eliminating prior authorization requirements. It is uncertain how long these COVID-19 related regulatory changes will remain in effect and whether they will continue beyond this public health emergency period. A return to the status quo could have a materially negative impact on any commercial agreements we have entered into during 2021 or any time before the termination of the COVID-19 public health emergency. For example, we may be required to change our operations or terminate certain services when the government reinstates certain healthcare regulatory requirements or restrictions that were in place before the COVID-19 public health emergency, including certain restrictions on the reimbursement of telehealth visits to Medicare beneficiaries and state licensure requirements for healthcare professionals who practice medicine across state lines.
The products and services that we provide are regulated by federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. Failure to comply with the applicable laws and regulations can subject us to significant administrative or enforcement actions by the government, government investigation, repayment of amounts previously paid to us, significant civil and criminal penalties, loss of licensure, certification, or accreditation, exclusion from government healthcare programs, corporate integrity agreements, or litigation. The significant areas of regulation are summarized below.
HIPAA and HITECH
Under the administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, the HHS issued regulations that establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the privacy and security of protected health information used or disclosed by healthcare providers and other covered entities. Three principal regulations with which we are required to comply have been issued in final form under HIPAA: privacy regulations, security regulations, and standards for electronic transactions, which establish standards for common healthcare transactions. The privacy and security regulations were extensively amended in 2013 to incorporate requirements from the HITECH Act.
- 18 -


The privacy regulations cover the use and disclosure of protected health information by healthcare providers and other covered entities. They also set forth certain rights that an individual has with respect to his or her protected health information maintained by a covered entity, including the right to access or amend certain records containing protected health information, or to request restrictions on the use or disclosure of protected health information. The security regulations establish requirements for safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of protected health information that is electronically transmitted or electronically stored. The HITECH Act, among other things, makes certain of HIPAA’s privacy and security standards applicable to business associates of covered entities, and established certain protected health information security breach notification requirements. A covered entity must notify affected individual(s) and the HHS when there is a breach of unsecured protected health information. The HIPAA privacy and security regulations establish a uniform federal “floor” that covered entities and their business associates must meet and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent or provide individuals with greater rights with respect to the privacy or security of, and access to, their records containing protected health information. These laws contain significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of protected health information. 
In addition to the federal privacy regulations, there are several state laws regarding the privacy and security of health information and personal data that are applicable to our operations. The compliance requirements of these laws, including additional breach reporting requirements, and the penalties for violation vary widely and new privacy and security laws in this area are evolving. Massachusetts, for example, has a state law that protects the privacy and security of personal information of Massachusetts residents that is more prescriptive than HIPAA. Requirements of these laws and penalties for violations vary widely. We believe that we have taken the steps required of us to comply with health information privacy and security statutes and regulations in all jurisdictions, both state and federal. However, we may not be able to maintain compliance in all jurisdictions where we do business. Failure to maintain compliance, or changes in state or federal laws regarding privacy or security, could result in civil and/or criminal penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Federal, State and Foreign Fraud and Abuse Laws
In the United States, there are various fraud and abuse laws with which we must comply and we are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities, including CMS, other divisions of the HHS (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. We also may be subject to foreign fraud and abuse laws.
In the United States, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for patient referrals for, or purchasing, leasing, ordering, recommending or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of, any healthcare item or service reimbursable under a governmental payer program. Courts have stated that a financial arrangement may violate the Anti-Kickback Statute if any one purpose of the arrangement is to encourage patient referrals or other federal healthcare program business, regardless of whether there are other legitimate purposes for the arrangement. The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including gifts, discounts, credit arrangements, payments of cash, consulting fees, waivers of co-payments, ownership interests, and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Recognizing that the Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the healthcare industry, the HHS issued a series of regulatory “safe harbors.” These safe harbor regulations set forth certain provisions, which, if met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Although full compliance with these safe harbor provisions ensures against prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a specific safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement is illegal or that prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute will be pursued. That said, non-compliance with all the requirements of a safe harbor can increase the risk of the transaction or arrangement and may increase the risk of government scrutiny. Many states also have anti-kickback statutes, some of which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers.
In addition, federal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus generally non-reimbursable, uses. The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
- 19 -


HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
In addition, various states have enacted false claim laws analogous to the federal False Claims Act, although many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payer and not merely a governmental payer program. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. The costs of defending such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could significantly affect our financial performance.
Additionally, entities that perform prior authorization and utilization management functions as a delegated entity are subject to additional federal and state requirements, directly and indirectly, including, but not limited to, credentialing, accreditation or licensing requirements and standards (such as requirements of the National Committee for Quality Assurance), state prior authorization laws, Medicare and Medicaid regulations, manuals and policies, and other federal and state laws and standards related to delegation, prior authorization, and utilization management. Health plans and other healthcare organizations that contract with delegated entities typically flow down extensive federal and state requirements to delegated entities, which can increase the cost of operations and exposure to potential liabilities for such delegated entities. Delegated entities are also subject to audits and oversight by healthcare plans as well as federal and state regulatory authorities. To the extent federal and state government programs or regulatory authorities change current laws, regulations or policies, or the prior authorization process and related requirements, such changes could impact our business operations. Complying with new regulatory requirements or changes to current regulations could be time-intensive and expensive, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business. 
If we or any third parties we may engage are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we or such third parties are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose regulatory licensure or authorization for our products and services, be exposed to contractual liabilities, and we may not achieve or sustain profitability. Efforts to ensure compliance with applicable healthcare laws and regulations can involve substantial costs. Violations of healthcare laws can result in significant penalties, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other U.S. healthcare programs, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of operations.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any United States individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, if any, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
In Europe, various countries have adopted anti-bribery laws providing for severe consequences, in the form of criminal penalties and/or significant fines, for individuals and/or companies committing a bribery offence. Violations of these anti-bribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation. For instance, in the United Kingdom, under the Bribery Act 2010, which went into effect in July 2011, a bribery occurs when a person offers, gives or promises to give a financial or other advantage to induce or reward another individual to improperly perform certain functions or activities, including any function of a public nature. Bribery of foreign public officials also falls within the scope of the Bribery Act 2010. Under the new regime, an individual found in violation of the Bribery Act 2010 faces imprisonment of up to 10 years. In addition, the individual can be subject to an unlimited fine, as can commercial organizations for failure to prevent bribery.

Corporate Practice of Medicine
Numerous states have enacted laws prohibiting business corporations, such as us, from practicing medicine and employing or engaging physicians to practice medicine, generally referred to as the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine. Many states also have fee splitting laws that prohibit splitting or sharing medical professional fees with other persons or entities who did not perform the medical services unless an exception applies. These laws are designed to prevent interference in the medical decision-making process by anyone who is not a licensed physician. Violation of these corporate practice of medicine laws may result in civil or criminal fines, as well as sanctions imposed against us and/or the physician through licensure proceedings. Typically, such laws are only applicable to entities that conduct business or interact with patients located in that state. Additionally, claims that violate the corporate practice of medicine or other FDA or healthcare laws may increase our liability under the federal False Claims Act and comparable state false claims laws.
Healthcare Reform
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted several legislative and regulatory proposals designed to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our business. In the United States, there is significant interest in promoting changes in the health care system with the stated goal of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. For example, the Affordable Care Act ("ACA") contains certain measures that may be significant for our business. The ACA includes, among other things, provisions regarding initiatives to revise Medicare payment methodologies; the coordination and promotion of research on comparative clinical effectiveness of different technologies and procedures; and initiatives to promote quality indicators in payment methodologies. 
There have been other health reform measures taken since the enactment of the ACA. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. Beginning April 1, 2013, Medicare payments to providers were reduced by 2% under the sequestration required by the Budget Control Act of 2011, which will remain in effect through 2031, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. Furthermore, on January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, increased the statute of limitations for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three years to five years. 
Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. In June 2021, the United States Supreme Court held that Texas and other challengers had no legal standing to challenge the ACA, dismissing the case without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Accordingly, the ACA remains in effect in its current form. It is unclear how this Supreme Court decision, future litigation, or healthcare measures promulgated by the Biden administration will impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Complying with any new legislation or changes in healthcare regulation could be time-intensive and expensive, resulting in material adverse effect on our business.
In the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs.The healthcare industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. We face uncertainties that might result from legislative, executive, and administrative actions and future healthcare measures and agency rules implemented by at the federal and state levels. Any changes to the ACA or implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms are likely to have an impact on our results of operations and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, or may prevent us from being able to generate revenue or attain profitability. We cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the United States may have on our business.
Changes in healthcare policy could increase our costs and subject us to additional regulatory requirements that may interrupt commercialization of our current and future solutions. Changes in healthcare policy could increase our costs, decrease our revenues and impact sales of and reimbursement for our current and future solutions. The Affordable Care Act substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impact our industry. The Act contains a number of provisions that impact our business and operations, some of which in ways we cannot currently predict, including those governing enrollments in federal healthcare programs and reimbursement changes.
Other Regulatory Requirements
To the extent we develop any products that implicate environmental, hazardous substances or emissions or other occupational safety laws, we may be subject to federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and policies governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, emission, effluent discharge, handling and disposal of certain hazardous and potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our operations.

Backlog
We have no material backlog of orders.
Geographic and Segment Information
During 2021, substantially all of our long-lived assets were located within the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. 
Revenues from international markets were approximately 1% and 1% of our consolidated revenue for 2021 and 2020, respectively.
We operate in one segment. The Company has one business activity and does not segregate its business for internal reporting. Accordingly, management has determined that the Company operates in one reportable segment.
Seasonality
Our revenues are not seasonal in nature.
Corporate Information
We were founded in 2010 as a Delaware limited liability company under the name “About Advanced Health, LLC.” In 2011, our affiliates NantWorks, LLC, or NantWorks, and California Capital Equity, LLC, or Cal Cap, purchased certain assets from Abraxis Bioscience, LLC, which were subsequently contributed to us. We subsequently changed our name to “All About Advanced Health, LLC,” and then to “Nant Health, LLC.” On June 1, 2016, in connection with our initial public offering, we converted from a limited liability company into a Delaware corporation and changed our name from Nant Health, LLC to NantHealth, Inc., which we refer to as the “LLC Conversion.” In conjunction with the LLC Conversion, (a) all of our outstanding units were automatically converted into shares of our common stock, based on the relative rights of our pre-IPO equity holders as set forth in the Nant Health, LLC limited liability company agreement, or the LLC Agreement, and (b) we adopted and filed a certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and adopted bylaws. Our principal executive offices are located at 3000 RDU Center, Suite 200, Morrisville, North Carolina 27500 and our telephone number is (855) 949-6268.
