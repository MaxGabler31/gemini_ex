Core Molding Technologies and its subsidiaries operate in the engineered materials market as one operating segment as a molder of thermoplastic and thermoset structural products. The Company produces and sells molded products for varied markets, including medium and heavy-duty trucks, automobiles, power sports, construction and agriculture, building products and other commercial markets. Core Molding Technologies has its headquarters in Columbus, Ohio, and operates seven production facilities in three countries, United States, Canada and Mexico. On November 5, 2020, the Company announced it will close the manufacturing facility located in Batavia, Ohio and completed the closure in the fourth quarter of 2021.
In general, product growth and diversification are achieved in several different ways: (1) resourcing of existing structural products from another supplier by an original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”); (2) obtaining new structural products through a selection process in which an OEM solicits bids; (3) successful marketing of structural products for previously non-structural applications; (4) converting alternative materials to engineered materials; (5) successful marketing of structural products to OEMs outside of our traditional markets; (6) developing of new materials, technology and processes 
to meet current or prospective customer requirements; and (7) acquiring an existing business. The Company's efforts continue to be directed towards all seven areas.
PRODUCTS
Structural plastics compete largely against metals and have the strength to function well during prolonged use. Management believes that structural plastic components offer many advantages over metals, including:
•heat resistance;
•corrosion resistance;
•lighter weight;
•lower cost;
•greater flexibility in product design;
•part consolidation for multiple piece assemblies;
•lower initial tooling costs for lower volume applications;
•high strength-to-weight ratio; and
•dent-resistance in comparison to steel or aluminum.
Our manufacturing facilities utilize various production processes; however, end products are similar and are not unique to a facility or customer base. 
Sheet Molding Compound (“SMC”) 
SMC is primarily a combination of resins, fiberglass, fillers, and catalysts compounded and cured in sheet form, which is then used to manufacture compression-molded products, as discussed below. The Company incorporates a sophisticated computer program in the process of compounding various complex SMC formulations tailored to meet customer needs. The program provides for the control of information during various production processes and data for statistical batch controls. The Company also sells SMC to other molders.
Molded Products
The Company manufactures structural products using compression molding, resin transfer molding, and injection molding. As of December 31, 2021, the Company owned 75 molding presses in its Columbus, Ohio facility (16); Matamoros, Mexico facility (21); Cobourg, Canada facility (19); Gaffney, South Carolina facility (10); Winona, Minnesota facility (5); and Escobedo, Mexico (54). The Company's molding presses range in size from 250 to 5,000 tons.
SMC compression molding is a process whereby SMC is molded to form by matched die steel molds through which a combination of heat and pressure are applied via a molding press. This thermoset process produces high quality, dimensionally consistent products and is typically used for high volume products. Higher volumes justify the customer's investment in matched die steel molds. Visually appealing outer components and high strength reinforcing components are fabricated with this process. Visually appealing components are produced with vacuum assisted molding and through utilizing in-mold coating (IMC). IMC can provide an additional benefit of conductivity assisting in the process of post paint application along with reducing porosity and improving surface appearance.
Direct Long Fiber Thermoplastic (“DLFT”) compression molding employs two molds, typically a core and a cavity, similar to matched die SMC molding. This is a process for compounding and molding thermoplastic materials with "long" fibers (typically, 0.5 inch or longer). Engineered thermoplastic pellets and performance additives are compounded in a screw extruder, to which chopped reinforcements (typically, glass fibers) are added and further extruded. A "charge" of material is cut to a precise weight, and this "charge" is directly moved to a compression or injection transfer process, where it is molded into a finished part. The process allows for direct processing of the compounded material, bypassing the expense and delay of producing an intermediate product (pellets or sheets) as is used in other fiber-reinforced thermoplastic molding processes. The D-LFT process is an attractive option for products that have highly complex geometry, require high strength and stiffness, and benefit from the recyclability of a thermoplastic resin.
Vacuum resin transfer compression molding (“RTM”) process employs two mold halves, typically a core and a cavity, similar to matched die molding. The composite is produced by placing glass mat, chopped strand, or continuous strand fiberglass in the mold cavity in the desired pattern. Parts used for cosmetic purposes typically have a gel coat applied to the mold surface. The core mold is then fitted to the cavity, and upon a satisfactory seal, a vacuum is applied. When the proper vacuum is achieved, the resin is injected into the mold to fill the part. Finally, the part is allowed to cure and is then removed from the mold and trimmed to shape. Fiberglass reinforced products produced from the RTM process exhibit a 
high-quality surface on both sides of the part and excellent part thickness. The multiple insert tooling technique can be utilized in the RTM process to improve throughput based upon volume requirements.
Structural Foam and Web Injection Molding (“SIM”) are low-pressure injection molding processes that develop high-strength, rigid parts at low weight. This is accomplished by mixing a foaming agent (usually, nitrogen gas) with the melted polymer (structural foam process), or by injecting nitrogen gas into the mold cavity immediately after the plastic resin is injected (structural web molding). Structural foam produces a cellular interior structure that can provide twice the rigidity of a solid plastic molding. The structural web process pushes the plastic out to the mold cavity walls, uniformly packing out the entire mold and hollowing out thicker sections to create products of varying wall thicknesses. As a result, structural web molded parts have a smoother, glossier finish than other low-pressure parts. Both processes give part designers flexibility when designing products that need strength and stiffness at low weight and also have the benefit of recyclability due to the use of a thermoplastic resin.
Reaction Injection Molding (“RIM”) is a process whereby a composite is produced through the injection of a two- component thermoset resin system utilizing dicyclopentadiene (“DCPD”) technology. DCPD technology involves injecting a liquid compound into matched die aluminum molds to form the part. In this process the mold is prepared, closed and the liquid compound is injected into the tool then cured. Additional finishing is required when the part is designated for top coat painting. The RIM process is an alternative to other closed mold processes for mid-volume parts that require a high level of impact resistance.
Hand Lay-Up is a process that utilizes a shell mold, typically the cavity, where glass cloth, either chopped strand or continuous strand glass mat, is introduced into the cavity. Resin is then applied to the cloth and rolled out to achieve a uniform wet-out from the glass and to remove any trapped air. The part is then allowed to cure and is removed from the mold. After removal, the part typically undergoes trimming to achieve the shape desired. Parts used for cosmetic purposes typically have a gel coat applied to the mold surface prior to the lay-up to improve the surface quality of the finished part. Parts produced from this process have a smooth outer surface and an unfinished or rough interior surface. These fiberglass-reinforced products are typically non-cosmetic components or structural reinforcements that are sold externally or used internally as components of larger assemblies.
Spray-Up is a process that utilizes the same type of shell mold as hand-lay-up, but instead of using glass cloth to produce the composite part, a chopper/spray system is employed. Glass rovings and resin feed the chopper/spray gun. The resin coated, chopped glass is sprayed into the mold to the desired thickness. The resin coated glass in the mold is then rolled out to ensure complete wet-out and to remove any trapped air. The part is then allowed to cure, is removed from the mold, and is then trimmed to the desired shape. Parts used for cosmetic purposes typically have a gel coat applied to the mold surface prior to the resin-coated glass being sprayed into the mold to improve the surface quality of the finished part. Parts produced from this process have a smooth outer surface and an unfinished or rough interior surface.
Assembly, Machining, and Paint Products
Many of the products molded by the Company are assembled, machined, and prime painted or topcoat painted to result in a finished product used by the Company's customers.
The Company has demonstrated manufacturing flexibility that accommodates a range of low volume hand assembly and machining work, to high volume, highly automated assembly and machining systems. Robotics are used as deemed productive for material handling, machining, and adhesive applications. In addition to conventional machining methods, water-jet cutting technology is also used where appropriate. The Company also utilizes paint booths and batch ovens in its facilities. The Company generally contracts with outside providers for higher volume applications that require top coat paint.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Capital expenditures totaled approximately $11.6 million, $3.7 million, and $7.5 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019 respectively. These capital expenditures primarily consisted of building and equipment improvements and additional production equipment to manufacture parts.
The Company continuously engages in product development. Research and development activities focus on developing new material formulations, new structural composite products, new production capabilities and processes, and improving existing products and manufacturing processes. The Company does not maintain a separate research and development organization or facility, but uses its production equipment, as necessary, to support these efforts and cooperates with its customers and its suppliers in research and development efforts. Likewise, manpower to direct and advance research and 
development is integrated with the existing manufacturing, engineering, production, and quality organizations. Management has estimated that costs related to research and development were approximately $1.3 million, $1.2 million and $1.2 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
MAJOR CUSTOMERS
The Company had five major customers during the year ended December 31, 2021, BRP, Inc. (“BRP”), Navistar, Inc. (“Navistar”), PACCAR, Inc. (“PACCAR”), Universal Forest Products, Inc. (“UFP”) and Volvo Group North America, LLC (“Volvo”). Major customers are defined as customers whose sales individually consist of more than ten percent of total sales during any annual or interim reporting period in the current year. The loss of a significant portion of sales to these customers could have a material adverse effect on the business of the Company. The following table presents sales to major customers as a percent of total sales for the years ended December 31:

 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 | Supply Agreement Expiration
BRP | 12% | 10% | 7% | July 31, 2024 
Navistar | 15% | 18% | 20% | December 31, 2021 
PACCAR | 12% | 13% | 16% | November 30, 2023 
Volvo | 12% | 12% | 17% | December 31, 2023 
UFP | 12% | 17% | 9% | January 1, 2023 

BRP provides a portfolio of industry-leading products comprising of snowmobiles, watercraft, on and off-road vehicles, power sports propulsion systems as well as engines for karts, motorcycles and recreational aircraft. Demand for these products is driven by consumer demand and general economic conditions.
The North American truck market in which Navistar, Volvo, and PACCAR compete is highly competitive and the demand for medium and heavy-duty trucks is subject to considerable volatility as it moves in response to cycles in the overall business environment and is particularly sensitive to the industrial sector, which generates a significant portion of the freight tonnage hauled. Truck demand also depends on general economic conditions, among other factors. The Company's supply agreement with Navistar expired on December 31, 2021. Navistar will source business to the Company via terms on individual purchase orders until a new supply agreement is executed. 
UFP supplies products to three industry segments: retail, industrial, and construction. These are highly-competitive markets, with suppliers competing for a share of available shelf space at large “big box” retailers and independent contractors. As a discretionary product category, suppliers must also strive continuously to differentiate their products with unique designs, colors, and features, in addition to maintaining a constant focus on cost reduction. Demand for these products is driven by residential and commercial construction and general economic conditions, among other influences.
OTHER CUSTOMERS
The Company also produces products for other customers and industries, including medium and heavy-duty truck, automobiles, power sports, construction and agriculture, building products and other commercial product markets. Sales to these customers individually were all less than 10% of total sales for interim and annual reporting during 2021. 
GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION
Substantially all of the Company's products are sold in U.S. dollars. The following table provides information related to the Company's sales by country, based on the ship to location of customers' production facilities, for the years ended December 31 (in thousands):

 | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019
United States | $ | 191,667 | | | $ | 136,424 | | $ | 178,953
Mexico | 88,952 | | | 64,942 | | | 79,761
Canada | 22,642 | | | 16,827 | | | 16,988
Other | 4,222 | | | 4,163 | | | 8,588 
Total | $ | 307,483 | | | $ | 222,356 | | $ | 284,290

SEASONALITY & BUSINESS CYCLE
The Company's business is affected annually by the production schedules of its customers. Certain of the Company's customers typically shut down their operations on an annual basis for a period of one to several weeks during the Company's third quarter. Certain customers also typically shut down their operations during the last week of December. As a result, demand for the Company's products typically decreases during the third and fourth quarters. Demand for medium and heavy-duty trucks, power sports, automotive, and commercial products also fluctuates on an economic, cyclical and seasonal basis, causing a corresponding fluctuation for demand of the Company's products.
MAJOR COMPETITORS
The Company believes that it is one of the largest compounders and molders of structural products in North America. The Company faces competition from a number of other molders including, most significantly, Molded Fiber Glass Companies, Continental Structural Plastics, Ashley Industrial Molding, René Matériaux Composite Ltée ("RMC"), STS Group, 20/20 Custom Molded Plastics and The Composites Group. 
RAW MATERIALS
The principal raw materials used in the Company's processes are unsaturated polyester, vinyl ester, polyethylene, polypropylene, and dicyclopentadiene resins, fiberglass, and filler. Other significant raw materials include adhesives for assembly of molded components, in-mold coating, gel-coat, prime paint for preparation of cosmetic surfaces, and hardware (primarily metal components). Many of the raw materials used by the Company are petrochemical-based, natural gas-based, as well as downstream derivatives, and therefore, the costs of certain raw materials can be affected by changes in costs in these upstream commodities. Due to fluctuating commodity prices, suppliers are typically reluctant to enter into long-term contracts. The Company generally has supplier alternatives for each raw material, and regularly evaluates its supply base to improve its overall purchasing position; however, current supply chain conditions have limited sourcing alternatives. 
Normally we do not carry inventories of raw materials or finished products in excess of what is reasonably required to meet production and shipping schedules, and to manage risk of supply and variation in demand.
CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS
Capacity utilization is measured based on standard cycle times and a standard work week, which can range from five days per week, three-shifts per day to seven days per week, three-shifts per day, depending on the facility and molding process. During times when demand exceeds the standard five day, three -shift capacity, the Company will work weekends to create additional capacity, which can provide capacity utilization percentages greater than 100%. During 2021, the Company has used various methods from overtime to a weekend manpower crew to support the customers' production requirements.
The Company measures facility capacity in terms of its large compression molding presses (2,000 tons or greater). The Company owned 28 large compression molding presses at its facilities at December 31, 2021. The capacity utilization in these production facilities was 85% and 55% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The Company measures facility capacity in terms of its large injection molding presses (750 tons or greater). The Company owned 7 large injection molding presses at its facility at December 31, 2021. The capacity utilization in these production facilities was 73% and 89% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
BACKLOG
The Company relies on production schedules provided by its customers to plan and implement production. These schedules are normally provided on a weekly basis and typically considered firm for approximately four weeks. Some customers update these schedules daily for changes in demand, allowing them to run their inventories on a “just-in-time” basis. The ordered backlog of four weeks of expected shipments was approximately $27.7 million (all of which the Company shipped during the first month of 2022) and $21.3 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
As of December 31, 2021, the Company employed a total of 1,584 employees, which consisted of 544 employees in the United States, 835 employees in Mexico and 205 employees in Canada. The salary workforce consisted of 329 employees, while 1,255 employees were hourly. Four plant locations making up 71.5% of the workforce are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
