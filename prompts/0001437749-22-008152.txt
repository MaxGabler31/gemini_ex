ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
 
We are an independent oil and gas company engaged primarily in the exploration for, and the acquisition, development, production, and sale of, natural gas and crude oil. Our core areas of operation are in the Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountain Regions where we have developed a significant inventory of prospects that consist of proved and unproved locations, offset and on trend with existing production. Prior to December 31, 2021 we pursued various projects and entered into option agreements which were terminated, other than as described herein.
 
On June 30, 2020, we entered into an Option Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Progressive Well Service, LLC (“Progressive”) to acquire oil and gas assets in Logan County in Central Oklahoma (the “Coral Project”). On February 17, 2022, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “APA”) with Progressive and on March 9, 2022 closed on the acquisition of 34 well bores and related assets including the proceeds of production since January 1, 2022. The well bores acquired consist of developed and undeveloped proven production on the Cherokee Uplift in Central Oklahoma. Of the 34 well bores, acquired five are presently active. The Purchase Price consists of $600,000 cash the balance, after payment of option extension amounts, was paid upon closing, plus three (3%) percent of the net revenue from new wells drilled until Progressive receives three hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($350,000.00).
 
Strategy
 
We intend to generally concentrate our exploration and development efforts in fields where we can apply technical exploration and development expertise through management and consultants and where we have accumulated significant operational and exploration experience.
 
Our business model is to acquire oil and gas properties to be held as long-term assets through cash or equity transactions. Oil and gas commodity pricing, while admittedly volatile, has been stable enough under the current economic market conditions to encourage investment in development projects. Our lean operating structure positions us well to succeed in this very competitive market. Our strategy is to acquire producing properties that we can operate which have proven un-drilled locations available for further development. Application of enhanced drilling technologies in previously undeveloped or underdeveloped areas assures the continued value of these properties. At this time, we have secured the rights to one development property and identified two target areas meeting our criteria.
 
We will continue with well activations and recompletions and initiate drilling activity with the proceeds from future financings. In addition, our management’s years of experience and knowledge of the oil and gas industry lead us to believe that there are an abundance of additional good drilling prospects available that have either been overlooked or are not big enough for larger companies to pursue. In the process of identifying these drilling prospects, we will utilize the expertise of existing management and employ contract engineering firms to further evaluate the properties. To qualify for acquisition, the calculated cash flow after taxes and operating expenses is expected recover the acquisition cost in under 30 months. The cash flow calculation will be based on NYMEX flat pricing of $60.00 per barrel of oil and $3.00 per MCF of gas, further adjusted by regional differentials. In addition, the selection criteria will require the life of current producing wells to be seven years or longer and the field must have a minimum total life of 15 years.
 
Our business operations are in the exploration and development of oil and gas, including unconventional natural gas, in the continental United States. Specifically, in the primary oil and gas basins located within the states in the Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountain Regions listed below:
 

A) | Oklahoma
---+---------


B) | Texas

Production and Reserve Overview
 
The Company engaged Liquid Gold Technologies, lnc. (LGT) to evaluate and deliver a Certified SEC Reserves and Valuation Report of the Rogers County Project. On March 10, 2021, but effective December 31, 2020, LGT delivered the report, of which, a full copy is attached and incorporated herein. LGT used their interpretations of the Company's supplied data and the definitions and disclosure guidelines of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) contained in Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting, Final Rule released June 14, 2009 in the Federal Register (SEC regulations), to determine the Project contains Proven net reserves (all non-producing or undeveloped) of 345,110 mcf of gas and 866,340 barrels of oil/condensate with an SEC PV10% of $10,286,180. In addition, the Project contains additional Probable net reserves (all non-producing or undeveloped) of 271,910 mcf of gas and 194,500 barrels of oil/condensate with an additional SEC PV10% of $2,427,660. PV10% as of December 31, 2020 was based on SEC prices of $39.54 per barrel of oil and $1.985 per mmbtu of natural gas as calculated by LGT.
 
Geological and geophysical
 
We may engage detailed geological interpretation combined with advanced seismic exploration techniques to identify the most promising drilling sites within our leases.
 
Geological interpretation is based upon data recovered from existing oil and gas wells in an area and other sources. Such information is either purchased from the company that drilled the wells or becomes public knowledge through state agencies after a period of years. Through analysis of rock types, fossils and the electrical and chemical characteristics of rocks from existing wells, we can construct a picture of rock layers in the area. We will have access to the well logs and decline curves from existing operating wells. Well logs allow us to calculate an original oil or gas volume in place while decline curves from production history allow us to calculate remaining proved producing reserves.
 
We have not purchased, leased or entered into any agreements to purchase or lease any of the equipment necessary to conduct the geological or geophysical testing referred to herein and will only be able to do so upon raising additional capital through loans or the sale of equity securities.
 
Market for Oil and Gas Production
 
The market for oil and gas production is regulated by both the state and federal governments. The overall market is mature and with the exception of gas, all producers in a producing region will receive the same price. The major oil companies will purchase all crude oil offered for sale at posted field prices. There are price adjustments for quality differences from the Benchmark. Benchmark is Saudi Arabian light crude oil employed as the standard on which OPEC price changes have been based. Quality variances from Benchmark crude results in lower prices being paid for the variant oil. Oil sales are normally contracted with a purchaser or gatherer as it is known in the industry who will pick up the oil at the well site. In some instances, there may be deductions for transportation from the well head to the sales point. At this time the majority of crude oil purchasers do not charge transportation fees unless the well is outside their service area. The service area is a geographical area in which the purchaser of crude oil will not charge a fee for picking upon the oil. The purchaser or oil gatherer as it is called within the oil industry, will usually handle all check disbursements to both the working interest and royalty owners. We will be a working interest owner. By being a working interest owner, we are responsible for the payment of our proportionate share of the operating expenses of the well. Royalty owners and overriding royalty owners receive a percentage of gross oil production for the particular lease and are not obligated in any manner whatsoever to pay for the costs of operating the lease. Therefore, we, in most instances, will be paying the expenses for the oil and gas revenues paid to the royalty and overriding royalty interests.
 
Gas sales are by contract. The gas purchaser will pay the well operator 100% of the sales proceeds on or about the 25th of each and every month for the previous month's sales. The operator is responsible for all checks and distributions to the working interest and royalty owners. There is no standard price for gas. Price will fluctuate with the seasons and the general market conditions. It is our intention to utilize this market whenever possible in order to maximize revenues. We do not anticipate any significant change in the manner production is purchased; however, no assurance can be given at this time that such changes will not occur.

Acquisition of Future Leases
 
Our strategy is to acquire producing properties that the Company can operate which have proven un-drilled locations available for further development. Our management’s years of experience, knowledge of the oil and gas industry, and existing networks provide access to both marketed and off-market acquisition opportunities. The Company anticipates evaluating many potential acquisitions; however, to qualify for acquisition, the calculated cash flow after taxes and operating expenses will recover the acquisition cost in under 30 months. The cash flow calculation will be based on NYMEX pricing of $55 per barrel of oil and $2.50 per MCF of gas. In addition, the selection criteria will require the life of current producing wells to be seven years or longer and the field must have a minimum total life of 15 years. 
Competition
 
The oil and gas industry is highly competitive. Our competitors and potential competitors include major oil companies and independent producers of varying sizes which are engaged in the acquisition of producing properties and the exploration and development of prospects. Most of our competitors have greater financial, personnel and other resources than we do and therefore have greater leverage in acquiring prospects, hiring personnel and marketing oil and gas. In addition, larger companies operating in the same area may be willing or able to offer oil and gas at a lower price.
 
We compete in Oklahoma with over 1,000 independent companies and approximately 40 significant independent operators including Marathon Oil, Contango Oil and Gas and Newfield Exploration Company in addition to over 950 smaller operations with no single producer dominating the area. Major operators such as Exxon, Shell Oil, ConocoPhillips, Mobil and others that are considered major players in the oil and gas industry retain significant interests in Texas.
 
We believe that we can successfully compete against other independent companies by utilizing the expertise of consultants familiar with the structures to be developed, maintaining low corporate overhead and otherwise efficiently developing current lease interests.
 
Government Regulation
 
The production and sale of oil and gas is subject to regulation by state, federal and local authorities. In most areas there are statutory provisions regulating the production of oil and natural gas under which administrative agencies may set allowable rates of production and promulgate rules in connection with the operation and production of such wells, ascertain and determine the reasonable market demand of oil and gas, and adjust allowable rates with respect thereto.
 
The sale of liquid hydrocarbons was subject to federal regulation under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 which amended various acts, including the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973. These regulations and controls included mandatory restrictions upon the prices at which most domestic and crude oil and various petroleum products could be sold. All price controls and restrictions on the sale of crude oil at the wellhead have been withdrawn. It is possible, however, that such controls may be re-imposed in the future but when, if ever, such reimposition might occur and the effect thereof is unknown.
 
The sale of certain categories of natural gas in interstate commerce is subject to regulation under the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 ("NGPA"). Under the NGPA, a comprehensive set of statutory ceiling prices applies to all first sales of natural gas unless the gas is specifically exempt from regulation (i.e., unless the gas is deregulated). Administration and enforcement of the NGPA ceiling prices are delegated to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC"). In June 1986, the FERC issued Order No. 451, which in general is designed to provide a higher NGPA ceiling price for certain vintages of old gas. It is possible that we may in the future acquire significant amounts of natural gas subject to NGPA price regulations and/or FERC Order No. 451.
 
Our operations are subject to extensive and continually changing regulation because of legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment and expansion. Many departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue and have issued rules and regulations binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual participants. The failure to comply with such rules and regulations can result in large penalties. The regulatory burden on this industry increases our cost of doing business and, therefore, affects our profitability. However, we do not believe that we are affected in a significantly different way by these regulations than our competitors are affected.

Transportation and Production
 
We can make sales of oil, natural gas and condensate at market prices, which are not subject to price controls at this time. The price that we receive from the sale of these products is affected by our ability to transport and the cost of transporting these products to market. Under applicable laws, FERC regulates:

● | the construction of natural gas pipeline facilities, and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the rates for transportation of these products in interstate commerce.

 
Our possible future sales of natural gas are affected by the availability, terms and cost of pipeline transportation. The price and terms for access to pipeline transportation remain subject to extensive federal and state regulation. Several major regulatory changes have been implemented by Congress and FERC from 1985 to the present. These changes affect the economics of natural gas production, transportation and sales. In addition, FERC is continually proposing and implementing new rules and regulations affecting these segments of the natural gas industry that remain subject to FERC's jurisdiction. The most notable of these are natural gas transmission companies.
 
FERC's more recent proposals may affect the availability of interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines. These initiatives may also affect the intrastate transportation of gas in some cases. The stated purpose of many of these regulatory changes is to promote competition among the various sectors of the natural gas industry. These initiatives generally reflect more light-handed regulation of the natural gas industry. The ultimate impact of the complex rules and regulations issued by FERC since 1985 cannot be predicted. In addition, some aspects of these regulatory developments have not become final but are still pending judicial and FERC final decisions. We cannot predict what further action FERC will take on these matters. However, we do not believe that any action taken will affect us much differently than it will affect other natural gas producers, gatherers and marketers with which we might compete.
 
Effective as of January 1, 1995, FERC implemented regulations establishing an indexing system for transportation rates for oil. These regulations could increase the cost of transporting oil to the purchaser. We do not believe that these regulations will affect us any differently than other oil producers and marketers with which we compete.
 
Drilling and Production.
 
Our anticipated drilling and production operations are subject to regulation under a wide range of state and federal statutes, rules, orders and regulations. Among other matters, these statutes and regulations govern:

● | the amounts and types of substances and materials that may be released into the environment;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the discharge and disposition of waste materials, 
● | the reclamation and abandonment of wells and facility sites, and 
● | the remediation of contaminated sites, and require: 
● | permits for drilling operations, 
● | drilling bonds, and 
● | reports concerning operations. 

Environmental Regulations
 
General. Our operations are affected by various state, local and federal environmental laws and regulations, including the:
 

● | Clean Air Act, 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Oil Pollution Act of 1990, 
● | Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 
● | Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA"), 
● | Toxic Substances Control Act, and 
● | Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA").

 
    7 

  

These laws and regulations govern the discharge of materials into the environment or the disposal of waste materials, or otherwise relate to the protection of the environment. In particular, the following activities are subject to stringent environmental regulations:
 

● | drilling, 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | development and production operations, 
● | activities in connection with storage and transportation of oil and other liquid hydrocarbons, and
● | use of facilities for treating, processing or otherwise handling hydrocarbons and wastes. 

 
Violations are subject to reporting requirements, civil penalties and criminal sanctions. As with the industry generally, compliance with existing regulations increases our overall cost of business. The increased costs cannot be easily determined. Such areas affected include:
 

● | unit production expenses primarily related to the control and limitation of air emissions and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the disposal of produced water, 
● | capital costs to drill exploration and development wells resulting from expenses primarily related to the management and disposal of drilling fluids and other oil and natural gas exploration wastes, and
● | capital costs to construct, maintain and upgrade equipment and facilities and remediate, plug and abandon inactive well sites and pits. 

 
Environmental regulations historically have been subject to frequent change by regulatory authorities. Therefore, we are unable to predict the ongoing cost of compliance with these laws and regulations or the future impact of such regulations on our operations.
 
A discharge of hydrocarbons or hazardous substances into the environment could subject us to substantial expense, including both the cost to comply with applicable regulations pertaining to the cleanup of releases of hazardous substances into the environment and claims by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage. We do not maintain insurance for protection against certain types of environmental liabilities.
 
The Clean Air Act requires or will require most industrial operations in the United States to incur capital expenditures in order to meet air emission control standards developed by the EPA and state environmental agencies. Although no assurances can be given, we believe the Clean Air Act requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
 
RCRA is the principal federal statute governing the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes. RCRA imposes stringent operating requirements, and liability for failure to meet such requirements, on a person who is either:
 

● | a "generator" or "transporter" of hazardous waste, or 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | an "owner" or "operator" of a hazardous waste treatment, storage or disposal facility.

 
At present, RCRA includes a statutory exemption that allows oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes to be classified as nonhazardous waste. As a result, we will not be subject to many of RCRA's requirements because our operations will probably generate minimal quantities of hazardous wastes.
 
CERCLA, also known as "Superfund," imposes liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original act, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a "hazardous substance" into the environment. These persons include:
 

● | the "owner" or "operator" of the site where hazardous substances have been released, and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site.

 
CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. In the course of our ordinary operations, we could generate waste that may fall within CERCLA's definition of a "hazardous substance." As a result, we may be liable under CERCLA or under analogous state laws for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which such wastes have been disposed. Under such law we could be required to:
 

● | remove or remediate previously disposed wastes, including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | clean up contaminated property, including contaminated groundwater, or 
● | perform remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination. 

 
We could also be subject to other damage claims by governmental authorities or third parties related to such contamination.
