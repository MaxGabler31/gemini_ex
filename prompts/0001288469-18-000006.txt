significant design flexibility and low system cost across a wide range of broadband communications, wired and wireless infrastructure, and industrial and multimarket applications.

During 2017, we sold our products to 286 end customers. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our net revenue was $420.3 million as compared to $387.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2016.
Recent Developments
On March 29, 2017, each share of our then outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock and shares underlying our then outstanding stock options, restricted stock units and restricted stock awards automatically converted into a single class of our common stock or rights to receive shares of a single class of our common stock pursuant to the terms of our Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The conversion had no impact on the total number of issued and outstanding shares of our capital stock; the Class A shares and Class B shares converted into an equivalent number of shares of our common stock. In addition, the conversion did not increase the total number of authorized shares of our common stock, which prior to the conversion was, and remains, 550,000,000 shares. However, our total number of authorized shares of capital stock was reduced from 1,575,000,000 to 1,509,554,147, to account for the retirement of the Class A shares and Class B shares that were outstanding at the time of the conversion. Following the conversion, our authorized capital stock includes 441,123,947 Class A shares and 493,430,200 Class B shares, which represents Class A shares and Class B shares that were authorized but unissued at the time of the conversion. No additional Class A shares or Class B shares will be issued following the conversion.
Following the conversion, each share of our common stock is entitled to one vote per share and otherwise has the same designations, rights, powers and preferences as the Class A common stock prior to the conversion. In addition, holders of our common stock vote as a single class of stock on any matter that is submitted to a vote of our stockholders. Prior to the conversion, the holders of our Class A and Class B common stock had identical voting rights, except that holders of Class A common stock were entitled to one vote per share and holders of Class B common stock were entitled to ten votes per share with respect to transactions that would result in a change of control of our company or that relate to our equity incentive plans. In addition, holders of Class B common stock had the exclusive right to elect two members of our Board of Directors, each referred to as a Class B Director. The shares of our Class B common stock were not publicly traded. Each share of our Class B common stock was convertible at any time at the option of the holder into one share of Class A common stock and in most instances automatically converted upon sale or other transfer.
On April 4, 2017, we consummated the transactions contemplated by a share and asset acquisition agreement with Marvell Semiconductor Inc., or Marvell, to purchase certain assets and assume certain liabilities of Marvell’s G.hn business, including its Spain legal entity, for aggregate cash consideration of $21.0 million. We also hired certain employees of the G.hn business outside of Spain and assumed employment obligations of the Spanish entity we acquired, which is now a subsidiary of MaxLinear. The assets acquired include, among other things, patents and other intellectual property, a workforce-in-place and other intangible assets, as well as tangible assets that include but are not limited to production masks and other production related assets, inventory and other property and equipment. The liabilities assumed include, among other things, product warranty obligations and accrued vacation and severance obligations for employees who joined MaxLinear and its subsidiaries as a result of the transaction. The acquired assets and assumed liabilities, together with the employees, represent a business as defined in ASC 805, Business Combinations. We integrated the acquired assets and employees into our existing business.
In April 2017, our subsidiary in Singapore began operating under certain tax incentives in Singapore, which are generally effective through March 2022 and may be extended through March 2027. Under these incentives, qualifying income derived from certain sales of our integrated circuits is taxed at a concessionary rate over the incentive period. We also receive a reduced withholding tax rate on certain intercompany royalty payments made by our Singapore subsidiary during the incentive period. Such incentives are conditional upon our meeting certain minimum employment and investment thresholds within Singapore over time, and we may be required to return certain tax benefits in the event the Company does not achieve compliance related to that incentive period. We currently believe that we will be able to satisfy these conditions without material risk. Primarily because of our Singapore net operating losses and our full valuation allowance in Singapore, we do not believe the incentives will have a material impact on our income tax position in the year ending December 31, 2018. 
On May 12, 2017, pursuant to the March 28, 2017 Agreement and Plan of Merger, Eagle Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of MaxLinear, merged with and into Exar Corporation, or Exar, with Exar surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of MaxLinear. Under this Agreement and Plan of Merger, we agreed to acquire Exar's outstanding common stock for $13.00 per share in cash. We also assumed certain of Exar's stock-based awards in the merger. We paid aggregate cash consideration of $688.1 million, including $12.7 million of cash paid to settle certain stock-based 
4

awards that were not assumed by us in the merger. We funded the transaction with cash from the balance sheet of the combined companies, including $235.8 million of cash from Exar, and the net proceeds of approximately $416.8 million under a secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $425.0 million. The facility is available (i) to finance the Merger, refinance certain existing indebtedness of Exar and its subsidiaries, and fund all related transactions, (ii) to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith and (iii) for working capital and general corporate purposes. The term loan facility has a seven-year term and the term loans bear interest at either an Adjusted LIBOR or an Adjusted Base Rate, plus a fixed applicable margin. In November 2017, to hedge a substantial portion of our interest rate risk, we entered into a fixed-for-floating interest rate swap agreement with an amortizing notional amount to swap a substantial portion of our variable rate LIBOR interest payments under the outstanding term loans for fixed interest payments bearing an interest rate of 1.74685%. Our outstanding debt is still subject to a 2.5% fixed applicable margin during the term of the loan. As a result of entering the swap, the interest rate on a substantial portion of our long-term debt is effectively fixed at approximately 4.25%.
Exar is a designer and developer of high-performance analog mixed-signal integrated circuits and sub-system solutions. The merger significantly furthers our strategic goals of increasing revenue scale, diversifying revenues by end customers and addressable markets, and expanding our analog and mixed-signal footprint on existing tier-one customer platforms. Exar adds a diverse portfolio of high-performance analog and mixed-signal products constituting power management and interface technologies that are ubiquitous functions in wireless and wireline communications infrastructure, broadband access, industrial, enterprise networking, and automotive platforms. We intend to leverage combined technological expertise, cross-selling opportunities and distribution channels to significantly expand our serviceable addressable market. For a discussion of specific risks and uncertainties that could affect our ability to achieve these and other strategic objectives of our acquisitions, please refer to Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” under the subsection captioned “Risks Relating to Recent Acquisitions.”
Industry Background
Over the last two decades, the availability of ubiquitous internet connectivity has resulted in an exponential growth in data content consumption, delivery, and distribution. The rapid rise of social media, the increasing popularity of new broadcast video delivery services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu, new high definition multimedia content, and expanding 4G/5G wireless data access have led to an explosion in data traffic and created an insatiable demand for data bandwidth. Increasingly, industrial, enterprise, and home devices, such as, high-efficiency environmentally friendly or "green" lighting, smart appliances in the connected home, commercial air-conditioning, video surveillance equipment, manufacturing machinery, and point-of-sale asset tracking systems are being connected over the internet, collectively referred to as the Internet of Things, or IoT. Society's drive towards increased energy efficiency and productivity gains is inextricably linked to an expanding interconnected world of devices and people. The sheer amount of information generated and made available for further processing in a IoT world necessitates the continuous upgrade of network bandwidth capacity and associated equipment. Cloud based computing services for storage, big data analytics, and internet data traffic management require massive high-speed data processing and data sharing between servers, switches, and routers within large hyperscale and enterprise data centers. As a result, the growth in demand for fatter and faster data pipes (higher data capacity and lower data latency networks) inside the home, into the home, and throughout the cloud and wired and wireless communications network infrastructure is unprecedented. The elimination of data capacity and speed bottlenecks inside networks is heavily reliant on wide spectrum or broadband, high frequency circuits, and digital signal processing algorithms that can improve spectrum utilization efficiency, and can be integrated into cost effective, low power, mixed-signal system-on-chip semiconductor solutions. We believe that several of these trends are key drivers across multiple of our target markets. We believe they present significant revenue growth opportunities for the Company. These trends include the following:

• | Connected Home: Competing cable, satellite, and other broadband video and data service providers differentiate their services by offering consumers with bundled video, voice, and broadband data access, referred to as triple-play services. These services include advanced features, such as, channel guide information, video-on-demand, DVR, and picture-in-picture viewing. Many of today’s service provider home gateway set-top boxes enable consumers to simultaneously access and manage multimedia content from multiple locations and screens in the home. These home gateway or set-top box devices are required to simultaneously receive, demodulate, and decode multiple signals spread across several channels of frequency bandwidth over a wide frequency range. In traditional set-top box architectures, each simultaneously accessed spectrum of signal is processed by a dedicated RF receiver and transmitter. In the emerging cable and satellite home gateway or media servers, content is delivered from the gateway/server to “thin” or remote IP clients that do not have traditional TV tuners. Each of these gateways and clients necessarily includes a broadband RF transceiver SoC based on MoCA, G.hn, or WiFi home data connectivity standards. As a result, the number of RF transceivers required in each gateway or client is greatly increased. For example, in order to deliver the increasing data bandwidth requirements of the home, cable

5

MSOs have begun initial deployments of DOCSIS 3.1 equipment and services, which enable channel bonding or the concurrent reception of multiple channels of frequency bands, resulting in a higher aggregate “sum of the channels” bandwidth available to cable subscribers. With the increasing popularity of accessing multimedia content over-the-top, or OTT, via broadband-enabled streaming services, consumers are augmenting OTT multimedia content services with free over-the-air (OTA) terrestrial TV broadcast programming (also referred to as “Cord Cutting”). Therefore, cord-cutting OTT streaming media platforms also require one or more terrestrial TV RF receiver and demodulator SoC solutions.

• | Infrastructure: The demand for “faster and fatter” data pipes and equipment in enterprise and telecommunications infrastructure markets is being primarily driven by the explosion of data traffic generated by mobile devices, OTT streaming video services, and cloud computing and data analytics.

Inside hyper-scale data centers, high speed optical interconnect products provide the interconnect function between the servers to the top-of-rack switch, which is also connected to the core-router. Through a hierarchy of switches and routers, servers not only connect to each other horizontally inside the data center, but are also connected to the external transport network. High speed interconnect products are also present inside the service provider's metro and long-haul high-speed fiber-optic connections of the transport network. Data center links and equipment are also consistently being upgraded for performance and speed. Currently, while server connections are transitioning from 1Gbps to 10Gbps links, routers and switches are moving from 10/40Gbps to 100Gbps, and to 400Gbps interconnect speeds. Likewise, as data traffic demand continues to grow, the number of servers and a server’s capacity to process massive amounts of data is poised to increase dramatically. Cloud services and machine learning are dependent upon the ability to interconnect vast numbers of servers and storage inside a data center as efficiently as possible, enabling the entire data center to act as a single computing or data processing unit. For this reason, improving the bandwidth of data center networking technology within and between data centers is critical to the data center technology roadmap. At the same time, the cooling of these large scale and densely configured data centers requires extremely low power and highly integrated large bandwidth interconnect solutions.
Within wireless access and backhaul infrastructure, the increasing data traffic from 3G/4G/5G wireless access enabled smartphones and IoT devices requires extremely high bandwidth capacity wireless backhaul and fronthaul point-to-point transport links. As a result, microwave wireless backhaul and fronthaul transport links are migrating to millimeter wave operating frequencies, where a large increase in available spectrum improves data capacity more than tenfold. The finite, and fractured wireless spectrum designated for 5G access is being used more efficiently by increasing the complexity of radio transceivers to be able to aggregate multiple non-contiguous channels of spectrum. At the same time, these complex radio transceivers are feeding antenna arrays that can direct wireless signals more efficiently to the target user, vastly improving coverage (range) and maximum data rates. 5G Wireless technology improves data rates and spectral efficiency by deploying antenna arrays consisting of multiple antenna elements and an equivalent large number of radio transceivers per each base-station. Increasing the density of 5G wireless cells geographically, for capacity and coverage, not only requires more base-stations per unit cell, but it also entails the upgrade of the wireless and optical backhaul transport network connecting the cells. The rollout of 5G functionality within base-stations presents unprecedented technical challenges in radio transceiver design. It involves larger bandwidth spectrum handling capability; extremely high operating radio frequency range; support of antenna array functionality; and the ability to transport high speed data to and from the base-station, all the while consuming extremely low power.
In cable infrastructure, in order to deliver extremely high data bandwidth to homes and businesses, conventional copper and analog broadband networks are being upgraded to deploy digital fiber deeper or closer to the subscriber premises. Currently, the deep optical fiber is being locally terminated at fiber nodes, which “passively” convert the optical signals to electrical signals to be transported over the coaxial cable network that connects to the end subscriber premises. Coaxial cable networks are not only ubiquitous, but are also extremely expensive to replace with fiber which extends all the way to the subscriber premises. As a result, service providers are striving to extract greater data bandwidth capacity from their existing coaxial cable networks. In the cable DOCSIS3.1 network configuration, new fiber node installations are required to support proactive “network monitoring” (“active fiber notes”), continually monitoring and optimizing spectrum usage in the coaxial cable, to deliver up to 10Gbps of available data capacity to any subscriber. Innovation in radio frequency broadband circuits and signal processing is necessary to meet the cost, power consumption, and size constraints of existing and new fiber node installations.
6

Increasing bandwidth severely stresses the limits of current semiconductor device technology, and drives up power consumption. The costly thermal constraints imposed by the additional power dissipation has made it impractical to push more data bandwidth or throughput inside network switches and other interconnects using existing communication signaling techniques. To surmount these challenges, design innovation in broadband analog circuits, and digital signal processing are required for network systems to reach higher data rates at much lower power consumption per unit bandwidth of data capacity. 

• | Industrial & Multi-Market: Through the acquisition of Exar, we have gained over 40 years of proven technical competency serving the connected world. Increasingly, in the industrial world, manufacturing equipment and appliances are connected to each other and to the cloud to better optimize utilization, improve power consumption, and plant management. Legacy equipment and new installations need to communicate with each other via newer and older connectivity protocol standards. This in turn creates opportunities for the growth of interface products, and interface bridge products supporting multiple protocols. We believe the Exar interface product portfolio, which consists of serial interface, universal serial bus (USB), universal asynchronous receiver transmitter (UARTS), peripheral interconnect express (PCIe) devices, data converters, power management integrated chips (PMICs), and force touch sensing modules, creates new growth vectors across communications, industrial and multiple other end markets. 

The development of broadband, low power, integrated communication systems-on-chip solutions is at the heart of competitiveness across a range of different businesses spanning broadband wireline access, mobile data services, hyperscale cloud data centers providing search, social networking and OTT streaming services, and cloud computation and storage markets. The proliferation of high frequency, high bandwidth, low power applications with advanced features has led to a rapid increase in the demand for systems that require multiple radio-frequency, mixed-signal, and high-performance analog and digital signal processing transceiver SoCs. 
Challenges Faced by Providers of Systems and RF Transceivers and Optical Interconnects
The performance requirements of high bandwidth spectrum-efficient applications consisting of broadband data access and connectivity at home, 4G/5G wireless access and backhaul communications network infrastructure, and high-speed optical interconnect applications in data center, metro, and long-haul telecom transport are extremely stringent. In particular, designing and implementing high-frequency, high-bandwidth RF transceiver systems is extremely challenging owing to the high operating frequency ranges and the spectrally scattered wide frequency bands across which the communication signal is transmitted. As a result, system designers encounter significantly more sources of interference than in the case of traditional narrow band, low-frequency communication systems. Traditional implementation of narrow band single-channel RF transceivers entails conventional radio system architectures that requires expensive discrete components, and are fabricated in costly special purpose semiconductor technologies, such as silicon germanium, gallium arsenide, and RF enhanced CMOS process technologies.
The key challenges of capturing and processing high quality broadband communications signals include:

• | Receiving single or multiple RF/digital communications signals spanning multiple frequency bands over a wide spectrum. Many of the advanced high data rate applications require the simultaneous RF reception of multiple channels or frequency bands in order to first aggregate, and then subsequently demodulate the data signal, which is spread over discrete disparate frequency bands. Likewise, high data rate transmission is achieved by disaggregating the user's data signal and transmitting it over multiple available frequency bands spanning a wide frequency spectrum. For example, in the cable set-top box and broadband gateway markets, it is necessary to support the simultaneous reception of multiple channels of high definition video, voice, and data applications in many system designs. OEMs meet these stringent requirements via multiple narrow or wideband RF receivers, each of which is dedicated to the reception of a single frequency band. An alternate, but highly challenging approach involves Full Spectrum Capture (FSCTM) receiver SoCs which can receive and digitize the entire available RF frequency spectrum in the transmission medium. They can then select and aggregate the relevant frequency bands over which the data is spread using analog and mixed-signal digital co-processing techniques. In conventional architectures, use of discrete multiple RF receivers is costly or unviable due to increased design complexity, overall cost, circuit board space, power consumption and heat dissipation. In addition, such implementations suffer from signal integrity issues, reliability, signal interference, and thermal challenges owing to the proximity of sensitive multiple RF receivers and discrete components in a limited PCB footprint.

• | Signal Clarity Performance Requirements. In communications systems, performance is limited by the quality of the received/transmitted signal, which is referred to as the signal-to-noise ratio or dynamic range of the transceiver. The signal-to-noise ratio measures the strength of the desired signal relative to the total noise and undesired signal energy in the same channel. High definition satellite and terrestrial digital video, high capacity 5G wireless cellular data networks operating across non-contiguous wireless spectrum bands, and wired coaxial cable and power-line networks require broadband RF transceivers with large dynamic range. These transceiver systems are required to isolate the desired signals from the undesired signals, which are invariably present in the wide operating frequency range. The undesired signals not only include the noise generated by extraneous radio waves, but also interference produced by home appliances, enterprise communications equipment, and other wireless networking systems. For example, in broadband television reception, traditional RF transceiver implementations utilize expensive discrete components, such as band-pass filters, resonance elements, and varactor diodes to separate the desired signals from the interfering signals. In high speed mobile environments, diversity combining of radio signals and multi-user MIMO, in which the desired signal is spread over multiple frequency bands, is achieved using multiple RF transceivers. Analog and digital signal processing is employed to reconstruct the original signal and to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. While diversity combining of radio signals significantly improves signal-to-noise ratio, it requires sophisticated RF, analog and digital signal co-processing, and software expertise. Broadband reception and diversity combining of RF signals in mobile environments are extremely difficult to implement due to the stringent size, cost, and power consumption constraints. Also, higher order modulation of communication signals, which enables maximization of data capacity in a finite spectrum, requires extremely high signal-to-noise or dynamic range, which greatly increases the difficulty of implementing broadband systems.


• | Power Consumption. Power consumption is an important consideration in consumer, broadband operator, and wired and wireless infrastructure applications. For example, in battery-operated devices such as notebooks, and voice-enabled cable modems with backup battery requirements to support E911 services, long battery life is a differentiating device attribute. In wireless infrastructure applications, the cost of provisioning power to base-station antenna towers and the operating cost attributable to energy consumption is extremely high. In wired optical infrastructure, such as data centers, the cost and technical challenges of cooling larger scale, densely configured data centers are quite significant. In many multiple transceiver system designs, a majority of the system’s overall power consumption can be ascribed to RF transceiver and related components. Providers of RF transceivers and RF transceiver digital signal processing SoCs are confronted with the design challenge of lowering power consumption while improving the device performance.


• | Size. The size of electronic components, such as RF transceivers and digital signal processing SoCs, is a key consideration for system designers and the service providers that deploy them. Given the proliferation of the number of RF transceivers in broadband applications such as service provider video and data gateway markets, size is a determining factor in the selection of a silicon vendor’s component. In wired optical infrastructure applications inside data centers, rapidly increasing network server and switch face-plate density trends are aggressively driving reduction of the size of interconnects. In wireless infrastructure, space on the base-station radio towers, where the radios and modems are mounted, is highly constrained and is extremely expensive to procure. In 5G wireless access, the deployment of massive MIMO and antenna arrays and cell densification for coverage and capacity greatly increase the number of radio transceivers required in each base-station radio tower, as well as the number of base-stations in a cell.

There are also challenges that are specific to the processing of high-speed optical interconnect signals in our target data center, metro and long-haul telecommunications transport markets.

• | Optical Fiber Channel Impairments. The optical properties of the fiber material result in impairments to the optical signal as it propagates along the fiber. These impairments include not only the loss of light intensity, but also the adverse modal, chromatic, and polarization dispersion effects on light during its propagation in the fiber. These impairments degrade signal integrity, which not only reduces the maximum data throughput, but also limits the distance over which data can propagate over passive fiber. Further, electrical signal impairments are introduced in the process of conversion of optical signals to electrical signals. Therefore, RF transceivers and PHY SoCs present inside optical modules are required to correct both electrical and optical signal impairments at both ends of the fiber termination.


• | Optical Device Technology. The state of the art in optical device technology today lags the rapidly increasing speed requirements of data traffic within cloud data centers and optical transport links between telecom data

8

centers. So, there are severe physical limits to the conversion of electrical signals to optical signals and vice versa at extremely high speeds. These limitations arise from bandwidth, nonlinearities, and noise properties in lasers, modulators, and photo detectors used in optical modules.

• | Form Factor. The form factor of the face plates in server, storage, switch, and networking racks in data centers limits the amount of heat that can be dissipated within an enclosure. The power consumption of electrical and optical devices inside the transceivers, to which optical fibers are connected, has been dramatically increasing. This imposes severe and costly thermal design challenges in the development of systems. As data rates have increased dramatically, the physical form of the face plates and connectors incorporating optical devices have not scaled rapidly enough to accommodate the corresponding increase in power density.

Our RF and Mixed-Signal Platform Solutions
We are a provider of radio-frequency, or RF, high performance analog, and mixed-signal communications systems-on-chip solutions for the connected home, wired and wireless infrastructure, and industrial and multi-market applications. We are a fabless integrated circuit design company whose products integrate all or substantial portions of a broadband communication system. In most cases, these products are designed on a single silicon-die, using standard digital CMOS processes and conventional packaging technologies. This enables our solutions to achieve superior power, performance, and cost advantages relative to our industry competition. Our customers include electronics distributors, module makers, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and original design manufacturers (ODMs), who incorporate the Company’s products in a wide range of electronic devices. Examples of such end market electronic devices incorporating our products include cable DOCSIS broadband modems and gateways; wireline connectivity devices for in-home networking applications; RF transceivers and modems for wireless carrier access and backhaul infrastructure; fiber-optic modules for data center, metro, and long-haul transport networks; video set-top boxes and gateways; hybrid analog and digital televisions, direct broadcast satellite outdoor and indoor units; and power management and interface products used in these and a range of other markets.
Our products exemplify our core integrated circuit design and communications systems engineering capabilities:

• | Proprietary broadband/RF, analog and mixed-signal transceiver front ends. Our analog and mixed-signal IC designers implement complex broadband radio transceiver front ends in standard silicon CMOS processes. Our ability to integrate complex RF/Analog and mixed-signal circuits in standard CMOS processes enables single-die integration of a complete digital signal processing communication system. This results in state-of-the-art performance, highest energy efficiency or lowest power, smallest form factor, and the lowest manufacturing cost of a target function. Our high performance mixed-signal design capability, which involves the high-speed conversion of signals precisely and efficiently between analog and digital domains, is core to all our products and market applications. Our mixed-signal capabilities have allowed us to design Full Spectrum Capture™ (FSC) receivers which digitize wide swaths of frequency spectrum. For example, in cable DOCSIS3.1 data gateways, our single-chip FSC receivers digitize the entire cable spectrum and aggregate multiple frequency bands or channels using analog and digital signal co-processing to enable multi-gigabit data services. Our architectural and circuit innovations have resulted in a 100-fold reduction in power per unit bandwidth in broadband DOCSIS cable modems, while increasing the total data throughput by an even greater factor. In our latest products, which address the emerging 400Gbps high speed optical interconnect applications inside the data center, our transceivers digitize and aggregate 4 lanes of 100Gps of high-speed data signals coming across the fiber, delivering 400Gbps of data throughput. Our microwave backhaul RF transceiver constitutes the industry’s first single-chip CMOS implementation. It not only has the capability to receive signals spanning an extremely wide 5GHz to 45GHz frequency range, but it is also able to aggregate signals spread over multiple disparate frequency bands to support multi-gigabit-per-second data speeds. As a result, wireless backhaul outdoor units incorporating our solution have the lowest power consumption, smallest form factor, superior performance, and the lowest system cost of any wireless backhaul outdoor unit of which we are aware.


• | Advanced digital signal processing ASIC design and algorithms. Our signal processing algorithm and digital ASIC design expertise is at the core of our ability to employ digital signal processing to enable breakthroughs in CMOS analog RF front-end design and vice-versa. For example, impairments introduced by analog systems such as power amplifiers and photonics devices are canceled using sophisticated digital signal processing algorithms to achieve superior signal quality, reduce power consumption, and improve the speed of operation. Communication systems across a range of our current and future target markets share common signal processing functions, such as efficient error control coding, compensation for transmission medium or channel induced impairments, and digital 

9

processing of wideband signals. So, algorithmic breakthroughs in one application are directly applicable to other product areas.

• | Architecture and system design for highly-integrated end-to-end communication systems on a single-chip. Our novel design techniques tradeoff individual signal path circuit level performance to optimize the overall system performance. Our holistic system level design approach eliminates costly, and power-hungry overdesign of individual circuit elements in the signal path. As a result, we are able to address more complex customer problems that require a deeper understanding of the customer’s end product. Many of our products not only integrate the entire physical layer (PHY), but also implement complete protocol stacks. Examples of these products include our fully integrated single-chip solutions for in-home wireline connectivity, namely G.hn and MoCA solutions. The integration of entire systems on a single-chip reduces the number of external board-level components, decreases board space, improves performance, simplifies customers’ product design, and significantly reduces power consumption.


• | Low-power design methodology. Reduced power consumption is extremely important to our end products and markets. The superior energy efficiency of our products reflects our years of cumulative experience and R&D investment in system architecture, semiconductor device modeling, and integrated circuit design expertise. At extremely high data rates, when electrical signals transit on and off the chip, there is a severe penalty in speed and power consumption. Therefore, significant reduction in power consumption of a device requires minimization of signal transitions between multiple chips. Our ability to achieve the highest levels of integration of all analog/RF and digital signal processing functionality on the same chip minimizes power consumption by eliminating such signal transitions. Our solutions disproportionately impact our end-customer’s product power dissipation, such as in cable modems, cable FDX fiber nodes, 400Gbps optical transceiver modules, and large 5G antenna radio transceiver arrays. Low power dissipation not only simplifies costly thermal design, but also eliminates the need for bulky fans and other cooling aids. This in turn improves end customer product reliability, increases the density of product features that can be supported in a compact footprint, and reduces overall system cost.


• | Embedded systems architecture. Our products contain complex integrated CPU subsystems. These subsystems typically include multiple low-power microprocessor cores, bus and peripherals, memory controllers, and interrupt processing. In addition to signal processing and supervisory activity functions, we also implement multiple layers of real-time embedded firmware and protocol stacks on a single-chip. We believe our expertise and track record of successfully developing widely deployed, reliable embedded protocols for networking applications are essential to the evolution of connected home products of the future. Our firmware design capability is critical to the ease of use of our products in end customer platforms.


• | Scalable Platform. Our products share a highly modular, core radio system and digital signal processing architecture, which enables us to offer fully integrated broadband RF transceiver based digital communication SoC solutions. They meet the stringent performance requirements of a wide variety of end market applications and standards. This contrasts to legacy solutions that require significant customization to conform to the various regional standards, technical performance and product feature requirements. As a result, our customers can minimize their design resources required to develop applications for multiple target markets using our “platform” solutions. In addition, we can deploy our engineering resources more efficiently to both diversify and address larger communications end markets.

Our Strategy
Our objective is to be the leading provider of highly integrated mixed-signal RF transceivers and SoCs for the connected home, wired and wireless infrastructure, and industrial and multi-market applications. In the future, we aim to leverage our core analog and digital signal co-processing competency to expand into other communications markets with similar performance requirements. The key elements of our strategy are:

• | Extend Technology Leadership in RF Transceivers and RF Transceiver + Digital Signal Processing SoCs.

Products
Our products are integrated into a wide range of electronic devices, including cable, terrestrial, and satellite video set-top boxes and gateways, cable DOCSIS data and voice gateways, hybrid analog and digital televisions, smartphones, direct broadcast satellite outdoor units, optical modules for data center, metro, and long-haul transport network applications, RF transceivers and modem solutions for wireless carrier infrastructure applications, wireline connectivity devices for in-home networking applications and last-mile broadband access, and power management and interface products for enterprise networking, infrastructure, industrial, and multi-market applications.
We provide our customers with guidelines, known as reference designs, so that they can efficiently use our products in their product designs. We currently provide the following types of semiconductors:

• | RF Receivers. These semiconductor products combine RF receiver technology that traditionally required multiple external discrete components, such as very high frequency, or VHF, and ultra-high frequency, or UHF, tracking filters, surface acoustic wave, or SAW, filters, intermediate-frequency, or IF, amplifiers, low noise amplifiers and transformers. All of these external components have been either eliminated or integrated into a single semiconductor produced entirely in standard CMOS process technology.


• | RF Receiver SoCs. These semiconductor products combine the functionality of RF receivers, and demodulators in a single chip. In some configurations, these products may incorporate multiple RF receivers and single or multiple demodulators in a single chip to provide application or market specific solutions to customers.


• | Wireless Infrastructure Backhaul RF Receivers and Modem SoC's. These semiconductor products reside in wireless operator system deployments to enable communication between various metro network rings. The RF receiver is capable of receiving and transmitting signals spanning 5-45 GHz and passes the signal to the back-end modem device, which modulates one or more carrier wave signals to encode digital information for transmission and demodulate signals to decode the transmitted information. The increasing amounts of data and video content

being consumed on mobile devices are creating new opportunities for innovative and efficient modem and RF receiver SoCs. 

• | Laser Modulator Drivers. These semiconductor products reside in optical modules and provide a constant current source that delivers exactly the current to the laser diode that it needs to operate for a particular application


• | Transimpedance Amplifiers. These semiconductor products reside in optical modules and provide current-to-voltage conversion, converting the low-level current of a sensor to a voltage.


• | Clock and Data Recovery Circuits. These semiconductor products generate a clock from an approximate frequency reference, and then phase-aligns to the transitions in the data stream with a phase-locked loop, or PLL.


• | Interface solutions. These differentiated bridging connectivity products include USB, ethernet, PCIe, as well as UARTs, and serial transceiver devices which serve data and telecommunications, networking and storage, industrial control and embedded applications and facilitate and optimize the interface between systems and across networks.


• | Power Management. These DC/DC voltage conversion and supervision products are designed to support the needs of various infrastructure, broadband, industrial and embedded system applications, including traditional linear, switching power management solutions and universal PMICs. Our proprietary and patented programmable power technology enables customers to reduce product development cycles, provides a flexible and configurable solution for control of critical attributes of the power management system and enables the system architect to design products that significantly reduce wasted energy.


• | Data encryption and compression. These products offer some of the industry's lowest noise and distortion amplifiers and lowest power consumption high speed analog-to-digital converters, or ADCs. They include instrumentation, low noise, high speed and hybrid amplifiers, as well as high speed ADCs and digital-to-analog converters. Our amplifier and data converter products are designed to meet the needs of various industrial, medical, and video applications.

Customers
We sell our products, directly and indirectly, to original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, module makers and original design manufacturers, or ODMs, and we refer to these as our end customers. By providing a highly integrated reference design solution that our customers can incorporate in their products with minimal modifications, we enable our customers to design cost-effective high-performance SoC-based solutions rapidly. In the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold our products to 286 end customers. A significant portion of our sales to these and other customers are through distributors based in Asia.
A significant portion of our net revenue has historically been generated by a limited number of customers. In the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, ten customers accounted for approximately 58%, 74% and 76% of our net revenue, respectively. In the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, Arris Group, Inc., or Arris, represented 25%, 27% and 28% of our net revenue. Sales to Arris as a percentage of net revenue include sales to Pace, which was acquired by Arris in January 2016, for the year ended December 31, 2016. In the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, Technicolor (which includes Cisco, Inc.'s, or Cisco, former connected devices business), represented 10% and 13% of net revenue, respectively. In 2017, Technicolor represented less than 10% of our net revenue. In November 2015, Technicolor acquired Cisco's connected devices business. The 2015 net revenue percentage did not include 1% for Technicolor.
Products shipped to Asia accounted for 89%, 93% and 91% of our net revenue in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Products shipped to China and Taiwan accounted for 71% and 7%, respectively, of our net revenue in the year ended December 31, 2017. Products shipped to China and Taiwan accounted for 78% and 6%, respectively, of our net revenue in the year ended December 31, 2016. Products shipped to China and Taiwan accounted for 77% and 8%, respectively, of our net revenue in the year ended December 31, 2015. Although a large percentage of our products are shipped to Asia, we believe that a significant number of the systems designed by these customers and incorporating our semiconductor products are then sold outside Asia. For example, we believe revenue generated from sales of our digital terrestrial set-top box products during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 related principally to sales to Asian set-top box manufacturers delivering products into Europe, Middle East, and Africa, or EMEA markets. Similarly, revenue generated from sales of our cable modem products during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 related principally to sales to Asian ODM’s and contract manufacturers delivering products into European and North American markets. To date, all of our sales have been denominated in United States dollars. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements, included in Part IV,
