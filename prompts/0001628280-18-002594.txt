REGULATED ENERGY
Regulated Energy is our largest segment and consists of: (i) our natural gas distribution operations in Delaware, Maryland and Florida; (ii) our electric distribution operations in Florida; and (iii) our natural gas transmission operations on the Delmarva Peninsula and in Florida. All operations in this segment are regulated, as to their rates and service, by the PSC having jurisdiction in each state in which we operate or by the FERC in the case of Eastern Shore. Our natural gas and electric distribution operations are local distribution utilities and generate revenues based on tariff rates approved by the PSC of each state in which we operate. The PSCs have also authorized our utilities to negotiate rates, based on approved methodologies, with customers that have competitive alternatives. Some of our customers in Maryland are, and will continue to be, served with propane through our underground propane distribution system under PSC-approved tariff rates until we complete the conversion of the system and these customers to natural gas. These customers are included in the Delmarva Peninsula natural gas distribution operation's results and customer statistics.
Eastern Shore generates revenues based upon the FERC-approved tariff rates. Eastern Shore is also authorized by the FERC to negotiate rates with its customers above or below the FERC-approved tariff rates. Peninsula Pipeline, our Florida intrastate pipeline subsidiary, is subject to regulation by the Florida PSC and has negotiated contracts with customers, including certain affiliates. Our rates are designed to provide the opportunity to generate revenues to recover all prudently incurred costs and provide a return on our rate base that is sufficient to pay interest on debt and a reasonable return for our stockholders. Each of our utilities has a rate base, which generally consists of the original cost of the utility's plant less related accumulated depreciation, working capital and certain other assets. In certain jurisdictions, the rate base may also include deferred income tax liabilities and other additions or deductions.
The natural gas commodity market for Chesapeake Utilities' Florida Division and FPU’s Indiantown division is deregulated. Accordingly, marketers, rather than a traditional utility, sell natural gas to end-use customers in those jurisdictions. For all of our other local distribution utilities, we have fuel cost recovery mechanisms authorized by the PSCs that allow us to periodically adjust fuel rates to reflect changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas and electricity and to ensure we recover all of the costs prudently incurred in purchasing natural gas and electricity for our customers.

(1) Eastern Shore's service to our local distribution affiliates is based on FERC-approved rates and is an integral component of the cost associated with providing natural gas supplies for those affiliates. We eliminate operating revenues of Eastern Shore against the cost of sales of those affiliates in our consolidated financial information; however, our local distribution affiliates include this amount in their purchased fuel cost and recover it through fuel cost recovery mechanisms.
(2) Operating revenues from "Other" sources are from the rental of gas properties and reserve for rate case refund. 
Peninsula Pipeline contracts with both affiliated and non-affiliated customers to provide firm transportation service. For the year ended December 31, 2017, operating revenues of Peninsula Pipeline were $7.2 million, of which $4.5 million was related to service to our affiliates, FPU and Eight Flags, under contracts which were previously approved by the Florida PSC. Peninsula Pipeline's operating revenues from FPU and Eight Flags are eliminated against the cost of sales in our consolidated financial information; FPU, however, includes this amount in its purchased fuel cost and recovers it through the fuel cost recovery mechanism.
Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2017 Form 10-K Page  4

As of December 31, 2017, our investments in our regulated operations were as follows: $136.5 million for Delmarva Peninsula natural gas distribution; $316.0 million for Florida natural gas and electric distribution; and $250.1 million for natural gas transmission. 
Weather
Revenues from our residential and commercial sales are affected by seasonal variations in weather conditions, which directly influence the volume of natural gas and electricity sold and delivered. Specifically, customer demand substantially increases during the winter months, when natural gas and electricity are used for heating. For electricity, customer demand also increases during the summer months, when electricity is used for cooling. We measure the relative impact of weather by using a degree-day methodology accepted by the utility industry. Degree-day data is used to estimate amounts of energy required to maintain comfortable indoor temperature levels based on each day’s average temperature. Normal heating and cooling degree-days are based on the most recent 10-year average. 
Our Maryland division and Sandpiper's rates include a weather normalization adjustment for residential heating and smaller commercial heating customers. A weather normalization adjustment is a billing adjustment mechanism (or "decoupled" rate mechanism) that is designed to eliminate the effect of deviations from average seasonal temperatures on utility net revenues. Sandpiper received approval from the Maryland PSC to include in its rates a revenue normalization mechanism for residential heating and smaller commercial heating customers in 2016. 
We do not currently have any weather or revenue normalization or “decoupled” rate mechanisms for our other local distribution utilities. 
Regulatory Matters
The following table identifies the key regulatory agencies and highlights the most recent base rate proceeding information for each of our major utilities:

(1) The effective date of the order approving the settlement agreement, which adjusted the rates originally approved on June 4, 2009. 
(2) Eastern Shore filed an uncontested settlement agreement with the FERC in December 2017. FERC approved the settlement agreement by letter order on February 28, 2018. The order will be deemed final upon the expiration of the right to rehearing on March 30, 2018. 
(3) Allowed after-tax return on equity.
(4) The terms of the settlement agreement for the FPU electric division limited proceeding with the Florida PSC prescribed an authorized return on equity range of 9.25 to 11.25 percent, with a mid-point of 10.25 percent. The FPU electric division cannot file for a base rate increase prior to December 2019, unless its allowed return on equity is below the authorized range and it experiences an unanticipated and unforeseen event that impacts the annual revenue requirement in excess of $800,000 within any contiguous four-month period.
(5) The terms of the agreement include revenue neutral rates for the first year, followed by a schedule of rate reductions in subsequent years based upon the projected rate of propane to natural gas conversions.
(6) The table reflects rate increases and rates of return approved prior to the enactment of the TCJA on December 22, 2017. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data (Note 18, Rates and Other Regulatory Activities and Note 11, Income Taxes in the consolidated financial statements) for further discussion on the impact of this legislation on our regulated businesses. 
(7)The Maryland PSC approved a declining return on equity that will result in a decline in our rates.
In addition to the base rates approved by the PSCs, certain of our local distribution utilities have additional surcharge mechanisms that were separately approved by their respective PSC. The most notable surcharge mechanisms include Delaware’s surcharge to increase the 
Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2017 Form 10-K Page  5

availability of natural gas in portions of eastern Sussex County, Delaware; Maryland's surcharge designed to recover the costs associated with conversions to natural gas and to improve infrastructure in Worcester County, Maryland; and Florida’s GRIP surcharge designed to recover capital and other costs, inclusive of an appropriate return on investment, associated with accelerating the replacement of qualifying distribution mains.
TCJA
At the end of December 2017, the United States Congress passed and the President signed into law, the TCJA, which is effective beginning with the 2018 tax year. Among other things, the TCJA substantially reduces the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent, effective January 1, 2018. Each state PSC, with jurisdiction over the areas that we serve, has issued, or is in the process of issuing, requests for information or orders directing utilities to make filings estimating the impacts of the TCJA on their respective costs to serve and to propose how the tax law changes are to be reflected in rates. We will comply with these orders and will make any necessary changes, as directed by the applicable PSC. The FERC has not yet issued any procedural orders on this matter; however, the settlement agreement that we filed with the FERC in December 2017 outlined the procedures and proposed customer rates in the event of tax reform. We believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material impact on our financial position, operating results or cash flows.
See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data (Note 11, Income Taxes, and Note 18, Rates and Other Regulatory Activities, in the consolidated financial statements), for more information.
Competition
Our natural gas and electric distribution operations and our natural gas transmission operations compete with other forms of energy, including oil, propane and renewables. The principal competitive factors are price and, to a lesser extent, accessibility. Our natural gas distribution operations have several large industrial customers that are able to use fuel oil or propane as an alternative to natural gas. When oil or propane prices decline, these interruptible customers may convert to an alternative fuel source to satisfy their fuel requirements, and our sales volumes may decline. To address the uncertainty of alternative fuel prices, we use flexible pricing arrangements on both the supply and sales sides of our business to compete with alternative fuel price fluctuations. 
Large industrial natural gas customers may be able to bypass our distribution and transmission systems and make direct connections with “upstream” interstate transmission pipelines when such connections are economically feasible. Certain large industrial electric customers may be capable of generating electricity for their own consumption. Although the risk of bypassing our systems is not considered significant, we may adjust services and rates for these customers to retain their business in certain situations. 
Supplies, Transmission and Storage
We believe that the availability of supply and transmission of natural gas is adequate under existing arrangements to meet the needs of our customers. 
Our Delaware, Maryland and Sandpiper divisions use their firm transportation resources to meet a significant percentage of their projected demand requirements. They purchase firm natural gas supplies to meet those projected requirements with purchases of base load, daily spot supplies and storage service. They have both firm and interruptible transportation service contracts with four interstate “open access” pipeline companies (Eastern Shore, Transco, Columbia Gas and TETLP) in order to meet customer demand. Their distribution system is directly interconnected with Eastern Shore’s pipeline, which is directly interconnected with the upstream pipelines of Transco, Columbia Gas and TETLP. The following table summarizes the firm transportation agreements for Delaware and Maryland divisions: 

 | | Maximum Daily Firm Transportation Capacity (Dts) | Contract Expiration Date
Division | Counterparty | 
Delaware | Eastern Shore | 72,029 | 2018 - 2028 
 | Columbia Gas | 10,960 | 2019 - 2020 
 | Transco | 21,423 | 2018 - 2028 
 | TETLP | 34,100 | 2027 
Maryland | Eastern Shore | 26,673 | 2018 - 2027 
 | Columbia Gas | 4,200 | 2018 - 2019 
 | Transco | 6,128 | 2018 
 | TETLP | 15,900 | 2027 

Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2017 Form 10-K Page  6

The Delaware and Maryland divisions also have the capability to use propane-air and liquefied natural gas peak-shaving equipment to supplement or displace natural gas purchases. 
Our Delaware and Maryland divisions contract with our natural gas marketing subsidiary, PESCO, through an asset management agreement, to optimize their transportation and storage capacity and secure an adequate supply of natural gas. Pursuant to the three-year asset management agreement, the asset manager pays our divisions a fee, which our divisions share with their customers. 
Sandpiper is a party to a capacity, supply and operating agreement with EGWIC to purchase propane, with a contract ending in May 2019. Sandpiper's current annual commitment is estimated at approximately 2.7 million gallons. Sandpiper has the option to enter into either a fixed per-gallon price for some or all of the propane purchases or a market-based price utilizing one of two local propane pricing indices. Sandpiper also has 1,950 Dts of maximum daily firm transportation capacity available from Eastern Shore through contracts expiring on various dates between 2018 and 2027. 
The following table summarizes the firm transportation agreements for our Florida Division and FPU: 

 | | Maximum Daily Firm Transportation Capacity (Dts) | Contract Expiration Date
Division | Counterparty | 
Florida Division | Gulfstream (1) | 10,000 | 2022 
FPU | FGT | 41,909 - 73,317 | 2020 - 2041 
 | Peninsula Pipeline | 25,000 - 32,000 | 2033 - 2038 
 | Peoples Gas System | 2,660 | 2024 - 2035 
 | Florida City Gas | 300 | 2032 

(1) Pursuant to a capacity release program approved by the Florida PSC, all of the capacity under this agreement has been released to various third parties, including PESCO. Under the terms of these capacity release agreements, Chesapeake Utilities is contingently liable to Gulfstream should any party, that acquired the capacity through release, fail to pay the capacity charge. 
FPU uses gas marketers and producers to procure all of its gas supplies to meet projected requirements. FPU also uses Peoples Gas to provide wholesale gas sales service in areas far from FPU's interconnections with FGT. 
Eastern Shore has three agreements with Transco for a total of 7,292 Dts/d of firm daily storage injection and withdrawal entitlements and total storage capacity of 288,003 Dts. These agreements expire on various dates between 2018 and 2023. Eastern Shore retains these firm storage services in order to provide swing transportation service and firm storage service to customers requesting such services. 
During 2017, FPU purchased wholesale electricity primarily from three main suppliers: JEA, Gulf Power and Eight Flags. As of January 2018, FPU purchases its wholesale electricity primarily from Gulf Power, FPL and Eight Flags. The following table summarizes the supply contracts for FPU:

Counterparty | Contracted Amount (MW) | Contract Expiration Date
Gulf Power | Full Requirement | 2019 
FPL | Full Requirement | 2024 
Eight Flags | 21 | 2036 
Rayonier | 1.7 to 3.0 | 2036 
WestRock Company | As-available | N/A 

The Gulf Power contract provides generation and transmission service to the Northwest Florida service territory. The FPL contract provides generation and transmission service to the Northeast Florida service territory. The electricity purchased from Eight Flags, Rayonier and WestRock Company serves a portion of FPU's electric distribution customers' base load in Northeast Florida.
UNREGULATED ENERGY
Our Unregulated Energy segment provides: (i) propane distribution; (ii) natural gas marketing; (iii) unregulated natural gas supply, gathering and processing; (iv) electricity and steam generation; and (v) other unregulated energy-related services to customers. Revenues generated from this segment are not subject to any federal, state or local pricing regulations. Our businesses in this segment typically complement our regulated energy businesses based on the products and services they sell.
Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2017 Form 10-K Page  7

Propane Distribution 
Our propane distribution operations sell propane to residential, commercial/industrial, and wholesale customers, including AutoGas customers, in Delmarva and southeastern Pennsylvania, through Sharp and Sharpgas, and in Florida through FPU and Flo-gas. Many of our propane distribution customers are “bulk delivery” customers. We make deliveries of propane to the bulk delivery customers as needed, based on the level of propane remaining in the tank located at the customer’s premises. We invoice and record revenues for our bulk delivery service customers at the time of delivery, rather than upon customers’ actual usage, since the customers typically own the propane gas in the tanks on their premises. We also have underground propane distribution systems serving various neighborhoods and communities. Such customers are billed monthly based on actual consumption, which is measured by meters installed on their premises. In Florida, we also offer metered propane distribution service to residential and commercial customers. We read the meters on such customers' tanks and bill customers monthly. As a member of AutoGas, Sharp and AutoGas install and support propane vehicle conversion systems for vehicle fleets. Sharp continues to convert fleets to bi-fuel propane-powered engines and provides onsite fueling infrastructure.

Propane Distribution - Competition
We compete with several other propane distributors in our geographic markets, primarily on the basis of price and service. Our competitors generally include local outlets of national distributors and local independent distributors, whose proximity to customers entails lower costs to provide service. As an energy source, propane competes with home heating oil and electricity, which are typically more expensive (based on equivalent unit of heat value). Since natural gas has historically been less expensive than propane, propane is generally not utilized for home heating in geographic areas served by natural gas pipelines or distribution systems.
Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2017 Form 10-K Page  8

Propane Distribution - Supplies, Transportation and Storage
We purchase propane for our propane distribution operations primarily from suppliers, including major oil companies, and independent producers of natural gas liquids. Although supplies of propane from these and other sources are generally readily available for purchase, extreme market conditions, such as significant fluctuations in weather, closing of refineries and disruption in supply chains, could result in a reduction in available supplies.
Propane is transported by trucks and railroad cars from refineries, natural gas processing plants or pipeline terminals to bulk propane storage facilities that we own in Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida. These bulk storage facilities have an aggregate capacity of approximately 6.8 million gallons. We then deliver propane from these storage facilities by truck to tanks located on our customers’ premises.
Propane Distribution Weather
Revenues from our propane distribution sales activities are affected by seasonal variations in temperature and weather conditions. Weather conditions and their severity directly influence the volume of propane used by our metered customers or sold and delivered to our bulk customers, with demand increasing substantially during the winter months when propane is used for heating. Sustained warmer-than-normal temperatures will tend to reduce propane use, while sustained colder-than-normal temperatures will tend to increase consumption.
Propane and Crude Oil Wholesale Marketing 
Prior to its wind down in the second quarter of 2017, Xeron traded in short-term natural gas liquids and crude oil forward and futures contracts on the InterContinentalExchange, Inc. Xeron settled its purchases and sales financially, without taking physical delivery of the propane or crude oil. 
Natural Gas Marketing
We provide natural gas supply and supply management services through PESCO to residential, commercial, industrial and wholesale customers. PESCO operates primarily in the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic and Appalachian Basin regions. The following table summarizes PESCO's operating revenues by region in 2017:

 | Operating Revenues (in thousands) | | % of Total
Southeast | $ | 59,269 | | | 32 | %
Mid-Atlantic | 87,241 | | | 47 | % 
Appalachian Basin | 38,009 | | | 21 | % 
 | $ | 184,519 | | | 100 | %

PESCO competes with regulated utilities and other unregulated third-party marketers to sell natural gas supplies directly to commercial and industrial customers through competitively-priced contracts. PESCO does not currently own or operate any natural gas transmission or distribution assets. The gas that PESCO sells is delivered to retail or wholesale customers through affiliated and non-affiliated local distribution company systems and transmission pipelines. PESCO bills its customers directly or through the billing services of the regulated utilities that deliver the gas. In August 2017, PESCO acquired certain natural gas marketing assets of ARM. The acquired assets complement PESCO’s current asset portfolio and expand our regional footprint and retail demand in a market where we have existing pipeline capacity and wholesale liquidity.
In 2017, PESCO entered into asset management agreements with our Delmarva Peninsula natural gas distribution operations to manage a portion of their natural gas transportation and storage capacity, which agreements were approved by the Delaware PSC with respect to our Delaware Division.
