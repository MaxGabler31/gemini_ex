Engineered Bearings:
The Timken® bearing portfolio features a broad range of engineered bearing products, including tapered, spherical and cylindrical roller bearings; spherical plain bearings and rod end bearings; thrust and specialty ball bearings; and housed bearings. Timken is a leading authority on tapered roller bearings, and leverages its position by applying engineering know-how and technology across its entire bearing portfolio.
A bearing is a mechanical device that reduces friction between moving parts. The purpose of a bearing is to carry a load while allowing a machine shaft to rotate freely. The basic elements of the bearing generally include two rings, called races; a set of rolling elements that rotate around the bearing raceway; and a cage to separate and guide the rolling elements. Bearings come in a number of designs, featuring tapered, spherical, cylindrical or ball rolling elements. The various bearing designs accommodate radial and/or thrust loads differently, making certain bearing types better suited for specific applications. 
Selection and development of bearings for customer applications and demand for high reliability require sophisticated engineering and analytical techniques. High precision tolerances, proprietary internal geometries and quality materials provide Timken bearings with high load-carrying capacity, excellent friction-reducing qualities and long service lives. The uses for bearings are diverse and can be found in transportation applications that include premium passenger cars and trucks, heavy trucks, helicopters, airplanes and trains. Ranging in size from precision bearings the size of a pencil eraser to more than roughly three meters in diameter, Timken components are also used in a wide variety of industrial applications, including: paper and steel mills, mining, oil and gas extraction and production, agriculture, construction, machine tools, gear drives, health and positioning control, wind turbines and food and beverage processing.

Services accounted for approximately 4% of the Company’s net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Sales and Distribution:
Timken products are sold principally by its internal sales organizations. A portion of each segment's sales are made through authorized distributors. 
Customer collaboration is central to the Company's sales strategy. Therefore, Timken goes where our customers need us, with sales engineers primarily working in close proximity to customers rather than at production sites. The Company's sales force continuously updates the team's training and knowledge regarding all friction management products and market sector trends, and Timken employees assist customers during development and implementation phases and provide ongoing service and support.
The Company has a joint venture in North America focused on joint logistics and e-business services. This joint venture, CoLinx, LLC, includes five equity members: Timken, SKF Group, Schaeffler Group, RBC Bearings and Gates Industrial Corp. The e-business service focuses on information and business services for authorized distributors in the Process Industries segment.
Timken has entered into individually negotiated contracts with some of its customers. These contracts may extend for one or more years and, if a price is fixed for any period extending beyond current shipments, customarily include a commitment by the customer to purchase a designated percentage of its requirements from Timken. Timken does not believe that there is any significant loss of earnings risk associated with any given contract.
Competition:
The bearing industry and the industries into which Timken sells its power transmission products are highly competitive. Timken primarily competes based on total value, including price, quality, timeliness of delivery, product design and the ability to provide engineering support and service on a global basis. The Company competes with many domestic and foreign manufacturers of anti-friction bearings, including SKF Group, Schaeffler Group, NTN Corporation, JTEKT Corporation and NSK Ltd., and with a diverse group of domestic and foreign manufacturers of power transmission products.
Joint Ventures:
Investments in affiliated companies accounted for under the equity method were $3.7 million and $2.1 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The investment balance at December 31, 2021 was reported in other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
Backlog:
The following table provides the backlog of orders for the Company's domestic and overseas operations at December 31, 2021 and 2020: 

 | December 31,
(Dollars in millions) | 2021 | 2020 
Segment: | | 
Mobile Industries | $ | 1,354.9 | | $ | 1,012.6
Process Industries | 1,095.0 | | 1,016.2 | 
Total Company | $ | 2,449.9 | | $ | 2,028.8

Approximately 96% of the Company’s backlog at December 31, 2021 is scheduled for delivery in the succeeding 12 months. Actual shipments depend upon customers' ever-changing production schedules. Accordingly, Timken does not believe that its backlog data and comparisons thereof, as of different dates, reliably indicate future sales or shipments.
Raw Materials:
The principal raw materials used by the Company to make engineered bearings are special bar quality ("SBQ") steel and steel components. SBQ steel and steel components are produced around the world by various suppliers. SBQ steel is purchased in bar, tube and wire forms, while steel components are commonly purchased as forgings, semi-finished or finished components. The availability and price of SBQ steel are subject to changes in supply and demand, commodity prices for ferrous scrap, ore, alloy, electricity, natural gas, transportation fuel, and labor costs. The Company manages price variability of commodities by using surcharge mechanisms on some of its contracts with its customers that provides for partial recovery of these cost increases in the price of bearing products.
The availability of bearing-quality tubing is relatively limited, and the Company has taken steps to limit its exposure to this particular form of SBQ steel. Overall, the Company believes that the number of suppliers of SBQ steel is adequate to support the needs of global bearing production, and, in general, the Company is not dependent on any single source of supply.
Research:
Timken operates a network of technology and engineering centers to support its global customers with sites in North America, Europe and Asia. This network develops and delivers innovative friction management and power transmission solutions and technical services. Timken's largest technical center is located at the Company's world headquarters in North Canton, Ohio. Other smaller sites in the United States ("U.S.") include Los Alamitos, California; Manchester, Connecticut; Downer's Grove, Fulton and Montgomery, Illinois; Indianapolis, Indiana; Norton Shores, Rochester Hills and Traverse City, Michigan; Springfield, Missouri; Keene and Lebanon, New Hampshire; and King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. Within Europe, the Company has technology facilities in Plymouth, England; Colmar, France; Pegnitz and Werdohl, Germany; Valmadrera, Italy; Gorinchem, Netherlands; and Ploiesti, Romania. In Asia, Timken operates technology and engineering facilities in Bangalore, India and Shanghai, China.
Compliance with Governmental Regulations:
Environmental Matters
The Company continues its efforts to protect the environment and comply with environmental protection laws. Additionally, it has invested in pollution control equipment and updated plant operational practices. The Company's manufacturing plants are expected to have an effective environmental management system which follows the ISO 14001 principles and internal audits are performed against this standard. Where appropriate to meet or exceed customer requirements, we are certified under the formal ISO 14001 certification process. As of the end of 2021, 21 of the Company’s plants had obtained ISO 14001 certification, including the majority of the Company's bearing manufacturing plants.
The Company establishes appropriate levels of reserves to cover its environmental expenses and has a well-established environmental compliance audit program for its domestic and international units. This program measures performance against applicable laws, as well as against internal standards that have been established for all units worldwide. It is difficult to assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements that differ from existing requirements.
The Company and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries previously have been and could in the future be identified as potentially responsible parties for investigation and remediation at off-site disposal or recycling facilities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), known as the Superfund, or state laws similar to CERCLA. In general, such claims for investigation and remediation also have been asserted against numerous other entities.
Management believes any ultimate liability with respect to pending actions will not materially affect the Company’s annual results of operations, cash flows or consolidated financial position. The Company also is conducting environmental investigation and/or remediation activities at certain current or former operating sites. The costs of such investigation and remediation activities, in the aggregate, are not expected to be material to the operations or financial position of the Company.
New laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements may require Timken to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a materially adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations
Other Regulations
Because of its global operations, the Company is subject to a wide variety of domestic and foreign laws and regulations, including securities laws, tax laws, employment and pension-related laws, competition laws, U.S. and foreign export and trade laws, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, government procurement regulations and laws governing improper business practices. The Company has policies and procedures in place to promote compliance with these laws and regulations and management believes any ultimate liability with respect to pending actions will not materially affect the Company’s annual results of operations, cash flows or consolidated financial position. In the future, the Company may be subject to both new laws and regulations, and changes to existing laws and regulations which may continue to evolve through interpretations by courts and regulators. Accordingly, it is difficult to assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements that differ from existing requirements. Such changes may require the Company to incur costs and such changes could form the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. Refer to Item 1.A Risk Factors – Risks Related to Legal, Compliance and Regulatory Matters for further discussion.
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses:
Timken owns numerous U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks and licenses relating to certain products. While Timken regards these as important, it does not deem its business as a whole, or any industry segment, to be materially dependent upon any one item or group of items.
Employment:
At December 31, 2021, Timken had more than 18,000 employees worldwide. Approximately 8% of Timken’s U.S. employees are covered under collective bargaining agreements.
Human Capital:
The Company believes that its associates and their collective knowledge are its most valuable resource. As a result, the Company is committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment, attracting, motivating and retaining the best talent in the industry and providing opportunities for its associates to learn and advance their career with the Company.
Associate Health and Safety
In 2021, the Coronavirus ("COVID-19") pandemic continued to present unique challenges with respect to protecting associate health and safety globally. Associate health and safety continues to be a top priority for the Company and its commitment to safety starts at the top of the organization. Chief Executive Officer, Richard Kyle, was the first-ever chair of the Company's Environmental Health and Safety Steering Committee, which was created in 2009 and continues to drive accountability and responsibility for safety throughout the organization. 
The Company's commitment to the health and safety of its associates is evidenced by its strong safety results in 2020 and 2021 shown in the charts below:
*Rates calculated as (number of injuries and illnesses x 200,000) / employee hours worked. 2021 rates represent the Company's best estimate at the date of this report 
- - - represents the 2020 average (mean) for U.S. metal manufacturers (North American Industry Classification System ("NAICS") code 332) that employ at least 1,000 employees, based on information provided by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics at https://www.bls.gov/iif/.
The Company aims to maintain a recordable rate within the top quartile of U.S. metal manufacturers (NAICS code 332) based on information provided by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and it met that target in 2020 with its 2020 recordable rate of 0.92 representing record performance for the Company. In 2021, the Company's recordable rate of 1.20 remained strong though industry data for 2021 was not available at the time of this report. In addition, the Company produced solid lost time accident rates of 0.32 in 2020 and 0.38 in 2021, respectively.
Attracting, Retaining, and Motivating Highly Qualified Associates

As such, the Company believes it is important to reward associates with competitive wages and comprehensive benefits to recognize professional excellence and career progression. The Company also believes it is important to provide pay and benefits that is competitive and equitable based on the local markets in which it operates. 
In addition, the Company also believes that having open, honest dialogue with its associates is key to evolving its culture and keeping the Company strong. In line with that approach, the Company conducts comprehensive surveys on a periodic basis to measure employee engagement. The Company also deploys regular pulse surveys to gain insights from associates’ recent experiences and to better understand how effectively it is engaging, energizing and enabling its workforce.
The Company also provides several professional development and training opportunities to advance our associates’ skills and expertise. Some of these opportunities include online-learning platforms, job-specific training, our operations development program and our educational reimbursement programs. The Company has recruited and trained many of its associates through its engineering co-op program, where engineering students have the opportunity to work up to five semesters alongside the Company’s experienced engineers while they complete their bachelor’s degrees. To better inform its hiring and associate development efforts, the Company has partnered with third-party vendors to provide required training for its managers focused on diversity and inclusion. 
To further the Company's goal of inclusiveness, Timken associate resource groups (“ARGs”) around the world help us understand and address the challenges faced by our diverse workforce and the opportunities diversity offers in advancing our collective knowledge. Since 2009, our associates have driven the expansion of regional chapters across three primary ARGs: Women’s International Network (WIN), Multicultural Association of Professionals (MAP), and Young Professionals Network (YPN).
