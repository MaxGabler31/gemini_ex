Introduction
 
Coca‑Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated, a Delaware corporation (together with its majority-owned subsidiaries, the “Company,” “CCBCC,” “we,” “our” or “us”), distributes, markets and manufactures nonalcoholic beverages in territories spanning 14 states and the District of Columbia. The Company was incorporated in 1980 and, together with its predecessors, has been in the nonalcoholic beverage manufacturing and distribution business since 1902. We are the largest independent Coca‑Cola bottler in the United States. Approximately 93% of our total bottle/can sales volume to retail customers consists of products of The Coca‑Cola Company, which include some of the most recognized and popular beverage brands in the world. We also distribute products for several other beverage brands including Dr Pepper, Sundrop and Monster Energy. Our purpose is to honor God, to serve others, to pursue excellence and to grow profitably. Our stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “COKE.”
Ownership
 
As of December 31, 2017, The Coca‑Cola Company owned approximately 35% of the Company’s total outstanding Common Stock, representing approximately 5% of the total voting power of the Company’s Common Stock and Class B Common Stock voting together. As long as The Coca‑Cola Company holds the number of shares of Common Stock it currently owns, it has the right to have a designee proposed by the Company for nomination to the Company’s Board of Directors. J. Frank Harrison, III, the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and trustees of certain trusts established for the benefit of certain relatives of J. Frank Harrison, Jr. have agreed to vote the shares of the Company’s Class B Common Stock which they control, representing approximately 86% of the total voting power of the Company’s Common Stock and Class B Common Stock voting together, in favor of such designee. The Coca‑Cola Company does not own any shares of the Company’s Class B Common Stock.
Beverage Products
 
We offer a range of nonalcoholic beverage products and flavors designed to meet the demands of our consumers, including both sparkling and still beverages. Sparkling beverages are carbonated beverages and the Company’s principal sparkling beverage is Coca‑Cola. Still beverages include energy products and noncarbonated beverages such as bottled water, tea, ready to drink coffee, enhanced water, juices and sports drinks. 
 
Our sales are divided into two main categories: (i) bottle/can sales and (ii) other sales. Bottle/can sales include products packaged primarily in plastic bottles and aluminum cans. Other sales include sales to other Coca‑Cola bottlers and “post-mix” products. Post-mix products are dispensed through equipment that mixes fountain syrups with carbonated or still water, enabling fountain retailers to sell finished products to consumers in cups or glasses.
 
Bottle/can sales represented approximately 84%, 84% and 82% of total net sales for fiscal 2017 (“2017”), fiscal 2016 (“2016”) and fiscal 2015 (“2015”), respectively. The sparkling beverage category represented approximately 63%, 66% and 70% of total bottle/can sales during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

System Transformation
 
We recently concluded a series of transactions with The Coca‑Cola Company and Coca‑Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. (“CCR”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Coca‑Cola Company, which were initiated in April 2013 as part of The Coca‑Cola Company’s multi-year refranchising of its North American bottling territories (the “System Transformation”). Through several asset purchase and asset exchange transactions with The Coca‑Cola Company, CCR and Coca‑Cola Bottling Company United, Inc. (“United”), an independent bottler that is unrelated to the Company, we significantly expanded our distribution and manufacturing operations through the acquisition and exchange of distribution territories and regional manufacturing facilities.
 
Following the completion of the System Transformation, we are party to several key agreements that (i) provide us with rights to distribute, market and manufacture beverage products and (ii) coordinate our role in the North American Coca‑Cola system. The following sections summarize certain of these key agreements.
 
Beverage Distribution and Manufacturing Agreements
 
We have rights to distribute, promote, market and sell certain nonalcoholic beverages of The Coca‑Cola Company pursuant to a comprehensive beverage agreement with The Coca‑Cola Company and CCR. We also have rights to manufacture, produce and package certain beverages bearing trademarks of The Coca‑Cola Company pursuant to a regional manufacturing agreement with The Coca‑Cola Company. These agreements, which are the principal agreements we have with The Coca‑Cola Company and its affiliates following completion of the System Transformation, are described below under the headings “Distribution Agreement with The Coca‑Cola Company and CCR” and “Manufacturing Agreement with The Coca‑Cola Company.”
 
In addition to our agreements with The Coca‑Cola Company and CCR, we also have rights to distribute certain beverage brands owned by other beverage companies, including Dr Pepper and Monster Energy, pursuant to agreements with such other beverage companies. These agreements are described below under the heading “Distribution Agreements with Other Beverage Companies.”
 
Distribution Agreement with The Coca‑Cola Company and CCR
 
We have exclusive rights to distribute, promote, market and sell certain beverages and beverage products of The Coca‑Cola Company in certain territories pursuant to a comprehensive beverage agreement with The Coca‑Cola Company and CCR entered into on March 31, 2017 (as amended, the “CBA”), in exchange for which we are required to make quarterly sub-bottling payments to CCR. The amount of these payments is based on gross profit derived from our sales of beverages and beverage products of The Coca‑Cola Company as well as certain cross-licensed beverage brands not owned or licensed by The Coca‑Cola Company. These sub-bottling payments to CCR are for the territories we acquired in the System Transformation, and are not applicable to those territories we served prior to the System Transformation or to those territories we acquired in an exchange transaction. Since March 31, 2017, we entered into a series of amendments to the CBA with The Coca‑Cola Company and CCR to add or remove, as applicable, all territories we acquired or exchanged after that date in the System Transformation.
 
5


As of December 31, 2017, the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration related to future sub-bottling payments was $381.3 million. Each quarter, we adjust the liability to fair value to reflect the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration related to future sub-bottling payments. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
 
The CBA contains provisions that apply in the event of a potential sale of our company or our aggregate businesses related to the distribution, promotion, marketing and sale of beverages and beverage products of The Coca‑Cola Company. Pursuant to the CBA, we may only sell our distribution business to either The Coca‑Cola Company or third-party buyers approved by The Coca‑Cola Company. We may obtain a list of approved third-party buyers from The Coca‑Cola Company on an annual basis or can seek The Coca‑Cola Company’s approval of a potential buyer upon receipt of a third-party offer to purchase our distribution business. If we wish to sell our distribution business to The Coca‑Cola Company and are unable to agree with The Coca‑Cola Company on the terms of a binding purchase and sale agreement, including the purchase price for our distribution business, the CBA provides that we may either withdraw from negotiations or initiate a third-party valuation process to determine the purchase price and, upon this determination, opt to continue with our potential sale to The Coca‑Cola Company. If we elect to continue with our potential sale, The Coca‑Cola Company will then have the option to (i) purchase our distribution business at the purchase price determined by the third-party valuation process and pursuant to the sale terms set forth in the CBA (including, to the extent not otherwise agreed to by us and The Coca‑Cola Company, default non-price terms and conditions of the acquisition agreement), or (ii) elect not to purchase our distribution business, in which case the CBA will be automatically amended to, among other things, permit us to sell our distribution business to any third party without obtaining The Coca‑Cola Company’s prior approval.
 
The CBA further provides:
 
 
• | the right of The Coca‑Cola Company to terminate the CBA in the event of an uncured default by us, in which case The Coca‑Cola Company (or its designee) is required to acquire our distribution business;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the requirement that we maintain an annual equivalent case volume per capita change rate that is not less than one standard deviation below the median of the rates for all U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers for the same period; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the requirement that we make minimum, ongoing capital expenditures in our distribution business at a specified level.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The CBA prohibits us from producing, manufacturing, preparing, packaging, distributing, selling, dealing in or otherwise using or handling any beverages, beverage components or other beverage products (i) other than the beverages and beverage products of The Coca‑Cola Company and expressly permitted cross-licensed brands, and (ii) unless otherwise consented to by The Coca‑Cola Company. The CBA has a term of ten years and is renewable by us indefinitely for successive additional terms of ten years, unless earlier terminated as provided therein.
 
As part of the System Transformation, on March 31, 2017, each of our then-existing bottling agreements for The Coca‑Cola Company beverage brands was automatically amended, restated and converted into the CBA (the “Bottling Agreement Conversion”), pursuant to a territory conversion agreement we entered into with The Coca‑Cola Company and CCR on September 23, 2015 (as amended, the “Territory Conversion Agreement”). The Bottling Agreement Conversion included, subject to certain limited exceptions, all of our then-existing comprehensive beverage agreements, master bottle contracts, allied bottle contracts and other bottling agreements with The Coca‑Cola Company or CCR that authorized us to produce and/or distribute beverages and beverage products of The Coca‑Cola Company in all territories where we (or one of our affiliates) had rights to market, promote, distribute and sell beverage products owned or licensed by The Coca‑Cola Company.
 
In connection with the Bottling Agreement Conversion, each then-existing bottling agreement for The Coca‑Cola Company beverage brands between The Coca‑Cola Company and certain of our subsidiaries, including Piedmont Coca‑Cola Bottling Partnership, a partnership formed by us and The Coca‑Cola Company (“Piedmont”), was also amended, restated and converted into a comprehensive beverage agreement with The Coca‑Cola Company, pursuant to which the subsidiary was granted certain exclusive rights to distribute, promote, market and sell certain beverages and beverage products of The Coca‑Cola Company in certain territories. These comprehensive beverage agreements are substantially similar to the CBA and, as with the treatment of the territories served by the Company prior to the System Transformation under the CBA, do not require our subsidiaries to make quarterly sub-bottling payments to CCR.
 
Manufacturing Agreement with The Coca‑Cola Company
 
We have rights to manufacture, produce and package certain beverages and beverage products of The Coca‑Cola Company at our manufacturing facilities pursuant to a regional manufacturing agreement with The Coca‑Cola Company entered into on March 31, 2017 (as amended, the “RMA”). These beverages may be distributed by us for our own account in accordance with the CBA, or may be sold by us to certain other U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers and to the Coca‑Cola North America division of The Coca‑Cola Company (“CCNA”) in accordance with the RMA. Pursuant to the RMA, the prices, or certain elements of the formulas used to determine the prices, that the Company charges for these sales to CCNA or other U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers are unilaterally established by CCNA from 
 6


time to time. Since March 31, 2017, we entered into a series of amendments to the RMA with The Coca‑Cola Company to add or remove, as applicable, all regional manufacturing facilities we acquired or exchanged after that date in the System Transformation.
 
Under the RMA, our aggregate business primarily related to the manufacture of certain beverages and beverage products of The Coca‑Cola Company and permitted third-party beverage products are subject to the same agreed upon sale process provisions in the CBA, including the obligation to obtain The Coca‑Cola Company’s prior approval of a potential purchaser of our manufacturing business and provisions for the sale of such business to The Coca‑Cola Company. The RMA requires that we make minimum, ongoing capital expenditures in our manufacturing business at a specified level. The Coca‑Cola Company has the right to terminate the RMA in the event of an uncured default by us under the CBA or in the event of an uncured breach of our material obligations under the RMA or the NPSG Governance Agreement (as defined below).
 
The RMA prohibits us from manufacturing any beverages, beverage components or other beverage products (i) other than the beverages and beverage products of The Coca‑Cola Company and certain expressly permitted cross‑licensed brands, and (ii) unless otherwise consented to by The Coca‑Cola Company. Subject to The Coca‑Cola Company’s termination rights, the RMA has a term that continues for the duration of the term of the CBA.
 
As part of the System Transformation and concurrent with the Bottling Agreement Conversion, on March 31, 2017, each of our then-existing manufacturing agreements with The Coca‑Cola Company were amended, restated and converted into the RMA.
 
Finished Goods Supply Arrangements
 
We have finished goods supply arrangements with other U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers to buy and sell finished products produced under trademarks owned by The Coca‑Cola Company in accordance with the RMA, pursuant to which the prices, or certain elements of the formulas used to determine the prices, for such finished products are unilaterally established by CCNA from time to time. In most instances, the Company’s ability to negotiate the prices at which it purchases finished goods bearing trademarks owned by The Coca‑Cola Company from, and the prices at which it sells such finished goods to, other U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers is limited pursuant to these pricing provisions, which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s profitability.
Distribution Agreements with Other Beverage Companies
 
In addition to our distribution and manufacturing agreements with The Coca‑Cola Company, we also have distribution agreements with other beverage companies, including Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. (“Dr Pepper Snapple”) and Monster Energy Corporation (“Monster Energy”).
 
Our distribution agreements with Dr Pepper Snapple permit us to distribute Dr Pepper and/or Sundrop beverage brands, as well as certain post-mix products of Dr Pepper Snapple, and our distribution agreement with Monster Energy grants us the rights to distribute energy drink products offered, packaged and/or marketed by Monster Energy under the primary brand name “Monster.”
 
Under our distribution agreements with other beverage companies, the price for syrup or concentrate is set by the beverage company from time to time. Similar to the CBA, these beverage agreements contain restrictions on the use of trademarks, approved bottles, cans and labels and sale of imitations or substitutes, as well as termination for cause provisions. The territories covered by beverage agreements with other beverage companies are not always aligned with the territories covered by the CBA, but are generally within those territory boundaries.
 
Sales of beverages under these agreements with other beverage companies represented approximately 7%, 10% and 13% of our bottle/can sales volume to retail customers for each of 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
Other Agreements related to the Coca‑Cola System
 
As part of the System Transformation process, we entered into agreements with The Coca‑Cola Company, CCR and other Coca‑Cola bottlers regarding product supply, information technology services and other aspects of the North American Coca‑Cola system, as described below. Many of these agreements involve new system governance structures providing for greater participation and involvement by bottlers which require increased demands on Company’s management and more collaboration and alignment by the participating bottlers in order to successfully implement Coca‑Cola system plans and strategies. We believe these system governance initiatives will benefit the Company and the Coca‑Cola system, but the failure of these mechanisms to function efficiently could impair our ability to realize their intended benefits.

Incidence-Based Pricing Agreement with The Coca‑Cola Company
 
The Company has an incidence-based pricing agreement with The Coca‑Cola Company, which establishes the prices charged by The Coca‑Cola Company to the Company for (i) concentrates of sparkling and certain still beverages produced by the Company and (ii) certain purchased still beverages. Under the incidence-based pricing agreement with The Coca‑Cola Company, the prices charged by The Coca‑Cola Company are impacted by a number of factors, including the incidence rate in effect, our pricing and sales of finished products, the channels in which the finished products are sold and package mix. The Coca‑Cola Company has no rights under the incidence-based pricing agreement to establish the resale prices at which we sell its products, but does have rights to establish pricing under other agreements, including the RMA.
 
National Product Supply Governance Agreement
 
We are a member of a national product supply group (the “NPSG”), comprised of The Coca‑Cola Company and other Coca‑Cola bottlers who are regional producing bottlers (“RPBs”) in The Coca‑Cola Company’s national product supply system, pursuant to a national product supply governance agreement executed in October 2015 with The Coca‑Cola Company and other RPBs (the “NPSG Governance Agreement”). The stated objectives of the NPSG include, among others, (i) Coca‑Cola system strategic infrastructure investment and divestment planning; (ii) network optimization of all plant to distribution center sourcing; and (iii) new product/packaging infrastructure planning.
 
Under the NPSG Governance Agreement, the NPSG members established certain governance mechanisms, including a governing board (the “NPSG Board”) comprised of a representative of (i) the Company, (ii) The Coca‑Cola Company and (iii) each other RPB. As of December 31, 2017, the NPSG Board consisted of The Coca‑Cola Company, the Company and seven other RPBs. The NPSG Board makes and/or oversees and directs certain key decisions regarding the NPSG, including decisions regarding the management and staffing of the NPSG and the funding for its ongoing operations. Pursuant to the decisions of the NPSG Board made from time to time and subject to the terms and conditions of the NPSG Governance Agreement, each RPB is required to make investments in its respective manufacturing assets and implement Coca‑Cola system strategic investment opportunities consistent with the NPSG Governance Agreement. We are also obligated to pay a certain portion of the costs of operating the NPSG.
 
CONA Services LLC
 
We are a member of CONA Services LLC (“CONA”), an entity formed with The Coca‑Cola Company and certain other Coca‑Cola bottlers pursuant to a limited liability company agreement executed in January 2016 (as amended, the “CONA LLC Agreement”) to provide business process and information technology services to its members. 
 
Under the CONA LLC Agreement, the business and affairs of CONA are managed by a board of directors comprised of representatives of its members (the “CONA Board”). All directors are entitled to one vote, regardless of the percentage interest in CONA held by each member. We currently have the right to designate one of the members of the CONA Board and have a percentage interest in CONA of approximately 20%. Most matters to be decided by the CONA Board require approval by a majority of a quorum of the directors, provided that the approval of 80% of the directors is required to, among other things, require members to make additional capital contributions, approve CONA’s annual operating and capital budgets, and approve capital expenditures in excess of certain agreed upon amounts. 
 
Each CONA member is required to make capital contributions to CONA if and when approved by the CONA Board. No CONA member may transfer its membership interest (or any portion thereof) except to a purchaser of the member’s bottling business (or any portion thereof) and as permitted under the member’s comprehensive beverage agreement with The Coca‑Cola Company.
 
The CONA LLC Agreement further provides that, if CCR grants any major North American Coca‑Cola bottler other than a CONA member rights to (i) manufacture, produce and package or (ii) market, promote, distribute and sell Coca‑Cola products, CCR will require the bottler to become a CONA member, to implement the CONA System in the bottler’s operations and to enter into a master services agreement with CONA.
 
We also are party to an amended and restated master services agreement with CONA (the “CONA MSA”), pursuant to which CONA agreed to make available, and we became authorized to use, the Coke One North America system (the “CONA System”), a uniform information technology system developed to promote operational efficiency and uniformity among North American Coca‑Cola bottlers. As part of making the CONA System available to us, CONA provides us with certain business process and information technology services, including the planning, development, management and operation of the CONA System in connection with our direct store delivery and manufacture of products (collectively, the “CONA Services”). We are also authorized under the CONA MSA to use the CONA System in connection with our distribution, promotion, marketing, sale and manufacture of beverages we are authorized to distribute or manufacture under the CBA, the RMA or any other agreement with The Coca‑Cola Company, subject to the 
 8


provisions of the CONA LLC Agreement and any licenses or other agreements relating to products or services provided by third parties and used in connection with the CONA System.
 
In exchange for our rights to use the CONA System and receive the CONA Services under the CONA MSA, we are charged service fees by CONA based on the number of physical cases of beverages we distributed or manufactured during the applicable period in the portion of our territories where the CONA Services have then been implemented. Upon the earlier of (i) all members of CONA beginning to use the CONA System in all territories in which they distribute and manufacture Coca‑Cola products (excluding certain territories of CCR that are expected to be sold to bottlers that are neither members of CONA nor users of the CONA System), or (ii) December 31, 2018, the service fees will be changed to be an amount per physical case of beverages distributed or manufactured in any portion of our territories equal to the aggregate costs incurred by CONA to maintain and operate the CONA System and provide the CONA Services divided by the total number of cases distributed or manufactured by all of the members of CONA, subject to certain exceptions and provided that the aggregate costs related to CONA’s manufacturing functionality will be borne solely amongst the CONA members who have rights to manufacture beverages of The Coca‑Cola Company. We are obligated to pay the service fees under the CONA MSA even if we are not using the CONA System for all or any portion of our distribution and manufacturing operations.
 
Amended and Restated Ancillary Business Letter
 
As part of the System Transformation, we entered into an amended and restated ancillary business letter with The Coca‑Cola Company on March 31, 2017 (the “Ancillary Business Letter”), pursuant to which we were granted advance waivers to acquire or develop certain lines of business involving the preparation, distribution, sale, dealing in or otherwise using or handling of certain beverage products that would otherwise be prohibited under the CBA or any similar agreement.
 
Under the Ancillary Business Letter, subject to certain limited exceptions, we are prohibited from acquiring or developing any line of business inside or outside of our territories governed by the CBA or any similar agreement prior to January 1, 2020 without the consent of The Coca‑Cola Company, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld. After January 1, 2020, The Coca‑Cola Company would be required to consent (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld) to our acquisition or development of (i) any grocery, quick service restaurant, or convenience and petroleum store business engaged in the sale of beverages, beverage components and other beverage products not otherwise authorized or permitted by the CBA, or (ii) any other line of business for which beverage activities otherwise prohibited under the CBA represent more than a certain threshold of net sales (subject to certain limited exceptions).
 
Distribution Territories and Regional Manufacturing Facilities
 
We are the largest independent Coca‑Cola bottler in the United States, distributing, marketing and manufacturing beverage products in territories spanning 14 states and the District of Columbia. In addition to the distribution territories and manufacturing facilities we continue to serve and operate in our historic operational footprint, which includes markets in North Carolina, South Carolina, central Tennessee, western Virginia and West Virginia, we now service and operate the following additional territories and manufacturing facilities acquired from CCR and United in the System Transformation:

The Company is also a shareholder in South Atlantic Canners, Inc. (“SAC”), a manufacturing cooperative managed by the Company. The Company is obligated to purchase 17.5 million cases of finished product from SAC on an annual basis through June 2024. SAC is located in Bishopville, South Carolina, and the Company utilizes a portion of the production capacity from the Bishopville production facility.
 
Raw Materials
 
In addition to concentrates purchased from The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies for use in our beverage manufacturing, we also purchase sweetener, carbon dioxide, plastic bottles, cans, closures and other packaging materials, as well as equipment for the distribution, marketing and production of nonalcoholic beverages.
 
We purchase all of our plastic bottles from Southeastern Container and Western Container, two manufacturing cooperatives we co-own with several other Coca‑Cola bottlers, and all of our aluminum cans from two domestic suppliers.
 
Along with all other U.S. Coca-Cola bottlers, we are a member of Coca-Cola Bottlers’ Sales and Services Company, LLC (“CCBSS”), which was formed in 2003 to facilitate various procurement functions and the distribution of beverage products of The Coca‑Cola Company with the intent of enhancing the efficiency and competitiveness of the Coca‑Cola bottling system in the United States. CCBSS negotiates the procurement for the majority of our raw materials, excluding concentrate.
 
We are exposed to price risk on commodities such as aluminum, corn, PET resin (a petroleum- or plant-based product), and fuel, which affects the cost of raw materials used in the production of our finished products. Examples of the raw materials affected include aluminum cans and plastic bottles used for packaging and high fructose corn syrup used as a product ingredient. Further, we are exposed to commodity price risk on oil, which impacts our cost of fuel used in the movement and delivery of our products. We participate in commodity hedging and risk mitigation programs administered both by CCBSS and by the Company. In addition, there are no limits on the prices The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies can charge for concentrate. 
 
Customers and Marketing
 
The Company’s products are sold and distributed through various channels, including direct sales to retail stores and other outlets such as food markets, institutional accounts and vending machine outlets. During 2017, approximately 65% of the Company’s bottle/can sales volume to retail customers was sold for future consumption, while the remaining bottle/can sales volume to retail customers was sold for immediate consumption. All of the Company’s beverage sales during 2017 were to customers in the United States. 
 
The following table summarizes the percentage of our total bottle/can sales volume to our largest customers as well as the percentage of our total net sales that such volume represents:

New product introductions, packaging changes and sales promotions are the primary sales and marketing practices in the nonalcoholic beverage industry and have required, and are expected to continue to require, substantial expenditures. Recent product introductions in our business include new flavor varieties within certain brands such as Sprite Cherry, POWERade Citrus Passionfruit, Monster Ultra Violet, Monster Juice Mango Loco, Peace Tea Georgia Peach, Peace Tea Razzleberry, Minute Maid 5% Berry Punch, Dunkin’ Donuts

Mocha Iced Coffee, Dunkin’ Donuts French Vanilla Iced Coffee and Coke Zero Sugar. Recent packaging introductions include the 13.7-ounce bottle for Dunkin’ Donuts Iced Coffees, 0.5-liter energy drink cans and eight-packs of 16-ounce energy drinks.
 
We sell our products primarily in non-refillable bottles and cans, in varying package configurations from market to market. For example, there may be as many as 28 different packages for Diet Coke within a single geographic area. Bottle/can sales volume to retail customers during 2017 was approximately 62% bottles and 38% cans.
 
We rely extensively on advertising in various media outlets, primarily online, television and radio, for the marketing of our products. The Coca‑Cola Company, Monster Energy and Dr Pepper Snapple (collectively, the “Beverage Companies”) make substantial expenditures on advertising programs in our territories from which we benefit. Although the Beverage Companies have provided us with marketing funding support in the past, our beverage agreements generally do not obligate the Beverages Companies to do so. 
 
We also expend substantial funds on our own behalf for extensive local sales promotions of our products. Historically, these expenses have been partially offset by marketing funding support provided to us by the Beverage Companies in support of a variety of marketing programs, such as point-of-sale displays and merchandising programs. We consider the funds we expend for marketing and merchandising programs necessary to maintain or increase revenue.
 
In addition to our marketing and merchandising programs, we believe a sustained and planned charitable giving program to support communities is an essential component to the success of our brand and, by extension, our sales. In 2017, the Company made cash donations of approximately $5.8 million to various charities and donor-advised funds in light of the Company’s financial performance, expanded distribution territory footprint and future business prospects. The Company intends to continue its charitable contributions in future years, subject to the Company’s financial performance and other business factors.
 
Seasonality
 
Business seasonality results primarily from higher unit sales of the Company’s products in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year. We believe that we and other manufacturers from whom we purchase finished goods have adequate production capacity to meet sales demand for sparkling and still beverages during these peak periods. See “Item 2. Properties” for information relating to utilization of our production facilities. Sales volume can also be impacted by weather conditions. Fixed costs, such as depreciation expense, are not significantly impacted by business seasonality.
Competition
 
The nonalcoholic beverage market is highly competitive for both sparkling and still beverages. Our competitors include bottlers and distributors of nationally and regionally advertised and marketed products, as well as bottlers and distributors of private label beverages. Our principal competitors include local bottlers of Pepsi-Cola and, in some regions, local bottlers of Dr Pepper, Royal Crown and/or 7‑Up products.
 
The principal methods of competition in the nonalcoholic beverage industry are point-of-sale merchandising, new product introductions, new vending and dispensing equipment, packaging changes, pricing, price promotions, product quality, retail space management, customer service, frequency of distribution and advertising. We believe we are competitive in our territories with respect to these methods of competition.
 
Government Regulation
 
Our businesses are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies of the United States, including laws and regulations governing the production, storage, distribution, sale, display, advertising, marketing, packaging, labeling, content, quality and safety of our products, our occupational health and safety practices, and the transportation and use of many of our products.
 
We are required to comply with a variety of U.S. laws and regulations, including but not limited to: the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and various state laws governing food safety; the Food Safety Modernization Act; the Occupational Safety and Health Act; the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act; the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act; the Lanham Act; various federal and state laws and regulations governing competition and trade practices; various federal and state laws and regulations governing our employment practices, including those related to equal employment opportunity, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Act and the National Labor Relations Act; and laws regulating the sale of certain of our products in schools.

As a manufacturer, distributor and seller of beverage products of the Beverage Companies in exclusive territories, we are subject to antitrust laws of general applicability. However, pursuant to the United States Soft Drink Interbrand Competition Act, soft drink bottlers, such as us, are permitted to have exclusive rights to manufacture, distribute and sell a soft drink product in a defined geographic territory if that soft drink product is in substantial and effective competition with other products of the same general class in the market. We believe such competition exists in each of the exclusive geographic territories in the United States in which we operate.
 
In response to the growing health, nutrition and obesity concerns of today’s youth, a number of states have regulations restricting the sale of soft drinks and other foods in schools, particularly elementary, middle and high schools. Many of these restrictions have existed for several years in connection with subsidized meal programs in schools. Restrictive legislation, if widely enacted, could have an adverse impact on our products, image and reputation.
 
Most beverage products sold by the Company are classified as food or food products and are therefore eligible for purchase using supplemental nutrition assistance (“SNAP”) benefits by consumers purchasing them for home consumption. Energy drinks with a nutrition facts label are also classified as food and are eligible for purchase for home consumption using SNAP benefits, whereas energy drinks classified as a supplement by the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) are not. Regulators may restrict the use of benefit programs, including SNAP, to purchase certain beverages and foods.
 
Certain jurisdictions in which our products are sold have imposed, or are considering imposing, taxes, labeling requirements or other limitations on, or regulations pertaining to, the sale of certain of our products, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or commodities used in the manufacture of our products, including certain of our products that contain added sugars or sodium, exceed a specified caloric content, or include specified ingredients such as caffeine. 
 
Legislation has been proposed in Congress and by certain state and local governments which would prohibit the sale of soft drink products in non-refillable bottles and cans or require a mandatory deposit as a means of encouraging the return of such containers, each in an attempt to reduce solid waste and litter. We are currently not impacted by this type of proposed legislation, but it is possible that similar or more restrictive legal requirements may be proposed or enacted within our territories in the future.
 
We are also subject to federal and local environmental laws, including laws related to water consumption and treatment, wastewater discharge and air emissions. Our facilities must comply with the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other federal and state laws regarding handling, storage, release and disposal of wastes generated on-site and sent to third-party owned and operated off-site licensed facilities.
 
Environmental Remediation
 
We do not currently have any material capital expenditure commitments for environmental compliance or environmental remediation for any of our properties. We do not believe compliance with enacted or adopted federal, state and local provisions pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or our competitive position.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 16,500 employees, of which approximately 14,500 were full-time and 2,000 were part-time. Approximately 14% of our labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements.
