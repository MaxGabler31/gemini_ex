Item 1.  Business.
General
The Davey Tree Expert Company, which was founded in 1880 and incorporated in Ohio in 1909, and its subsidiaries ("we" or "us") provide a wide range of arboricultural, horticultural, environmental and consulting services to our customers throughout the United States and Canada. We have two reportable operating segments organized by type or class of customer: Residential and Commercial, and Utility.
Our Residential and Commercial segment provides services to our residential and commercial customers including: the treatment, preservation, maintenance, removal and planting of trees, shrubs and other plant life; the practice of landscaping, grounds maintenance, tree surgery, tree feeding and tree spraying; the application of fertilizer, herbicides and insecticides; and, natural resource management and consulting, forestry research and development, and environmental planning.
Our Utility segment is principally engaged in providing services to our utility customers--investor-owned, municipal utilities, and rural electric cooperatives--including: the practice of line-clearing and vegetation management around power lines, rights-of-way and chemical brush control; and, natural resource management and consulting, forestry research and development and environmental planning.
We also maintain research, technical support and laboratory diagnostic facilities.
Competition and Customers
Our Residential and Commercial segment is one of the largest national tree care organizations in the United States, and competes with other national and local firms with respect to its services. On a national level, our competition is primarily landscape construction and maintenance companies as well as residential and commercial lawn care companies. At a local and regional level, our competition comes mainly from small, local companies which are engaged primarily in tree care and lawn services. Our Utility segment is the second largest organization in the industry in the United States, and competes principally with one major national competitor, The Asplundh Tree Expert Co., as well as several smaller regional firms.
Principal methods of competition in both operating segments are customer service, marketing, image, performance and reputation. Our program to meet our competition stresses the necessity for our employees to have and project to customers a thorough knowledge of all horticultural services provided, and utilization of modern, well-maintained equipment. Pricing is not always a critical factor in a customer's decision with respect to our Residential and Commercial segment; however, pricing is generally the principal method of competition for our Utility segment, although in most instances consideration is given to reputation and past production performance.
We provide a wide range of horticultural services to private companies, public utilities, local, state and federal agencies, and a variety of industrial, commercial and residential customers. During 2018, we had revenues of approximately $125 million, or approximately 12% of total revenues, from Pacific Gas & Electric Company ("PG&E"), our largest customer. On January 29, 2019, PG&E filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. As a utility company, PG&E serves residential and industrial customers in California and has an ongoing obligation to continue to serve its customers. Therefore, we do not anticipate PG&E's bankruptcy to have a material impact on our future cash flows and results of operations.
Regulation and Environment
Our facilities and operations, in common with those of the industry generally, are subject to governmental regulations designed to protect the environment. This is particularly important with respect to our services regarding insect and disease control, because these services involve, to a considerable degree, the blending and application of spray materials, which require formal licensing in most areas. Constant changes in environmental conditions, environmental awareness, technology and social attitudes make it necessary for us to maintain a high degree of awareness of the impact such changes have on the market for our services. We believe that we comply in all material respects with existing federal, state and local laws regulating the use of materials in our spraying operations as well as the other aspects of our business that are subject to any such regulation.

Marketing
We solicit business from residential customers principally through referrals, direct mail programs and to a lesser extent through the placement of advertisements in national magazines and trade journals, local newspapers and "yellow pages" telephone directories. We also employ online marketing and lead generation strategies, including email marketing campaigns, search engine optimization, search engine marketing, and social media communication. Business from utility and commercial customers is obtained principally through negotiated contracts and competitive bidding. We carry out all of our sales and services through our employees. We generally do not use agents, and do not franchise our name or business.
Seasonality
Our business is seasonal, primarily due to fluctuations in horticultural services provided to Residential and Commercial customers and to a lesser extent by budget constraints imposed on our Utility customers. Because of this seasonality, we have historically incurred losses in the first quarter, while sales and earnings are generally highest in the second and third quarters of the calendar year. Consequently, this has created heavy demands for additional working capital at various times throughout the year. We borrow primarily against bank commitments in the form of a revolving credit facility and issue notes to provide the necessary funds for our operations. You can find more information about our bank commitments in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” of this report under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Other Factors
Due to rapid changes in equipment technology and intensity of use, we must constantly update our equipment and processes to ensure that we provide competitive services to our customers and continue our compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Act.
We own several trademarks including "Davey," "Davey and Design," "Arbor Green Pro," "Arbor Green," and "Davey Resource Group." Through substantial advertising and use, we believe that these trademarks have become of value in the identification and acceptance of our products and services.
Employees
We employed approximately 8,900 employees at December 31, 2018. However, employment levels fluctuate due to seasonal factors affecting our business. We consider our employee relations to be good.
Domestic and Foreign Operations
We sell our services to customers in the United States and Canada.
We do not consider the risks attendant to our business with foreign customers, other than currency exchange risks, to be materially different from those attendant to our business with domestic customers.
