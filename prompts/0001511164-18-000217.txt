Item 1. Business
Company Overview
 
Canbiola, Inc. was originally incorporated as WrapMail, Inc. (WRAP) in Florida on October 11, 2005 in order to tap into a largely un-serviced segment of the web-based advertising industry. Effective December 27, 2010, WRAP effected a 10 for 1 forward stock split of its common stock. Effective June 4, 2013, WRAP effected a 1 for 10 reverse stock split of its common stock. The accompanying consolidated financial statements retroactively reflect these stock splits. 

Effective January 5, 2015, WRAP acquired 100% ownership of Prosperity Systems, Inc. (Prosperity), a New York corporation incorporated on April 2, 2008, in order to acquire Prosperitys office productivity software suite as a complement to WRAPs existing intellectual property. After its acquisition, the Company transferred Prosperitys operations to WRAP and is presently in the process of dissolving Prosperity. For the periods presented, the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses are those of the Company. Prosperity had no activity for the periods presented.

Around the first quarter of 2017, the Company began to transition into the Hemp CBD industry and now primarily offers health and beauty products containing CBD. On May 15, 2017, WRAP changed its name to Canbiola, Inc. (the Company or CANB or Canbiola) to reflect its transition. 

Business 

The Company operates several divisions, including document management and email marketing platforms; however, its primary operations are from the development and sale of products containing CBD. The Companys products contain CBD derived from Hemp and include products such as oils, creams, moisturizers, chews, vapes, isolate, gel caps, concentrate and water. In addition to offering white labeled products, Canbiola is developing its own line of proprietary products, as well as seeking synergistic value through acquisitions in the Hemp industry. Canbiola aims to be the premier provider of the highest quality natural Hemp CBD products on the market through sourcing the very best raw material and developing a variety of products we believe will improve people's lives in a variety of areas.

CBD Business

Cannabidiol (CBD) is one of nearly 85 naturally occurring compounds (cannabinoids) found in industrial hemp and cannabis. CBD is non-psychoactive and is thought to have numerous uses, including, but not limited to, for pain, insomnia, epilepsy, anxiety, inflammation, and nausea. Unlike CBD derived from marijuana, CBD derived from the seeds and stalks of industrial hemp is generally considered legal in the U.S. so long as it contains less than 0.03% of THC, another, but psychoactive, cannabinoid found in cannabis. CBD derived from marijuana, marijuana and other marijuana derivatives are federally illegal in the U.S. under the Controlled Substances Act, despite being medically or recreationally legal in numerous states.

In order to facilitate its operations, the Company has entered into a Production Agreement with Pure Health Products, LLC, a New York limited liability company (PHP). Pursuant to the Production Agreement, PHP will manufacture, package, and sell the Companys CBD infused products on an exclusive basis. PHP will not produce or manufacture any product containing any cannabis or hemp derivative for any person or entity other than the Company, and the Company controls the ingredients, recipe, manufacturing processes and procedures and quality and taste parameters for all Products produced at the PHP facility. PHP may also white label / rebrand or relabel the products on the Companys behalf pursuant to white label agreements entered into between the Company and third-party customers. Through its contractual relationship with PHP, the Company is able to control the manufacturing process of its products while reducing its production costs. In addition, the Company has the option to acquire certain assets of PHP should it elect to take over direct manufacture of its Products. 

The Companys products are sold via its website and through doctors and other medical professionals with which the Company enters into distribution agreements.

The CBD and cannabis markets are flooded with competition ranging from mom and pop operations to multi-million-dollar conglomerates, many with longer operating histories, more capital and/or more industry knowledge than the Company. The Company hopes to partner with or engage industry specialists to help set it apart from its numerous competitors. 

The statements found herein have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Companys products are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease or medical condition.

While the Company is seeking additional opportunities to manufacture, market and/or distribute CBD, it continues to operate its Bullseye and WRAPmail divisions and explore ways to grow each, especially in a manner that would be symbiotic with its intended future CBD operation. 

WRAPmail

The Company owns a patented technology that combines custom marketing content with organization e-mail to provide a next generation marketing platform for organizations and personal use. WRAPmail provides a branding and advertising solution to organizations allowing employee e-mails to be written on company sanctioned trackable e-mail stationary as opposed to using simple, personal e-mail signatures. In essence, WRAPmail turns every e-mail sent by one of our customers into valuable marketing tool by wrapping the e-mail with the customers letterhead, logo, product offerings, or other information or graphics that the customer wishes to disseminate to the reader. 

WRAPmail is a server/cloud‐ based solution. Users create e-mails just as they always have, and do not see the rich content. Users are not required to change their e‐mail address and the administrator can “construct” with or without the help of the WRAPmail Production & Design team different e‐mail letterheads using the included WRAPmaker that allow for including different graphics, links, promotions, surveys and/or audio. The e-mail either makes a stop after leaving the user’s desktop and that “stop” is where the e-mail gets wrapped or users use the available WRAPmail toolbars. Currently, toolbars are available for Google Chrome, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Apple Safari and Firefox for Gmail, Yahoo Mail, AOLMail, Microsoft Hotmail/LIVE, GoDaddy webmail, Keller Williams webmail, Salesforce.com webmail and 24sevenoffice.com webmail. WRAPmail software resides in the cloud or for large clients on their own server inside their Firewall. One WRAPmail server can currently process about 100K emails per hour (as we move to multi‐threading we believe we can increase the speed ten‐fold). WRAPmail has also developed an APP for Android and iPhone where users can send WRAPPED emails from their Gmail, Yahoo Mail, AOL Mail and Microsoft Mail.

We have been only mildly successful in gaining customers for our newest version, WRAPmail 2.0, a paid service with B2B and B2C offerings. This limited success in garnering new clients is despite numerous marketing efforts to the contrary and the Company has yet to find the best avenue for marketing WRAPmail 2.0 to potential clients. The Company continues to explore alternative avenues for generating revenues through its WRAPmail 2.0 product offering and intellectual property. 

After substantial research, we are not aware of any competitors developing a similar solution to WRAPmail, possibly giving us first mover advantage. Nonetheless, we may face competition from stationary letterhead, bulk e-mail and similar product providers.

Intellectual Property

We own the following patents for our WRAPmail technology: US patent no. 8572275 issued on October 29, 2013. This patent expires in October 2033. On July 20, 2015, WRAPmail filed for a new patent under the title: Method, System and Software for Dynamically Extracting Content for Integration with Instant Messages, which application is still pending and not being actively pursued by the Company.

Any expiration of our patents or claims could adversely affect our business. However, with regard to the importance and effect of these patents, it is necessary to understand the structure of the Companys intellectual property. Patents have been relied upon to discourage infringement during the research and development stage of the technology. In that sense we believe that the main purpose of the patents has been that they have served to provide the Company a head start against potential competitors. A significant body of unpublished know-how and trade secrets is closely held by the Company in order to mitigate the risk of competition that could arise from other parties reliance merely upon the information contained in the patents. The Company can derive revenue from sub-licensing its know-how without sub-licensing the rights to patents, or it can, as it has the right to do under the agreement, also sublicense the patents as well. 

The above patents relate to the document management and email marketing divisions. Due to diminishing revenue it was determined to reduce the fair value of these patents to 0.

The Company currently has no full-time employee.
