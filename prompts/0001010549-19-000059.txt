Item 1.                         Business
Company Overview
 
Water Now, Inc. was incorporated in Texas on February 10, 2016 to develop and commercialize a gas/diesel or electric powered, portable device that processes and purifies contaminated water. Our business strategy was conceived as a result of the growing global water crisis. Today, many countries and regions are experiencing acute water shortages and we believe our technology and products are capable of generating safe drinking water from many available water sources.
 
Our water purification product lines consist of portable units capable of providing a cost-effective, safe and efficient method of water purification. Our products require no pre- or post-treatment of the source water, no filters, no membranes and no chemicals. The quality of water purified by our products has been tested to meet or exceed the World Health Organization’s (“WHO”) drinking water standards.
 
We have also developed a flameless heating technology that allows us to manufacture an electronically powered portable heating platform. The platform uses no combustion or electronic heating elements. By avoiding traditional heating elements, the product is ideal for facilities that generate vapors or dust, such as paint and body shops, furniture manufacturers, fuel depots and grain elevators. Our technology is anticipated to allow for the efficient heating of large spaces such as warehouses and garages. We anticipate introducing to the market our initial product offering in May 2019. The first product that we will make available to the market will heat approximately 1,000 square feet.
 
On October 23, 2018, the Company formed HydraSpin USA, Inc., a Texas corporation (“HydraSpin”), as a wholly-owned subsidiary. HydraSpin is engaged in the installation and operation of oil recovery machines deployed at salt water disposal wells associated with the oil industry. The utilized technology developed by African Horizon Technologies (Pty) Ltd (“AHT”)

allows for the separation of residual oil from water contained in the disposal sites so as to minimize environmental contamination from the fluids containing oil.
 
On October 31, 2018, the Company entered into an Exclusive Sales Distribution Agreement (the “Agreement”) with AHT whereby the Company serves as AHT’s exclusive distributor of the Hydraspin Hydro Cyclone technology in the United States of America. Pricing is established in accordance with the AHT Agreement. Products are paid 50% upon order and the balance being due FOB the port. Typical lead time to have a machine ready for deployment after it is ordered is sixty (60) days.
 
The Company, through HydraSpin, contracts with owners of saltwater injection wells to reclaim oil using machines manufactured by AHT but owned and operated by HydraSpin. We derive revenue from sharing the proceeds of the oil recovered and sold with the owner of the applicable disposal location, typically on a 50/50 basis. As of March 31, 2019 we have purchased 13 machines from AHT, of which one is in operation.
 
Water Purification Products
 
We currently offer three water purification products: the Aqua 125, the Aqua 1000, and an upgraded Aqua 1000 designed for disaster relief, military and agricultural applications. The Aqua 125 model is available in both gas and electric versions and is capable of purifying fresh water that is contaminated primarily with partially dissolved solid material, microorganisms and other pathogens that can be dangerous to humans. The Aqua 125 model has the capacity to purify up to 80 gallons of water per day. The Aqua 1000 model adds the ability to desalinate salt water, with a capacity of up to 800 gallons per day. The disaster relief configuration, which consists of an upgraded Aqua 1000 unit complemented with a reservoir mounted on a trailer, is also capable of purifying up to 800 gallons of water per day.
Manufacturing and Distribution. We assemble our Aqua 125 and Aqua 1000 units at our facility in Fort Worth, Texas. Components are purchased from third-party suppliers and delivered to us for assembly. We do not depend on any single source for materials used in the production of our water purification products. As currently designed, the components of our Aqua units are available from various sources.
 
Our distribution strategy is to make our products available through direct sales and distributors. Our current focus is on selling our products to governmental and non-governmental organizations both domestically and internationally. Our products are currently sold in seven countries through our distributor network. We currently have exclusive distributor relationships for the Philippines and South Africa. In fiscal 2018, we sold approximately 100 Aqua 125 and six Aqua 1000 models.
 
Warranty. We have entered into an Administration Agreement with Datacom Warranty Corp., a third-party warranty administrator, to administer warranty claims. We expect that all significant components of our products will have warranties from the respective manufacturer. We have retained Datacom to administer warranty claims with the responsible component supplier. Our cost to have Datacom administer warranty claims on our behalf under the Administration Agreement is $8.00 per unit shipped by us.

Customers. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had back-log orders of approximately $65,000, all of which were filled in January 2019.
 
HydraSpin USA 
 
As of March 31, 2019 we have executed contracts with two owners of two salt water disposal wells located in Oklahoma and Wyoming, respectively. We are currently in negotiations with approximately four additional owners to service approximately 17 wells during fiscal 2019.
Competition
 
There are numerous competitors for the products and services we provide. We believe that the design of our products have advantages over other similar solutions that are currently available. However, we expect that competition for our offerings will remain highly competitive.
Governmental Approvals and Regulations
 
We do not anticipate that we will need to obtain material governmental approvals for the manufacturing and distribution of any of our products, other than customary permits and licenses generally applicable to businesses operating in the geographic areas in which we operate. We do not anticipate that obtaining any such permit or license will impact or hinder our operations in any material respect. We also expect to be subject to regulations applicable to businesses operating in the areas in which we operate. We do not anticipate that any of such regulations will have a material effect on our business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we can give no assurance regarding the impact that governmental regulations might have on our operations. We do not anticipate that we will be required to incur significant costs and expenses in order to comply with environmental laws, although certain components incorporated into our products are expected to require certifications that they satisfy applicable environmental regulatory requirements. The cost of obtaining such certifications are expected to be borne by our suppliers.
Intellectual Property
 
We have filed domestic and international patent applications for the design of our water purification technology. Current water purification products typically require disposable filters and membranes coupled with a heating element driven through a resistive coil that can fail, especially if coming in contact with the fluids involved. Our design seeks to mitigate these problems by utilizing a water pump fed rotational centrifugal system, where solid contaminants are held to the interior cylindrical walls of the centrifuge, resulting in water containing fewer contaminants.
 
We have also filed for domestic patent protection of our space heating technology and submitted an application to trademark the HydraSpin name.
 
Research and Development; Employees
 
For fiscal 2018, we expended an aggregate of approximately $1.4 million research and development (“R&D”) activities as compared to approximately $1.0 million during fiscal 2017.

We anticipate a material reduction in R&D activities in fiscal 2019.
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 15 employees, all of whom were employed on a full-time basis.
 
Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as that term is used in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or “JOBS Act.” An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies, and we have elected to comply with these reduced reporting and other burdens. These provisions include:

• | A requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth company’s internal control over financial reporting under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements and an exemption from various shareholder voting requirements with respect to executive compensation arrangements.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We could remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common stock under a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, (iii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iv) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period. The foregoing amounts are subject to adjustment for inflation.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act and Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with the revised accounting standards. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.
