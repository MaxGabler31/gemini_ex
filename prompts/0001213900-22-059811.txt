Recent Developments



On April 27, 2022, we announced that all 21 anticipated purchase orders for the first national hotel rollout of Nightfood ice cream pints had been received. Shipments have been initiated and Nightfood is available in 21 major hotel distribution hubs across the country.



In May 2022, at the direction of a leading global hotel company with thousands of locations in the United States, Nightfood’s first major chainwide hotel distribution began with the national rollout in a yet-to-be announced major extended-stay hotel chain with approximately 500 properties in the United States.



In addition to the May launch in that first chain, the Company announced a second global hotel company initiated a corporate-level test of Nightfood in one of their chains , which was declared a success by that hotel company in June, 2022



In June 2022, we announced plans to launch Nightfood sleep-friendly cookies in July 2022. In August, Nightfood completed production of the first production run of Nightfood cookies in the “Prime-Time Chocolate Chip” flavor. Cherry oat and snickerdoodle flavors are also nearing development completion.



In September, 2022, we were notified by the global hotel company that launched us into our first national chain in May, 2022 that they now are planning to introduce Nightfood into multiple additional chains comprising over 3,000 additional properties. The timeline communicated to us was that introduction into the additional chains would begin in October, 2022, although we can give no assurance that such timeline will not be pushed back, either by the hotel company or their individual chains.



This decision was made as the result of strong relative sales velocities, meaning sales of our products compared to our competitors in the same hotels were, on average, strong and competitive. This includes leading legacy brands of ice cream pints such as Haagen Dazs, Ben & Jerry’s, Blue Bell, Baskin Robbins, Talenti, Halo Top, and others.




On September 23, 2022, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement and issued and sold to an institutional investor, a Promissory Note in the principal sum of $700,000.00, which amount is the $644,000 actual amount of the purchase price plus an original issue discount in the amount of $56,000. In connection with the issuance of the note, we issued to the investor warrants to purchase 2,800,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.225, as well as returnable warrants to purchase 7,000,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.30, in each case subject to adjustment. As a result of the transaction, our existing lenders triggered their “most favored nation” clause which resulted in their existing notes receiving some of the same terms and conditions we granted to the new investor’s notes and warrants. The proceeds from the sale of the note and warrants is expected to be used for business development, working capital, operations and required debt service.



Industry Overview



What you eat before bed matters.



Nightfood is pioneering the category of sleep-friendly nighttime snacking.




Research indicates that humans are biologically hard-wired to load up on sweets and fats at night. Loading a surplus of calories (fuel) into the body before the long nightly fast is believed to be an outdated survival mechanism from our hunter-gatherer days. Unfortunately, while modern consumers know this type of consumption isn’t necessary for survival, willpower also weakens at night, so consumers are more likely to succumb to these unhealthy nighttime cravings for excess “survival calories”.



As a result, over 85% of adults report snacking regularly between dinner and bed, resulting in an estimated 700 million nighttime snack occasions weekly, and an annual spend on night snacks of over $50 billion. Because of our hard-wired evolutionary preferences for calorie-dense choices that increase the odds of short-term survival, the most popular nighttime snacks are ice cream, cookies, chips, and candy. These are all understood to be generally unhealthy. They can also impair sleep quality.



And, because these cravings are biologically hardwired, we believe this unhealthy nighttime snacking behavior will continue to be a pattern and a problem for a significant portion of the population. We believe it’s a problem that demands a solution.



In recent years, billions of dollars of consumer spend have shifted to better-for-you versions of consumers’ favorite snacks. But we do not believe any of those products were nutritionally formulated to support better sleep. Nightfood snacks are not only formulated to be better-for-you, but they’re also formulated by sleep experts and nutritionists to provide a better nutritional foundation for sleep.



Almost half of all snacking takes place between dinner and bed. Nutrition is an important part of sleep-hygiene because what one eats at night impacts sleep. Recent industry surveys indicated that most modern consumers have begun to seek functional benefits from their snacks, and most consumers would also prefer better sleep.



As the pioneers of the nighttime snacking category, Nightfood accepts the responsibility to educate consumers and build the awareness required to grow the nighttime segment of the overall snack market. Along with that responsibility comes the opportunity to be the category king. We envision a future where nighttime specific, sleep-friendly snacks comprise a multi-billion-dollar segment of the estimated $150 billion American snack market.

Management believes significant latent consumer demand exists for better nighttime snacking options, and that a new consumer category, consisting of nighttime specific snacks, is set to emerge in the coming years. This belief is supported by research from major consumer goods research firms such as IRI Worldwide, and Mintel, who identified nighttime specific foods and beverages as one of the “most compelling and category changing trends” for 2017 and beyond. In recent years, CEO’s and other executives from major consumer goods conglomerates such as Nestle, PepsiCo, Mondelez, and Kellogg’s have commented on consumer nighttime snack habits and alluded to the opportunity that might exist in solving this problem for the marketplace.



Nightfood has established a highly credentialed Scientific Advisory Board consisting of sleep and nutrition experts to drive product formulation decisions and provide consumer confidence in the brand promise. The first member of this advisory board was Dr. Michael Grandner, Director of the Sleep and Health Research Program at the University of Arizona. Dr. Grandner has been conducting research on the link between nutrition and sleep for over fifteen years, and he believes improved nighttime nutritional choices can improve sleep, resulting in many short and long-term health benefits. In March of 2018, the Company added Dr. Michael Breus to their Scientific Advisory Board. Dr. Breus, known to millions as The Sleep Doctor™, is believed to be the Nation’s most trusted authority on sleep. He regularly appears in the national media to educate and inform consumers so they can sleep better and lead happier, healthier, more productive lives. In July, 2018, we completed our Scientific Advisory Board with the addition of Lauren Broch, Ph.D, M.S. Dr. Broch is a sleep therapist and former Director of Education & Training at the Sleep-Wake Disorders Center at Weill Cornell Medical College. Dr. Broch also has a master’s degree in human nutrition. This combination allows her to play an important role in the formulation of Nightfood snacks. These experts work with Company management to ensure Nightfood products deliver on their nighttime-appropriate, and sleep-friendly promises.



Compared to regular ice cream, Nightfood is formulated with more tryptophan, more vitamin B6, more calcium, magnesium, and zinc, more protein and more prebiotic fiber. Nightfood also contains less fat, less sugar, and fewer calories than traditional ice cream, and is lactose free.



Nightfood cookies offer similar nutritional benefits when compared to conventional cookies. They feature less sugar, less fat, fewer calories, more protein, more prebiotic fiber, and contain added inositol and vitamin B6.



Each new Nightfood snack format would be expected to deliver sleep-friendly snacking in a way that is appropriate for that format. For example, Nightfood chips would not necessarily contain significantly more tryptophan than other brands of chips but may be more sleep-friendly in other ways.



In February of 2019, it was announced that Nightfood had won the 2019 Product of the Year Award in the ice cream category in a Kantar innovation survey of over 40,000 consumers. In June of 2019, it was announced that Nightfood won both the Best New Ice Cream and Best New Dairy Dessert awards at the World Dairy Innovation Awards.



In November of 2021, Nightfood won the Real California Milk Excelerator Dairy Innovation competition, with a top prize of $150,000 in marketing support. Executives and judges from the California Milk Advisory Board and corporate entities such as Hershey’s, Coca-Cola, and Whole Foods commended the unique problem the Nightfood brand addresses for consumers, and the opportunities and strategic advantages afforded by widespread hotel distribution for a brand pioneering sleep-friendly nighttime snacking.



Nightfood has received media coverage in outlets such as The Today Show, Oprah Magazine, The Rachael Ray Show, Food Network Magazine, The Wall Street Journal, USA Today, The Washington Post, Fox Business News, and many more media outlets.

Our Products, Present and Proposed



Nightfood ice cream is available in nine flavors. These are Full Moon Vanilla, Midnight Chocolate, Cold Brew Decaf, After Dinner Mint Chip, Milk & Cookie Dough, Cherry Eclipse, Bed and Breakfast, Cookies n’ Dreams, and Pickles For Two.



Compared to traditional ice cream, Nightfood is formulated with more tryptophan, more vitamin B6, more calcium, magnesium, and zinc, more protein and more prebiotic fiber. Nightfood also contains less fat, less sugar, and fewer calories than traditional ice cream, and is lactose free.



Nightfood cookies are currently available in one flavor (Prime-Time Chocolate Chip), and two other flavors are expected to be introduced in November of 2022 (a cherry oat flavor, and a snickerdoodle flavor). Compared to traditional cookies, Nightfood cookies feature less sugar, less fat, fewer calories, more protein, more prebiotic fiber, and contain added inositol and vitamin B6.



Sleep-friendly versions of additional popular nighttime snack formats are anticipated to be introduced in 2023 and beyond, subject to available funds, including chips, single-serve ice cream novelties, candy, and more. Based on conversations with hotel decision-makers, Nightfood management believes hotels are seeking to have sleep-friendly snacks available in their lobby shops in multiple formats, so that, whatever snack format a guest might be in the mood for, there would be a sleep-friendly version available for them, alongside the traditional full-fat, full-sugar legacy brands.



Each new Nightfood snack format would be expected to deliver sleep-friendly snacking in a way that is appropriate for that format. For example, Nightfood chips would not necessarily contain significantly more tryptophan than other brands of chips but may be more sleep-friendly in other ways.



Development Plans




The Company plans to leverage widespread distribution in the lobby shops of the world’s leading hotel brands to grow revenue, grow brand awareness, and establish the sleep-friendly snack category we are pioneering. Our national hotel distribution began earlier this year. Our plans include introducing additional snack formats and capitalizing on the foundation of hotel distribution to ultimately establish successful and profitable distribution in mainstream retail.
Production



To date, we have utilized contract manufacturers for producing our products and packaging, and third-party logistics for warehousing and order fulfillment. We intend to continue outsourcing in this manner as we add additional snack formats to the Nightfood product lineup.
Marketing and Distribution



Nightfood ice cream is currently available in hundreds of hotel locations across the United States. The Company anticipates adding new distribution in thousands of hotels in the coming months through relationships it has established with some of the largest companies in the world in the hospitality vertical. We have built what we believe is a very valuable network and distribution infrastructure, which includes global hospitality companies group purchasing organizations, hotel management groups, and distributors. This new distribution is anticipated to include Nightfood ice cream pints and Nightfood cookies, as well as additional Nightfood snack formats during calendar 2023.



As of September 27, 2022, Nightfood ice cream is available in approximately 300 supermarket locations and 500 hotel lobby shops across the United States. This includes select locations from leading national and international hotel chains such as Holiday Inn, Holiday Inn Express, Fairfield Inn, Courtyard by Marriott, Hyatt Place, Hyatt House, Ramada by Wyndham, Best Western, Clarion, La Quinta, Staybridge Suites, Candlewood Suites, and many more.



As a result of our decision to focus on highly relevant and high-margin hotel distribution, we have temporarily shifted our primary focus away from traditional supermarket distribution. We believe that widespread and successful distribution in the lobby shops of the world’s leading hotel brands will grow revenue, grow brand awareness, and establish the nighttime snack category we are pioneering, and will pave the way to future success in supermarkets and other traditional retail channels.

Competition



The nutritional/snack food business is highly competitive and includes such participants as companies like Mondelez, Nestle S.A., Hershey’s, Hormel, Kraft/Heinz, Kellogg’s, Ferrero, Campbell Soup Company, Utz, General Mills, Mars, The Simply Good Foods Company, Wells Enterprises, Froneri, Unilever, Hostess, PepsiCo, and more. Many of these competitors have well established names and products.



In 2019, Nestle announced interest in the nighttime snacking space with the introduction of a candy-type product called GoodNight. In 2020, Pepsi announced the launch of a “relaxation” drink called Driftwell. Moreover, in 2021, Unilever announced they had initiated a year-long research study to identify how nutrition could be used to improve sleep, through impact on the gut microbiome. In September 2021, the Chief Medical Officer of Pepsi stated that Pepsi researchers were examining how foods and beverages affect neurochemical pathways, and that the company was interested in how this research could be used to impact sleep.



Nightfood competes based upon the unique characteristics and positioning of our products and we expect to derive significant leverage from being the pioneer and creator of the emerging night snack category. However, other companies, including those with greater name recognition than us and greater resources may seek to introduce products that directly compete with our products. Management believes that if a competitor sought to develop a competing product, it could do so and begin to establish retail distribution in 12-24 months.



Management speculates that entry into our category by one of the global players would significantly benefit our Company by advancing the growth of the category while also significantly increasing the strategic value of the Nightfood brand and existing distribution partnerships to the other global competitors.




Based on the current acquisition climate in the consumer goods space, Management believes that successful growth of the Nightfood snack line would likely bring acquisition offers from potential competitors as quickly as it might actually bring competition on the shelf from those same potential competitors. Management has no knowledge or reason to believe that any of the large global food and beverage companies are actively planning a launch of any new internal products to compete in our category.




Management believes widespread distribution in the lobby shops of the world’s largest hotel chains will provide a unique and powerful competitive advantage within the sleep-friendly nighttime snack category. In this vertical, the Nightfood brand can be insulated from potential competition compared to in the supermarket environment. In addition, deep and wide hotel penetration could serve to entrench Nightfood as the leading brand within the category, with a de-facto endorsement by the hotel industry serving as a distinct competitive advantage for Nightfood when competing head to head with competitors in other segments of the marketplace.



We believe the very nature of the hotel lobby shops, with small retail footprint and limited selection, will afford Nightfood a protected position in that high-margin vertical during the formative years of the category. Furthermore, management believes widespread hotel rollout of Nightfood snacks will serve to validate the concept of sleep-friendly nutrition and night snacks in the minds of consumers, potentially accelerating its adoption in all relevant retail verticals.



Intellectual Property Rights



We own the registered trademark “Nightfood®” for the nutrition bar/snack/meal replacement category, and the ice cream category in the United States. In September 2021, the Company also submitted for federal trademark protection for the Nightfood mark in the categories of cookies, chips, and candy in the United States. The Nightfood mark in the ice cream category has also been registered in Australia, Benelux, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. We believe these marks will prove important and valuable to our business as we continue to pioneer the development of a new category of snacks that support relaxation with a sleep-friendly nutritional profile, specific to consumption at night, between dinner and bedtime. 



Additionally, we own the domain Nightfood.com as well as many other relevant domains such as late-night-snack.com, nighttimesnack.com, and nighttimesnacking.com, as well as Nightfood.us, Nightfood.net, TryNightfood.com, GetNightfood.com, NiteFood.com, TryNightfood.com, BuyNightfood.com, NightSnacking.com, and Night-Food.com. We also own the toll-free number 888-888-NIGHT.

Nightfood’s formulae and recipes are proprietary, and we have non-disclosure agreements with our suppliers.  



Our wholly owned subsidiary, MJ Munchies, Inc., owns a registered trademark for “Half-Baked” in the State of California relating to marijuana edibles, and has two pending federal trademark applications for “Half-Baked” relating to certain packaged snacks and beverages. We can give no assurance that the federal trademark applications will be approved, or that if approved, it will not face legal challenges. We also acquired the HalfBaked.com domain, and several other related domain names and intellectual property assets. We are not currently pursuing this line of business but may do so in the future if funds allow and we feel it appropriate based upon our evolving business model.



Personnel



Nightfood has no employees. Our CEO, Sean Folkson, and other key team members have consulting agreements with the Company. Through vendor and consultant relationships, Nightfood has well over one dozen team members contributing to our operations on a regular basis. Should we be successful in executing our business plan, we anticipate potentially hiring employees at some point to assist with various company functions. However, we also expect to continue to strategically outsource significantly to accomplish work that might otherwise be done by employees in a more traditional company.
Customers



Our customers consist primarily of distributors that sell snack product to hotels and supermarkets. In FY 2022, we had one customer that accounted for over 20% of our Gross Sales. Two other customers each accounted for 16% and four others each accounted for between 8.5% and 9.9%. In FY 2021, we had one customer that accounted for over 30% of our Gross Sales. Three other customers each accounted for between 7.8% and 23%. As a result of our efforts to shift our primary focus away from traditional supermarket distribution to focus on higher-margin hotel distribution, we expect the mix of distributors, at least in the short term, to trend towards more hotel distribution and less supermarket distribution.
Vendors



During the year ended June 30, 2022, no vendors accounted for more than 10% of our operating expenses. During the year ended June 30, 2021, one vendor accounted for more than 10% of our operating expenses.
