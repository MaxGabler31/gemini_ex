Item 1.    Business
Overview
MultiPlan is a leading provider of data analytics and technology-enabled solutions designed to bring affordability, efficiency and fairness to the U.S. healthcare industry. We do so through services focused on reducing medical cost and improving billing and payment accuracy for the payors of healthcare, which are health insurers, self-insured employers and other health plan sponsors (typically through their health plan administrators), and, indirectly, the plan members who are the consumers of healthcare services.
Our predecessor was founded in 1980 as a New York-based hospital network and we have evolved both organically and through acquisition into a national organization offering three categories of services:
•Analytics-Based Services: data-driven algorithms which detect claims over-charges and either negotiate or recommend fair reimbursement using a variety of data sources and pricing algorithms;
•Network-Based Services: contracted discounts with healthcare providers to form one of the largest independent preferred provider organizations ("PPOs") in the United States with over 1.2 million healthcare providers under contract, as well as outsourced network development and/or management services; and
•Payment and Revenue Integrity Services: data, technology, and clinical expertise deployed to identify and remove improper and unnecessary charges before or after claims are paid, or to identify and help restore and preserve underpaid premium dollars.
Although the end beneficiary of our services are employers and other plan sponsors and their health plan members, our direct customers are typically health plan administrators ("Payors"). We offer these Payors a single electronic gateway to a comprehensive set of services in each of the above three categories, which are used in combination or individually to reduce the medical cost burden on their health plan customers and members while fostering independently developed fair and efficient payments to the providers. In essence, we sit in the midst of four constituencies – payors, employers/health plan sponsors, plan members and providers – offering an independent reimbursement solution to reduce healthcare costs in a manner that is orderly, efficient and fair to all parties involved, while also helping them to navigate the highly complex U.S. healthcare system.
These comprehensive offerings have enabled us to maintain long-term relationships with a number of our customers, including relationships of over 25 years with some of the nation's largest Payors. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our services identified approximately $21.7 billion in potential medical cost savings. In addition, because in most instances the fee for our services is directly linked to the savings utilized by our customers, our revenue model is aligned with the interests of our customers.
U.S. Healthcare Industry
According to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid ("CMS"), Americans spent $4.1 trillion, or 19.7% of U.S. GDP, on healthcare in 2020. That equates to about $12,530 per person and is projected to grow by 5.4% annually through 2028. CMS estimates that, at the current rate, healthcare spend will represent $6.2 trillion by 2028. The Census Bureau reports that about 298 million people in the U.S. had health insurance coverage in 2020, of which 177 million were covered under employer-sponsored plans. According to CMS, nearly 22 million people were enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans in 2020, and we conservatively estimate another 54 million were enrolled in managed Medicaid plans based on 2019 CMS figures. This means as many as 85% of those with health insurance coverage could benefit from the value MultiPlan delivers.
Medical spend is a function of both utilization and cost, and there are many factors driving the expected growth in both. Utilization is increasing due to a population that is both aging and experiencing more chronic disease. The advent of new treatments, modalities and technologies also spur utilization. Medical cost is increasing with increases in per-unit prices, driven in part by those same new treatments, modalities and technologies as well as the additional administrative burden of complying with new regulations. Costs also increase with the continued complexities of healthcare billing which lead to unintended billing issues. As expenditures continue to rise, stakeholders – and especially Payors – are becoming increasingly focused on solutions that reduce medical costs and improve billing and payment accuracy.
An estimated $1.2 trillion, or about a third of U.S. healthcare expenditures, are attributed to some form of waste or abuse that leads to overcharges. MultiPlan’s services directly address the category of waste/abuse that accounts for about $400 billion of this burden – excessive prices, clinical billing errors, suspect billing schemes and patterns, errors in enrollment data and, in some cases, services provided unnecessarily. 
We believe cost management and billing and payment accuracy will continue to be highly important to Payors across the markets we serve. We expect growth in demand for these services will be driven by two major trends: (i) increasing costs per claim from medical inflation and technology enhancements and (ii) increasing treatment volume from an aging population and increases in the insured population. As medical activity rises as a result of an aging population and a focus on preventative healthcare and technological advances, medical claims volume and costs are expected to increase significantly, which we believe will further increase utilization of our solutions. We see opportunity in trying to counter the accelerating pace of medical cost inflation, leading to more savings for our customers, and associated revenues for the Company. 
MultiPlan Solutions
Payors of healthcare have essentially three strategies for reducing medical cost: managing the utilization of medical services, lowering the per-unit cost of medical services incurred, and ensuring the services are reimbursed without error and accepted by the provider. MultiPlan services target the latter two of these approaches, as shown in the value chain from care to payment for healthcare services illustrated below.

Analytics-Based Services.
Our Analytics-Based Services reduce the per-unit cost of claims using data-driven negotiation and/or reference-based pricing methodologies. These services generally are used in a solution hierarchy after network services to reduce claims with no available network contract, but also are used standalone. Value-Driven Health Plan services bundle network and reference-based pricing to enable a blended benefit plan design. All of the services in this category leverage our information technology platform, public data sources, and the billions of claims that we have reviewed and are included in our database reflecting both network and out-of-network priced claims, as well as the results of clinical coding analyses. They feature proprietary algorithms and machine learning/AI to allow claims to be processed quickly and accurately. 
Reference-Based Pricing ("RBP"). RBP provides Payors with a recommended payment amount for claims based on a reference point. Most RBP programs in the market uses Medicare as the reference point. We also offer this option, but most customers elect to use our Data iSight program which uses facility cost as the facility reference and median reimbursed amounts as the professional reference. The facility pricing methodology features a patented benchmarking process that determines the cost of a group of like claims from like providers in the same geography. Both methodologies use data from readily-available public and private sources which feed our proprietary automated algorithms to deliver defensible, consistent pricing. RBP recommendations do not incorporate member protection from balance billing, so the service includes optional post-payment negotiation and patient advocacy services to negotiate settlements where needed to eliminate balance billing. Our cost-driven approach was developed with input from healthcare facilities, and was designed to addresses the typical issues providers have with reference-based pricing. As a result, we believe the propensity for providers to balance bill is materially lower than other similar services. Data iSight delivers provider acceptance of over 92% for facility and 96% for professional claims, and for those claims that are appealed, we successfully retain about 75% of savings through education and negotiation. We offer a number of additional choices of reference point, including: median contracted rates (adjusted to the Qualifying Payment Amount for certain surprise bill claims), and usual and customary charges. Our Reference-Based Pricing services are used by all types of Payors, most notably large commercial insurers, Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, provider-sponsored and independent health plans. They are most commonly priced at a percentage of savings identified.
Value-Driven Health Plan Services ("VDHP"). VDHP is a form of reference-based pricing that bundles member and provider engagement tools to enable employers and other health plan sponsors to offer low-cost health plans. The engagement tools include member shopping based on quality, cost and provider acceptance of the reimbursement; provider education and, where applicable, negotiation in advance or after payment; point-of-service cash payment processing; and other features designed to ensure satisfaction of both members and providers while delivering significant cost reduction. These tools distinguish VDHPs from other plans using RBP because they deliver many of the benefits that plan members and providers expect with a PPO network, and therefore make it feasible to replace the network either in part or in full. Provider acceptance of the reference price is about 98%. Our VDHP service offerings enable a range of VDHP configurations, including a "standard" form of VDHP which integrates our PPO network for professional and select facility services; a "full" VDHP which has no network; and a community-based VDHP which features an agreement with a marquee health system in the area to accept the reference-based price in exchange for preferred steerage of the health plan’s members. VDHP services are sold to employers 
directly using the broker/consultant channel, or through Third-Party Administrators ("TPAs"). Today, they are most in demand in the small and mid-sized group market. They are most commonly priced per-employee/member-per-month ("PEPM").
Financial Negotiation. Our financial negotiation services assist Payors with pricing claims from providers with whom neither they nor MultiPlan have been able to secure a contractual discount. We handle these claims on an individual basis and attempt to negotiate with the provider an acceptable payment amount for a specific claim that includes member protections from balance billing. Negotiation agreements protect the health plan member from balance billing. Approximately half of the successfully negotiated claims are completed in a fully automated manner. These claims include those in which the proposed negotiated amount is generated by algorithms and automatically transmitted to the provider’s office, and/or that are electronically accepted and signed by the provider. Certain providers also choose to set up an arrangement with MultiPlan for pre-determined levels of discount to be automatically deducted on claims that would otherwise be individually negotiated. For those claims that are not automatically negotiated, MultiPlan works directly with the provider's office through our negotiations staff, which is aided by extensive workflow and benchmarking tools. Financial negotiation services are used by all types of Payors, most notably Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, provider-sponsored and independent health plans. They are priced at a percentage of savings identified.
Surprise Billing Services. Introduced in 2021, our surprise billing services enable Payors to comply, or to help their employer/plan sponsor customers to comply, with the federal No Surprises Act ("NSA") which became effective on January 1, 2022. The NSA, and interim final regulations issued on July 13, 2021 and October 7, 2021 ("IFRs") that implemented the NSA, introduces changes to the reimbursement process of certain types of medical claims, increasing what was typically a one to two step reimbursement process to five steps. MultiPlan performs all five steps in an end-to-end service, or makes each step available as components to meet the specific needs of each Payor. The steps require extensive data collection and analysis to identify claims as surprise bills under the law’s definition; calculate the new QPA benchmark introduced by the law and append it to the claim; create an initial payment amount for the claim, typically by using the QPA as the reference point; negotiate a settlement as needed; and take claims through an independent dispute resolution process as needed. We leverage existing technology and expertise in data science, claim pricing and negotiation in offering these new services. They are used by all types of Payors that must comply with the NSA, and are priced either at a percentage of savings for the end-to-end service, or on a per-claim basis for individual components.
Network-Based Services
Our Network-Based Services reduce the per-unit cost of claims through contracts with over 1.2 million healthcare providers and facilities that establish discounts with member protection from balance billing in exchange for patient steerage and other provider-friendly terms and conditions. These services generally are used first in a solution hierarchy with members actively steered to participating providers through online and other directories. The services leverage our extensive network development, credentialing and data management capabilities as well as a sophisticated transaction engine that matches rendering provider information on the claim to the correct network contract so the discount can be applied. We offer a variety of network configurations to support all types and sizes of health plans, generally used as either the primary network, or as a complement to another primary network. 
Primary Networks. For Payors without their own direct contractual discount arrangements with providers, our primary networks serve as the network for the Payor’s commercial or government health plans in a given service area in exchange for a PEPM rate, or as the Payor’s out-of-area extended primary network in exchange for a percentage of the savings identified. Our national primary network, branded PHCS Network, has been continuously accredited for credentialing by the National Committee for Quality Assurance ("NCQA") since 2001. We believe this provides assurances to employers/plan sponsors and plan members of the quality of providers in the network. Customers mainly include provider-sponsored and independent health plans; Medicare Advantage plans; Taft-Hartley plans and TPAs, as it is more cost effective for these Payors to outsource this function than to incur the expense of developing and maintaining their own network of thousands of doctors and hospitals. We also offer custom development of primary networks, leveraging our extensive network development team and analytic tools, including a tool combining internal provider data with public sources to enable strategic targeting of providers to be contracted. Customers of this custom build service include Medicare Advantage and Medicaid health plans seeking assistance with expansion plans or help maintaining the required network adequacy.
Complementary Networks. Our complementary networks provide Payor customers with access to our national network of healthcare providers that offer discounts under the health plan’s out-of-network benefits, or otherwise can be accessed secondary to another network. Payors use the network to expand provider choice for consumers, and to achieve contracted reductions with member protections on more claims. The service is priced based on a percentage of savings identified. Customers most commonly include large commercial insurers, property and casualty carriers via their bill review vendors, Taft-Hartley plans, provider-sponsored and independent health plans, and some TPAs.
Payment and Revenue Integrity Services
Our Payment and Revenue Integrity Services improve the accuracy of payments made to providers, leading to a reduction in overall medical cost by minimizing overpayments. They use data, technology and clinical expertise to assist Payors in identifying improper, unnecessary and excessive charges before or after claims are paid, as well as issues with premiums paid by CMS for government health plans caused by discrepancies with enrollment-related data. Payment integrity services can be used before payment, to correct overpayments before they are issued, or after payment to enable the recovery of overpaid dollars. Revenue integrity services identify and correct errors in plan enrollment data that lead to underpayment of CMS premium dollars. The services rely heavily on our internal and other data sources, advanced analysis, machine learning and transaction processing technology, as well as clinical expertise to aid in the identification and selection of issues to be addressed with the least provider abrasion.
Pre-Payment Clinical Reviews. Pre-payment claims are taken through payment integrity analytics, which may include any of the following additional reviews: medical coder, clinician, medical record or itemized bill. Claims are returned with recommended corrections or routed to a negotiator to leverage the billing issues to reach agreement with member protections for a lower reimbursement. The negotiation service targets non-contracted claims; the correction service targets all claims, including a Payor’s in-network claims. These services are most commonly used by large commercial and Medicare Advantage/Medicaid insurers, Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, and provider-sponsored and other independent health plans. Claims are priced based on a percentage of savings identified. The services also are integrated into MultiPlan's network pricing and analytics-based services so the majority of customers benefit from our pre-payment integrity services. 
Coordination of Benefits and Subrogation Services (pre- and post-payment). Coordination of Benefits identifies payments that should have been made by a health plan member's other health insurance coverage (for example, if the member's spouse has coverage through another employer-sponsored plan). Subrogation Services identify payments made related to an accident that are the responsibility of another responsible third party. The services use data, technology and highly experienced staff to identify cases, validate coverage status, report or recover dollars paid in error, and assist with root cause correction to avoid future potential overpayments. Subrogation services are also available in a Software-as-a-Service ("SaaS") model. These services are used by commercial, Medicare Advantage and Managed Medicaid Payors and depending on the service are priced based on a percentage of savings identified and/or recovered, per member per year, or per member with primary coverage identified. 
Data Mining and Clinical Audits (post-payment). Data Mining deploys payment integrity analytics combining industry-accepted rules and plan-specific policies to identify overpayments associated with claim adjudication errors, billing errors and contract language, as well as their root causes. Findings are returned to the Payor for action. Clinical Audits utilize clinical subject matter experts to review medical records related to a claim to ensure that the claim was billed and coded appropriately. Clinical audits include Diagnosis Related Group validation, medical necessity short stay review, itemized bill review, and hospital bill audit. These services are used by commercial, Medicare Advantage, Managed Medicaid and state Medicaid Payors and are priced based on a percentage of savings identified and/or recovered. Depending on the engagement, some clinical audit programs may be priced based per claim reviewed.
Revenue Integrity Services. Targeting issues unique to Medicare Advantage Payors, these services use data, technology, and clinical expertise to identify and restore underpaid premiums, and to improve accuracy of future premiums paid to Medicare Advantage plans by CMS. There are three services currently offered, typically used in combination: Medicare Secondary Payor interfaces with CMS to confirm member eligibility records for primacy, correct inaccuracies, and help restore and preserve underpaid premium dollars; End Stage Renal Disease ("ESRD") analyzes claim data to identify Medicare Advantage plan members with missing ESRD statuses at CMS and works with dialysis providers and CMS to correct the statuses; and Part D Other Health Insurance ("OHI") leverages analytics to identify Medicare Advantage plan members where the Part D Pharmacy Coverage on file with CMS is inaccurate and effectuates corrections with CMS. The updated Part D information improves compliance, efficiencies and member satisfaction. These services are priced based on a percentage of the CMS premiums restored to the Medicare Advantage Payor. Part D OHI is priced per validated member with other primary Part D coverage.
Mission and Growth Strategy
According to the Peterson-Kaiser Family Foundation Health System Tracker, at an estimated $12,000 per person, the United States has the highest per capita healthcare spend among the 11 high income countries. Yet, in terms of healthcare quality and efficacy, we rank last. Our mission is to deliver fairness, efficiency and affordability to U.S. healthcare, and our services, data, technology, expertise and connectivity are aimed at addressing this dichotomy. We have historically focused on two of the three levers Payors can use to manage medical spend: lowering per-unit costs related to administrative overhead, and improving billing and payment accuracy. For the most part, we also have focused on spend associated with out-of-network utilization although in 2014 we began to offer payment integrity services designed to add value for a Payor’s in-network claims. 
Our growth strategy leverages our longstanding relationships with Payors and extensive proprietary data and algorithms to not only accelerate our shift to in-network claims, but also to develop a beachhead for expanding our value to other Payor functions that service their plan members and the providers that service those members. The strategy has three components being executed simultaneously: Enhance, Extend and Expand. 
The first part of our strategy is enhancing our platform. We do this by improving and innovating upon our existing products to deliver more value on the claim volume we already receive from existing customers. We have and continue to make investments in combining proprietary data with third party data, and in advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve service performance. We also have invested in sales resources to heighten cross-selling activity with existing customers.
The second element of the strategy is extending our platform. We do this by deepening penetration in customer segments we consider to be large markets where we either develop or acquire capabilities to address an unmet client need. Our initial target segments are a Payor’s in-network claims, government programs such as Medicare Advantage and Managed Medicaid, TPAs and the Property and Casualty sector. We leverage sales and product development initiatives, both organic and through acquisition, to execute on this part of the strategy. Our acquisitions of HST in 2020 and Discovery Health Partners in 2021 are two examples of our work on this strategy, both adding new services with HST focused on TPAs and their employer customers and Discovery significantly increasing our footprint with in-network claims for commercial plans as well as Medicare Advantage and Medicaid plans.
The third element of the strategy is to expand our platform to new business models that deliver value-added, primarily Payor-centric services for providers and healthcare consumers. We expect to execute on this component through corporate and business development efforts, and believe we are well positioned given the 1.2 million healthcare providers we have under contract and the more than 60 million consumers estimated to have access to MultiPlan's services. Our data, algorithms and service components can be leveraged by us, our Payor customers, and partner software companies to tackle some of providers' and consumers' biggest pain points, such as transparency of patient medical bills and consumer financing of medical expenses. 
Markets
We work with healthcare payors in the commercial healthcare, government healthcare and property and casualty markets. Substantially all of MultiPlan's services are available in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. All services are available to all applicable customers regardless of geographic location, company type or size.
Commercial Health
Commercial healthcare accounted for about 28% of the total $4.1 trillion medical spend in 2020. Commercial health plans are offered either as an insured program where the plan sponsor – typically an employer – and its members pay a monthly premium and the insurer pays the medical costs from those premium dollars, or as self-insured plans funded by the employer/plan sponsor and its members from a pool of funds earmarked for this purpose. Self-insured plans typically are administered by insurance companies or TPAs. Often, particularly for the national insurers, this "Administrative Services Only" ("ASO") business is larger than the at-risk insured business. In the quarter ended September 30, 2021, consistent with MultiPlan’s revenue mix, the four largest publicly-held commercial health insurers reported that 80% of their membership was in self-insured plans. 
MultiPlan services benefit both fully-insured and self-insured health plans. We work with fully-insured plans directly, including national insurers, Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, provider-sponsored and independent health plans. Because these entities are responsible for paying for medical claims, they are typically focused primarily on cost management and billing and payment accuracy with member features given less emphasis. These plans favor MultiPlan’s Analytics-Based Services, and in particular RBP, over Network-Based Services. 
We work with self-insured plans primarily through their plan administrators, which include the same types of companies as well as TPAs and sometimes the employers/plan sponsors themselves. Over 85% of our 2021 revenues are attributed to self-insured plans we service through their payors or directly. According to a Kaiser Family Foundation's Employer Health Benefits survey, healthcare premiums exceeded $22,000 in 2021, with employees paying nearly $6,000 toward their cost of care. Self-insured plan sponsors are responsible for paying medical claims as well as for the satisfaction of their plan members. In a tight employment market, particularly with large employers, choice of benefits and member satisfaction concerns may have equal or more weight than medical cost. This leads to the need for Payors to offer variety in plan designs, and according to Kaiser Family Foundation, over two-thirds of large employers offer at least two benefit plan options to their employees. Consequently, these plans often include Network-Based Services in their service hierarchies and/or use the "standard" VDHP services that integrate the professional PPO network in order to generate savings for both plan and plan member. Larger Payors servicing self-insured plans also have extensive customized processing logic to support plan design variability as the labor market shifts, and one such customer has well over 100,000 such rules in place. 
The commercial health segment also includes individual health plans which are always insured, and may or may not be sold through the Affordable Care Act exchanges. MultiPlan supports individual plans through the insurance companies offering these plans, and does not sell to the individual directly.
Government Programs
This market segment includes Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, Federal Employees Health Benefits, Veterans Administration and other federal health programs (state and municipal government health plans typically are managed as commercial plans). Commercial insurers and health plans also participate in this market segment, but there also are Payors that operate government plans exclusively. Most, but not all, of MultiPlan’s commercial healthcare services also are of value to Payors of government programs. 
Medicare Advantage. Medicare Advantage ("MA") plans serve the Medicare-eligible population in a private plan alternative to traditional Medicare. Kaiser Family Foundation reports that enrollment in MA plans more than doubled over the last decade. As of 2021, an estimated 26 million people were enrolled in MA plans, comprising 37% of the total Medicare population. The population grew from about 21.6 million, or 36% of the total 60 million Medicare enrollees in 2020. MA Payors have a greater need for billing and payment accuracy than they do cost management, because healthcare prices largely are set. With the dramatic growth this segment has and continues to see, there is heightened competition which also drives the need for assistance in building network access. Today, these Payors use MultiPlan’s payment and revenue integrity services, and also may outsource some portion of their provider network development to MultiPlan.
Medicaid and Managed Medicaid. An estimated 76.3 million people were enrolled in Medicaid and 6.9 million were enrolled in CHIP (Children’s Health Insurance Program) plans as of June 2021. This reflects growth of 12.3% and 3.2%, respectively, over June 2020 figures. At 2019, 83% of Medicaid enrollees were in a managed Medicaid program. Enrollment has been growing as a result of the Medicaid expansion allowed under the Affordable Care Act. To date, 39 states and the District of Columbia have expanded or have committed to expand their Medicaid programs. The most recent growth is likely attributable to Families First Coronavirus Response Act ("FFCRA"), which created a temporary increase in the Medicaid Federal Medical Assistance Percentage ("FMAP"). As with MA, MultiPlan’s services in this segment are primarily limited to payment integrity services with some custom network development also of use to bidders winning state Medicaid business under a request for proposal ("RFP"). 
Other Programs. We have a history of developing custom networks for TRICARE and Veterans Administration programs. These are RFP driven and MultiPlan partners with one or more Payors bidding on the business.
Property and Casualty
This market segment includes payors of the medical services arising from work-related injuries and auto accidents, as well as other types of property and casualty insurance. There is little overlap between the commercial and government Payors and those in this segment. Often the insurers are serviced by third parties that perform bill review services which include access to provider networks. We typically work with these service providers versus the carriers directly.
Workers' Compensation. Workers' compensation insurers must pay both the indemnity costs and the medical costs associated with an injured worker. Recent trends in medical cost inflation have become a major driver in the overall cost growth for workers' compensation insurers. Medical services today constitute about 60% of workers' compensation claims costs, up from 40% in the early 1980s. Rising medical costs have increased focus on cost management measures for the medical portion of workers' compensation insurance claims. We provide network access and pre-payment integrity services to these Payors. Our analytics-based services are used to a lesser extent, primarily because the majority of states have established fee schedules which providers expect to be reimbursed from, in the absence of a network contract that provides other benefits to the Payor.
Auto Medical. Auto insurance carriers face costs from auto damage and medical claims. Economic losses for bodily injury liability claims increased 10% annually from 2012 – 2017, well above the 3% annual medical inflation rate, with medical expenses accounting for 79% of claimed losses. With ongoing medical cost inflation, this trend is expected to continue into the future. MultiPlan’s value in this segment is similar to the Workers’ Comp segment – network access and payment integrity services primarily, with some interest in analytics-based services where state fee schedules are not in place. 
Customers
MultiPlan works directly with Payors to manage medical cost and billing and payment accuracy for their own fully-insured health plans, and for their Administrative Services Only ("ASO"), self-insured employers/plan sponsors. We estimate that in 2021 our Payor customers served over 100,000 employers/plan sponsors actively using our services through the ASO channel, which generated over 85% of our combined Network and Analytics revenues in 2021. Within the ASO channel, the top 10 plan sponsors represent less than 20% of our combined Analytics and Network revenues in 2021. We also indirectly service 
consumers accessing healthcare services through commercial and government health plans or property and casualty policies. An estimated 60 million consumers have access to our services through their health plans. In aggregate, we serve a diverse customer base comprised of national and regional insurance companies, Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, provider-sponsored and independent health plans, TPAs, self-insured health plans, Property and Casualty bill review companies and other companies involved in the claim adjudication process. 
We believe that we have strong relationships with our customers, which include substantially all of the largest health plans. The loss of the business of one or more of our larger customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our three largest customers accounted for approximately 34%, 19% and 10%, respectively, of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021. Contract terms with larger customers are often three and as many as five years, while mid- to small-sized customer contracts are often annual and typically include automatic one-year renewals. However, we continue to experience high renewal rates and our top ten customers based on full year 2021 revenues have been customers for an average of 25 years. Our customer relationships are further strengthened by high switching costs as MultiPlan is electronically linked to customers in their time-sensitive claims processing functions, and we support highly flexible benefits offerings to an extensive group of customers who often feature a MultiPlan logo on membership cards when networks are used.
Network
As of December 31, 2021, our network includes over 1.2 million healthcare providers. Our team of approximately 100 network development professionals manages these network relationships across our Primary and Complementary PPO Networks. For both networks, the team is responsible for strengthening our existing relationships with these providers. For existing providers, the goal of the network development team is to help providers maintain participation across products as well as increase the discounts the providers extend to our customers that utilize our provider networks.
In addition, the network development team is responsible for executing new contracts with providers that are not currently affiliated with our networks, either under our own contracts or on behalf of a payor that seeks to outsource its network development function. We strategically grow the number of providers that participate across all network product lines so we can continue to increase the value we provide to our customers. The network development team manages a sophisticated program of data mining, profiling, recruiting and ultimately contracting with new providers. An incentive driven pay-for-performance plan measures and rewards the success of our network development team.
Sales and Marketing
Our largest customers are serviced by a team of national account managers and senior executives responsible for continued growth of the relationship. The account team partners strategically with our customers, leveraging our Healthcare Economics unit to mine the customer's data and proactively present opportunities to the customer to improve performance and competitive position. This team also delivers account service, including daily claims management, RFPs, service inquiries and other marketing and operational support functions. The national account managers are compensated with a base salary plus bonus linked to customer retention.
The majority of our customers are serviced by a dedicated team of account managers and account service professionals organized into three market-focused departments — Health Plans (commercial and government), TPA/Employer, and Property and Casualty. These teams also include sales professionals responsible for new customer acquisition. The market-focused account managers are responsible for relationship management as well as for growing revenue through expanded use of services. They are compensated with a base salary plus a bonus and commission based on customer retention and revenue from upselling new products. The sales professionals are compensated with a base salary plus commission based on revenue from new customers. Sales and upselling efforts are supported by a marketing team which generates leads, builds brand awareness, implements and educates customers and develops proposals.
Information Technology
We believe that our IT platform provides us with a substantial competitive advantage. We have made significant investments in upgrading our IT infrastructure enabling us to automatically process significantly more transactions with greater accuracy and greatly improving our capacity to continuously serve our customers. Our IT is certified under HITRUST, NIST and AICPA SOC programs and in May 2020, we were rated at the top of our peer group by BitSight, an IT security rating organization. Our proprietary network repricing application is capable of returning approximately 99% of repriced claims to our Payor customers on the same day. In 2021, our pre-payment integrity and reference-based pricing services returned 99% and 97%, respectively, of claims within one day. Our proprietary negotiation application features portal technology with electronic signature acceptance, sophisticated claim distribution and prioritization algorithms enhanced with machine learning. We have implemented connectivity via EDI or direct integration using web services with all of our top customers. During 2021, nearly all of the claims processed in our system were received via EDI or direct web service integration. As we process more claims 
through EDI and direct web service integration, our substantial back office interconnectivity significantly reduces complexity and the number of processing errors. Because our IT platform is scalable, it is generally able to absorb substantial increases in volume at minimal marginal costs.
In addition to its high levels of security and throughput, our IT platform is enhanced with access to over three petabytes of structured data and 12 petabytes of total structured and unstructured data. The data reflects about one billion claims, growing steadily through the approximately 525,000 claims we process every day. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had the capacity to increase processing capacity three-fold with the current infrastructure.
Competition
Our competitors vary by service as follows.
Analytics-Based Services. MultiPlan competes with a variety of medical cost management companies for negotiation, reference-based pricing and surprise billing services. We compete for these services on the basis of savings effectiveness, provider acceptance, and plan member satisfaction. Our workflow and claim processing technology, user interaction and analytic algorithms are key competitive advantages. MultiPlan's competitors for these services typically are reference-based pricing services. They can be classified as programs intended to partially or fully replace networks, such as 6Degrees, AMPS, ELAP Services and Payer Compass, and those primarily accessed behind a full network, such as Zelis, ClearHealth Strategies and Naviguard.
Network-Based Services. We compete directly with other independent PPO networks, which are primarily regional, and with PPO network aggregators. We compete with independent PPO networks primarily on the basis of network discounts and access, but also on the basis of quality, independence and price. Our nationwide Primary PPO Network is NCQA accredited, which we believe provides assurances to payors and consumers regarding the quality of the providers in our network. Because some independent PPO networks are owned by large commercial payors, our customers may prefer to purchase PPO network services from a fully independent vendor. PPO aggregators offer national access by patching together third-party networks, in some cases including MultiPlan's network. While aggregators rely on third-party networks, MultiPlan's network features direct contracts with 98% of its participating providers. MultiPlan's competitors for these services typically include First Health, TRPN, and Zelis. 
Payment and Revenue Integrity Services. We compete with a variety of larger and smaller vendors of payment and revenue integrity services. Our Payment Integrity solutions compete on the basis of analytic breadth and depth, human expertise and scope. Virtually all payment integrity competitors originated as post-payment specialists and to varying degrees have migrated services to a pre-payment modality, while our services were built to focus on examining claims before payment occurs and now, with the recent acquisition of DHP, we have a broader capability to address post-payment integrity. Our Revenue Integrity solutions compete on the basis of identification and assistance in restoration and preservation of underpaid premiums from CMS caused by member eligibility and status errors. Our competitors for these services typically include Change Healthcare Inc., Conduent, Cotiviti, Inc., Optum, SCIO and The Rawlings Group. 
Government Regulations 
We believe that each of MultiPlan's service offerings bears less risk than other healthcare businesses that bear insurance risk and bill federal healthcare programs or directly provide care. While we support our customers that are regulated entities, we generally are not directly regulated and face significantly lower levels of regulatory complexity. We function as a transaction processor and we believe we have limited risk for services or billing.
MultiPlan does not deliver healthcare services, provide or manage healthcare services, provide care or care management. We do not bear insurance, underwriting, payment, malpractice or reimbursement risks, nor do we adjudicate or pay claims. Our business is compensated directly by private payor customers, not by Medicare, Medicaid or other government healthcare programs. In some instances, we provide services to payors that contract directly with a federal or state agency. In those instances, we may be subject to certain federal and state law requirements associated with those programs as a First Tier, Downstream or Related entity (FDR). As an FDR to these customers, we are subject to requirements which prohibit an individual or entity who has been convicted of program-related crimes or other violations from providing services to, or receiving payment from, government healthcare programs. As an FDR, we are subject to affirmative legal obligations, as well as contractual requirements with our customers, to check the exclusion status of the individuals and entities we employ against lists of excluded individuals and entities prior to entering into employment or contractual relationships with them, and to periodically re-check such lists thereafter, or run the risk of liability under civil monetary penalties laws or a breach of our contractual obligations. We are also required to provide access to contracts, books and records pertaining to services performed in connection with federal or state agency contracts. A failure to comply with FDR requirements or violations of healthcare 
laws could subject us to audits, corrective actions, contract terminations, criminal or civil penalties, debarment or exclusion from government health care programs.
We are, however, subject, either directly or indirectly through our customer relationships, to federal and state laws and regulations governing privacy, security and breaches of patient information and the conduct of certain electronic health care transactions, including, for example, HIPAA, which imposes rules protecting individually identifiable health information and setting national standards for the security of electronic PHI. We are a "Business Associate" (as defined by HIPAA) of our customers. As such, we must comply with all applicable provisions of HIPAA, including the HIPAA Security Rule and applicable provisions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule and the Breach Notification Rule. Violations of such provisions may result in civil monetary penalties, resolution agreements, monitoring agreements, and, in certain circumstances, criminal penalties including fines and/or imprisonment. HIPAA also authorizes state attorneys general to file suit on behalf of their residents. Although HIPAA does not create a private right of action allowing individuals to sue in civil court for violations, the laws and regulations have been used as the basis for duty of care in state civil suits such as those for negligence or recklessness in the misuse or breach of patient information. In addition to HIPAA, there are federal and state laws that protect types of personal information that may be viewed as particularly sensitive, including substance use information, genetic information, HIV/AIDS status, and mental health information. The Federal Trade Commission has also interpreted existing consumer protection laws to impose standards for the collection, storage, processing, use, retention, disclosure, transfer, disposal, and security of information about individuals, including health-related information. State privacy laws are changing rapidly. Massachusetts and New York, for example, have enacted regulations and statutes that require any entity that holds, transmits or collects certain personal information about their residents to adopt a written data security plan meeting the requirements set forth in the statute. In California, the CCPA, as amended by CPRA, provides California residents with a number of privacy-related rights and is more stringent in many respects than other state laws currently in effect in the United States. Further, there currently are also a number of proposals related to data privacy or security pending before federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies, including in a number of states considering consumer protection laws similar to those in California, Colorado and Virginia. These laws are contributing to increased enforcement activity and may also be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities.
In addition, we are subject to certain state licensure and/or certification laws and other state and federal laws and regulations governing our operations and our products. Among other examples, contracts governing our relationships with healthcare providers may be subject to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, federal False Claims Act and comparable state laws, as well as state laws prohibiting fee-splitting and the corporate practice of medicine and state and federal laws regarding transparency. The federal False Claims Act, for example, prohibits knowingly submitting or causing to be submitted false claims or statements to the federal government, including to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The law contains whistleblower provisions, which allow private individuals to sue on behalf of the federal government, alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government. The government has used the FCA to prosecute Medicare and other government healthcare program fraud such as billing for services not provided, coding errors, and providing care that is not medically necessary or that is substandard in quality. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. States have similar false claims act laws. Failure to comply with such laws can result in civil or criminal liability such as penalties, fines, and/or exclusion from federal healthcare programs. Furthermore, we may be subject to some state laws regulating the ability of PPOs to allow broad access to their provider networks. We may directly or indirectly be subject to state and federal regulation regarding the payment of out-of-network claims, including regulations regarding the determination of payment amounts and what data and other factors are permitted to be used by commercial health payors and other payors in making such determinations, as well as regulations targeting surprise billing and requiring transparency. 
For example, effective January 1, 2022, the NSA prohibits certain out-of-network providers from charging patients an amount beyond the in-network cost sharing amount for services rendered, subject to limited exceptions. For services for which balance billing is prohibited, the NSA establishes an independent dispute resolution ("IDR") process for providers and payors to handle payment disputes that cannot be resolved through direct negotiation. The law is being implemented through IFRs issued on July 13, 2021 and October 7, 2021 by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and other governmental entities. The IFRs provide that, when making a payment determination, the IDR entity must begin with the presumption that the QPA is the appropriate out-of-network rate for the service at issue. The IDR entity must select the offer closest to the QPA unless the provider or payor submits credible evidence that clearly demonstrates the QPA is materially different from the appropriate out-of-network rate. The additional factors that may be considered by the IDR entity are secondary to the QPA. The IFRs are currently subject to several legal challenges, and it is difficult to predict the outcome of efforts to challenge or modify the IFRs or how such challenges may affect our enhancements or offerings within our Analytics-Based Services category.
We may directly or indirectly be subject to regulation in some states governing the submission of true and accurate claims, or regarding the application of payment integrity edits to claims, including regulations impacting what data and other factors are 
permitted to be used by commercial health payors and other payors in making such determinations. Our services may directly or indirectly be subject to state regulations specifically covering certain categories of clients, such as workers compensation insurers and auto medical insurers. We regularly monitor legislative and regulatory activity in all states and at the federal level that could impact any of the products we offer in all relevant market segments. In addition, we are committed to supporting our clients in meeting their regulatory obligations, so we work cooperatively with them in establishing processes and procedures that comply with applicable requirements.
While we believe that we are in compliance with such laws and regulations and we will undertake efforts to comply with new laws and regulations, once effective, a failure to comply with these laws and regulations could adversely affect our contractual relationships and possibly expose us to civil or criminal sanctions by federal or state authorities. Please see the section entitled "Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business and Operations."
Human Capital
Our employees are our most critical assets. Our ability to achieve our strategic objectives, deliver high quality customer service, drive operational excellence and deliver strong financial performance is only achievable through the talent, expertise, and dedication of our team. The long-term success and continued growth of our business depends in large part on our ability to attract, reward, retain, and develop diverse, talented, and high-performing employees at all levels of our organization.
We employed approximately 2,400 people as of December 31, 2021, substantially all of whom are full time employees and none of whom are covered by unions. We believe that we have a good relationship with our employees.
The following are some of the significant investments we make in our employees and their development:
Compensation and Benefits. We offer competitive pay, and a robust benefits package, including healthcare benefits, flexible spending accounts, life insurance, short-term and long-term disability plans, a generous Paid Time Off (PTO) policy, and a 401(k) Plan with employer match. We also offer voluntary wellness programs which can result in reduced benefit premiums, employee assistance programs, tuition assistance programs, voluntary benefits programs (including home & auto insurance, pet insurance, legal services, etc.), summer hours and employee referral programs. 
In addition, children of eligible full-time employees may qualify for the MultiPlan scholarship program. 
Through our MultiPlan Helping Hands program (formerly named MultiPlan ACTS), we are able to provide financial assistance for employees experiencing hardship; the program is funded 100% from employee donations and is administered by the Helping Hands Committee, comprised of MultiPlan employees.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, MultiPlan established the One MultiPlan Fund. Established by MultiPlan and funded in part by employee donations, the One MultiPlan Fund provides direct assistance to colleagues facing financial hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
MultiPlan also continues the PTO Donation Program that enables employees to donate their accrued paid time off to a general pool to be used by fellow colleagues who are experiencing a financial hardship due to a medical emergency or due to a major disaster (as declared by the President of the United States), and who have exhausted all paid leave available to them. 
Health and Safety. The physical and mental health of our employees is vital to our success. We sponsor a wellness program designed to enhance physical and mental well-being for all of our employees. Throughout the year, we encourage healthy behaviors through regular communications, educational sessions, voluntary progress tracking, wellness challenges, and other incentives. 
As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, we responded quickly by enabling our teams to work remotely to ensure the health and safety of our employees, while continuing to provide uninterrupted service to our customers. We implemented a COVID-19 global task force to prioritize our pandemic response, and, in 2021, we began a phased re-opening plan, implementing a number of safety and social distancing measures in our sites to protect the health and safety of our employees who chose to return during the initial phases. With the identification of the Delta and Omnicron variants, our re-opening plans slowed and we generally remain in a voluntary return to work posture. As the pandemic continues, we remain committed to our plan for staged office reentry when safe to do so. Additionally, we are focused on supporting access to COVID-19 vaccines for our employees, including by providing additional paid time off to facilitate employees’ ability to receive their vaccinations. We continue to provide communications and information to our employees through an internal Coronavirus Information Center, all with the goal of keeping our employees and communities healthy, safe and informed.
Diversity Inclusion and Belonging. We strive to create a workplace that fosters mutual respect and collaboration, where talented individuals from all backgrounds, perspectives and abilities can participate and perform their best work. In 2020, we formed a Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging ("DIB") Governance Committee to establish, oversee and advance MultiPlan's DIB program. The committee seeks to champion and foster organizational changes with a dedicated focus on DIB priorities, to facilitate the integration of the DIB program with our corporate objectives and values, to create accountability for program results and to engage and communicate with the MultiPlan community on all DIB efforts.
In 2021, employees completed a survey providing insight on individual perceptions of our commitment and performance on DIB, with the results shared with all employees. As part of the annual training initiatives, employees are asked to complete five hours of DIB training, including a course provided by the Company plus additional hours selected from other DIB educational resources provided by us or other outside opportunities chosen by the employee. In addition, employees were invited to take a pledge to support our efforts to positively impact its employees and local communities, and to foster a culture of mutual respect for individuals from all backgrounds, perspectives, and abilities. 
MultiPlan partners with America's Job Exchange, in the recruiting process, to ensure job postings are distributed to diversity websites to expand visibility to individuals seeking employment opportunities from a wide variety of backgrounds. We also partner with local CareerOneStop services for outreach.
Learning and Development. We believe that education is essential to MultiPlan employees’ professional growth and our organization's success. To support this belief, our Corporate Education Department offers many learning opportunities beginning with our new employee orientation and continuing with our ongoing operational, compliance and DIB training plus a variety of optional courses to help employees further their career development on topics such as: business management, personal productivity and working with teams. 
Talent Management. We also believe that it is important to foster employee feedback and recognition. We utilize our MultiSTAR: MultiPlan Service Talent Achievement & Reward program to allow colleagues an opportunity to acknowledge co-workers for their great work and to recognize their professional accomplishments. 
Community Giving. Each MultiPlan office has a Charitable Giving Committee that holds charitable activities throughout the year, and we maintain a MultiPlan Matching Gifts Program. We have continued to focus on our giving efforts even while working remotely during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Corporate History and Background
Our predecessor was founded in 1980 as a New York-based hospital network, but we are by no means just a network company. We evolved both organically and through acquisitions from that regional network to a leading independent national PPO player, and then to a data- and technology-driven provider of cost management, payment and revenue integrity services company. Other notable acquisitions, in addition to the recent acquisitions of HST and Discovery Health Partners, were BCE Emergis Corporation, in 2004, which extended network access nationally and added a negotiation services platform; Private Healthcare Systems, Inc., in 2006, which added a National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA)-accredited, national primary PPO network; Viant, in 2010, which added analytics-based services and additional network access including for Medicare Advantage and Medicaid plans; NCN, in 2011, which added the Data iSight pricing service; and Medical Audit and Review Solutions, in 2014, which added pre-payment integrity services. 
Churchill Capital Corp III (formerly known as Butler Acquisition Corp), was incorporated in Delaware on October 30, 2019 for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. 
On July 12, 2020, Churchill entered into the Merger Agreement by and among First Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub, Holdings, and MultiPlan Parent. On October 8, 2020, the Merger was consummated and the Transactions were completed. In connection with the Transactions, Churchill changed its name to MultiPlan Corporation and The New York Stock Exchange ticker symbols for its Class A common stock and warrants to "MPLN" and "MPLN.WS", respectively.
The Transactions were accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded, in accordance with GAAP. Under this method of accounting, Churchill was treated as the "acquired" company for financial reporting purposes with MultiPlan Parent determined to be the accounting acquirer. This determination was primarily based on the existing MultiPlan Parent stockholders being the majority stockholders and holding majority voting power in the combined company, MultiPlan Parent's senior management comprising the majority of the senior management of the combined company, and the ongoing operations of MultiPlan Parent comprising the ongoing operations of the combined company. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Transactions were treated as the equivalent of MultiPlan Parent issuing shares for the net assets of 
Churchill, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of Churchill were recognized at fair value (which were consistent with carrying value), with no goodwill or other intangibles recorded. See Note 4, The Transactions of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for further information on the Transactions.
