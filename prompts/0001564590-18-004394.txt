ITEM 1. Business
General Description of Our Business
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of programmed cellular immunotherapies for cancer and immune disorders. We are developing first-in-class cell therapy product candidates based on a simple notion: we believe that better cell therapies start with better cells. 
 To create better cell therapies, we use an approach that we generally refer to as cell programming. For certain of our product candidates, we use pharmacologic modulators, such as small molecules, to enhance the biological properties and therapeutic function of cells ex vivo before our product candidates are administered to a patient. In other cases, we use human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), generate a clonal master iPSC line having preferred biological properties, and direct the fate of the clonal master iPSC line to create our cell therapy product candidate. We believe the use of clonal master iPSC lines may enable the creation of cell therapy product candidates that are well-defined and uniform in composition; that can be reproducibly manufactured at significant scale; and that can be used to treat a large number of patients in an off-the-shelf manner. Utilizing these therapeutic approaches, we program cells of the immune system, including natural killer (NK) cells, T cells and CD34+ cells, and are advancing a pipeline of programmed cellular immunotherapies in the therapeutic areas of immuno-oncology and immuno-regulation.
 
The following table summarizes our programmed cellular immunotherapies currently under development and our cell programming partnerships:

Our Cell Programming Approach
 
The use of human cells as therapeutic entities has disease-transforming potential, and compelling evidence of their medical benefit exists across a broad spectrum of severe, life-threatening diseases. One of the most successful and widespread applications of cell therapy is hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), with over 60,000 procedures performed worldwide on an annual basis. HCT holds curative potential for patients afflicted with hematologic malignancies, such as leukemia and lymphoma, and with rare genetic disorders, such as hemoglobinopathies, inherited metabolic disorders and immune deficiencies.
 2



Building upon this well-established medical precedent, the clinical investigation of hematopoietic cells, including NK cells, T cells and CD34+ cells, as therapies for the treatment of human diseases is rapidly expanding. Many of these clinical trials are investigating transformative applications in the field of cancer immunotherapy to control, and potentially eradicate, tumor growth. While advancements in the isolation, expansion and manufacture of cells have opened new avenues for their use as therapeutic entities, we believe the biological properties and therapeutic function of cells, including the activation and/or modification of effector cells to better recognize tumor cells, persist longer or exhibit more potent and specific anti-tumor activity, can be enhanced ex vivo prior to patient administration to maximize therapeutic benefit.
 
We are using advanced molecular characterization tools and technologies to identify small molecule and biologic modulators that promote rapid and supra-physiologic activation or inhibition of therapeutically-relevant genes and cell-surface proteins, such as those involved in the homing, proliferation and survival of CD34+ cells or those involved in the persistence, proliferation and anti-tumor activity of NK cells and T cells. We apply our deep understanding of the hematopoietic system to rapidly assess and quantify the potential therapeutic benefits of ex vivo cell programming in the settings of cancer and immune disorders. We believe that this highly differentiated therapeutic approach – systematically and precisely programming the biological properties and therapeutic function of cells ex vivo prior to adoptive transfer – is a reproducible, scalable and cost-effective approach to maximize the safety and efficacy of cell therapies.
 
Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with their capacity to be indefinitely expanded and differentiated in culture into any type of cell in the body, hold revolutionary potential for creating better cell therapies. The groundbreaking discovery that fully differentiated human cells can be induced to a pluripotent state through the expression of certain genes was recognized with the award of the 2012 Nobel Prize in Science and Medicine. We believe iPSCs can be used to overcome key limitations inherent in many of the cell therapy product candidates undergoing development today, including the requirement to source, isolate, engineer and expand cells from an individual patient for subsequent delivery of the therapy to that same patient.
 
We believe iPSCs represent an ideal cell source for creating cell therapy products that are well-defined, uniform in composition, have a consistent and dose-dependent pharmacology profile, and can be delivered off-the-shelf for the treatment of large numbers of patient
s. We are applying our expertise in induced pluripotent stem cell biology to genetically engineer and single-cell isolate and select iPSCs for clonal expansion, characterization and cryopreservation as clonal master iPSC lines. We direct the fate of clonal master iPSC lines to create cells of the immune system, including NK cells, T cells and CD34+ cells, and are advancing a pipeline of off-the-shelf cellular immunotherapies derived from clonal master iPSC lines. Our iPSC product platform is supported by an intellectual property portfolio of over 100 issued patents and 100 pending patent applications that we own or license. 
 
Our Business Strategy
 Utilizing our cell programming approach, we seek to program immune cells, including NK cells, T cells and CD34+ cells, and to develop and commercialize first-in-class cellular immunotherapies in the therapeutic areas of immuno-oncology and immuno-regulation. The key pillars of our business strategy are to:

• | Efficiently develop and commercialize first-in-class cellular immunotherapies for severe, life-threatening diseases where treatment options are limited. We are pioneering the development of first-in-class cellular immunotherapies for cancer and immune disorders. We seek to develop product candidates to improve the lives of patients with severe, life-threatening diseases with significant unmet need and where regulatory agencies offer efficient and expedited development and review programs, such as Fast Track designation, and/or market protection programs, such as Orphan Drug designation. For example, we are developing our product candidate ProTmune as a next-generation hematopoietic cell graft for the prevention of life-threatening complications, including graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), in patients undergoing donor cell-sourced, or allogeneic, HCT. GvHD is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing allogeneic HCT, and there are currently no therapies approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the prevention of GvHD, giving rise to a significant unmet medical need. The FDA has granted Fast Track designation, and the FDA and the European Commission have granted Orphan Drug Designation and Orphan Medicinal Product Designation, respectively, for ProTmune. We also intend to evaluate the potential to pursue expedited development and review programs for FATE-NK100, our first-in-class NK cell cancer immunotherapy comprised of adaptive memory NK cells, to support the product candidate’s development in certain indications. Due to high incidences of morbidity and mortality and the rare disease nature of many of our target indications, we believe clinical trials that we conduct will generally require relatively small numbers of subjects and that our development path to approval may be efficient.

• | Forge collaborations with leading researchers and top medical centers to accelerate development of and rapidly translate our first-in-class product candidates into first-in-human clinical trials. The research and development of first-in-class product candidates requires an exceptional team of people and scientific and clinical expertise across a range of disciplines. Additionally, first-in-human studies of first-in-class cell therapy product candidates are often conducted under investigator-sponsored clinical trials or at a small number of medical centers. We have and will continue to seek collaborations with leading researchers, investigators and top medical centers for the research, development, and clinical translation of our product candidates. Among our collaborations is a collaboration with the University of Minnesota, led by Dr. Jeffrey S. Miller, a renowned NK cell biologist and clinical investigator, to support the development of our FATE-NK100, FT500 and FT516 product candidates, and a collaboration with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, led by Dr. Michel Sadelain, a renowned T-cell biologist and a recognized founder of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, to support the development of engineered iPSC-derived CAR T-cell immunotherapies, including FT819. We believe this approach to research and product development will maximize our potential to successfully identify first-in-class product candidates, accelerate our product candidates’ clinical translation and clinical investigation, and efficiently establish first-in-human proof-of-concept for our product candidates.

• | Selectively share our cell programming expertise, including our iPSC product platform, with industry-leading strategic partners for the development of highly differentiated cellular immunotherapies. The clinical investigation of hematopoietic cells, including NK cells, T cells and CD34+ cells, as therapies for the treatment of human diseases is rapidly expanding. We believe we are uniquely positioned as an expert partner of choice for industry-leading developers seeking to maximize the therapeutic benefit of hematopoietic cell therapies through ex vivo pharmacologic modulation. As exemplified by our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics, we have and will continue to seek partnerships with leading hematopoietic cell therapy companies so that other companies can apply our expertise toward the development of cell therapies. Additionally, since iPSCs have the unique capacity to be genetically engineered, indefinitely expanded and differentiated in culture into any type of cell in the body, we believe there is significant opportunity to broadly exploit our industry-leading iPSC product platform and intellectual property position. We will continue to seek additional partnerships with other institutions and companies for the research, development and commercialization of iPSC-derived cell therapy product candidates to enable off-the-shelf treatment of larger patient populations.

Our Product Pipeline & Partnerships
 Immuno-Oncology Product Candidates
 FATE-NK100 Adaptive Memory Natural Killer Cell Product Candidate
 NK cells have an innate ability to rapidly seek and destroy abnormal cells, such as cancer or virally-infected cells, and represent one of the body’s first lines of immunological defense. Unlike T cells that require specific tumor antigen recognition to elicit an effective immune response, natural killer cells have the unique ability to selectively identify and destroy abnormal cells through multiple mechanisms while leaving normal healthy cells unharmed. These cytotoxic mechanisms include: direct killing by binding to stress ligands expressed by cells and releasing toxic granules; indirect killing by producing and releasing chemotactic cytokines that play a pivotal role in orchestrating the adaptive immune response; and antibody-mediated targeted killing by binding to and enhancing the cancer-killing effect of therapeutic antibodies through a process known as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).
 
Adaptive memory NK cells are a highly specialized and functionally distinct subset of natural killer cells. In July 2015, we entered into a research collaboration with the University of Minnesota led by Dr. Jeffrey S. Miller, Professor of Medicine at the University of Minnesota and Deputy Director of the University of Minnesota Masonic Comprehensive Cancer Center, to develop an adaptive memory NK cell product candidate for cancer. In the setting of allogeneic HCT, a retrospective study by investigators at the University of Minnesota found that HCT recipients with a high absolute number of adaptive memory NK cells (>2.5 cells/μl of blood; n=54) at six months post-HCT had a 2-year disease relapse rate of 16%, as compared to 46% in recipients with a low absolute number of adaptive memory NK cells (0.1–2.5 cells/μl of blood; n=16). Additionally, published preclinical findings from the University of Minnesota investigators demonstrated that adaptive memory NK cells have enhanced effector function, long-term persistence and greater resistance to immune checkpoint pathways.
 
We are developing FATE-NK100, a first-in-class natural killer cell cancer immunotherapy comprised of adaptive memory NK cells. Through the application of our cell programming expertise and our specific knowledge of modulators involved in the persistence, proliferation and anti-tumor activity of immune cells, we identified a combination of pharmacological modulators consisting of a cytokine and a small molecule (FT1238) that induces the robust formation of adaptive memory NK cells in therapeutically-relevant quantities. We produce FATE-NK100 using these pharmacological modulators in a seven-day manufacturing process. In August 2017, preclinical data describing the unique properties and anti-tumor activity of FATE-NK100 were published in Cancer Research (doi:10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-0799), a peer-reviewed journal of the American Association of Cancer Research.

As described in the publication, we have observed in preclinical studies that FATE-NK100 has enhanced anti-tumor activity across a broad range of liquid and solid tumors, improved persistence and increased resistance to immune checkpoint pathways as compared to conventional NK cell therapies that are being clinically administered today. Additionally, we have observed in preclinical studies that FATE-NK100 significantly augments ADCC against cancer cells when administered in combination with a monoclonal antibody, including antibodies that target CD20, HER2 and EGFR antigens.
 
FATE-NK100 is produced using the peripheral blood of a healthy donor in a feeder-free, seven-day manufacturing process during which NK cells are programmed ex vivo with our combination of pharmacological modulators. While patient-specific T cells are most commonly utilized in cancer immunotherapy, NK cells sourced from healthy donors have been safely administered to patients for over a decade without eliciting GvHD or triggering significant side effects, such as cytokine release syndrome. FATE-NK100 is currently being evaluated in three clinical trials.
 
The VOYAGE Study. VOYAGE is an ongoing open-label, accelerated dose-escalation, Phase 1 clinical trial of FATE-NK100 in subjects with refractory or relapsed acute myelogenous lymphoma (AML). The primary objective of the clinical trial is to assess the safety and determine the maximum dose of a single intravenous infusion of FATE-NK100 as a monotherapy when administered after lymphodepleting chemotherapy followed by a short course of sub-cutaneous interleukin-2 (IL-2) administration. Up to three dose levels of FATE-NK100 are intended to be assessed using an accelerated dose-escalation design, proceeding in cohorts of one subject per dose level until a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed. If a DLT is observed at a dose level, an additional three subjects will be enrolled at that dose level. Following enrollment of these three additional subjects, the study will convert to the standard “3+3” design using cohorts of three subjects per dose level. Under the standard “3+3” design, if no DLT is observed in the first three subjects of a cohort, dose escalation will proceed to the next cohort. If a DLT is observed in the first three subjects of a cohort, an additional three subjects are treated at that dose level. If, at any time, more than one subject at a dose level experiences a DLT, the dose level shall be considered to exceed the maximum dose level and dose escalation will stop. A total of ten subjects is expected to be enrolled at the maximum dose level. Other endpoints include rates of complete response and of disease-free and overall survival. 
 
The Phase 1 clinical trial currently is being conducted at the Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota as an investigator-sponsored study. On November 10, 2017, we reported initial clinical data from the ongoing VOYAGE study. The subject in the first dose cohort of VOYAGE presented in primary induction failure with 87% leukemic blasts in the bone marrow. Two weeks following a single infusion of FATE-NK100, a bone marrow biopsy showed residual AML with 48% leukemic blasts in the bone marrow. The subject in the second dose cohort presented in relapse, was refractory to conventional NK cell therapy and had 50% leukemic blasts in the bone marrow. Two weeks following a single infusion of FATE-NK100, a bone marrow biopsy showed a morphologic leukemia-free state; however, the response was not durable. No dose-limiting toxicities were reported in either the first or the second dose cohort. 
 
The APOLLO Study. APOLLO is an ongoing open-label, accelerated dose-escalation, Phase 1 clinical trial of FATE-NK100 in women with ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer resistant to, or recurrent on, platinum-based treatment. The primary objective of the clinical trial is to assess the safety and determine the maximum dose of a single infusion via intraperitoneal catheter of FATE-NK100 as a monotherapy when administered after outpatient lymphoconditioning chemotherapy followed by a short course of sub-cutaneous IL-2 administration. Up to three dose levels of FATE-NK100 are intended to be assessed using an accelerated dose-escalation design, proceeding in cohorts of one subject per dose level until a DLT is observed. If a DLT is observed at a dose level, an additional three subjects will be enrolled at that dose level. Following enrollment of these three additional subjects, the study will convert to the standard “3+3” design using cohorts of three subjects per dose level. A total of ten subjects is expected to be enrolled at the maximum dose level. Other endpoints include objective response rates and progression-free and overall survival. 
 
The Phase 1 clinical trial is being conducted currently at the Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota as an investigator-sponsored study. On December 8, 2017, we announced that the first subject had been treated with FATE-NK100 in the APOLLO study.

The DIMENSION Study. DIMENSION is an open-label, accelerated dose-escalation, Phase 1 clinical trial of FATE-NK100 as a monotherapy and in combination with monoclonal antibody therapy in subjects with advanced solid tumors who have failed approved therapies. The primary objective of the clinical trial is to assess the safety and determine the maximum dose of a single intravenous infusion of FATE-NK100 when administered after outpatient lymphoconditioning chemotherapy followed by a short course of sub-cutaneous IL-2 administration. Other endpoints include objective response rates and progression-free and overall survival. The DIMENSION study is designed with three treatment regimens, where enrollment in Regimens B and C will only begin after clearance of the first dose level in Regimen A: 
  
• | Regimen A: FATE-NK100 as a monotherapy in subjects with advanced solid tumor malignancies. Regimen A will test three dose levels of FATE-NK100 using accelerated-dose escalation. In the event a DLT is observed, the clinical trial will convert immediately to a “3+3” design. We intend to have the third dose level follow a traditional “3+3” design to confirm tolerability. A twenty-subject expansion cohort is expected to be enrolled at the maximum dose level.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Regimen B: FATE-NK100 in combination with trastuzumab in subjects with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+) advanced breast cancer, HER2+ advanced gastric cancer or other advanced HER2+ solid tumors. Regimen B will test four dose levels of FATE-NK100 using accelerated-dose escalation. In the event a DLT is observed, the clinical trial will convert immediately to a “3+3” design. We intend to have the third and fourth dose levels follow a traditional “3+3” design to confirm tolerability. A twenty-subject expansion cohort is expected to be enrolled at the maximum dose level.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Regimen C: FATE-NK100 in combination with cetuximab in subjects with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) or head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC), or other epidermal growth factor receptor 1 positive (EGFR1+) advanced solid tumors. Regimen C will test four dose levels of FATE-NK100 using accelerated-dose escalation. In the event a DLT is observed, the clinical trial will convert immediately to a “3+3” design. We intend to have the third and fourth dose levels follow a traditional “3+3” design to confirm tolerability. A twenty-subject expansion cohort is expected to be enrolled at the maximum dose level.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 On February 20, 2018, we announced that the first subject had received treatment with FATE-NK100 in the DIMENSION study.
 FT500 iPSC-derived NK Cell Product Candidate for Checkpoint Inhibitor Combination
 Therapies that block inhibitory immunological signaling pathways have transformed the oncology landscape. For example, the use of monoclonal antibody-based therapies commonly referred to as checkpoint inhibitors, which target the PD1 receptor upregulated on activated T cells or its ligands (programmed death ligands 1 and 2 (PD-L1 and PD-L2)) expressed on tumor cells, have achieved long term remissions in multiple tumor indications. Unfortunately, more than 60% of patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors will not respond or will relapse. As a result, there is significant unmet need for novel therapeutic approaches to overcome resistance to checkpoint inhibitors.
 One common mechanism of intrinsic and acquired resistance to checkpoint inhibitors is deletions or loss of heterozygosity in beta-2-microglobulin, or B2M, an essential component of tumor-antigen expression and T-cell response. A recent longitudinal analysis in a cohort of patients treated with several checkpoint inhibitors identified B2M expression defects in approximately 30% of patients with progressing disease. In fact, loss of heterozygosity in B2M was found to be enriched three-fold in non-responders (~30%) vs. responders (~10%) and was associated with poor overall survival. Additionally, complete loss of B2M expression was found only in non-responders. These findings suggest that defects in tumor-specific B2M expression can contribute to tumor evasion of T-cell responses and disease progression.
 One potential strategy to overcome resistance to checkpoint inhibitors, especially in patients whose heterogenous tumor burden includes B2M expression defects, is through the administration of allogeneic donor NK cells, which have the inherent capability to directly kill cells that have down-regulated B2M expression. The mechanism of killing is through the release of perforins exposing large amounts of tumor antigens and through the secretion of a number of cytokines and chemokines, both of which can activate and facilitate an adaptive immune response. As such, allogeneic donor NK cells may have the potential to overcome resistance in certain patients by directly killing tumor cells and by creating a favorable environment for successful checkpoint inhibitor therapy and an adaptive immune response.

We are developing FT500 as an off-the-shelf NK cell cancer immunotherapy for the treatment of advanced solid tumors, both as a monotherapy and in combination with checkpoint inhibitors. FT500 is created from a clonal master iPSC line. Using a proprietary, efficient and reproducible differentiation process, we have shown that one iPSC can create over one million NK cells, providing a substantially pure population of NK cells that is well-defined and of uniform composition. In preclinical studies, FT500 displays multiple potential mechanisms by which it may synergize with T cells to activate the immune system in patients with tumors that are non-responsive to checkpoint inhibitors alone. 
 In January 2017, we amended our July 2015 collaboration with the University of Minnesota to include process development and scale-up activities to support the manufacture of FT500 in accordance with current good manufacturing practices (GMP) for Phase 1 clinical studies. In November 2017, we received a Pre-Investigational New Drug, or IND, meeting written response from the FDA for FT500. The written response and subsequent FDA correspondence aligned our approach to safety testing, product manufacture, quality assessment and clinical trial design in support of our IND submission. In December 2017, we announced that production of FT500 to enable IND filing had commenced at University of Minnesota, Molecular and Cellular Therapeutics, a state-of-the-art, FDA-registered GMP facility. We are currently preparing an IND application to evaluate the safety and activity of multiple dosing cycles of FT500 in combination with FDA-approved checkpoint inhibitor therapy for the treatment of advanced solid tumor malignancies in subjects that have progressed on checkpoint inhibitor therapy.
 
FT516 Engineered iPSC-derived NK Cell Product Candidate for Targeted Monoclonal Antibody Combination
 NK cells play a major role in the anti-tumor efficacy of certain tumor-antigen targeting monoclonal antibodies. NK cells express CD16, an activating receptor that can bind to the Fc portion of IgG antibodies and transmit immune response signals. Once activated through CD16, NK cells are able to lyse antibody-coated target cells and secrete cytokines, such as interferon gamma, to recruit adaptive immune cells, including T cells. This mechanism of ADCC has been proven critical to the treatment of a wide range of human tumor types.
 
The anti-tumor efficacy of several FDA-approved monoclonal antibody therapies, including trastuzumab (FDA-approved for certain breast and gastric cancers), cetuximab (FDA-approved for certain head and neck, non-small cell lung and colorectal cancers) and rituximab (FDA-approved for certain cancers of the blood and lymph system), has been shown to be NK cell-dependent. Additionally, a number of clinical studies with these FDA-approved monoclonal antibodies have demonstrated that their anti-tumor efficacy is significantly enhanced in patients having a single nucleotide polymorphism resulting in the expression of a high-affinity CD16 isoform with increased strength of binding to IgG antibodies. Only about 10% of humans are homozygous for this allele. 
 
We are developing a targeted NK cell product candidate, which is created from a master clonal iPSC line engineered to express a high-affinity, non-cleavable CD16 (hnCD16) Fc receptor, as an off-the-shelf immunotherapy for the treatment of cancer. We refer to this product candidate as FT516. We have created a novel hnCD16 Fc receptor that incorporates two unique modifications designed to augment the receptor’s binding affinity to IgG antibodies and to block the shedding of the receptor’s expression on the surface of NK cells upon activation. We have engineered iPSCs to express this novel hnCD16 Fc receptor, isolated and selected a single engineered iPSC, and clonally-expanded this single engineered iPSC to generate a clonal master iPSC line expressing this novel hnCD16 Fc receptor. Using a proprietary, efficient and reproducible differentiation process, we have shown that one iPSC can create over one million NK cells, providing a substantially pure population of NK cells that is well-defined and of uniform composition. 
 
We are developing FT516 as an off-the-shelf cancer immunotherapy for the treatment of liquid and solid tumors, both as a monotherapy and in combination with tumor-antigen targeting monoclonal antibody therapy. We have shown that FT516 exhibits potent and persistent anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo in multiple tumor cell recognition and killing assays:
 
 
• | FT516 exhibits superior direct killing in combination with each of rituximab, trastuzumab and cetuximab in vitro, as compared to conventional NK cells sourced from peripheral blood and cord blood, in a killing assay of a human lymphoma cell line positive for CD20 (rituximab) and a human ovarian cancer cell line that is positive for both HER2 (trastuzumab) and EGFR expression (cetuximab);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FT516 shows a dose-dependent killing response in combination with rituximab in vitro in a CD20+ human lymphoblast-derived B-lymphocyte cell line killing assay; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FT516 augments anti-tumor activity in combination with trastuzumab in vivo, as compared to mice treated with trastuzumab alone, in a HER2+ ovarian cancer model, where the anti-tumor activity at Week 6 of FT516 plus trastuzumab was durable with no tumor detectable by imaging in 80% of the mice as compared to trastuzumab alone where all mice displayed tumor burden.

In January 2017, we amended our July 2015 collaboration with the University of Minnesota to include process development and scale-up activities to support the manufacture of FT516 in accordance with current good manufacturing practices for Phase 1 clinical studies. In March 2017, we received a Pre-IND meeting written response from the FDA for FT516. The written response and subsequent FDA correspondence aligned our approach to safety testing, product manufacture, quality assessment and clinical trial design in support of our IND submission. We expect to file an IND application to evaluate the safety and activity of multiple dosing cycles of FT516 in combination with FDA-approved tumor-antigen targeting monoclonal antibody therapy for the treatment of advanced solid tumor and hematologic malignancies.
 
Additional Engineered iPSC-derived NK Cell Product Candidates
 We are applying our iPSC product platform to develop other clonal master iPSC lines and additional engineered iPSC-derived NK cell product candidates, including in collaboration with leading researchers and top medical centers. For example, we entered into a research collaboration with the University of California, San Diego to develop off-the-shelf, CAR-NK cell cancer immunotherapies. The two-year collaboration is being led by Dan S. Kaufman, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Medicine in the Division of Regenerative Medicine and Director of Cell Therapy at UC San Diego School of Medicine.
 
In December 2017, Dr. Kaufman presented initial preclinical data of a CAR-targeted NK cell product candidate, which was derived from a master iPSC line engineered with a specific CAR construct containing a NKG2D transmembrane domain, a 2B4 co-stimulatory domain and a CD3ζ signaling domain. In preclinical studies using an ovarian cancer xenograft model, Dr. Kaufman showed that a single dose of these CAR-NK cells markedly inhibited tumor growth and significantly enhanced survival as compared to NK cells containing a CAR construct commonly used for T-cell immunotherapy. 
 
FT819 Engineered CAR19 iPSC-derived T-Cell Product Candidate
 Current engineered T-cell immunotherapies undergoing clinical investigation are most often patient-specific and their delivery requires the extraction, engineering, expansion and re-introduction of each individual patient’s T cells. This multi-step manufacturing process is resource intensive, logistically challenging and complex, and significant hurdles remain to ensure that patient-specific T-cell immunotherapies can be efficiently and consistently manufactured, and safely and reliably delivered, at the scale necessary to support broad patient access and wide-spread commercialization. For example, the overall safety and efficacy of patient-specific T-cell immunotherapies may be limited by: the inherent qualities, quantities and properties of the T cells extracted from each individual patient; the genetic engineering of the extracted T cells, where the site of genetic engineering is often random and variable from cell to cell and, as a result, may disrupt normal T-cell biology and function; and the activation and expansion of the extracted T cells during manufacture, where T cells by their inherent nature can become exhausted.
 
We are developing chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell product candidates created from clonal master iPSC lines as off-the-shelf cancer immunotherapies for the treatment of liquid and solid tumors. In September 2016, we announced a partnership with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center for the development of off-the-shelf engineered T-cell product candidates using clonal master iPSC lines. Additionally, we launched a majority-owned subsidiary, Tfinity Therapeutics, Inc., to focus exclusively on the advancement of off-the-shelf T-cell immunotherapies across a wide range of diseases. Tfinity Therapeutics holds an option to license intellectual property that we own or control for the development and commercialization of T-cell immunotherapies created from iPSCs.
 
Research and development activities under the multi-year collaboration are being led by Dr. Michel Sadelain, Director of the Center for Cell Engineering and the Stephen and Barbara Friedman Chair at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Dr. Sadelain has published preclinical results demonstrating that CD19 CAR-targeted T cells created from engineered iPSCs are capable of profound tumor clearance in vivo. Under the collaboration, we are currently engineering therapeutic attributes into human iPSCs, such as antigen targeting, lack of alloreactivity and enhanced persistence, and are optimizing the differentiation of these engineered iPSCs to create T cells for characterization and functional assessment.
 
In connection with the formation of the partnership with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, we exclusively licensed from Memorial Sloan Kettering foundational intellectual property covering iPSC-derived immune cells, including T cells and NK cells derived from iPSCs engineered with chimeric antigen receptors, for human therapeutic use. We also secured an exclusive option to exclusively license intellectual property arising from all research and development activities under the collaboration.

In December 2017, we provided an update on our collaboration with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center for the development of off-the-shelf engineered T-cell product candidates using clonal master iPSC lines. Under the collaboration, CD8αβ+ T cells have been generated from a clonal master iPSC line which was engineered to both eliminate T-cell receptor (TCR) expression and insert a CAR into the T-cell receptor α constant (TRAC) locus. Preclinical data from the collaboration showed that these CAR-targeted, TCR-null CD8αβ+ T cells display antigen-specific anti-tumor potency, including cytokine release and targeted cellular cytotoxicity. We also announced our plans to develop FT819, a first-of-kind CAR19 T-cell product candidate derived from a clonal master iPSC line engineered to eliminate TCR expression and to promote TRAC-regulated CAR19 expression.
 Immuno-Regulation Product Candidates
 ProTmune™
 Allogeneic HCT has been performed globally for decades with curative intent in patients with a wide range of hematologic malignancies and rare genetic disorders. The procedure involves transferring donor-sourced hematopoietic cells to a patient following the administration of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. The biological properties of the various cell populations present in the donor-sourced hematopoietic cell graft play an essential role in determining outcomes of allogeneic HCT. Donor-sourced CD34+ cells have the unique ability to engraft and reconstitute a new blood and immune system, and donor-sourced immune cells, such as T cells, have an important protective role following HCT in eradicating residual cancer cells and providing protection against life-threatening infections. The engraftment of donor-sourced CD34+ cells is essential for successful reconstitution, and any delay in, or failure of, engraftment leaves a patient severely immuno-compromised and exposed to exceedingly high risk of early morbidity and mortality. Additionally, while the donor-sourced immune cells impart a critical immunotherapeutic effect, allo-reactive T cells can cause GvHD, a serious complication where donor-sourced T cells recognize antigens on a patient’s cells as foreign and attack the patient’s cells.
 
According to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, approximately 30,000 allogeneic HCT procedures are performed globally each year. Hematopoietic cells for use in allogeneic HCT can be obtained from multiple donor sources including umbilical cord blood, bone marrow and mobilized peripheral blood (mPB). Approximately 65% of allogeneic HCT procedures utilize mPB as the donor hematopoietic cell source. While the use of mPB is associated with faster rates of neutrophil engraftment compared to other cell sources like bone marrow and umbilical cord blood, approximately 35-60% of patients undergoing mPB HCT develop acute GvHD and 70-80% of patients undergoing mPB HCT experience at least one severe infection within the first 180 days following HCT. We believe our cell programming approach has the potential to prevent severe, life-threatening complications and improve outcomes in patients undergoing HCT.
 
We are developing ProTmune as an investigational programmed cellular immunotherapy for use as a next-generation allogeneic HCT cell graft. ProTmune is produced by modulating donor-sourced mPB ex vivo with two small molecules, 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 (FT1050) and dexamethasone (FT4145), to enhance the biological properties and therapeutic function of the graft’s cells. The programmed mPB graft is administered to a patient as a one-time intravenous therapy. Based on preclinical data, we believe ProTmune has the potential to suppress the GvHD response and maintain the anti-tumor, or graft-versus-leukemia (GvL), activity of donor T cells. We have demonstrated that FT1050-FT4145 programmed CD4+ and CD8+ T cells of mPB are functionally less allo-reactive in vitro, exhibiting a decrease both in the expression levels of T-cell activation markers, including ICOS and 41BB, and in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and an increase in the production of potent anti-inflammatory cytokines including IL-10.
 
We are conducting a multi-center Phase 1/2 clinical trial of ProTmune in adult subjects with hematologic malignancies undergoing mPB HCT following myeloablative conditioning, a clinical trial which we refer to as the PROTECT study. The primary objectives of the PROTECT study are to evaluate safety and tolerability, and to assess the potential of ProTmune to prevent acute GvHD, which is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing HCT. There are currently no FDA-approved therapies for the prevention of GvHD in patients undergoing allogeneic HCT, giving rise to a significant unmet medical need.
 
In December 2017, we reported clinical data from the Phase 1 stage of PROTECT. The Phase 1 stage of PROTECT included seven subjects. Underlying hematologic diseases included three subjects with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), three with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and one with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). At Day 28 following HCT, all seven subjects receiving ProTmune met the safety objectives of neutrophil engraftment and survival. There were no events of graft failure and no serious adverse events related to ProTmune reported by investigators. The median time to neutrophil engraftment was 18 days [14-22 days]. At Day 100 following HCT:
 
 
• | there were no events of graft failure;
--+---------------------------------------


• | there were no serious adverse events related to ProTmune reported by investigators;

• | three subjects experienced acute GvHD, all of whom responded to standard-of-care steroid treatment. The median time to resolution of the maximum GvHD grade was 7 days [range: 5-8 days].

A tabular summary of the reported clinical data from the Phase 1 stage of PROTECT is presented below.

1 As measured from the day following HCT

 
All subjects receiving ProTmune in the Phase 1 stage of PROTECT are being followed for a period of two years following HCT. As of a November 29, 2017 data cut-off, five of seven subjects remained on study with median time on study of 154 days [Day 106 – 254].  There were no events of graft failure and no serious adverse events related to ProTmune reported by investigators. All subjects remained relapse-free.  Non-relapse mortality was reported in two subjects (Subject 1 on Day 228; Subject 3 on Day 151). It should be noted that these data are current as of the respective data cut-off dates, are preliminary in nature and our PROTECT studies are not complete. 
 
The ongoing Phase 2 stage of PROTECT is a randomized, controlled and double-blinded clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of ProTmune in up to 60 adult subjects with hematologic malignancies undergoing matched unrelated donor HCT following myeloablative conditioning. Subjects are being randomized, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive either ProTmune or a conventional matched unrelated donor mobilized peripheral blood cell graft. The primary efficacy endpoint of PROTECT is cumulative incidence of Grades 2-4 acute GvHD by Day 100 following HCT, where prospective clinical studies have shown that 40% to 80% of patients undergoing matched unrelated donor transplant experience Grades 2-4 acute GvHD. Additional endpoints, such as rates of cancer relapse, chronic GvHD, non-relapse mortality and overall survival, are also being assessed. Fourteen U.S. centers are currently open for enrollment in the Phase 2 stage of PROTECT.
 
In June 2016, the FDA granted Fast Track designation for ProTmune for the reduction of incidence and severity of acute GvHD in patients undergoing allogeneic HCT. In September 2016, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation and, in October 2016, the European Commission granted Orphan Medicinal Product Designation, for ProTmune. The orphan designation granted in each jurisdiction broadly covers subjects undergoing allogeneic HCT across diseases for which the procedure is performed, including blood cancers and genetic disorders.
 
ToleraCyte™
 Autoimmune diseases arise from abnormal immune responses in which the body’s immune system attacks and damages its own tissues. Some of the most common autoimmune diseases include rheumatoid arthritis, type-1 diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus), multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease and asthma. It is estimated that more than 23 million people in the U.S. suffer from autoimmunity, which makes it the third most common category of illness in the U.S. after cancer and heart disease.

Auto-reactive T lymphocytes are key players in aberrant autoimmune responses. We believe that certain biological mechanisms, which have been demonstrated to suppress activation of T cells in the presence of tumor cells, can be exploited to suppress auto-reactive T-cell destruction of normal tissues. Cancerous cells often evade the immune system by expressing programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1), a ligand that binds to the cell-surface receptor PD-1 on T lymphocytes and prevents T-cell activation. The PD-1 / PD-L1 biological axis has been clinically-validated as a potent immune checkpoint pathway, as certain monoclonal antibodies, commonly referred to as immune checkpoint inhibitors, have been shown to block the interaction between PD-L1 and PD-1, boosting the immune system and enhancing T-cell killing of cancer cells. We believe CD34+ cells possess intrinsic immuno-regulatory properties that are triggered under certain physiological conditions and, once triggered, have the potential to suppress activated T cells and induce immune tolerance.
 
In June 2015, we entered into a collaboration with Boston Children’s Hospital and its investigator, Paolo Fiorina, M.D., Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Dr. Fiorina and his team have extensively studied the cellular mechanisms and molecular pathways involved in the autoimmune-mediated destruction of pancreatic beta cells that result in insulin deficiency and onset of type-1 diabetes. Preclinical data from the Fiorina laboratory, which was presented at the American Diabetes Association’s 75th Scientific Sessions in June 2015, demonstrated that genetically engineered PD-L1+ hematopoietic cells adoptively transferred into hyperglycemic mice traffic to the pancreas, reduce aberrant T-cell activity and revert hyperglycemia in a well-established murine model of type-1 diabetes.
 
We have conducted preclinical development of a pharmacologically programmed CD34+ cell therapy with potent immuno-regulatory properties, which we refer to as ToleraCyte, for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Through the application of our cell programming expertise and our specific knowledge of modulators involved in the trafficking of CD34+ cells, we have identified a small molecule combination that significantly upregulates the chemokine receptor CXCR4 on CD34+ cells and enhances the cells’ ability to traffic to sites of inflammation. Additionally, these programmed CD34+ cells have the potential to express powerful T-cell regulatory factors, including PD‐L1 and IDO1. We believe that ToleraCyte has the potential to preferentially traffic to and immunologically check autoreactive T cells that are directly responsible for the destruction of healthy tissue in certain autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. 
 
In June 2016, we presented preclinical data at the American Diabetes Association’s 76th Scientific Sessions exploring the disease-modifying potential of ToleraCyte in humanized and mouse models of type-1 diabetes using immunologically matched programmed cells. In in vivo studies using hyperglycemic NOD mice designed to mimic new-onset type-1 diabetes, a one-time administration of programmed cells resulted in the durable correction of disease, as compared to vehicle-treated cells. Additionally, in pre-hyperglycemic NOD mice, a one-time administration of programmed cells demonstrated a statistically significant delay in the onset of disease. Finally, in a humanized model of type-1 diabetes, programmed CD34+ cells showed enhanced trafficking to the pancreas and regulation of T-cell activation. These studies support the premise that ToleraCyte may serve as a disease-modifying immunotherapy for patients with type-1 diabetes and other autoimmune diseases.
 
In October 2016, we held a pre-IND meeting with the FDA to support the clinical translation of ToleraCyte using CD34+ cells sourced from patients with type-1 diabetes. We are assessing whether the immuno-regulatory mechanism of action of ToleraCyte is dependent on the use of immunologically matched CD34+ cells, or whether CD34+ cells from healthy donors or CD34+ cells created from iPSCs can regulate autoreactive T cells and induce immune tolerance. This assessment includes the conduct of side-by-side in vivo preclinical studies in several different models of T-cell mediated autoimmune diseases and inflammatory disorders using immunologically matched CD34+ cells, immunologically mismatched CD34+ cells and immunologically mismatched CD34+ cells created from iPSCs.
 
FT300 iPSC-derived Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cell Product Candidate  
 Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a naturally occurring population of immune regulatory cells. These cells can function to inhibit antigen-specific and non-specific T-cell activation and proliferation through a diverse set of mechanisms. MDSCs often associate with tumors in the microenvironment, promoting escape from T-cell immunity, and are being targeted clinically to promote tumor regression. 
 
Although MDSCs can impede T-cell responses against cancer, the cells’ potent suppressive properties may be therapeutically beneficial for treating autoimmune diseases. However, MDSCs are rare in healthy donors and, although abundant in tumor-bearing patients, repurposing tumor-derived MDSCs for therapeutic purposes may pose undesirable risks. As a result, a need exists to generate MDSCs in large quantities, particularly from healthy sources that are relatively accessible in order to explore the therapeutic potential of MDSCs.
 
11


Using a proprietary, efficient and reproducible differentiation process, we have shown the potential to create a substantially pure population of iPSC-derived MDSCs that is well-defined and which can be banked for off-the-shelf use. Preclinical studies of iPSC-derived MDSCs have shown that the cells suppress T-cell proliferation and activity independent of antigen recognition, and that these immunoregulatory properties are maintained across immunologically mismatched systems. We are developing FT300 as an off-the-shelf cellular immunotherapy for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.
 Our Cell Programming Partnerships
 Juno Therapeutics
 T-cell immunotherapies commonly use a patient’s own T cells as the starting cell source to manufacture a personalized cell therapy. T cells sourced from patients require in vitro culturing, engineering, activation and expansion, usually over a period of days to weeks, to generate the number of cells that are therapeutically necessary for use as an immunotherapy. Significant challenges associated with this therapeutic paradigm include a high degree of patient-to-patient variability in the ability to harvest, engineer and expand T cells and the propensity for T cells to become exhausted during in vitro processing. These challenges can negatively affect T-cell function in vivo upon administration to a patient. In fact, clinical studies have shown that the anti-tumor properties of exhausted T cells are less durable and efficacious.
 
In May 2015, we entered into a strategic research collaboration and license agreement with Juno Therapeutics, Inc. (Juno) bringing together our expertise in hematopoietic cell biology and cell programming with Juno’s scientific and development leadership in CAR and T-cell receptor (TCR) immunotherapy. Under the collaboration, we screen for and seek to identify small molecule modulators that improve the function of T cells, including for molecules that enhance the therapeutic properties of CAR T-cell and TCR immunotherapies. Juno has the right to incorporate such modulators in their development and commercialization of genetically engineered CAR T-cell and TCR immunotherapies directed against certain tumor-associated antigen targets designated by Juno. Juno is responsible for the development and commercialization of genetically engineered CAR T-cell and TCR immunotherapies incorporating such modulators against such targets.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Juno paid us an upfront payment of $5.0 million, and purchased one million shares of our common stock, at $8.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0 million. Additionally, Juno agreed to fund all of our collaboration research activities during the research term of the agreement with minimum annual research payments of $2.0 million to us. The initial research term of the agreement is four years ending in May 2019. Juno has the option to extend the exclusive research term for an additional two years beyond the initial four-year term, subject to the payment of a one-time, non-refundable extension fee of $3.0 million and the continued funding of our activities under the collaboration during the extended term, with minimum annual research payments of $4.0 million to us during the two-year extension period. Additionally, if Juno elects to exercise its extension option, we then have the option to require Juno to purchase up to $10.0 million of our common stock at a premium equal to 120% of the then thirty-day trailing volume weighted average trading price. Juno may terminate the agreement upon six (6) months’ written notice to us.
 
We are eligible under the agreement to receive selection fees for each tumor-associated antigen target selected by Juno and bonus selection fees based on the aggregate number of tumor-associated antigen targets selected by Juno. Additionally, in connection with each Juno therapy that uses or incorporates our small molecule modulators, Juno has agreed to pay us non-refundable, non-creditable milestone payments totaling up to approximately $51.0 million, in the aggregate, per therapy upon the achievement of various clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones. Additionally, in connection with the third Juno therapy and the fifth Juno therapy that uses or incorporates our small molecule modulators, Juno has agreed to pay us additional non-refundable, non-creditable bonus milestone payments totaling up to approximately $116.0 million and $137.5 million, respectively, in the aggregate, per therapy upon the achievement of various clinical, regulatory, and commercial milestones.
 
Beginning on the date of the first commercial sale (in each country) for each Juno therapy that uses or incorporates our small molecule modulators, and continuing until the later of i) the expiration of the last valid patent claim, ii) ten years after such first commercial sale, or iii) the expiration of all data and other regulatory exclusivity periods afforded each therapy, Juno has agreed to pay us royalties in the low single-digits on net sales of each Juno therapy that uses or incorporates our small molecule modulators.
 
Under the agreement, we have granted Juno an exclusive worldwide license to certain of our intellectual property, including our intellectual property arising under the collaboration, to make, use, sell and otherwise exploit genetically-engineered CAR T cell and TCR immunotherapies (excluding those derived from iPSCs) using or incorporating small molecule modulators directed against certain designated tumor-associated antigen targets, subject to the selection of such target by Juno. We have retained exclusive rights to such intellectual property, including our intellectual property arising under the collaboration, for all other purposes.
 
12


During the term of our research activities under the agreement, we have agreed to collaborate exclusively with Juno on the research and development of small molecule modulators with respect to CAR T-cell and TCR immunotherapies (excluding those derived from iPSCs) against certain tumor-associated antigen targets designated by Juno. Furthermore, during the term of the agreement, we will be unable to conduct, or enable third parties to conduct, research, development and commercialization activities using small molecule modulators to enhance the therapeutic properties of CAR T-cell and TCR immunotherapies against certain tumor-associated antigen targets selected by Juno.
 
In January 2018, Juno announced its entry into a merger agreement with Celgene Corporation (Celgene), pursuant to which Celgene has agreed to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Juno through a tender offer.

Our Material Technology License Agreements
 Children’s Medical Center Corporation
 In May 2009, we entered into a license agreement with Children’s Medical Center Corporation (CMCC) for rights relating to therapeutic compositions of modulated HSCs and methods for promoting reconstitution of the hematopoietic system using modulators of the prostaglandin pathway, as described in more detail above under “Intellectual Property Relating to the Programming of Hematopoietic Cells.” Under our agreement with CMCC, we acquired an exclusive royalty-bearing, sublicensable, worldwide license to make, use and sell products covered by the licensed patent rights, and to perform licensed processes, in each case, in all fields. CMCC retains a non-exclusive right to practice and use the patent rights for research, educational, clinical or charitable purposes, and also to license other academic and nonprofit organizations to practice the patent rights for research, educational, and charitable purposes (but excluding any clinical use and commercialization of the patent rights to the extent granted to us under the license agreement). Our license is also subject to pre-existing rights of the U.S. government and rights retained by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the General Hospital Corporation to use the patent rights for research purposes. Additionally, if we make any discovery or invention that is described in a patent application and is not within the scope of the licensed patent rights but would not have been made but for the licensed patent rights, we are required to disclose the invention to CMCC and enter into a non-exclusive license agreement with CMCC, for no more than a nominal fee, for CMCC to practice the invention solely for internal research purposes or clinical purposes and not for commercial purposes.
 
Under the terms of the license agreement, we are required to pay to CMCC an annual license maintenance fee during the term of the agreement. We also are required to make payments to CMCC of up to $5.0 million per product in development, regulatory and sales milestones. If commercial sales of a licensed product commence, we will pay CMCC royalties at percentage rates ranging in the low- to mid-single digits on net sales of licensed products in countries where such product is protected by patent rights. Our obligation to pay royalties continues on a country by country basis until the expiration of all licensed patent rights covering licensed products in such country, and our royalty payments will be reduced by other payments we are required to make to third parties until a minimum royalty percentage has been reached. In the event that we sublicense the patent rights, CMCC is also entitled to receive a percentage of the sublicensing income received by us.
 
Under the license with CMCC, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to bring a licensed product to market as soon as practicable, and also to use good faith and diligent efforts to manufacture and distribute a licensed product, and make licensed products reasonably available to the public during the term of the agreement. We are also required to use good faith and diligent efforts to meet the milestones set forth in development plans as part of the agreement, subject to any revisions to the development plans that may be permitted under certain circumstances. Additionally, if a third party expresses interest in an area under the license that we are not pursuing, under the terms of our agreement with CMCC, we may be required to sublicense rights in that area to the third party.
 
The agreement will continue until the last to expire of the patent rights. We may terminate the agreement by providing prior written notice to CMCC, and CMCC has the right to terminate the agreement if we fail to pay royalties or otherwise materially breach the agreement and fail to cure such breach within a specified grace period. CMCC may also terminate the agreement should we cease operations or in the event of our bankruptcy or insolvency.
 The University of Minnesota
 In December 2016, we entered into a license agreement with the Regents of the University of Minnesota for rights relating to compositions and methods relating to NK cells, to modifications of cytotoxic receptors naturally expressed on NK cells including the CD16 Fc receptor, and to chimeric antigen receptors for expression on NK cells. Under our agreement with the University of Minnesota, we acquired an exclusive royalty-bearing, sublicensable, worldwide license to make, use and sell licensed products in all fields for commercial purposes. The licensed patent rights are described in more detail above under “Intellectual Property Relating to the Programming of Hematopoietic Cells.” The University of Minnesota retains the right to practice the patent rights for research, teaching and educational purposes, including in corporate-sponsored research subject to certain limitations during the initial three years of the license agreement. The University of Minnesota also retains the right to license other academic and non-profit research institutes to practice the patent rights for research, teaching and educational purposes, but not for corporate-sponsored research. Our license is also subject to pre-existing rights of the U.S. government.

Under the terms of the license agreement, we are required to pay the University of Minnesota an annual license maintenance fee during the term of the agreement, and are also required to make payments of up to $4.6 million for development, regulatory and commercial milestones achieved with respect to each of the first three licensed products. If commercial sales of a licensed product commence, we will also be required to pay royalties at percentage rates in the low-single digits on net sales of licensed products. Our royalty payments are subject to reduction for any third-party payments required to be made until a minimum royalty percentage has been reached. In the event that we sublicense the patent rights, the University of Minnesota is also entitled to receive a percentage of the sublicensing income received by us.
 
Under the license agreement with the University of Minnesota, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and make commercially available licensed products. In particular, we are required to conduct activities toward specific development milestones of licensed products on an annual basis. 
 
The agreement will continue until the abandonment of all patent rights or expiration of the last to expire licensed patent. The University of Minnesota may terminate the agreement if we default in the performance of any of our obligations and fail to cure the default within a specified grace period. The University of Minnesota may also terminate the agreement if we cease to carry out our business or become bankrupt or insolvent. We may terminate the agreement for any reason upon prior written notice to the University of Minnesota and payment of all amounts due to the University of Minnesota through the date of termination.
 Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research
 In February 2009, we entered into a license agreement with the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, as amended in October 2009 and September 2010, for rights relating to compositions and methods for reprogramming somatic cells to a less differentiated or pluripotent state. Under our agreement with the Whitehead Institute, we acquired an exclusive royalty-bearing, sublicensable, worldwide license to make, use and sell licensed products in all fields for commercial purposes, excluding the sale or distribution of reagents for basic research use. The licensed patent rights are described in more detail above under “Intellectual Property Relating to iPSC Technology.” The Whitehead Institute retains the right to practice the patent rights for research, teaching and educational purposes, including in corporate-sponsored research under limited circumstances and in some cases only after obtaining our consent. The Whitehead Institute also retains the right to license other academic and non-profit research institutes to practice the patent rights for research, teaching and educational purposes, but not for corporate-sponsored research. Our license is also subject to pre-existing rights of the U.S. government.
 
Under the terms of the license agreement, we are required to pay the Whitehead Institute an annual license maintenance fee during the term of the agreement, and are also required to make payments of up to $2.3 million for development and regulatory milestones achieved with respect to licensed products. If commercial sales of a licensed product commence, we will also be required to pay royalties at percentage rates in the low-single digits on net sales of licensed products. Our royalty payments are subject to reduction for any third-party payments required to be made until a minimum royalty percentage has been reached. In the event that we sublicense the patent rights, the Whitehead Institute is also entitled to receive a percentage of the sublicensing income received by us.
 
Under the license agreement with the Whitehead Institute, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products, and to make licensed products or processes reasonably available to the public. In particular, we are required to commit a minimum amount of funding toward the development of a licensed product on an annual basis or conduct activities toward specific development milestones.
 
The agreement will continue until the abandonment of all patent rights or expiration of the last to expire licensed patent. The Whitehead Institute may terminate the agreement if we default in the performance of any of our obligations and fail to cure the default within a specified grace period, or if we institute a proceeding to challenge the patent rights. The Whitehead Institute may also terminate the agreement if we cease to carry out our business or become bankrupt or insolvent. We may terminate the agreement for any reason upon prior written notice to the Whitehead Institute and payment of all amounts due to the Whitehead Institute through the date of termination.
 The Scripps Research Institute
 We have entered into various license agreements with The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) for rights relating to compositions and methods for reprogramming somatic cells, including the use of various small molecule classes and compounds in the reprogramming and maintenance of iPSCs. Under our agreements with TSRI (the TSRI License Agreements), we acquired exclusive royalty-bearing, sublicensable, worldwide licenses to make, use and sell products covered by the licensed patent rights, and to perform 
 16


licensed processes, in each case, in all fields. The licensed patent rights are described in more detail above under “Intellectual Property Relating to iPSC Technology.” TSRI retains a non-exclusive right to practice and use the patent rights for non-commercial educational and research purposes, and to license other academic and non-profit research institutions to practice the patent rights for internal basic research and education purposes. Under certain of our TSRI License Agreements, other third parties maintain a right to practice the patent rights for their internal use only. Our license is also subject to pre-existing rights of the U.S. government.
 
Under the terms of the TSRI License Agreements, we are required to pay to TSRI annual minimum fees during the term of each agreement. Additionally, upon the achievement of specific regulatory and commercial milestones, we are required to make payments to TSRI of up to approximately $1.8 million under each of the TSRI License Agreements. We will also be required to pay TSRI royalties at percentage rates ranging in the low- to mid-single digits on net sales of licensed products. In the event that we sublicense the patent rights, TSRI is also entitled to receive a percentage of the sublicensing income received by us.
 
Under the TSRI License Agreements, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to meet the development benchmarks set out in development plans under each of the TSRI License Agreements, or otherwise expend a minimum specified amount per year for product development. TSRI has the right to terminate any TSRI License Agreement if we fail to perform our obligations under the applicable agreement, including failure to meet any development benchmark or to use commercially reasonable efforts and due diligence to develop a licensed product, or if we otherwise breach the agreement, challenge the licensed patent rights, are convicted of a felony involving the development or commercialization of a licensed product or process, or become insolvent. We may terminate any of our TSRI License Agreements by providing ninety days’ written notice to TSRI. Each TSRI License Agreement otherwise terminates upon the termination of royalty obligations under such agreement.
 Manufacturing
 We are responsible for ensuring consistent manufacture of our product candidates in compliance with regulatory requirements as necessary for marketing approval of these candidates. We do not own or operate any of our own manufacturing facilities. Other than small amounts of materials that we may synthesize ourselves for preclinical testing, we currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our required materials, including our clinical materials and product candidates.
 ProTmune™
 ProTmune is a composition of ex vivo programmed human mobilized peripheral blood cells. ProTmune is produced by treating qualified human mobilized peripheral blood with two small molecules, FT1050 and FT4145, in a multi-step process that is performed on the day of HCT. Currently, the manufacture of ProTmune is performed at clinical cell processing facilities operated by or affiliated with our clinical sites. The manufacturing process consists of functionally closed unit operations. We aim to continue to develop manufacturing processes to further standardize the manufacture of ProTmune across clinical cell processing facilities.
 
Human peripheral blood cells from a donor, whose tissue type closely matches the patient’s, are used as the starting cellular source material for the manufacture of ProTmune. HCT centers can electronically access a worldwide network of donor registries, which collect and transfer human peripheral blood cells from donors, to source these cells on behalf of patients. We expect donor registries to continue to collect and transfer, and HCT centers to continue to source, human peripheral blood cells for our manufacture of ProTmune. Other components used in the manufacture of ProTmune include programming media as well as disposable materials, such as bags and tubing sets. To date, we have obtained all components required for the manufacture of ProTmune, including FT1050, FT4145 and programming media, from third-party manufacturers and suppliers, which include, in some instances, sole source manufacturers and suppliers. We do not currently have long-term commitments or supply agreements in place to obtain human peripheral blood cells and certain components used in the manufacture of ProTmune.
 
For the conduct of our Phase 1/2 clinical trial of ProTmune, the clinical cell processing facility at each participating site is qualified and trained by our technical staff to manufacture ProTmune. Our technical representative(s) are on-site at the clinical cell processing facility for each of the first two subjects administered ProTmune at a participating site. ProTmune is released immediately by the clinical cell processing facility staff after final processing, including filtration, final packaging, rapid release testing, and labeling. In the future, we may manufacture ProTmune at facilities operated by us, by transplant centers, or by third parties.

FATE-NK100
 FATE-NK100 is a first-in-class NK cell cancer immunotherapy comprised of adaptive memory NK cells. The cell therapy product candidate is manufactured using peripheral blood (PB) leukocytes from a CMV seropositive donor, where the donor is typically a HLA haplo-identical donor, and is depleted of CD3+ (T-lymphocytes) and CD19+ (B-lymphocytes). This starting cell population is cultured for seven days in a feeder-free environment and in a media containing a proprietary pharmacologic modulator combination, including a cytokine and a small molecule GSK3β inhibitor, to expand and enrich for NK cells that phenotypically have been associated with the adaptive memory phenotype.
 
For the conduct of Phase 1 clinical trials, FATE-NK100 is being manufactured at each participating clinical site by a clinical cell processing facility operated by or affiliated with such clinical site. Each clinical cell processing facility will be trained and qualified to manufacture FATE-NK100 by our technical staff prior to manufacture of FATE-NK100 for clinical use. We may in the future qualify additional medical center cell therapy facilities, contract with third-party manufacturers, or operate our own facilities for the manufacture of FATE-NK100 for use in clinical trials or for commercial therapeutic use.   
 
Other reagents and excipients used in the manufacture of FATE-NK100 include the pharmacologic modulators used in programming FATE-NK100 as well as the culture media used in the seven-day manufacturing process. All of these reagents and excipients required for the manufacture of FATE-NK100 are obtained today from third-party manufacturers and suppliers. We do not currently have long-term commitments or supply agreements in place to obtain these components used in the manufacture of FATE-NK100.
 Off-the-Shelf Cellular Immunotherapies Created from Master Pluripotent Cell Lines
 We expect that the manufacture of our off-the-shelf cellular immunotherapy product candidates created from iPSCs will involve a three-stage process:
 
 
• | The first stage is intended to generate a clonal master iPSC line and generally consists of the following steps: (i) obtain appropriately-consented normal human donor cells, such as fibroblasts or CD34+ cells, and conduct transfusion transmissible disease testing on the donor cells; (ii) induction of pluripotency in the donor cells using a proprietary transgene-free and footprint-free method of reprogramming; (iii) genetic engineering, where applicable, of iPSCs; (iv) isolation and selection of a single iPSC, followed by clonal expansion of the single iPSC to produce a clonal master iPSC line for cell product candidate manufacture.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The second stage is intended to derive the cell product population of interest and generally consists of the following steps: (i) expansion and differentiation of the clonal master iPSC line to produce CD34+ definitive hematopoietic progenitor cells; and (ii) further expansion and differentiation of these progenitor cells to produce the cell product population of interest. At this stage, we anticipate cryopreserving individual aliquots from this cell product population and banking these aliquots in single vials, where each vial contains cells sufficient to constitute a single dose.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The third stage is intended to derive the final cell product candidate and generally consists of the following steps: thawing and washing a single vial of the cell product population, and formulating the cells in an infusion media for intravenous administration of the cell therapy product candidate.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We are manufacturing certain of our iPSC-derived product candidates for use in research and preclinical development. As we expand our research activities and prepare for clinical translation of our iPSC-derived product candidates, we may continue to manufacture our iPSC-derived product candidates at facilities operated by us, or we may contract with third parties, including medical center cell therapy facilities, for the conduct of some or all of the activities required for manufacturing our iPSC-derived product candidates. As part of our manufacturing process, we endeavor to utilize cGMP grade materials and reagents, if commercially available; however, certain critical materials and reagents are currently qualified for research use only. 
 Marketing & Sales
 We currently intend to commercialize any products that we may successfully develop. We currently have no experience in marketing or selling therapeutic products. To market any of our products independently would require us to develop a sales force with technical expertise along with establishing commercial infrastructure and capabilities. Our commercial strategy for marketing our product candidates also may include the use of strategic partners, distributors, a contract sales force or the establishment of our own commercial infrastructure. We plan to further evaluate these alternatives as we approach approval for the first of our product candidates.

Government Regulation
 In the United States, the FDA regulates biological products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FDCA), and the Public Health Service Act (the PHS Act) and related regulations, and drugs under the FDCA and related regulations. Biological products and drugs are also subject to other federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations. The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of biological products and drugs. These agencies and other federal, state, local, and foreign entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, packaging, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping, reporting, approval or licensing, advertising and promotion, and import and export of our products. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions include refusal to approve pending applications, suspension or revocation of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. In addition, government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of product candidates for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities.
Marketing Approval
 The process required by the FDA before biological products and drugs may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of nonclinical laboratory and animal tests according to good laboratory practices (GLPs) and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND application which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices (GCPs) and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product or drug for its intended use or uses;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | for a biological product, submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials, and, for a drug, submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) that includes substantive evidence of the product’s safety and efficacy;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities where the product is produced to assess compliance with current cGMPs to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate, and, if applicable, the FDA’s current good tissue practices (cGTPs) for the use of human cellular and tissue products to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable diseases;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study sites and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA or NDA; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA and review and approval of the NDA which must occur before a biological product and a drug can be marketed or sold.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

U.S. Biological Products and Drug Development Process
 Before testing any biological product or drug candidate in humans, nonclinical tests, including laboratory evaluations and animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate, are conducted. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs.
 Prior to commencing the first clinical trial, the trial sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of an initial IND application. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND application is submitted. The IND application automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial and places the trial on a clinical hold. In such case, the sponsor of the IND application must resolve any outstanding concerns with the FDA before the clinical trial may begin. The FDA also may impose a clinical hold on ongoing clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If a clinical hold is imposed, a trial may not recommence without 
 19


FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Further, an independent institutional review board (IRB) for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that site. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study subjects and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA and to the IRB.
 For purposes of BLA or NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap:
  
• | Phase 1—The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. These trials may also provide early evidence on effectiveness.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2—These trials are conducted in a limited number of patients in the target population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3—Phase 3 trials are undertaken to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further evaluate dosage, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the product has been obtained, and are intended to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational product, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval and physician labeling.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials may be required by the FDA as a condition of approval and are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. The FDA has statutory authority to require post-market clinical trials to address safety issues. All of these trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements in order for the data to be considered reliable for regulatory purposes.
 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting, written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events; any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects; or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.
 Regulatory authorities, a data safety monitoring board or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the investigated product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients, and the trial may not recommence without the IRB’s authorization.
 Typically, if a product is intended to treat a chronic disease, safety and efficacy data must be gathered over an extended period of time, which can range from six months to three years or more.
 Concurrently with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the investigational product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with 
 20


the use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency, and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 A drug being studied in clinical trials may be made available to individual patients in certain circumstances.  Pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act (the Cures Act) which was signed into law in December 2016, the manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious disease or condition is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for individual patient access to such investigational drug. This requirement applies on the later of 60 calendar days after the date of enactment of the Cures Act or the first initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial of the investigational drug.
 U.S. Review and Approval Processes
 In order to obtain approval to market a biological product in the United States, a BLA must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety, purity and potency of the investigational product for the proposed indication. Similarly, for a drug, an NDA must be submitted to the FDA that provides data demonstrating the drug is safe and effective. Both a BLA and an NDA include all data available from nonclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s manufacture and composition, and proposed labeling.
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), as amended, each BLA and NDA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA’s fee schedule, effective beginning on October 1, 2017 and in effect through September 30, 2018, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as a BLA and an NDA, will be $2,421,495 for fiscal year 2018. PDUFA also imposes an annual prescription drug product program fee for biologics and drugs ($304,162 for fiscal year 2018). Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs or NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA or NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA or NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA or NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. After the BLA or NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the BLA or NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMPs to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency, and purity, and for a biological product, whether it meets the biological product standards. The FDA may refer applications for novel products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically comprised of clinicians and other experts, for evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and, if so, under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 Before approving a BLA or NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. For a human cellular or tissue product, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with cGTPs. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products (HCT/Ps) with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. Additionally, before approving a BLA or NDA, the FDA may inspect clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCPs. If the FDA determines the manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it typically will outline the deficiencies and often will require the facility to take corrective action and provide documentation evidencing the implementation of such corrective action, which may delay further review of the application. If the FDA finds that a clinical site did not conduct the clinical trial in accordance with GCPs, the FDA may determine the data generated by the site should be excluded from the primary efficacy analyses provided in the BLA or NDA, and request additional testing or data. Additionally, the FDA ultimately may still decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 21


The FDA also has authority to require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) from manufacturers to ensure that the benefits of a biological product or drug outweigh its risks. A sponsor may also voluntarily propose a REMS as part of the BLA or NDA submission. The need for a REMS is determined as part of the review of the BLA or NDA. Based on statutory standards, elements of a REMS may include “dear doctor letters,” a medication guide, more elaborate targeted educational programs, and in some cases restrictions on distribution. These elements are negotiated as part of the BLA or NDA approval, and in some cases may delay the approval date. Once adopted, REMS are subject to periodic assessment and modification.
 After the FDA completes its initial review of a BLA or NDA, it will communicate to the sponsor that the biological product will either be approved, or it will issue a complete response letter to communicate that the BLA or NDA will not be approved in its current form. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA or NDA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the applicant in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA or NDA to address all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
 One of the performance goals of the FDA under PDUFA is to review 90% of standard BLAs and NDAs in 10 months and 90% of priority BLAs and NDAs in six months, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and NDAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal data may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA or NDA applicant otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.
 Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages, or the indications for use may otherwise be limited. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 post-marketing clinical trials and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in the imposition of new restrictions on the product or complete withdrawal of the product from the market.
 Expedited Development and Review Programs
 The FDA has a Fast Track program intended to facilitate the development and expedite the review of new drugs and biological products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition or disease and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a biological product or drug may request the FDA to designate the biologic or drug as a Fast Track product at any time during clinical development. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application.
 Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a biological product or drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a biological product or drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials. Fast Track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
 22


The FDCA also requires FDA to expedite the development and review of a breakthrough therapy. A biological product or drug can be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that it may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. A sponsor may request that a biological product or drug be designated as a breakthrough therapy at any time during the clinical development of the product. If so designated, FDA shall act to expedite the development and review of the product’s marketing application, including by meeting with, and providing advice to, the sponsor throughout the product’s development, and taking steps to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to ensure that the design of the clinical trials is as efficient as practicable.
 Accelerated Approval for Regenerative Advanced Therapies 
 As part of the Cures Act, Congress amended the FDCA to create an accelerated approval program for regenerative advanced therapies, which include cell therapies, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, and combination products using any such therapies or products.  Regenerative advanced therapies do not include those human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products regulated solely under section 361 of the PHS Act and 21 CFR Part 1271.  The new program is intended to facilitate efficient development and expedite review of regenerative advanced therapies, which are intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition.  A drug sponsor may request that FDA designate a drug as a regenerative advanced therapy concurrently with or at any time after submission of an IND.  FDA has 60 calendar days to determine whether the drug meets the criteria, including whether there is preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for a serious or life-threatening disease or condition.  A BLA or NDA for a regenerative advanced therapy may be eligible for priority review or accelerated approval through (1) surrogate or intermediate endpoints reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit or (2) reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites.  Benefits of such designation also include early interactions with FDA to discuss any potential surrogate or intermediate endpoint to be used to support accelerated approval.  A regenerative advanced therapy that is granted accelerated approval and is subject to post approval requirements may fulfill such requirements through the submission of clinical evidence, clinical studies, patient registries, or other sources of real world evidence, such as electronic health records; the collection of larger confirmatory data sets; or post approval monitoring of all patients treated with such therapy prior to its approval.
U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 Under certain circumstances, U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. Patent term restoration can compensate for time lost during product development and the regulatory review process by returning up to five years of patent life for a patent that covers a new product or its use. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The period of patent term restoration is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND application (falling after issuance of the patent) and the submission date of a BLA or NDA, plus the time between the submission date of the BLA or NDA and the approval of that application, provided the sponsor acted with diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The application for patent term extension is subject to approval by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in consultation with the FDA. A patent term extension is only available when the FDA approves a biological product or drug for the first time.
 With the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the FDCA. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit to the agency an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) which relies on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug (RLD). For the ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug. The FDA must also determine that the generic drug is bioequivalent to the innovator drug.
 An abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, a FDA-licensed reference biological product was created by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, which was part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (PPACA). This amendment to the PHS Act attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a biological product is biosimilar to the reference biological product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the product and the reference product may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product.
 23


A reference biological product is granted twelve years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. The first biological product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against other biologics submitting under the abbreviated approval pathway for the lesser of (i) one year after the first commercial marketing, (ii) 18 months after approval if there is no legal challenge, (iii) 18 months after the resolution in the applicant’s favor of a lawsuit challenging the biologic’s patents if an application has been submitted, or (iv) 42 months after the application has been approved if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.
 A biological product or drug can obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
 Orphan Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to biological products and drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a biological product or drug in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting a BLA or NDA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the identity of the applicant, the name of the therapeutic agent and its designated orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 If a biological product or drug that receives orphan designation is the first such product approved by FDA for the orphan indication, it receives orphan product exclusivity, which for seven years prohibits the FDA from approving another application to market the same product for the same indication. Orphan product exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if the new product is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or if the company with the orphan product exclusivity is unable to meet market demand. More than one product may also be approved by the FDA for the same orphan indication or disease as long as the products are different. If a biological product or drug designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, benefits.
 Pediatric Research Equity Act
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), a BLA or NDA or supplement must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product or drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The intent of PREA is to compel sponsors whose products have pediatric applicability to study those products in pediatric populations. The FDCA requires manufacturers of biological products and drugs that include a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration to submit a pediatric study plan to the FDA as part of the IND application. The plan must be submitted not later than 60 days after the end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA; or if there is no such meeting, before the initiation of any Phase 3 trials or a combined Phase 2 and Phase 3 trial; or if no such trial will be conducted, no later than 210 days before submitting a marketing application or supplement. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. By its terms, PREA does not apply to any biological product or drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted, unless the FDA issues regulations stating otherwise. Because the FDA has not issued any such regulations, submission of a pediatric assessment is not required for an application to market a product for an orphan-designated indication.
Other Regulations
 We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.

Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense and dynamic competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, scientific knowledge and experience in the field of cellular immunotherapy provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 We are developing ProTmune as a next-generation mobilized peripheral blood graft for patients undergoing allogeneic HCT. The product candidate is intended to prevent GvHD and other life-threatening complications that compromise the procedure’s curative potential. While ProTmune is designed to replace a standard-of-care mobilized peripheral blood graft to improve patient outcomes, we are aware of other companies and medical centers that are developing adjunct therapies, such as Bellicum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Kiadis Pharma Netherlands B.V., or treatments for GvHD and other life-threatening complications of HCT, such as AbbVie Inc., Incyte Corporation, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
 We are developing FATE-NK100 as a cancer immunotherapy.  Additionally, we are utilizing our iPSC platform to develop off-the-shelf NK- and T-cell cancer immunotherapies. Cellular immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer have recently been an area of significant research and development by academic institutions and biopharmaceutical companies. While we believe our focus on NK cells, as well as our use of master pluripotent cell lines to create our product candidates, is highly differentiated, a number of companies are currently focused on the development of cellular immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer, including Adaptimmune Limited, bluebird bio, Inc., Celgene Corporation, Cellectis SA, Celyad SA, CRISPR Therapeutics AG, Green Cross Corporation, Intrexon Corporation, Juno Therapeutics, Inc., Kite Pharma, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gilead Sciences, Inc.), Mustang Bio, Inc., NantKwest, Inc., Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc., Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc. and ZIOPHARM Oncology, Inc.. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.  
 We compete against our competitors in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical study sites and subject enrollment for clinical studies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and commercializing those treatments. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance. 
 We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new products enter the market and advanced technologies become available. We expect any treatments that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. 
 Insurance
 We maintain product liability insurance for our clinical trials. We intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if marketing approval is obtained for products in development. However, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. In addition, we may not be able to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we employed 80 employees, all of whom are full-time employees, including 44 in research and development, 25 in clinical development and regulatory affairs and 11 in general and administrative. We have never had a work stoppage, and none of our employees is represented by a labor organization or under any collective bargaining arrangements. We consider our employee relations to be good.
