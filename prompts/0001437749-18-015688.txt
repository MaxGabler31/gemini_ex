ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
We were incorporated on May 21, 1986 in the state of Delaware.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2014 up until our July 1, 2015 acquisition of FSC Solutions, Inc. (“FSC”) discussed below, we sought to produce and market high-quality, low-cost B100 biodiesel. We no longer intend to engage in this business.
 
FSC Solutions, Inc. On June 26, 2015, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with FSC and its shareholders which included Uri Tadelis, our Chief Executive Officer and Director and our former Directors Chaim J. Lieberman and Gal Levy. The Agreement was effective as of July 1, 2015 which served as the closing date for the acquisition. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, we acquired all of the capital stock of FSC in exchange for the issuance of 70 billion shares of our unregistered common stock with the possibility of the issuance of an additional 130 Billion common shares upon FSC meeting certain milestones as outlined in the Agreement. Upon completion of the acquisition of FSC, we intended to employ FSC’s software and trading platform to enter the on-line trading industry. Subsequent to the completion of the acquisition, we determined that FSC did not have control over the trading platform and software we expected to acquire and operate. Consequently, we never commenced operations of this business and became a shell company as of December 31, 2016 when we determined that we were unable to engage in this business. We are in discussions with the non-management sellers of FSC to resolve this issue that arose after closing and are evaluating our alternatives.
Amid Financial Centre, Ltd.. On March 13, 2016, FSC entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Amid Purchase Agreement”) with Natalie Stock, Ltd. for the purchase of all of the outstanding shares of Amid Financial Centre, Ltd. (“Amid”), a Mauritius Company that operates as a broker-dealer. During the first quarter of 2016, an initial deposit of $20,000 was made as part of the agreement. Prior to December 31, 2016, we elected to terminate the Amid Purchase Agreement, and, as a result the $20,000 deposit was written off as an expense in 2016.
Our Products
 
We are currently exploring our alternatives as it relates to the acquisition of FSC and are searching for a business combination candidate.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had no full-time employees. Throughout the year we had work performed by part-time consultants on an as-needed basis. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we have not entered into a collective bargaining agreement with any union. As of December 31, 2016, all of our employees were on temporary leave without pay and/or an obligation for pay.
