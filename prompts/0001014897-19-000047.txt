ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 
Astro Aerospace Ltd. was originally incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 27, 2007. On March 14, 2018, the majority of the stock was purchased by MAAB Global Limited, resulting in the name change from CPSM, Inc. to Astro Aerospace Ltd. and the business change from pool sales to the research and development of manned and cargo drones. The Company has acquired the software, firmware and hardware for version one of a manned drone which has executed multiple flights. It is Astro’s goal to transform how people and things get from place to place. This will be done by making safe, affordable user-friendly autonomous manned and unmanned Electrical Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft available to the mass market anywhere. Astro is currently working on Version two of the drone product which will feature design changes to enhance the top speed and length of time the drone can stay in the air while also adding additional safety features. The target market will be government, private sector operators and individuals for a wide range of commercial, logistical and personal uses. The Company is currently in the flight testing mode of its Passenger Drone Version 1.0, as well as in the development stages of its Version 2.0 Passenger Drone.
 
Growth Strategy for the Company
 The Company is working with Paterson Composites Inc., our design and manufacturing partner, who is leading the design and development team with responsibility for developing the team as well as building the new prototypes for the two new drone models. The Company applied for approval to test the Passenger Drone1.0 version in Canada in order to display new software, avionics and stability. The Company received an SFOC (Special Flight Operations Certificate) from Transport Canada in September 2018, allowing Astro to take to the sky, and put the Passenger Drone 1.0 “Elroy” through critical elements of integrated flight testing. The testing culminated on Wednesday September 19, 2018 with a 4 minute and 30 second flight, reaching heights of over 60 feet and speeds of over 50 km/h. The avionics and flight control systems were put to task with a multitude of maneuvers and the vehicle remained exceptionally stable, even under the effects of a couple of unexpected wind gusts.
 
The Company’s newest prototype focuses on a multitude of applications including passenger transport, cargo delivery, ambulance and med-evac services, rescue and disaster assistance, military, and B2B. Its newly designed modular structure allows the Astro Top Frame to fly independently, as well as in combination with the individually designed “Astro pods” for the specific need in that specific industry. A fly-in and pick-up system will allow the vehicle to connect, fly, disconnect and repeat, effectively and efficiently, changing from one application to the next.
 
Along with recent Avionics and Control system upgrades, this modularity allows for growing opportunities in the electric take-off and landing short haul vehicle market.
 
The Company anticipates that the new prototype will be completed and flying in the summer of 2019.
 
Competition
 The Company is currently a research and development company focused on the creation of aerial drones for use in carrying passengers or cargo. It is expected that research and development will continue for at least two years, at which point we will seek out a joint venture to help manufacture the design. Once the research and development is complete, we intend to supply our products to a variety of industries, such as government, military, and for private use. The cargo drone is intended to be the first available product.

Our prime competitors are Volocopter, a German company, and Ehang, a Chinese company, which are both developing manned eVTOL craft. Our primary competitive advantage is our proprietary avionics and control systems. Currently, we have a working prototype that has flown while manned, and testing has shown that the design is very stable.
 
Employees
 As of April 15, 2019, we do not have any significant employees who are not executive officers.
