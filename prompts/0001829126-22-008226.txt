ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Business Overview
 
We are a music technology company that utilizes our platforms to record live concerts, and then sell that content to consumers. We make the content we record available to the set.fm platform, as well as our website, immediately after a live show is finished. Our technology helps artists and record labels generate alternative income from the recorded content. We also offer high-end collectible products such as CDs, USB drives and laminates, which feature our fully mixed and mastered live concert content.
 
On February 13, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with VNUE Acquisition Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“MergerCo”), Stage It Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Stage It”), and the stockholders’ representative for Stage It, pursuant to which the Company contracted to acquire Stage It for up to $10 million (the “Merger Consideration”), by merging MergerCo with and into Stage It, with Stage It continuing as the surviving entity and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger”). At the same time, Stage It and several of the shareholders of Stage It entered into a voting agreement concerning the Merger.
 
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the closing of the Merger (the “Closing”), each of Stage It’s outstanding shares (including common and preferred shares) will be converted into the right to receive the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration. A portion of the Merger Consideration will be paid in cash and take the form of satisfying certain outstanding debt obligations of Stage It, as outlined in a Closing Payment Certificate of the Merger Agreement, and the other portion will be paid in shares of the Company’s common stock or preferred stock, with the actual number of such shares to be issued reduced by the cash component outlaid in the transaction. A portion of the Merger Consideration, $1 million, will be held back for the purposes of satisfying certain contingent obligations of Stage It.
 
The Merger Agreement also allows for the issuance of earn out shares, not to exceed the overall Merger Consideration, provided that certain EBIDTA requirements are met over the course of 18 months.
 
On February 14 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Stage It. As a result of the Closing, Stage It became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. For the acquisition, the Company issued the initial 135,000,000 shares, paid certain amounts to Stage It vendors and will pay additional amounts as detailed under Merger Consideration in the Merger Agreement. The price to be paid in cash and stock for the Earnout Shares and Holdback Shares are set forth in the Merger Agreement. Through the period ended March 17, 2022, the Company had spent approximately $1,414,000 in cash on the acquisition.
 
With the addition of Stage It (Stage It.com), VNUE will have the ability to livestream concerts and other events, adding to the pool of other live music focused technology services. Stage It is an established platform where concerts or other live events may be ticketed (just like an in-person event), and fans who pay for tickets may enjoy a performance or other engagement by watching digital video as it occurs on their web browser. For example, an artist can create an event through the platform, and then, in advance, let their fans know they can purchase the ability to view the concerts on the Stage It platform. Fans then buy the ability to access these concerts, and at the designated time, the fan may then observe the live performance on Stage It.com.
 
The transaction with Stage It has brought hundreds of thousands of live music fans, and complementary technologies to our portfolio.
 
Existing VNUE Operations
 
Aside from the products and services associated with our wholly owned subsidiary, Stage It, we have two other products for the industry:
 
Set.fm™ / DiscLive Network™ - Our consumer app platform allows customers to download and purchase, via their individual mobile device, the concert they just attended. There are also physical collectible products which are recorded and sold at shows as well as online through the Company’s exclusive partner DiscLive Network™. The app itself is free to download and allows for in app purchases regarding the content. (Currently, aside from Stage It, this is the only platform that generates any revenue for the Company.)

Soundstr™ - a comprehensive music identification and rights management Cloud platform that we are developing, when fully deployed, can accurately track and audit public performances of music, creating a more transparent ecosystem for general music licensing and associated royalty payments, which will help ensure the correct stakeholders are compensated through the use of our “big data” collection.
 
While Set.fm™ and Soundstr™ are proprietary marks of the Company, DiscLive, and its related marks and names are not owned by the Company and are owned and utilized by RockHouse Live Media Productions, Inc. The Company has not filed any formal trademark applications relating to Set.fm™ with the United States US Patent and Trademark Office but has been using these marks openly since 2017 and claims common law rights to them.
 
The Company currently only generates revenue from Set.fm and from DiscLive by (a) recording the audio of live concerts and then selling the content “instantly” through its set.fm website, as well as the IOS Set.fm mobile application, and (b) selling content on physical products such as CDs, which are burned on-site where customers can purchase them. Our customers are fans of live music and the bands which we record.
 
Customers want to “take home” their experience of the concerts they attend. Our Company enters into agreement with certain bands and artists, and record labels if a particular artist under contract with the label. Our teams then follow that artist or band while they are on tour and record every show on that tour. Our Company uses its own recording and sound equipment while recording concerts.
 
As we partner with both artists and labels, we market our services on their websites, their social media platforms, their mailing lists, as well as our own websites and social networks. Furthermore, partnerships, with companies similar to Ticketmaster, allow us to market to customers when they buy tickets to see certain artists in concert.
 
On January 9, 2020, the Company entered into an artist agreement (the “Artist Agreement”) with recording and performance artist, Matchbox Twenty (“MT”) to record its 2020 tour and sell limited edition double CD sets, download cards, and digital downloads. Due to COVID-19, the tour has been twice rescheduled, most recently to May 2023.
 
We are a relatively new company and our independent auditors have raised substantial doubts as to our ability to continue without significant additional financing.
 
Our future operations may be dependent on our ability to secure additional financing. Even if we are able to raise the funds required, it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses, fail to collect amounts owed to us, or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing. Furthermore, if we issue additional equity or debt securities, stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock. The inability to obtain additional capital will restrict our ability to grow and may reduce our ability to continue to conduct business operations. If we are unable to obtain additional financing, we will likely be required to curtail our marketing and development plans and possibly cease our operations.
 
We anticipate that depending on market conditions and our plan of operations, we may incur operating losses in the foreseeable future. Therefore, our auditors have raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
 
Our liquidity may be negatively impacted by the significant costs associated with our public company reporting requirements, costs associated with newly applicable corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other rules implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission. We expect all of these applicable rules and regulations to significantly increase our legal and financial compliance.
 
Our Revenue Model
 
The live music and entertainment space are constantly searching for ways to generate revenue. Music licensing and royalties are particular “hot button” issues in the industry. We have developed solutions that create new revenue streams that simultaneously help to protect the rights of the artists. Our business model helps to ensure that creators and artists are properly compensated for their work.

Our Industry
 
The live music and entertainment space is constantly searching for new monetization outlets. We believe that we have developed solutions that create new revenue streams.
 
Since 2003, half of the nation’s CD and record stores have closed. Annual data regarding downloads was not even collected until 2004, yet in 2014 it accounted for 46% of total music industry sales. For most artists, digital sales and streaming revenues have not replaced the income they earn from recording and publishing. However, streaming revenues create an additional income stream.
 
A recent study on musicians’ online revenue streams, featured on www.lifeisbeautiful.com, suggests that the average payment to an artist is $0.0011 net per stream. Artists that have their content on our Set.fm mobile app receive 30% of the net revenue generated from their specific music. Live music shows are seeing significant new commercial and experiential trends driven by technology. More musicians engage directly with their fans via their web presence —selling songs and even allowing them to vote on touring venues – bypassing the traditional record labels and ticket services.
 
For an industry with constantly evolving trends, music’s live events have remained surprisingly static since the 1970’s. VNUE employs a unique platform that provides music lovers with an exciting new way to experience the live music events they attend. With Set.fm and DiscLive, the customer can purchase the songs they just heard at the concert, in excellent quality, mixed and mastered, and take that unique magical moment home, to be enjoyed for a lifetime.
 
Almost everyone has a smart phone present with them when they attend live events. The widespread use of these mobile devices is changing the ways customers behave before, during and after a live music event. Customers use their devices to search for live music events, buy tickets, and share their experiences.
 
The rise of the mobile internet and smart phones has, in recent years, begun shaping and changing the live music concert experience for many audience members. The ability to preserve and share moments of the show as they happen—to take photos and upload them instantly, to capture videos is a growing trend. Everyone has a cell phone.
 
According to a Nielsen report, as of August 2019, the annual average consumer music spending in the U.S. is over $150 million, of which 54% of that spending is on live music events.
 
Our Company reimagines the live event experience. We connect consumers, artists and venues with the VNUE Set.fm app as well as our physical, collectible products. We create promotional and social opportunities that enhance the live concert experience. We offer certain venues a partnership to help with their sales, and artists can get added revenue with their concerts. Our app allows artists to connect with their fans at a different level.
 
Our technology enhances our customer’s sensory experience at live events. It creates a natural extension of earlier concert culture allowing our customers to now have a piece of the live experience and own it forever.
 
Competition
 
Any entity that offers, or has the ability to offer, live music recordings that can be uploaded to an app-based platform is considered a direct competitor of our Company, regardless of whether the end-user is required to pay for those services or not. This also includes applications that allow users to engage in streaming activities and download musical content, such as Amazon, Apple, SoundCloud, iTunes, etc.
Competitive Strengths
 
We believe our expertise and experience in “Instant Live” content production and distribution is a competitive strength that differentiates us from our competitors.
 
VNUE’s team members have been involved in the business of instant live content since 2003. The Company’s CEO has vast experience with this concept and how to commercialize it. Over the years, the Company has continued to develop the processes and methodologies it uses to gain partnerships with certain artists and labels which gives us a competitive advantage in the live content industry. We plan to continue to develop our current business model as well as introduce new innovative and immersive software features to consumers.
Intellectual Property
 
VNUE has pending patents for our Soundstr™ technology and expects to file more related patents around the Soundstr™ platform, as well as Set.fm™. This will further strengthen the company as a leader in music technology and will allow us to have a competitive edge against those that may emerge as the company continues to execute.
 
We have patent-pending technology, USPTO Application US 2017/0316089, “System and Method for Capturing, Archiving and Controlling Content in a Performance Venue” which relates to our Soundstr™ technology.

Our Strategy for Growth
 
Key elements of our growth strategy include:
 
Continued rollout of the live recording business and further improvement to our software platforms.
 
Rollout of the Soundstr technology, which is a key part of our Company’s strategy going forward. Soundstr is in a space called “Music Recognition Technology,” (MRT), that is a relatively new area of live music and addresses a large market with no known, established solution for recognizing music and then tracking this information in an automated fashion. By leveraging technology and automation, Soundstr will be in a position to help the company build a large database of music performed in public spaces, such as bars, restaurants, gyms, radio, and other businesses.
 
The expansion of Stage It’s customer database and the integration of its business into ours is expected to bring us considerably more fans of music and specifically, live music. There are thousands of artists and over a million users on the Stage It database. We expect to tap that database for our existing services, as well as future services and integration. Further to this, we intend to leverage technical development efforts to identify common threads across our Set.fm and Soundstr platforms, and combining back end technologies to streamline and more efficiently utilize all of these platforms. Eventually we will explore further branding and expansion of the platform services. Immediate plans have been to address Stage It debt to artists, and to other vendors, as we have a 90 day plan to bring up to 100 mid-level to major artists onto the platform, thus increasing revenue opportunities. There can be no assurances we will be successful in bringing 100 artists to the platform.

Legal Proceedings
 
In the matter of VNUE, Inc. v. Power Up Lending Group, Ltd. On October 6, 2021, the Company commenced an action against Power Up Lending Group, Ltd. “Power Up”) and Curt Kramer (“Kramer”) (Power Up and Kramer together, the “Power Up Parties”) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The complaint alleges that: (1) Power Up is an unregistered dealer acting in violation of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Act”) and, pursuant to Section 29(b) of the Act, the Company is entitled to rescissionary relief from certain convertible promissory notes (“Notes”) and securities purchase agreements (“SPAs”) entered into by the Company and Power Up; (2) Kramer is liable to the Company as the control person of Power Up pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Act; and (3) Power Up is liable to the Company for unjust enrichment arising from the Notes and SPAs.
 
On December 10, 2021, the Power Up Parties filed their pre-motion conference request letter with the Court regarding their forthcoming motion to dismiss the Company’s complaint. On December 17, 2021, the Company filed its opposition thereto. On January 26, 2022, the Company filed its amended complaint, which asserted the same causes of action set forth in the initial complaint, and further alleged that that Power Up made material misstatements in connection with the purchase and sale of the Company’s securities in violation of Section 10(b) of the Act and, thus, the Company is entitled to rescissionary relief from the Notes and SPAs pursuant to Section 29(b) of the Act.
 
On February 9, 2022, the Court ordered an initial conference. The initial conference is currently scheduled for May 16, 2022, at 12:00 p.m. (EST). As of the date hereof, the Company intends to litigate its claims for relief against the Power Up Parties.
 
Golock Capital, LLC and DBW Investments, LLC v. VNUE, Inc. On September 29, 2021, Golock Capital, LLC (“Golock”) and DBW Investments, LLC (“DBW”) (Golock and DBW together, the “Golock Plaintiffs”) commenced an action against the Company in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Golock Plaintiffs’ complaint alleges that the Company is in breach of certain convertible promissory notes and securities purchase agreements separately entered into with Golock and DBW, and seeks declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and specific performance against the Company.
 
On December 2, 2021, the Golock Plaintiffs filed their amended complaint, which asserted the same causes of action set forth in the initial complaint, and an additional cause of action for unjust enrichment. On January 19, 2022, the Company filed its answer with affirmative defenses to the amended complaint. As to its affirmative defenses, the Company asserted that the Golock Plaintiffs claims are barred because: (1) the Golock Plaintiffs are unregistered dealers acting in violation of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Act”), and, pursuant to Section 29(b) of the Act, that the Company is entitled to recessionary relief from the certain convertible promissory notes and securities purchase agreements at issue in the amended complaint; and (2) that the convertible promissory notes are, in fact, criminally usurious loans that impose interest onto the Company at a rate that violates New York Penal Law § 190.40 and, therefore, the subject convertible notes are void ab initio pursuant to New York’s usury laws.

On January 20, 2022, the Court ordered that the parties submit a joint letter in lieu of a pretrial conference on or before February 3, 2022. As of the date hereof, the Company intends to vigorously defend itself against the Golock Plaintiffs claims.
 
Smaller Reporting Company
 
The Company is a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. There are certain exemptions available to us as a smaller reporting company, including: (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act; (2) scaled executive compensation disclosures; and (3) the requirement to provide only two years of audited financial statements, instead of three years. As long as we maintain our status as a “smaller reporting company”, these exemptions will continue to be available to us.
