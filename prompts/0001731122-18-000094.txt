Item 1. Business
Our Business 
 
Enochian BioSciences, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to identifying, developing, manufacturing and commercializing gene therapies. We accomplish this by translating groundbreaking science combined with our expertise in gene therapy, gene regulation and cell therapy. Our gene therapy platform can be applied to multiple indications. We are first applying our technology to develop therapies seeking to improve the lives of patients with HIV/AIDS through the restorative potential of gene therapy. Additionally, we have combined the gene therapy platform with our extensive knowledge of dendritic cells to develop a novel proprietary immuno-oncology technology platform. In the process of developing our HIV/AIDS and oncology platforms, we are accruing significant scientific, manufacturing and regulatory capabilities as well as building upon our proprietary knowledge that is applicable in the broader field of gene therapy. We believe our technology platforms provide us with distinct competitive advantages, including the potential to reduce development risk, cost and time to market.
 In infectious diseases, we are in the early stage of development of ENO-1001, a genetically modified cell therapy for patients with HIV/AIDS and ENO-2001, a preventative vaccine for HIV/AIDS.
  In immune-oncology, we have developed and patented cancer vaccines used in initial clinical trials in Europe and Asia, including ENO-4001 for the treatment of cancer (one phase I/II trial in Denmark and two-phase II trials in Denmark and Singapore). We have advanced candidate therapies, targeted initially at non-small-cell-lung-cancer (NSCLC) and colorectal cancer (sometimes referred to herein as CRC). We are also in the early stages of developing additional compounds: ENO-5001 (a genetically modified allogeneic dendritic cell-based therapy), ENO-4001 (formerly “MCV”), ENO-4002 (novel version of ENO-4001), and ENO-3001 (as therapy for the prevention of relapse in colorectal cancer patients). ENO-4001 (previously known as MCV) was developed by our Company in 2001.  Currently, our only product in clinical stage is ENO-4001, and we have no plans to market ENO-4001; rather we expect to seek out strategic partnerships to further develop and market this asset in the future.
 Our Mission and Strategy
 Our mission is to radically improve the lives of patients with infectious diseases and cancer through the restorative potential of gene therapy. We intend to build a leading gene therapy company that leverages our technologies to accelerate the delivery of transformative therapies to patients in serious unmet medical need. The key elements of our strategy to achieve this mission are:

· | Advance our internal lead proprietary development program ENO-1001, a potentially best-in-class treatment of HIV/AIDS, to patients. Currently, we are conducting in vitro and in vivo proof-of-concept studies of ENO-1001 which we expect to lead to completion of the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control (“CMC”) requirements for an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) filing. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expand the pipeline of gene therapy programs focused on HIV/AIDS. Beyond ENO-1001 (our lead program for HIV/AIDS), we have a pipeline of additional HIV/AIDS gene therapy programs in various stages of preclinical development. We are leveraging our leading technology platform, which includes novel vectors and promoters, to develop gene therapies primarily focused on HIV/AIDS. Our HIV/AIDS pipeline also includes ENO-2001, a preventative HIV vaccine that we intend to develop in collaboration with unaffiliated partners.

· | Build an immune-oncology pipeline based on our proprietary genetically modified allogeneic dendritic cell-based therapies for the treatment of advanced colon cancer, advanced non small cell lung cancer, advanced melanoma and advanced stomach cancer. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Maintain and grow our extensive intellectual property portfolio. We have broadened our existing intellectual property portfolio in immune-oncology with new applications for HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases. We expect to continue to expand our portfolio by aggressively seeking patent protection for promising aspects of our technology platforms and product candidates. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Seek out new opportunities beyond our current core therapeutic areas of HIV/AIDS and cancer. We believe our gene therapy technology could have applications outside of HIV/AIDS and cancer. We are currently focused on achieving human proof-of-concept of our gene therapy technology in HIV/AIDS and cancer, but we believe our technology could new product candidates for other diseases in the long term. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our strategy is to maximize the value and therapeutic use of our technology platforms. In certain therapeutic areas such as HIV/AIDS we intend to capture the value of our proprietary gene therapy products by developing ourselves the product candidate to Biologic License Application (“BLA”). In other therapeutic areas such as immuno-oncology we intend to partner with biopharmaceutical companies to develop products.
 Our clinical development strategy is to submit an IND application for ENO-1001(The first step in the drug review process by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”)) and continue to advance the research and development of ENO-5001 and ENO-4002. Including but not limited to conducting with a potential oncology partner, a randomized multicenter Phase III clinical trial to determine the ability of ENO-4002 to prevent recidivism in stage IV colorectal patients with no evidence of disease (“NED”) after resection of metastasis and chemotherapy. Our additional research programs address preventative vaccine for HIV/AIDS, genetically modified allogeneic dendritic cell vaccine for treatment of colon and lung cancers.
 HIV/AIDS 
 Our primary focus is to develop novel treatments for HIV/AIDS. HIV infection results in the death of immune system cells, particularly CD4+ T cells, and thus leads to AIDS, a condition in which the body’s immune system is depleted to such a degree that the patient is unable to fight off common infections. Ultimately, these patients succumb to opportunistic infections or cancers. According to the most recent data from the Center for Disease Control (“CDC”), it is estimated that there were 1.0 million people living with HIV/AIDS in the United States in 2017. In a broader market, including all of North America, Western and Central Europe, it is estimated that 2.2 million people were living with HIV and AIDS in 2017, with 70,000 new cases in that year (source: UNAIDS Fact Sheet - July 2018). Worldwide it is estimated that as of 2017, there were over 36.9 million people living with HIV and AIDS, with 1.8 million new cases of HIV in that year (source: UNAIDS Fact Sheet - July 2018).
Current Treatments and Unmet Medical Needs 
 Currently, there are over 30 antiretroviral drugs approved by the FDA to treat people infected with HIV. While these drugs can suppress the virus in the blood to undetectable levels, they cannot eliminate the reservoir of cells containing genome-integrated HIV from the body. Hence, individuals living with HIV need to take antiretroviral drugs for the rest of their life. The number of individuals living with HIV who are treated with Anti-Retroviral Therapy (“ART”) is increasing. For the first time in 2016, over 50% of people living with HIV/AIDS globally were on ART treatment with a 53% global coverage rate, totaling 19.5 million adults and children globally (source: Clinton Health Access Initiative September 2017). According to GlobalData (Global Data PharmaPoint 2017 Report), market opportunity for ART across the nine major countries of the US, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK, Japan, Brazil, and China, is set to grow from $16.3 billion in 2015 to $22.5 billion by 2025, representing a compound annual growth rate of just over 3%.

While ART can be effective in halting the progression of HIV infection, it is totally ineffective as a cure (Wong, J.K., et al, Science 1997, 278, 1291–1295). The need to find a sterilizing cure (complete elimination of the virus), or even a functional cure (virus is present at low levels, but it does not replicate) for this disease is of paramount importance, but it has remained elusive despite of significant efforts by academia and the medical industry. The HIV virus has the capacity to remain hidden in reservoirs (dendritic cells, macrophages, CD4+ T-lymphocytes) (Finzi, D., et al, Science 1997, 278, 1295–1300). This means, if ART is discontinued, the HIV virus will replicate again and the patient will relapse. We believe the limitations of ART provide an opportunity for products in our pipeline, which we are developing as more comprehensive treatments for HIV that we believe have the potential to become an attractive alternative to ART.
 The prevailing view in the medical community is that the combination of genetic modification and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (“HSC”) may provide the alternative treatment option to conventional antiretroviral therapy, and maybe eventually, a sterilizing cure for HIV infection (Hütter, G., AIDS Res. Ther. (2016) 13:31). As HSCs give rise to all hematopoietic cell types susceptible to HIV infection, modification of HSCs is an ideal strategy for the development of infection-resistant immune cell populations. Our objective at Enochian is to develop HSC techniques to obtain a long-term control of the HIV virus.
 Gene Modification for HIV Treatment 
 Given the ability of HSCs to repopulate the immune system, we believe the path to provide a commercially viable alternative to ART treatments is develop an approach to allow durable and permanent elimination of CCR5 receptor in a sufficiently large number of CD4 cells to obtain a long-term control of the HIV virus.
 Our approach to address the elimination of the CCR5 receptor is to take advantage of the CCR5-Δ32 mutation (“Δ32”). HIV disease progresses more slowly in individuals with a single copy of the Δ32 mutation (de RodaHusman AM, et al, Ann Intern Med. 1997; 127:882–890), while individuals with two copies of the Δ32 mutation are largely resistant to HIV infection (Liu R, et al, Cell. 1996; 86:367–377).
 The recent emergence of DNA editing proteins, has created the possibility to specifically and permanently inactivate any gene, including CCR5. This approach can be used to inactivate CCR5 in any cell type, including a patient’s own HSCs. After HIV challenges in preclinical models, mice receiving modified cells with inactivated CCR5 had significantly lower HIV loads. In principle, the bone marrow transplant of allogenic (not the patient’s own cells) genetically modified bone marrow cells carrying the two copies of the Δ32 mutation of CCR5 represents a potential curative treatment for HIV (Kiem, H.P., et al, Cell Stem Cell. 2012 Feb 3;10(2):137-47). We are developing our lead candidate ENO-1001, detailed below, as a HSC Gene modification technique that we believe builds and improves on the current strategy to treat HIV through autologous (the patient’s own cells) gene modification.
 The HIV Vaccine
 Despite almost 30 years of effort by the scientific community, a safe and effective AIDS vaccine is not yet available, and only four HIV vaccines have been tested in six HIV vaccine efficacy trials to date. These efforts revealed scientific challenges that are related to specific aspects of HIV biology. These aspects include (1) the extreme genetic heterogeneity and structural plasticity of the virus; (2) the ability of the virus to persist as integrated pro-viral DNA in an immunologically silent form; and (3) HIV’s preferential targeting of activated memory CD4+ T cells, which creates the possibility that any vaccine-induced immune response to HIV will paradoxically favor its transmission. Large-scale phase IIb clinical trials testing the efficacy of three candidate AIDS vaccine regimens each of independently identified a trend toward a higher frequency of HIV acquisition in vaccinated individuals than in placebo recipients.
 The disappointing results from efficacy trials together with difficulties in translating preclinical studies to clinical trials, including, but not limited to, the uncertain predictability of the results obtained in non-human primate models, also indicate that vaccine candidates should first be tested in infected individuals. We are developing ENO-2001 as an HIV/AIDS vaccine that we believe builds and improves on the past HIV vaccine candidates.

Cancer
 In addition to our focus on the treatment on HIV/AIDS, we plan to develop several immuno-oncology therapies for solid cancers. Cancer is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with approximately 14 million new cases in 2012 (Ferlay J, Soerjomataram I, Ervik M, Dikshit R, Eser S, Mathers C et al. GLOBOCAN 2012 v1.0, Cancer Incidence and Mortality Worldwide: IARC Cancer Base No. 11). The number of new cases is expected to rise by about 70% over the next 2 decades. (source: Globecan). Cancer has been the second leading cause of death globally, and was responsible for 8.8 million deaths, or approximately 1 in 6 deaths in 2015 (source: World Health Organization). The economic impact of cancer has historically been significant and is increasing. The total annual direct economic cost of cancer in 2010 was estimated at approximately $1.16 trillion (source: Stewart BW, Wild CP, editors, World Cancer Report 2014).
 Immuno-Oncology
 The immune system plays an important role in targeting and destroying cancer cells. Our strategy is to combine our gene therapy platform used in HIV with our extensive knowledge of dendritic cells to develop a novel proprietary immuno-oncology technology platform for the treatment of cancer. Our pipeline for immuno-oncology includes ENO-3001 (as therapy for the prevention of relapse in colorectal cancer patients), ENO-4002 (novel version of ENO-4001) and ENO-5001 (a genetically modified allogeneic dendritic cell-based therapy). ENO-4001 (previously known as MCV) was developed by our Company in 2001. 
 Specific Cancer Target: Neoepitopes
 The scientific community now better understands which of the many cancer-specific genomic changes are actually recognized by the immune system. We now know that there are no cancer-specific antigens but only cancer-specific epitopes, which arise because of random passenger mutations in dividing cells. These cancer-specific epitopes arise simply because the processes of DNA replication and repair do not happen with complete fidelity, and because they are random—each new tumor has a unique set of mutations, and hence neoepitopes. With the advent of high-throughput DNA sequencing and bioinformatics capabilities, several companies built algorithms that can identify these mutations and predict neoepitopes that will elicit CD8 T cell response and tumor rejection. However, a key remaining challenge is the administration. Companies developing neoepitopes cancer vaccines face a choice of delivery modalities that fall broadly into the categories of peptide-, RNA- or DNA-based systems. All these delivery systems present challenges, which we seek to address.
 Our approach to the challenges faced by companies developing neoepitopes cancer vaccines is an allogenic dendritic cell used as an antigen-presenting cell. There is a consensus that dendritic cells are the optimal antigen-presenting cells. However, using autologous monocyte-derived dendritic cells donated by patients is cumbersome, expensive and creates numerous regulatory and logistic problems. The use of allogeneic dendritic cells (off-the shelf and not derived from the cancer patient) is therefore appealing.
 Our Product Candidates
 We are focused on the development of human therapeutics for infectious diseases and cancers. We are advancing a focused pipeline of innovative gene therapies that have been developed internally. We have proprietary preclinical and discovery stage programs in HIV/AIDS and cancer immunotherapy.

A summary table of our key development programs as of August 2018 is provided below:


ENO-1001 Autologous Cell Therapy
 Our lead candidate, ENO-1001 is being developed to improve on the theory that an allogeneic bone marrow transplant procedure could represent a potential curative treatment for HIV. ENO-1001 seeks instead to develop a method of bone marrow transplant using autologous (the patient’s own cells) CD34+ cells, which could have significant advantages. The prevailing hypothesis is that an autologous treatment could become available to most patients suffering from HIV/AIDS, and there is no need for matched donors and no risk of “Graft versus Host Disease” (when the immune system of the treated patient rejects and destroys the transplanted cells).
 ENO-1001 as it is being developed seeks to silence the CCR5 gene in cells of a patient’s immune system to make these cells permanently resistant to HIV infection, by mimicking the naturally occurring CCR5 delta-32 mutation that renders a population of individuals largely resistant to infection by the most common strains of HIV.. The aim of this approach is to provide the patient with a population of HIV-resistant CD4 cells that can fight HIV and opportunistic infections.
 We plan to advance the ENO-1001 program to IND.

ENO-2001 Vaccine
 ENO-2001 is being developed as a preventative vaccine. We plan to advance the ENO-2001 program through externally-funded collaborations with outside organizations, although we do not currently have any contractual commitments to do so.
ENO-3001 Colon Cancer Vaccine
 ENO-3001 is being developed as an intranasal cancer vaccine therapy for long term maintenance and prevention of relapse for stage III and IV colon cancer patients. We remain in the discovery stage of formulation of ENO-3001, and we plan to develop partnerships to a suitable pre-clinical candidate.
 ENO-4002
 ENO-4002 is being developed as an improvement on ENO-4001 (formerly “MCV”), as a dendritic cell cancer vaccine designed to prevent relapse in colon cancer patients with no evidence of disease after resection and chemotherapy. We are currently in the discovery stage, and we believe a succession of strong clinical success in the field of checkpoint inhibitors has spawned a renewed interest in the development of cancer vaccines. We plan to use new clinical data to and existing data on ENO-4001 to develop ENO-4002.
 ENO-5001 Genetically Modified Allogeneic Dendritic Cells
 ENO-5001 is being developed as an off the shelf, universal, dendritic cell as a delivery system for more specifically tailored cancer treatments. In this approach, immature dendritic cells that are differentiated from monocytes derived from bone marrow stem cells. During the production process, monocytes are genetically modified to elicit cellular, humoral and systemic immune response by activating the cytotoxic response pathway, reactive B cell response, which induces a pan-activated immune response against the “target” we are loading the dendritic cells with. The genetic modifications of these monocytes include a single chain proprietary/unique sequence that we have developed. The genetically modified monocytes then get differentiated into immature dendritic cells pulsed with tumor lysate (or neoepitopes) and matured using Enochian’s proprietary maturation cocktail o be turned into a therapeutic cancer vaccine. 
 ENO-4001 (formerly “MCV”) Colon Cancer Treatment
 E ENO-4001 (formerly “MCV”), is a phase II dendritic cell cancer vaccine designed to prevent relapse in colon cancer patients with no evidence of disease after resection and chemotherapy, and we are seeking partnerships to further develop this asset as ENO-4002.
 Collaborations 
 We have established strategic partnerships for several of our therapeutic programs. We will continue to pursue partnerships when appropriate with selected pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to fund internal research and development activities, and to assist in product development and commercialization. We are applying our technology platform to several commercial applications in which our products provide us and our strategic partners and collaborators with potential technical, competitive and economic advantages.

 Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including in the field of gene therapy, are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. While we believe that our technology platforms, strong intellectual property portfolio and scientific expertise in the gene therapy field provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, new market entrants and new technologies.
 We are aware of several companies focused on other methods for editing genes and regulating gene expression and a limited number of commercial and academic groups pursuing the development of gene regulation and genome editing technology. The field of applied gene regulation and genome editing is highly competitive and we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future from a number of different sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies; academic and research institutions; and government agencies.

Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection, receiving FDA approval, or commercializing competitive products before us. If we commence commercial product sales, we may be competing against companies with greater marketing and manufacturing capabilities, areas in which we have limited or no
 experience. In addition, any product candidate that we successfully develop may compete with existing products that have long histories of safe and effective use.
 The competitive landscape that we are facing is as follows:
 Gene therapy companies developing gene-based products in clinical trials. uniQure N.V.’s product for lipoprotein lipase deficiency and GlaxoSmithKline plc’s, or GSK, product for severe combined immunodeficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency are approved in Europe. No other gene therapy products have yet been approved. Our competitors in this category may include, but not be limited to, Sangamo, uniQure N.V., bluebird bio, Inc., Regenxbio Inc., Shire, Pfizer, and GSK.
 Cell therapy companies developing cell-based products. Our competitors in this category may include Novartis AG, Adaptimmune Therapeutics PLC, Atara Biotherapeutics, Inc., bluebird bio, Inc., Cellectis S.A., Juno Therapeutics, Inc., Kite, and Iovance Biotechnologies, Inc..
 For ENO-1001, we are aware of two companies developing a gene therapy for HIV/AIDS: Sangamo and American gene Technology.
 For ENO-2001, we are aware of a few biotech companies developing an HIV vaccine:
 
• | Geovax (Atlanta, GA, USA), listed on OTC, is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing human vaccines against infectious diseases using a Modified Vaccinia Ankara - Virus-Like Particle vaccine.

• | InnaVirVax – (a spin-off of INSERM, Evry, France) is developing VAC-3S, a vaccine constructed to induce a humoral immune response against a highly conserved region of the envelope protein gp41 of HIV-1 known as 3S. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Profectus Biosciences (Baltimore, MD, USA) is developing TheraVax, a multi-antigen HIV vaccine administered by electroporation, in combination with interleukin-12 plasmid DNA followed by a boost with same the antigens vectored by a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (“rVSV”) delivered intramuscularly. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 For ENO-5001, the competitive landscape is more complex.
 Immunotherapy is an active area of research and a number of immune-related products have been identified in recent years that are alleged to modulate the immune system. Many of these products utilize dendritic cells, a form of immune cell that presents cancer target peptides to T cells and that can in turn result in T cell activation. More recently, bi-specific antibodies and checkpoint inhibitors (for instance PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies) have been identified as having utility in the treatment of cancer. Bi-specific antibodies commonly target both the cancer peptide and the T cell receptors (“TCR”), thus bringing both cancer cells and T cells into close proximity to maximize the chance of TCR binding and hence an immune response to the cancer cells. Checkpoint inhibitors on the other hand work by targeting receptors that inhibit T cell effectiveness and proliferation and essentially activate T cells. Other immunotherapies that are being actively investigated include: antibody-drug complexes, TCR-mimic antibodies, oncolytic viruses, cancer vaccines. A variety of cell-based autologous and allogeneic approaches are also being researched and developed.

CAR-T in solid tumors
 In addition to hematological malignancies, there are a growing number of pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and academic institutions researching and developing autologous and allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor T cell (“CAR-T”) therapies in the solid tumor setting. These CAR-T cell therapies are at a variety of stages of preclinical and clinical development, as well as directed towards a broad target spectrum. Two Car-T therapies has been approved for treatment of leukemia
 CARs&TCR-mimics targeting peptide-HLA complexes
 Most CAR-T therapies in development are directed towards antigen targets. However, competitors are also developing a CAR-T that selectively binds to the peptide-HLA (pHLA) complex (the natural binding site for endogenous TCR). Furthermore, competitors are also looking at pHLA antibodies or TCR mimic antibodies that can either be engineered in Tcells or developed as standalone antibody therapies in cancer indications (including solid tumors).
 TCRTcells
 Competitors are developing TCR T cells (including affinity engineered T cells) that are directed towards a multitude of targets. Juno Therapeutics has developed an engineered TCR therapeutic candidate where the end TCR is purported to have enhanced affinity through stem-cell selection.
 Other cell-based approaches
 In addition to all the adoptive cell therapy approaches above, our competitors are also investigating the potential of GammaDelta T cell, CAR-NK cell, NK cell, NKT cell and CTLs either in a preclinical or clinical setting (both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors).
 Manufacturing 
 We rely on contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”), to produce our preclinical and clinical product candidates in accordance with FDA and EMA mandated regulations, also known as current good manufacturing practices, (“cGMPs”). We employ a technical operations staff in the areas of process development, analytical development, quality control, quality assurance, project management, and manufacturing to facilitate appropriate oversight of our CMOs, support of our regulatory filings and execution of clinical trials.
Government Regulation
 In the United States, the FDA regulates biologic products including gene therapy products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA), the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”), and regulations and guidance implementing these laws. The FDCA, PHSA and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biologic products. Applications to the FDA are required before conducting human clinical testing of biologic products. Additionally, each clinical trial protocol for a gene therapy product candidate is reviewed by the FDA and, in limited instances the National Institutes of Health, or the NIH, through its Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (“RAC”). FDA approval also must be obtained before marketing of biologic products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals.

U.S. Biologic Products Development Process
 Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a biologic product candidate may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and in vivo studies in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”), regulations and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an application for an IND exemption, which allows human clinical trials to begin unless FDA objects within 30 days; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”), reviewing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated; • performance of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s good clinical practice (“GCP”) regulations, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended use; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantial evidence of safety, purity and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biologic product candidate is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biologic product candidate’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees and FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Before testing any biologic product candidate in humans, including a gene therapy product candidate, the product candidate must undergo preclinical testing. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as in vivo studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually must complete some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 If a gene therapy trial is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving NIH funding for recombinant DNA research, prior to the submission of an IND to the FDA, a protocol and related documents must be submitted to, and the study registered with, the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities, or the OBA, pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, or the NIH Guidelines. Compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving recombinant DNA. However, many companies and other institutions, not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines, voluntarily follow them. The NIH is responsible for convening the RAC that discusses protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety or ethical considerations at one of its quarterly public meetings. The OBA will notify the FDA of the RAC’s decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a gene therapy protocol. RAC proceedings and reports are posted to the OBA website and may be accessed by the public.

The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically
 becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. With gene therapy protocols, if the FDA allows the IND to proceed, but the RAC decides that full public review of the protocol is warranted, the FDA will request at the completion of its IND review that sponsors delay initiation of the protocol until after completion of the RAC review process. The FDA also may impose clinical holds on a biologic product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such studies.
 Human Clinical Trials Under an IND
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the biologic product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators which generally are physicians not employed by, or under, the control of the trial sponsor. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent.
 Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers items such as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject, or their legal representative, reviews and approves the study protocol, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Clinical trials involving recombinant DNA also must be reviewed by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research that utilizes recombinant DNA at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment.
 Human clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 
• | Phase 1. The biologic product candidate initially is introduced into a small number of human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early understanding of its effectiveness. Phase 1 clinical trials of gene therapies are typically conducted in patients rather than healthy volunteers. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The biologic product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. Phase 3 clinical trials are commonly referred to as “pivotal” studies, which typically denotes studies which present the data that the FDA or other relevant regulatory agency will use to determine whether or not to approve a biologic product. In Phase 3 studies, the biologic product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites in adequate and wellcontrolled clinical trials to generate sufficient data to statistically confirm the potency and safety of the product for approval. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Postapproval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, and may be conducted after initial approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA.

Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the NIH and the investigators for: serious and unexpected adverse events; any findings from other trials, in vivo laboratory tests or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects; or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.
 The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biologic product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. FDA usually recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by 10 years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire.
 Compliance with cGMP Requirements
 Manufacturers of biologics must comply with applicable cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers and others involved in the manufacture and distribution of such products also must register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Both domestic and foreign manufacturing establishments must register and provide additional information to the FDA upon their initial participation in the manufacturing process. Establishments may be subject to periodic, unannounced inspections by government authorities to ensure compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Discovery of problems may result in a government entity placing restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, and may extend to requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. The FDA will not approve a BLA unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specification.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional preclinical studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biologic product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product candidate in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents or of causing other adverse events with the use of biologic products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other requirements, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biologic product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biologic product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 U.S. Review and Approval Processes
 The results of the preclinical tests and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s CMC and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications.
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, , as amended (“PDUFA”), each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. The PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for approved biologics. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. The FDA reviews a BLA within 60 days of submission to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In that event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth, substantive review of the BLA.

The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product candidate is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, has an acceptable purity profile and whether the product candidate is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product candidate’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biologic products or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the product candidate. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product candidate unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product candidate within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements.
 On the basis of the BLA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter.
 If a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biologic product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
 The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review of BLAs under the PDUFA. One such goal is to review standard BLAs in 10 months after the FDA accepts the BLA for filing, and priority BLAs in six months, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.

Environmental Matters 
 
We are subject to a broad range of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations which govern, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges and the handling, storage disposal and release of wastes and hazardous substances. It is our policy to comply with applicable environmental requirements at all of our facilities. We are also subject to laws, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, that may impose liability retroactively and without fault for releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances at on-site or off-site locations. We are subject to similar requirements in Denmark and other European countries.
Research and Development 

Research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred and consist primarily of clinical trial costs related to manufacturing costs, consulting costs, contract research and development costs, and compensation costs. 
 
Discovery and preclinical research and development expenses include costs for substantial external scientific personnel, technical and regulatory advisers, and others, costs of laboratory supplies used in our internal research and development projects, travel, regulatory compliance, and expenditures for preclinical and clinical trial operation and management when we are actively engaged in clinical trials. Because we are pre-revenue company, we do not allocate research and development costs on a project basis. We adopted this policy, in part, due to the unreasonable cost burden associated with accounting at such a level of detail and our limited number of financial and personnel resources.
 
Expenses for Company-sponsored research and development for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 were $616,961 and $62,763, respectively.

As of June 30, 2018, we had 4full-time employees. We are in the process of building a research and development organization that includes extensive expertise in gene therapy and related scientific disciplines. We operate cross-functionally and are led by an experienced research and development management team. We use rigorous project management techniques to assist us in making disciplined strategic research and development program decisions and to help limit the risk profile of our product pipeline. We also access relevant market information and key opinion leaders in creating target product profiles when appropriate, as we advance our programs towards commercialization. We engage third parties to conduct portions of our preclinical research. In addition, we plan to utilize multiple clinical sites to conduct our clinical trials.
Facilities and Offices
 Our corporate headquarters are located at Century City Medical Plaza, 2080 Century Park East, Suite 906, Los Angeles CA, 90067. We have a ten-year lease for approximately 2,453 square feet at this location. The base rent for this leased premises increases by 3% each year over the term, and ranges from $12,265 per month for the first year to $16,003 per month for the tenth year. The Company is entitled to $108,168 in contributions toward tenant improvements.
 We also have a 5-year lease for 2,325 rentable square feet of office space at 5901 W. Olympic Blvd., Suite 419, Los Angeles, CA 90036.

We are entitled to $70,800 in tenant improvement allowance in the form of free rent applied over 10 months in equal installments from January 2018.  
 Corporate Information
 
We were incorporated in January 18, 2011 in the state of Delaware and on March 2, 2018 we changed our name from “DanDrit Biotech USA, Inc.” to Enochian BioSciences, Inc.” Our website is http://www.enochianbio.com. We make available free of charge, on or through our internet site, our annual, quarterly, and current reports and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. Information contained in our website is not part of, nor incorporated by reference into, this report.
 We originally incorporated in Delaware on under the name “Putnam Hills Corp.” We filed a Registration Statement on Form 10 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, on August 12, 2011.
   
On February 12, 2014, pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement, the Registrant acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of DanDrit Denmark and as a result became DanDrit Denmark’s parent company (the “Share Exchange”). Prior to the Share Exchange, the Registrant and an existing shareholder agreed to cancel 4,400,000 out of 5,000,000 shares of Common Stock of DanDrit Denmark outstanding, and the Company issued 1,440,000 shares of Common Stock for legal and consulting services related to the Share Exchange and a future public offering. At the time of the Share Exchange each outstanding share of common stock of DanDrit Denmark was exchanged for 1.498842 shares of Common Stock, for a total of 6,000,000 shares of Common Stock, resulting in 8,040,000 shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately following the Share Exchange, including the Escrow Shares, which are deemed issued and outstanding for accounting purposes (See also Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
 
In June 2015, the Board approved a change to the Registrant’s fiscal year end from December 31 to June 30. 
 
On February 16, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Enochian Biopharma pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, with Enochian Biopharma surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Registrant. As consideration for the Acquisition, the stockholders of Enochian Biopharma received (i) 18,081,962 shares of Common Stock and (ii) the right to receive Contingent Shares pro rata upon the exercise or conversion of warrants which were outstanding at closing (See also Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Emerging Growth Company 
 
 As a company with less than $1.0 billion in revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, enacted in April 2012. An “emerging growth company” may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. These provisions include, but are not limited to:

● | Reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | No non-binding shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reduced disclosure of financial information in this prospectus, limited to two years of audited financial information and two years of selected financial information. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 Each of the foregoing exemptions is currently available to us. We may take advantage of these exemptions until the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, which such fifth anniversary will occur on June 30, 2019 or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than $1.0 billion in annual revenues as of the end of a fiscal year, if we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC, or if we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year-period. The JOBS Act permits an emerging growth company to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies; provided, however, that an emerging growth company may elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have not elected to opt out of the transition period.
 
Because we have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations and may elect to take advantage of other reduced reporting requirements in future filings, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests.
