Item 1. | BUSINESS

Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is a holding company headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada, which either on its own or together with its subsidiaries is referred to herein as the “Company.” Through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Southwest Gas Corporation (“Southwest” or the “natural gas distribution” segment), Centuri Group, Inc. (“Centuri” or the “utility infrastructure services” segment), and MountainWest Pipelines Holding Company, the newly formed holding company owning all of the membership interests in Dominion Energy Questar Pipeline, LLC and related entities (herein referred to as “Questar Pipelines,” “MountainWest,” or the “pipeline and storage” segment). The Company has historically operated two business segments: natural gas distribution (previously referred to as natural gas operations) and utility infrastructure services. With the consummation of the Questar Pipelines acquisition on December 31, 2021, a third segment now exists, the pipeline and storage segment. 
Southwest, incorporated in March 1931 (in California), and its subsidiaries provides regulated natural gas delivery services to customers in portions of Arizona, Nevada, and California. Public utility rates, practices, facilities, and service territories of Southwest are subject to regulatory oversight. The timing and amount of rate relief can materially impact results of operations. Natural gas purchases and the timing of related recoveries can materially impact liquidity. Results for the natural gas distribution segment are higher during winter periods due to the seasonality incorporated in its regulatory rate structures.
As described above, on December 31, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of Questar Pipelines from Dominion Energy Questar Corporation (“Dominion”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Dominion Energy, Inc. Questar Pipelines owns and operates over 2,000 miles of highly contracted regulated interstate natural gas pipelines and storage facilities in the Rocky Mountain region, providing service in Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado, with non-regulated businesses primarily providing analytical and measurement services, and natural gas gathering. This acquisition further diversifies the Company’s business with an expansion of operations regulated, by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the “FERC”), including regulated plant, tariff rates, and services performed. Questar Pipelines’ revenues are primarily derived from reservation charges for firm transportation and storage services as provided for in their FERC-approved tariffs. The profitability of these businesses is dependent on their ability, through the rates they are permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable return on their capital investments. Variability in earnings results from changes in operating and maintenance expenditures, as well as changes in rates and the demand for services, which are dependent on weather, changes in commodity prices, and the economy. Pursuant to a transition services agreement (the “TSA”) entered into between the Company and Dominion, Dominion will continue to provide certain services with respect to the operations of Questar Pipelines for up to 12 months. The Company will develop an operating model during the period of the TSA in which Questar Pipelines will be leveraging Dominion Energy, Inc.’s personnel and systems. During the development of the operating model, the Company will be reviewing current processes for the development of future processes in association with the integration and administrative stand up of Questar Pipelines.
Centuri is a strategic utility infrastructure services company dedicated to partnering with North America’s electric and gas providers to build and maintain the energy network that powers millions of homes across the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada. Centuri’s skilled workforce delivers a comprehensive and integrated array of solutions through its primary operating companies: NPL Construction Co. (“NPL”), NPL Canada Ltd. (“NPL Canada”), New England Utility Constructors, Inc. (“Neuco”), Linetec Services, LLC (“Linetec”), and Riggs Distler & Company, Inc. (“Riggs Distler”). Centuri has strategically expanded its geographic reach and service offerings through organic and inorganic growth to better meet diverse customer needs across both electric and gas infrastructure, including growing customer attention to achieving environmental objectives. Utility infrastructure services activity is seasonal in most of Centuri’s operating areas. Peak periods are the summer and fall months in colder climate areas, such as the northeastern and midwestern U.S. and in Canada. In warmer climate areas, such as the southwestern and southeastern U.S., utility infrastructure services activity continues year round. Centuri completed the acquisition of Drum Parent LLC, formerly Drum Parent, Inc. (“Drum”), including Drum’s most significant operating 
subsidiary, Riggs Distler, in August 2021, thereby expanding Centuri’s electric footprint in the northeast and mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S.
On March 1, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors (the “Board”) determined to separate Centuri from Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. and has authorized management to complete the separation within the next nine to twelve months.

NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION
General Description
Southwest is subject to regulation by the Arizona Corporation Commission (the “ACC”), the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada (the “PUCN”), and the California Public Utilities Commission (the “CPUC”). These commissions regulate public utility rates, practices, facilities, and service territories in their respective states. The CPUC also regulates the issuance of all debt securities by Southwest, with the exception of short-term borrowings. Certain accounting practices, transmission facilities, and rates are subject to regulation by the FERC. As discussed above, the pipeline and storage segment of the Company is also subject to the regulation of the FERC. Centuri, by contrast, is not rate regulated by the state utilities commissions or by the FERC in any of its operating areas.
As of December 31, 2021, Southwest purchased and distributed or transported natural gas to 2,159,000 residential, commercial, and industrial customers in geographically diverse portions of Arizona, Nevada, and California. Southwest added 37,000 new customers during 2021. Southwest expects similar customer growth in 2022.
The table below lists the percentage of operating margin (operating revenues less net cost of gas) by major customer class for the years indicated:

 | Distribution | | 
For the Year Ended December 31, | Residential andSmall Commercial | | Other SalesCustomers | | Transportation
2021 | 85 | % | | 4 | % | 11 | %
2020 | 85 | % | | 3 | % | 12 | %
2019 | 84 | % | | 3 | % | 13 | %

Southwest is not dependent on any one or a few customers such that the loss of any one or several would have a significant adverse impact on earnings or cash flows.
Transportation of customer-secured gas to end-users accounted for 44% of total system throughput in 2021, but represents only 11% of operating margin as shown in the table above. Customers who utilized this service transported 95 million dekatherms in 2021, 98 million dekatherms in 2020, and 101 million dekatherms in 2019.
The demand for natural gas is seasonal, with greater demand in the colder winter months and decreased demand in the warmer summer months. It is the opinion of management that comparisons of earnings for interim periods do not reliably reflect overall trends and changes in operations due to this seasonality. The decoupled rate mechanisms in place in the three-state service territory, as described below, are structured with seasonal variations. Also, earnings for interim, or any, periods can be significantly affected by the timing of general rate relief.
Rates and Regulation
Rates that Southwest is authorized to charge its distribution system customers are determined by the ACC, PUCN, and CPUC in general rate cases and are derived using rate base, cost of service, and cost of capital experienced in an historical test year, as adjusted in Arizona and Nevada, and projected for a future test year in California. The FERC regulates the northern Nevada transmission and liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) storage facilities of Great Basin Gas Transmission Company (“Great Basin”), formerly Paiute Pipeline Company, a wholly owned subsidiary, and the rates it charges for transportation of gas directly to certain end-users and to various local distribution companies (“LDCs”). The LDCs transporting on the Great Basin system are: NV Energy (serving Reno and Sparks, Nevada) and Southwest (serving Truckee, South and North Lake Tahoe in California, and various locations throughout northern Nevada).
Rates charged to customers vary according to customer class and rate jurisdiction and are set at levels that are intended to allow for the recovery of all commission-approved costs, including a return on rate base sufficient to pay interest on debt as well as a reasonable return on common equity. Rate base consists generally of the original cost of utility plant in service, net of amounts associated with costs borne by third parties, plus certain other assets such as working capital and inventories, less accumulated depreciation on utility plant in service, net deferred income tax liabilities, and certain other deductions.
Rate structures in all service territories allow Southwest to separate or “decouple” the recovery of operating margin from natural gas consumption, though decoupled structures (alternative revenue programs) vary by state. In California, authorized operating margin levels vary by month. In Nevada and Arizona, the decoupled rate structures apply to most customer classes on the basis of margin per customer, which varies by month. Collectively, these mechanisms provide stability in annual operating margin.
Rate schedules in all service areas contain deferred energy or purchased gas adjustment provisions, which allow Southwest to file for rate adjustments as the cost of purchased gas changes. Deferred energy and purchased gas adjustment (collectively 
“PGA”) rate changes affect cash flows, but have no direct impact on profit margin. Filings to change rates in accordance with PGA clauses are subject to audit by the appropriate state regulatory commission staff.
Information with respect to recent general rate cases, PGA filings, and other regulatory proceedings is included in the Rates and Regulatory Proceedings section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”), which is incorporated by reference herein and included within the 2021 Annual Report to Stockholders.
The table below lists recent docketed general rate filings and the status of such filing within each ratemaking area:

Ratemaking Area | Type of Filing | Month Filed | Month Final RatesEffective
Arizona | General rate case | December 2021 | Pending 
California: | | | 
Northern, Southern, and South Lake Tahoe | General rate case | August 2019 | January 2021 
Nevada: | | | 
Northern and Southern | General rate case | August 2021 | Pending 
FERC*: | | | 
Great Basin | General rate case | May 2019 | February 2020 

*Separate from the natural gas distribution operations, and acquired by the Company as part of the Questar acquisition, Questar Pipeline, LLC, Overthrust Pipeline, LLC, and White River Hub, LLC (the latter, a 50% owned company accounted for under the equity method) are FERC regulated, each having filed their last general rate case in July 1995, March 2018, and October 2018, respectively. Other filings take place more frequently as necessary. Current rate structures are sufficient to cover cost of service and provide a return; each of these entities would file a rate case in the future to update their revenue requirement as necessary or required.
Demand for Natural Gas
Deliveries of natural gas by Southwest are made under a priority system established by state regulatory commissions. The priority system is intended to ensure that the gas requirements of higher-priority customers, primarily residential customers and other customers who use 500 therms or less of gas per day, are fully satisfied on a daily basis before lower-priority customers, primarily electric utility and large industrial customers able to use alternative fuels, are provided any quantity of gas or capacity.
Demand for natural gas is greatly affected by temperature. On cold days, use of gas by residential and commercial customers can be as much as seven times greater than on warm days because of increased use of gas for space heating. To fully satisfy this increased high-priority demand, gas is withdrawn from storage in certain service areas, or peaking supplies are purchased from suppliers. If necessary, service to interruptible lower-priority customers may be curtailed to provide the needed delivery system capacity. Southwest maintains no significant backlog on its orders for gas service.
Natural Gas Supply
Southwest is responsible for acquiring and arranging delivery of natural gas to its system in sufficient quantities to meet its sales customers’ needs. Southwest’s primary natural gas procurement objective is to ensure that adequate supplies of natural gas are available at a reasonable cost. Southwest acquires natural gas from a wide variety of sources with a mix of purchase provisions, which includes spot market and firm supplies. The purchases may have terms from one day to several years and utilize both fixed and indexed pricing. During 2021, Southwest acquired natural gas from 35 suppliers. Southwest regularly monitors the number of suppliers, their performance, and their relative contribution to the overall customer supply portfolio. New suppliers are contracted when possible, and solicitations for supplies are extended to the largest practicable list of suppliers, taking into account each supplier’s creditworthiness. Competitive pricing, flexibility in meeting Southwest’s requirements, and demonstrated reliability of service are instrumental to any one supplier’s inclusion in Southwest’s portfolio. The goal of this practice is to mitigate the risk of nonperformance by any one supplier and ensure competitive prices in the portfolio.
Balancing reliability with supply cost results in a continually changing mix of purchase provisions within the supply portfolios. To address the unique requirements of its various market areas, Southwest assembles and administers a separate natural gas supply portfolio for each of its jurisdictional areas. Southwest facilitates most natural gas purchases through competitive bid processes.
To mitigate customer exposure to short-term market price volatility, during 2021 Southwest sought to fix the price on a portion of its forecasted annual normal-weather volume requirement (up to 25% in the California jurisdiction and to a limited extent, in the Arizona jurisdiction), primarily using firm, fixed-price purchasing arrangements that are secured periodically throughout the year. Southwest’s price volatility mitigation program previously included the use of financial derivatives, in the form of fixed-for-floating-index-price swaps combined with indexed-price physical purchases, to secure a portion of the fixed-price portfolio, 
most recently, for the Arizona rate jurisdiction. The combination of fixed-price contracts and financial derivatives was designed to increase flexibility for Southwest and increase supplier diversification. The cost of such financial derivatives combined with the associated indexed-price physical purchases has been recoverable from customers through the PGA mechanism. For periods beyond October 2020, Southwest has not and does not plan to make fixed-price term purchases broadly in other than California (as set forth above), nor engage in swap transactions for any of its territories. 
For the 2021/2022 heating season, firm fixed-price physical commodity purchases ranged from approximately $3.90 to approximately $4.23 per dekatherm. Southwest makes natural gas purchases, not covered by firm fixed-price contracts, under variable-price contracts with firm quantities or on the spot market. Prices for these contracts are determined at the beginning of each month to reflect that month’s published first-of-month index price or based on a published daily price index. These monthly or daily index prices are not published or known until the purchase period begins.
The baseload firm natural gas supply arrangements are structured such that Southwest must nominate a stated volume of natural gas and the supplier must confirm that nomination. Contracts provide for fixed or market-based penalties to be paid by the non-performing party.
Storage availability may influence the average annual price of natural gas, as storage may allow a company to purchase natural gas quantities during the off-peak season and store it for use in high demand periods when prices may be greater or supplies/capacity, tighter. Dependent upon the rate jurisdiction, Southwest has some access to storage services, but overall there are small quantities of storage services available for Southwest’s use. For available storage services, Southwest purchases natural gas for injection during the off-peak period for use in the high demand months; however, since storage is limited, its impact is also limited in regard to Southwest’s annual average price of natural gas. Additionally, Southwest utilizes most available storage services for operational purposes to meet customer demand and not for economic purposes. This also limits the influence the available storage services have on Southwest’s average annual price of natural gas.
Southwest currently has no market area storage service availability in its southern Nevada rate jurisdiction; however, Southwest will begin receiving, in 2022, supply area storage services that will likely be used for the southern Nevada rate jurisdiction but could also be used to service the northern Nevada or northern California rate jurisdictions, as described below. Southwest has limited market area storage services availability for the southern and northern California, northern Nevada, and Arizona rate jurisdictions. The following summarizes Southwest’s access to storage services for those rate jurisdictions.
Southwest has a storage services contract with Southern California Gas Company for use only within Southwest’s southern California rate jurisdiction.
Southwest contracts for storage services from Great Basin’s above-ground LNG facility. This storage service generally provides vaporization and injection, as well as peaking capability only for the northern Nevada and northern California rate jurisdictions. 
As referenced above, beginning in 2022, Southwest has contracted for supply area storage services from Spire Storage West. This storage will likely be used for the southern Nevada rate jurisdiction, but could also be used to service the northern Nevada or northern California rate jurisdictions.
Southwest also has interruptible storage contracts with Northwest Pipeline Corporation (“NWPL”) for the northern Nevada and northern California rate jurisdictions. NWPL has the discretion to limit Southwest’s ability to inject or withdraw from this interruptible storage, which consequently limits Southwest’s use of this interruptible storage capacity. As such, this storage provides limited operational flexibility to adjust daily flowing supplies to meet demand.
For the Arizona rate jurisdiction, Southwest operates a 233,000 dekatherm above-ground LNG facility in southern Arizona. This facility is intended to enhance service reliability and flexibility in natural gas deliveries in the area by providing a local storage option that is operated by Southwest and connected directly to its distribution system. 
Natural gas supplies for Southwest’s southern system (Arizona, southern Nevada, and southern California properties) are primarily obtained from producing regions in Colorado and New Mexico (San Juan basin), Texas (Permian basin), and Rocky Mountain areas. For its northern system (northern Nevada and northern California properties), Southwest primarily obtains natural gas from Rocky Mountain producing areas and from Canada.
The landscape for national natural gas supply is continuously changing. Advanced drilling techniques continue to provide access to abundant and sustainable natural gas supplies. The natural gas market has responded to the abundant supply of natural gas at prices that are competitive with other forms of energy. Forecasts show that an ample and diverse natural gas supply continues to be available to Southwest’s customers at a competitive price when compared with competing forms of energy.
Southwest arranges for transportation of natural gas to its Arizona, Nevada, and California service territories through the pipeline systems of El Paso Natural Gas Company (“El Paso”), Kern River Gas Transmission Company (“Kern River”), Transwestern Pipeline Company (“Transwestern”), NWPL, Tuscarora Gas Pipeline Company (“Tuscarora”), Southern California Gas Company, Great Basin, and Ruby Pipeline LLC (“Ruby”), costs for which are recovered from Southwest’s customers through the PGA mechanism. Southwest regularly monitors short- and long-term supply and pipeline capacity 
availability to ensure the reliability of service to its customers. Southwest currently receives firm transportation service, both on a short- and long-term basis, for all its service territories on the pipeline systems noted above. Southwest also contracts for firm natural gas supplies that are delivered to Southwest’s city gates to supplement its firm capacity on the interstate pipelines and to meet projected peak-day demands. Southwest could also utilize its interruptible contracts on the interstate pipelines for the transportation of additional natural gas supplies.
Southwest believes that the current levels of contracted firm interstate capacity and delivered purchases are sufficient to serve each of its service territories’ forecasted peak-day requirements. As the need arises to acquire additional capacity on one of the interstate pipeline transmission systems and to secure additional supply, primarily due to customer growth, Southwest will continue to consider available options to obtain that capacity (either through the use of firm contracts with a pipeline company or by purchasing capacity on the open market), and will also consider options for the purchase of additional firm delivered natural gas supplies.
Competition
Electric utilities are the principal competitors of Southwest for the residential and small commercial markets throughout its service areas. Competition for space heating, general household, and small commercial energy needs generally occurs at the initial installation phase when the customer/builder typically makes the decision as to which type of equipment to install and operate. The customer will generally continue to use the chosen energy source for the life of the equipment. Southwest interfaces directly with the various home builders and commercial property developers in its service territories to ensure that natural gas appliances are considered in new developments and commercial centers. As a result of its efforts, Southwest has continued to experience growth in the new construction market among residential and small commercial customer classes. In 2021, Southwest provided natural gas to a large majority of the new homes constructed during the year in the major metropolitan markets composing our service territories.
Certain large commercial, industrial, and electric generation customers have the capability to switch to alternative energy sources. To date, Southwest has been successful in retaining most of these customers by setting rates (subject to conditions of the respective state tariffs) at levels competitive with commercially available alternative energy sources such as electricity and fuel oils. However, high natural gas prices or policies surrounding electrification could impact Southwest’s ability to retain some of these customers. Alternative energy has gained momentum in governmental policy overall in recent years. Southwest has taken steps to align with these efforts by supporting energy efficiency in our jurisdictions, being part of greenhouse gas protocols and initiatives in California, and creating new biogas and renewable natural gas (“RNG”) tariff schedules in Arizona, California, and Nevada. See also Environmental Matters below. While certain forms of renewable energy initiatives compete with natural gas, the abundance and low cost of natural gas, as well as the convenience and comfort it provides to our customers, result in competitive advantages across our portfolio of customers. Overall, management does not anticipate any material adverse impact on operating margin from fuel switching or alternative energy initiatives over the near term. Additionally, the Company instituted a Board of Directors strategic review process to help facilitate and ensure success as the energy transition advances.
Southwest competes with interstate transmission pipeline companies, such as El Paso, Kern River, Transwestern, Tuscarora, and Ruby to provide service to certain large end-users. End-use customers located in proximity to these interstate pipelines pose a potential bypass threat. Southwest closely monitors each customer situation and provides competitive service in order to retain the customer. Southwest has remained competitive through the use of negotiated transportation contract rates (subject to conditions of the respective state tariffs), special long-term contracts with electric generation and cogeneration customers, and other tariff programs. These competitive response initiatives have mitigated the loss of operating margin earned from large customers.
Environmental Matters
Federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment have a direct impact upon Southwest. Environmental efforts, with respect to matters such as storm water management, emissions of air pollutants, hazardous material management, and protection of endangered species and archaeological resources, directly impact the complexity and time required to obtain pipeline rights-of-way and construction permits. There have also been a number of federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives proposed in recent years in an attempt to control or limit the effects of global warming and overall climate change, including greenhouse gas emissions (“GHGs”), such as methane. The adoption of this type of legislation by Congress or similar legislation by state governments mandating a substantial reduction in GHGs, or decarbonization generally, could have significant impacts on the energy industry in the future. Such new legislation or regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions on our business, affect the demand for natural gas, or impact the prices we charge our customers. At this time, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws or regulations, if adopted, on our future business, financial condition, or results. However, increased environmental legislation and regulation can also be beneficial to the natural gas industry. Natural gas is more environmentally-friendly than many other fuels currently available and its use can help energy users comply with stricter environmental air quality standards. While 
transportation is typically cited as the leading source of carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S., natural gas for residential consumption/use is cited as accounting for less than 5% of total U.S. GHG emissions. 
Southwest remains committed to providing customers with clean, efficient, affordable natural gas service and continues to work with policy makers and regulators to support and adopt renewable initiatives and expanded use of RNG and compressed natural gas (“CNG”) as a transportation fuel. Additionally, Southwest is investigating blending hydrogen into its gas supply. Southwest is not only supporting a regional transportation customer in Nevada with its fleet’s RNG and CNG needs, but Southwest also received favorable cost recovery regarding the conversion of part of its own vehicle fleet to CNG, in support of the state’s greenhouse gas emission reduction goals. In recent years, regulatory activity in Arizona, California, and Nevada led to provisions allowing for the development of RNG projects. In addition, proposals have been made in all three states to allow Southwest to purchase RNG as part of its gas supply portfolio; in the California and Nevada jurisdictions, those proposals have been accepted by regulators or legislative bodies.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) and State of California Environmental Protection Agency (the “Cal/EPA”) regulations require the reporting of GHGs from large sources and suppliers in order to facilitate the development of policies and programs to reduce GHGs. Southwest reports required information to the EPA and Cal/EPA under respective rules, including the volumes of natural gas that it receives for distribution to LDC customers, and the GHG emissions that result from the operation of its LDC pipelines.
California legislation and regulations promulgated by the California Air Resources Board (the “CARB”) require Southwest to comply with the California GHG Emissions Reporting Program and the California Cap and Trade Program, which play an important role in the state’s goal of reducing GHG emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. Southwest must report annual GHGs each year. The CARB annually allocates to Southwest a certain number of allowances based on Southwest’s reported 2011 GHGs. Of those allocated allowances, Southwest must consign a certain percentage to the CARB for auction. Southwest can use any allocated allowances that remain after consignment, along with allowances it can purchase through CARB auctions or reserve sales, or through over the counter (“OTC”) purchases with other market participants, to meet its compliance obligations. 
There are ongoing three-year compliance periods established. One ended in 2017, another ended in 2020, and the current compliance period ends in 2023. Southwest successfully met the 2017 and 2020 compliance obligations by surrendering a sufficient number of allowances prior to November 1, 2018 and November 1, 2021, respectively. Southwest will meet the 2023 compliance obligation by surrendering a sufficient number of allowances prior to November 1, 2024, or will purchase carbon offsets in order to meet those obligations. During the first quarter of 2022, Southwest successfully bid on offsets at auction to partially meet these requirements. While carbon offsets can be only be used to satisfy a portion of the compliance obligation per year, the recent auction in 2022 supports compliance years through 2025. The CPUC previously issued a decision that provides for the regulatory treatment of the program costs. The decision also implemented the California Climate Credit in October 2018, representing a return of auction proceeds, which is updated annually each April. There is no expected impact on earnings. 
UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES
Centuri is a strategic utility infrastructure services company dedicated to partnering with North America’s gas and electric providers to build and maintain the energy network that powers millions of homes across the U.S. and Canada. Centuri’s skilled workforce delivers a comprehensive and integrated array of solutions through its operating companies. Centuri derives revenue primarily from installation, replacement, repair, and maintenance of energy networks. The primary focus of Centuri operations is the replacement of electric service lines and natural gas distribution pipelines, as well as new infrastructure installations. With the recent expansion of its electric services business and its geographic footprint through the acquisition of Riggs Distler, Centuri has grown its emergency restoration services, where necessary, to bring its customers’ above-ground utility infrastructure back on line following regional storms. Utility infrastructure services work varies from relatively small projects to the installation of infrastructure for entire residential communities or business parks. Centuri seeks to build long-term relationships with customers to meet their needs across geographies and across both electric and gas infrastructure. Utility infrastructure services activity is seasonal in many of Centuri’s operating areas. Peak periods are the summer and fall months in colder climate areas, such as the northeastern and midwestern U.S. and Canada. In warmer climate areas, such as the southwestern and southeastern U.S., utility infrastructure services activity typically continues year round. 
During recent years, various factors resulted in an increase in large multi-year utility system replacement programs and expanded protocols. The U.S. Energy Policy Act of 2005 established mandatory electric grid reliability standards and incentivized investments in transmission and distribution systems. The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) instituted Distribution Integrity Management Programs (“DIMP”) effective February 2010, which required operators of gas distribution pipelines to develop and implement integrity management programs to enhance safety by identifying and reducing pipeline integrity risks. FERC Order No. 1000, issued in July 2011, established transmission planning requirements to encourage development of electric transmission infrastructure projects. In 2020, PHMSA issued its final “Mega Rule,” including requirements for reconfirming transmission pipeline maximum 
allowable operating pressure and verification of pipeline materials, in addition to expanding assessments and requirements for work in moderate consequence areas, among other things. Likewise, there has been significant attention placed on electric grid modernization through national infrastructure legislation and related initiatives. The Department of Energy estimates more than 70% of the nation’s grid transmission lines and power transformers are over 25 years old, creating vulnerability particularly in light of seasonal storm and extreme weather events. Centuri’s services also support customers’ environmental goals, such as reducing methane emissions from pipeline leaks through pipe repair and replacement. Centuri is well positioned to support growing customer attention in achieving environmental objectives through infrastructure construction and maintenance.
Centuri’s contract terms with utility customers generally specify unit-price or time-and-materials (“T&M”) terms under master service agreements, and occasionally fixed-price arrangements for bid work. Unit-price contracts establish prices for all of the various services to be performed during the contract period. These contracts often have annual pricing reviews that provide an opportunity for Centuri to reflect anticipated increases in labor costs. Centuri customers supply materials required for building and maintenance services under the majority of Centuri’s contracts, and thus increased costs of materials generally do not present a direct material risk to Centuri. During 2021, approximately 88% of revenue was earned under unit-price and T&M contracts. Storm restoration services are often contracted under T&M rates and generally involve a higher number of hours worked per day given the emergency response nature of the work performed. Backlog represents the dollar amount of revenue Centuri expects to recognize in the future from contracts awarded and in progress as of the end of the reporting period. Reported backlog differs from the concept of remaining performance obligations as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”) and is not a measure of contract profitability. As of December 31, 2021, backlog of approximately $106 million existed with respect to outstanding fixed-priced contracts. Centuri maintains an average customer relationship tenure of more than 20 years, supported by its unwavering commitments to safety, quality, community engagement, and workforce development.
Materials used by Centuri in its utility infrastructure service activities are typically specified, purchased, and supplied by Centuri’s customers. Contracts with customers also contain provisions which make customers generally liable for remediating environmental hazards encountered during the construction process. Such hazards might include digging in an area that was contaminated prior to construction, finding endangered animals, digging in historically significant sites, etc. Otherwise, Centuri’s operations have limited environmental impact (dust control, normal waste disposal, handling harmful materials, etc.).
Competition within the industry has traditionally been limited to several regional and numerous local competitors in what has been a largely fragmented industry. Some national competitors also exist within the industry. Centuri operates in over 68 primary locations across 45 states and provinces in the U.S. and Canada, with its corporate headquarters located in Phoenix, Arizona. During 2021, Centuri served over 300 customers, with Southwest accounting for approximately 5% of total revenue. Another individual customer accounted for approximately 11% of total revenue, while five other customers individually accounted for 5% or more of total revenue.
Centuri is not directly affected by regulations promulgated by the ACC, PUCN, CPUC, or FERC. Centuri is an unregulated subsidiary of the Company. However, because Centuri performs work for Southwest, its associated costs are subject indirectly to “prudency reviews” like any other capital work performed by third parties or directly by Southwest. However, such reviews would not bring Centuri under the regulatory jurisdiction of any of the commissions noted above.
Centuri, through its subsidiaries, holds a 50% interest in W.S. Nicholls Western Construction Ltd. (“Western”), a Canadian infrastructure services company that specializes in construction of underground aviation fueling systems and storage tanks. Western is a variable interest entity of which Centuri is not the primary beneficiary; therefore, Western is not consolidated with Centuri and is, instead, accounted for under the equity method of accounting. To date, Western, has not been a significant component of Centuri’s financial results. 
PIPELINE AND STORAGE 
Questar Pipelines was acquired by Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. on December 31, 2021. The operations are comprised of over 2,000 miles of highly-contracted FERC-regulated interstate natural gas pipelines providing transportation and underground storage services in Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado. The operations specifically include two wholly owned, FERC-regulated businesses (referred to herein as Questar Pipeline and Overthrust Pipeline), and another FERC-regulated pipeline held as a 50% interest in White River Hub (“WRH”). WRH is a variable interest entity of which Questar Pipelines is not the primary beneficiary; therefore, WRH is not consolidated with MountainWest and is, instead, accounted for under the equity method of accounting. 
Collectively, Questar Pipelines has fewer that two hundred customers, which include storage customers, marketers, end-users, power generators, or utilities. The two largest customers comprise nearly half of their expected revenues, including an entity that was affiliated prior to the acquisition by the Company. 
Its operations are primarily in the midstream, including 56 billion cubic feet (“Bcf”) of storage capacity that has, in the recent past, been at or near full contracting.
Operationally, it is subject to certain similar influences of the Company’s significant subsidiary, Southwest Gas Corporation. It is subject to the operational and pricing requirements under FERC and PHMSA rulemaking. Questar Pipelines is also subject to similar environmental and political influences as Southwest. Federal, state, and local regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment have a direct impact on Questar Pipelines’ operations. For example, in recent years, legislation implemented in Colorado, significantly amended the Oil and Gas Conservation Act and directed the Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment (the “CDPHE”) to promulgate new rules to meet the state’s GHG emissions goals. In 2021, the CDPHE amended certain regulations, that among other things, established a steering committee to develop recommendations for the reduction of GHG emissions. That steering committee is directed to consider all means of reducing GHGs, with guidelines expected in 2023. While MountainWest will be part of the Company’s broader consideration for deployment on renewables undertakings, these and other developments will be monitored for their impact on Questar Pipelines and the Company.
HUMAN CAPITAL
At Southwest, Centuri, MountainWest, and throughout our collective operations, employees are critical to our success. Their talent and dedication are what allow us to provide safe and reliable service to customers and explore new opportunities that align with our strategies, while carrying out organizational core values related to safety, quality, and stewardship, among others. The Board oversees matters relating to our vision, values, and culture where diversity, equity, and inclusion; human and workplace rights; and employee health and safety are priorities. The Board receives regular reports from management and subject matter experts in these areas, and in turn provides guidance on current and future initiatives. The Board also assists management in integrating responsibility and sustainability into strategic activities to create long-term customer and shareholder value.
Southwest, Centuri, and MountainWest are committed to the safety of our employees and the communities we serve every day. Employees and contract workers receive initial safety orientation training to learn practices, procedures, and policies established by Southwest, Centuri, and MountainWest. New and recurring safety training occurs at regular intervals thereafter. Frontline safety strategies, developed with executive leadership, contribute to the improvement of our safety management systems. Safety metrics also form part of incentive compensation programs for leaders of all the Company’s business segments, reinforcing our top priority to safeguard our communities, our employees, and our assets. At Southwest, such metrics included Damages per 1,000 Tickets and Incident Response Time; at Centuri, they included Total Recordable Incident Rate and Days Away/Restricted/Transferred (“DART”); and at MountainWest such metrics included OSHA Injury Rate, DART, and Preventable Motor Vehicle Incident Rate, among others. In each case, the measures are widely used in the respective industries comprising our businesses. All segments maintain additional programs and extensive employee training initiatives to promote safe work.
At December 31, 2021, Southwest had 2,286 regular full-time equivalent employees. Southwest believes that a skilled, highly trained workforce is a key to success in the utility industry, and a driver of Southwest’s safety performance and high customer satisfaction ratings. Southwest believes it has a good relationship with its employees and that compensation, benefits, and working conditions are comparable to those generally found in the utility industry. In recent years, employee engagement surveys have been deployed to gauge the extent to which employees feel connected and valued. Flexible working arrangements are available to employees, which support work-life balance. No Southwest employees are represented by a labor union. A stable workforce has been important to knowledge transfer and succession processes, with the average tenure of Southwest employees being approximately 12 years. Germane to attracting and retaining employees are our compensation and benefits programs, which are regularly reviewed. For employees hired on or before December 31, 2021, Southwest maintains an employee pension plan based on eligibility and vesting, and also provides a 50% company match on the first 7% of employee contributions through its defined contribution plan. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2022 will be eligible for enhanced employer contributions of 3% plus a matching contribution up to 7% (dollar-for-dollar) of eligible compensation through the defined contribution plan instead of participating in the defined benefit pension plan. The health and wellness of our workforce are supported by group insurance programs, incentive programs in support of total health, and related employee programs. Southwest also offers a tuition assistance program. Regular succession planning helps ensure that talent is identified, and existing and prospective leaders are developed in order to build their skills and be prepared for future roles.
At December 31, 2021, Centuri had 10,434 regular full-time equivalent employees, including additional full-time equivalent employees resulting from the Riggs Distler acquisition, working in over 45 states and provinces throughout the U.S. and Canada. Employee counts fluctuate between seasonal periods, normally heaviest in the summer and fall. Typical of the segment’s industry, a majority of Centuri employees are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements. Centuri maintains a market-based total rewards strategy to attract, retain, motivate, and develop employees. Additionally, Centuri has a scholarship program, which awards more than half of the grants to minority students who are dependents of Centuri employees. Similar employee engagement and succession planning protocols to those existing at Southwest are deployed at Centuri.
The acquisition of Questar Pipelines increased the number of states in which the Company operates. As of December 31, 2021, MountainWest had 253 full-time employees across Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado. MountainWest is comprised of a highly 
skilled workforce which provides gas transportation and underground storage services in the midstream space. MountainWest does not have a unionized workforce. Pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated as of October 5, 2021, by and between Dominion and the Company, Questar Pipelines employees transferred as part of the acquisition will have certain employment protections for a period of 24 months beginning December 31, 2021. In addition, pursuant to the TSA, Dominion will continue to provide certain services with respect to the operations of MountainWest for up to 12 months, including many administrative processes. 
Management believes that a positive onboarding experience is foundational to positive employee engagement and rapid productivity. As part of the acquisition strategy, management has established a robust integration program with the goal of enabling the transferred Questar Pipelines employees to quickly integrate into the Company’s culture. The Company will be working to develop an operating model during the TSA period during which MountainWest will be leveraging Dominion Energy, Inc.’s personnel and systems. During the development of the operating model, the Company will be reviewing current state processes for the development of future state processes to facilitate the integration and necessary administrative stand up of MountainWest. This will include building an organizational structure and hiring additional employees where gaps exist, as well as reviewing outsourcing solutions that are financially prudent to support future state processes. Other activities will include policy changes to support new processes, employee engagement and culture, and management changes to support employees and leaders during this transitional period.
Collectively, we embrace a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion to not only protect employees under laws designed to do so regardless of race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, age, disability, pregnancy, and veteran status, but to reinforce the value that diversity brings to the workplace. We strive to have a workforce that reflects the communities we serve, and engage experts from time to time to update management on the trends and benefits of diverse backgrounds, cultures, and perspectives. Our belief is that adherence to these principles forms the genesis of a workforce that is both diverse and inclusive. Southwest and Centuri have several programs, including employee resource groups, diversity councils, a diversity ambassadors (champions) network, educational outreach programs, and other initiatives designed to attract and retain a diverse workforce. We commit to creating a safe and respectful workplace by encouraging employees to value diversity through unconscious bias training, and by inviting them to engage in meaningful conversations about diversity, equity, and inclusion topics. Through these and other efforts, we place value in our people and nurture their development, while ensuring that all employees have an equitable opportunity for success.
