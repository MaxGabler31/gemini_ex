Industry Overview
At the highest level, semiconductors can be classified either as discrete devices, such as individual transistors, or integrated circuits, where a number of transistors and other components are combined to form a more complicated electronic subsystem. ICs can be divided into three primary categories: digital, analog, and mixed-signal. Digital ICs, such as memory devices and microprocessors, can store or perform arithmetic functions with data. Analog ICs, by contrast, handle real-world signals such as temperature, pressure, light, sound or speed, and also perform power management functions such as regulating or converting voltages for electronic devices. Mixed-signal ICs combine digital and analog functions onto a single chip and play an important role in bridging real world inputs into the digital domain.
Historically, growth in the semiconductor industry has been driven by content expansion in computing, mobile and consumer electronics. However, research analysts anticipate that as each of these markets approach saturation, the automotive sector will become one of the fastest growing opportunities. Specifically, according to a November 2021 report from Allied Market Research, the global automotive semiconductor market, which was valued at $38 billion in 2020, is projected to reach $114 billion by 2030, registering a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of nearly 12 percent from 2021 to 2030. 
indie’s Market Opportunity
In today’s automobiles, semiconductors perform a variety of functions across multiple electronic components and systems, including sensing, processing data, storing information and converting or controlling signals. Semiconductor architectures vary significantly depending upon the specific function or application of the end product. They also differ based on a number of technical characteristics, including the degree of integration, level of customization, programmability and the underlying process technology utilized in manufacturing and assembly.
While semiconductors have always comprised the core building blocks of automotive electronic systems and equipment, recent technological advances have substantially increased their features, functionality and performance. Today, they support enhanced user interfaces and offer improved power consumption — all with reduced footprints and lower costs. These innovations have resulted in significant growth opportunities spanning diverse end markets and applications.
The twin megatrends driving the automotive semiconductor market are the rapid proliferation of electric vehicles (“EVs”) and adoption of ADAS functionality as the industry moves towards completely autonomous vehicles. Deloitte’s global EV forecast 
Table of Contents

is for a 29 percent CAGR over a 10-year period, with total annual EV sales growing from 2.5 million in 2020 to 31.1 million by 2030, representing almost one third of all new car production. These estimated sales volumes are driven in part by increasing governmental mandates in Europe and Asia, along with similar new legislation in the United States. For example, special provisions in the United States Clean Air Act allow states to either follow the federal requirements or adopt California’s vehicle emission regulations. As of December 2021, 16 states have adopted California’s Low-Emission Vehicle (“LEV”) criteria pollutant and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emission regulations and Zero-Emission Vehicle (“ZEV”) regulations. Further, EVs are also benefiting from higher performance in terms of horsepower and range as well as compelling long-term economics resulting from decreased battery prices, lower lifetime maintenance costs and total cost of ownership. 2021 has already been a major year for EV action. Several countries including the U.K., Japan, Norway, Canada, Germany and Sweden have strengthened or implemented new internal combustion engine vehicle bans; as part of its EV Early Adoption Initiative, to be launched in 2022, and increased investment in charging infrastructure; and India amended its FAME scheme to increase EV purchasing and manufacturing incentives.
At the same time, global ADAS volumes are expected to increase substantially, driven by consumer demand and government mandates for increased vehicle safety features. The European New Car Assessment Program (“NCAP”), which has been focused on fostering safe cars since 1996, requires a minimum level of crash mitigation functionality in new vehicles, such as Automatic Electronic Braking (“AEB”), Lane Keeping Assist (“LKA”) and other driver-assist features, in order for a vehicle to be awarded a 5-star rating. Similarly, the European Union is moving towards requiring speed assistance, driver drowsiness, attention-warning and driver distraction systems. In the United States, ADAS adoption and consumer education on advanced crash avoidance capabilities are being fueled by industry standards such as the U.S. NCAP and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety “Top Safety Pick” and “Top Safety Pick+” awards. Additionally, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and 20 automakers recently pledged to voluntarily equip nearly all new passenger vehicles by September 1, 2022, with low-speed AEB systems that include forward-collision warning. With global safety rating programs and auto manufacturers pushing to deliver more safety and comfort features to customers, the ADAS market size is projected to reach $58 billion by 2028, up from $27 billion in 2020, or a 11.4% CAGR, according to Fortune Business Insights.
indie’s addressable market is not solely dependent on global automotive volumes, but rather on the increased levels of semiconductor content that are required in vehicles to support safety systems, connected car, enhanced user experiences and EV applications as defined below:
•Safety Systems: Automotive safety features are evolving from passive to active systems, with the addition of ADAS and sensor technologies such as radar and vision. The path to Level 4 (high autonomy) and Level 5 (full autonomy) also contributes to ADAS adoption in vehicles today.
•Connected Car: Vehicles are increasingly called upon to communicate not only within the cabin, but also with external devices and networks. Smart car access, automotive Near-Field Communication (“NFC”) and Ultra-Wide Band (“UWB”) technologies, which enable the connection of vehicles and keys with external devices (including smart phones and vehicle to vehicle applications), are becoming increasingly standardized in baseline vehicle models rather than solely in the luxury or customized vehicles segments. Data integrity and security hardware features for safeguarding memory and other critical data are also becoming standard across all vehicle models, particularly as vehicles interface with external networks.
•User Experience: Comfort and convenience systems coupled with user interface applications, such as the inclusion of digital cockpits with multiple, large, interactive screens, require increased processing power. In addition, indie believes that consumer demand for the standardization of higher-end options across a greater number of vehicle classes, as well as complex internal vehicle customization, will drive higher semiconductor content.
•Electrification: Higher performance, broader availability of charging stations and more stringent emissions regulations are each accelerating the move toward electric vehicles.

We encourage our customers to frequently visit both our design centers and our manufacturing partners to ensure that the processes and quality meet the standards they have come to expect. We are ISO9001 certified and intend to pursue further certifications.
Intellectual Property
The core strengths of our business are our intellectual property portfolio and engineering experience, both of which guide product development activities and our approach to patent filings.
Our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of our proprietary technologies. In general, we have elected to pursue patent protection for aspects of our circuit and device designs that we believe are patentable. We have a number of core technology patents currently in process, including provisions, but we do not rely on any particular patent or patents for our success and have instead relied on our know-how and trade secrets. We also rely on a combination of non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions, as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty, to protect our technology and processes.
The semiconductor industry in general is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Patent infringement is an ongoing risk, in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, and we may have to defend ourselves against infringement claims.
Competition
The market for high-performance analog, digital and mixed-signal semiconductors for automotive applications, is competitive although recent consolidation across the semiconductor industry has reduced the number of viable competitors and created design opportunities for us. Our primary competitors are other automotive-focused semiconductor companies, including Infineon, Monolithic Power Systems, NXP, Renesas and ST Microelectronics.
Some competitors have more financial resources than we do, while others have a more diversified set of products and end markets. Accordingly, such competitors may be able to more quickly respond to customer requests and market developments, and to better withstand external economic or market factors.
However, we believe that our technical and design experience, our existing approved vendor list position across a dozen Tier 1 automotive suppliers, and a growing demand for software embedded solutions with proprietary manufacturing and packaging capabilities, position us to outpace our addressable market.
Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability
We believe responsible and sustainable business practices support our long-term success. As a company, we are committed to protecting and supporting our people, our environment, and our communities. This commitment is reflected through our day-to-day activities, including adoption of socially responsible policies and procedures, our focus on fostering an inclusive workplace, our constant drive toward more efficient use of materials and energy, our careful management of our supply chain, our products which help enhance road safety, and our ethics and compliance program.
