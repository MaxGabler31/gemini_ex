The following is a description of our corporate history and structure:
 
Perfect Dream Limited (“Perfect Dream”) was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on July 1, 2004. Perfect Dream was originally formed as a holding company, and it became our wholly-owned subsidiary as a result of a share exchange transaction completed in November 2005.

Goldenway invested approximately $0.8 million (approximately RMB 6.0 million) in cash, and La Chapelle invested approximately $0.6 million (RMB 4.0 million) in cash, for a 60% and 40% ownership interest, respectively, in LA GO GO.  In connection with the formation of LA GO GO, Goldenway made a strategic investment in La Chapelle by acquiring a 10% equity interest in La Chapelle with a cash payment of RMB 10 million (approximately USD$1.4 million). The business objective of the joint venture was to establish and create a leading brand of ladies’ garments for the mainland Chinese market.  On March 23, 2009, Goldenway transferred all of its ownership interest in LA GO GO to Ever-Glory International Group Apparel Inc. (“Ever-Glory Apparel”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Goldenway. On April 23, 2010, Ever-Glory Apparel acquired the 40% non-controlling interest in LA GO GO from La Chapelle for approximately $0.9 million (RMB 6.2 million), bringing our ownership in LA GO GO to 100%. In connection with such acquisition, and in order to focus on our core business, Goldenway sold the 10% equity interest in La Chapelle to the original shareholders of La Chapelle and, in return, received a total cash payment of RMB 12.4 million (approximately $1.8 million).

Business Operations
 
Our wholesale operations include a complete set of services of supply chain management and worldwide sale of apparel to well-known domestic and international casual wear, sportswear and outerwear brands and retailers in major markets. We conduct our original design manufacturing (“ODM”) operations through six wholly owned subsidiaries which are located in the Nanjing Jiangning Economic and Technological Development Zone and Shang Fang Town in the Jiangning District in Nanjing, Jiangsu province, China, and Chuzhou, Anhui province, China: Ever-Glory International Group Apparel Inc. (“Ever-Glory Apparel”), Goldenway Nanjing Garments Company Limited (“Goldenway”), Nanjing New-Tailun Garments Company Limited (“New Tailun”), Nanjing Catch-Luck Garments Co., Ltd.

In our fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, our wholesale segment achieved total sales of $218.6 million. 
 
Although we have our own manufacturing capacity, we currently outsource most of the manufacturing to our strategic long-term contractors as part of our overall business strategy. Outsourcing allows us to maximize our production capacity and remain flexible while reducing capital expenditures and the costs of keeping skilled workers on production lines during times of seasonally lower sales. We inspect products manufactured by our long-term contractors to ensure that they meet our high-quality control standards. Total unit output from our manufacturing facilities and outsourced partners is more than 14.0 million pieces in 2018. See Production and Quality Control below.
 
Our retail business objective is to establish and develop leading brands of women’s wear and to build a nationwide retail distribution channel in China. We conduct our retail operations through Shanghai LA GO GO Fashion Company Limited (“Shanghai LA GO GO”), Jiangsu LA GO GO Fashion Company Limited (“Jiangsu LA GO GO”), Tianjin LA GO GO Fashion Company Limited (“Tianjin LA GO GO”), Shanghai Ya Lan Fashion Company Limited (“Ya Lan”), Xizang He Meida Trading Company Limited (“He Meida”) and Shanghai Yiduo Fashion Company Limited (“Yiduo”).

Customers
 
We manufacture garments for a number of well-known retail chains and famous domestic and international brands. We also have our own in-house design capabilities and can provide our customers with a selection of original designs that the customer may have manufactured-to-order. We normally supply our customers through purchase orders and we have no long-term supply contracts with any of them.
 
In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 58.3% of our sales revenue came from customers in China, 3.1% of our sales revenue came from customers in Germany, 21.1% of our sales revenue came from customers in United Kingdom and other European countries, 14.0% from customers in the United States, and 3.5% from customers in Japan.

Substantially all of our long-lived assets were located in the PRC as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.

Suppliers
 
We purchase the majority of our raw materials (including fabric, fasteners, thread, buttons, labels and related materials) directly from numerous local fabric and accessories suppliers in China. For our wholesale business, collectively, purchases from our five largest suppliers represented approximately 16.2% and 13.9% of total raw material purchases in 2018 and 2017, respectively. No single supplier provided more than 10% of our total purchases. 
 
We also purchased finished goods from contract manufacturers. For our wholesale business, collectively, purchases from our five largest contract manufacturers represented approximately 38.8% and 43.8% of total finished goods purchases in 2018 and 2017, respectively.  One contract manufacturer provided approximately 18.1% and 24.0% of our total finished goods purchases in 2018 and 2017.
 
For our wholesale business, we generally agree to pay our suppliers within 30 to 90 days after our receipt of goods. We typically place orders for materials from suppliers when we receive orders from our customers. On average, the materials will generally be consumed by production in approximately 20 days.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We have set up our own merchandising department to interface with our customers. We believe we have developed good and stable business relationships with our main customers in Europe, the U.S., Japan and China. Our sales staff typically works directly with our customers and arranges the terms of the contracts with them.
 
Our management believes that we continue to benefit from our solid reputation for providing high quality goods and professional service in the markets where we have a presence, which provides us further opportunities to work with desirable customers. Our marketing strategy aims to attract customers with outstanding brands from top markets. We seek to attract customers mainly from Europe, the U.S., Japan, and China. In addition, we look for customers with strong brand recognition and product lines that require high quality manufacturing and generate sufficient sales volume to support our sizeable production capacity. Referrals from existing customers have been and will continue to be a fruitful source of new customers. In addition, we aim to maintain an active presence in trade shows around the world, including those in Europe, the U.S., Japan, and China.
 
Production and Quality Control
 
In 2018, approximately 5.1% of the products we sold to wholesale customers were in our own manufacturing facilities. We typically outsource the manufacturing of a large portion of our products based upon factory capacity and customer demand. The number of outside contract manufacturers to which we outsource is expected to increase in order to meet the anticipated growth in demand from our customers.
 
As of December 31, 2018, our total production capacity, including outsourced production, reached 14.0 million pieces per year. At present, we believe our production capacity is sufficient to meet customer demand.
 
We are committed to designing and manufacturing high quality garments. We place the highest standard on quality control because we emphasize the high quality of our products. We have implemented strict quality control and craft discipline systems. Before we manufacture large quantities, we obtain the approval from our customers either through in-person visits to the factories or by shipping samples of our products to our customers for testing, inspection and feedback. This ensures that our products perfectly meet specifications prior to production. In addition, our trained professional quality control personnel periodically inspect the manufacturing process and quality of our apparel products. Our factory is ISO 9001:2000 certified. ISO 9000 is a family of standards for quality management systems maintained by ISO, International Organization for Standardization, and is administered by accreditation and certification bodies. We have been independently audited and certified to be in conformance with ISO 9001 which certifies that formalized business processes are being applied.

Due to our strict quality control and testing process, we have not undergone any significant product or merchandise recalls, and we generally do not receive any significant requests by our customers to return finished goods. Product returns are not a material factor in our business.
 
We anticipate to continue outsourcing a large portion of our production. Management believes that outsourcing allows us to maximize our production flexibility while reducing significant capital expenditure and the costs associated with managing a large production workforce. We contract for the production of a portion of our products through various outside independent manufacturers. Quality control reviews are done by our employees during and after production before the garments leave the outsourcing factories to ensure that material and component qualities and the products “fits” are in accordance with our specifications. We inspect prototypes of each product prior to cutting by the contractors and conduct a final inspection of finished products prior to shipment to ensure that they meet our high standards.
 
Delivery and Transportation
 
We generally do not hold any significant inventory of finished goods for more than ninety days, as we typically ship finished goods to our customers upon completion.
Competition
 
The garment manufacturing industry is highly competitive, particularly in China. Our competitors include garment manufacturers of all sizes, both within China and elsewhere in the world, many of which have greater financial and manufacturing resources than us. We have been in the garment manufacturing business since 1993 and believe that we have earned a reputation of producing high quality products with high efficiency, competitive prices, and excellent customer service. We believe we provide one-stop total solutions and more valuable products for our customers.
 
Currently, we have several small-to-large sized competitors in China including some state-owned trading groups and private garment companies. We believe we differentiate ourselves from the competition and will be able to effectively compete with our competitors due to our persistent pursuit of quality control, a diversified casual wear product lineup, and in-house design talent. In addition, we believe we derive advantages from our customer feedback in the supply chain and the use of our advanced Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system. Our ERP system integrates many of our operational processes into one system including order processing, statistical analysis, purchasing, manufacturing, logistics and financial control systems, providing management with instantaneous feedback on important aspects of our business operations.
 
Governmental Regulations/Quotas
 
In 2018, we were not subject to any export quota imposed by countries where our customers are located. Nevertheless, we have noticed that many European countries tightened their chemical inspection requirements after the removal of quotas. In addition, there can be no assurance that additional trade restrictions will not be imposed on the export of our products in the future. Such actions could result in increases in the cost of our products generally and may adversely affect our operating results. On a longer-term basis, we believe that our customer mix and our ability to adjust the types of apparel we manufacture will mitigate our exposure to such trade restrictions in the future.
 
We are also required to comply with Chinese laws and regulations that apply to some of the products we produce for shipment to the countries to which we export. In order to address these Chinese compliance issues, we have established an advanced fabric testing center to ensure that our products meet certain quality and safety standards in the U.S. and EU. In addition, we work closely with our customers so that they understand our testing and inspection process.
 
Seasonality
 
Our business is affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels of wholesale sales in our third and fourth quarters and higher retail sales in our first and fourth quarters. These trends result primarily from the timing of seasonal demand and shipments in our wholesale business and holiday periods in China where our retail business operates.

Retail Segment
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,381 retail stores in China selling our own brand clothing. We believe our advantages in the retail segments include our ability to promptly respond to market trends, our quick turn-around in design and production, and appropriate pricing. In 2018, we achieved total net sales of approximately US$229.9 million for our retail business. We operate most of our retail stores in so-called Tier-2 or Tier-3 cities in China, such as Zhengzhou in Henan province, Taizhou in Jiangsu province, etc. We also have penetrated into Tier-1 cities, such as Beijing and Shanghai.
Suppliers
 
We purchase the majority of our raw materials (including fabric, fasteners, thread, buttons, labels and related materials) directly from numerous local fabric and accessories suppliers. For our retail business, collectively, purchases from our five largest suppliers represented approximately 79.3% of total purchases in 2018. There were five suppliers which provided more than 10% of our total raw materials purchases in 2018. We have not experienced difficulty in obtaining raw materials that are essential to our business.
 
We also purchase finished goods from contract manufacturers. For our retail business, collectively, our five largest contract manufacturers represented approximately 16.3% of total finished goods purchases in 2018. There was no one contract manufacturer which provided more than 10% of our total finished goods purchases in 2018. We have not experienced difficulty in obtaining finished products from our contract manufacturers. 
 
For our retail business, we generally agree to pay our suppliers within 30-180 days after the receipt of goods. We typically place orders for materials from suppliers when the style has been confirmed by our chief designer. On average, the supplies we hold in stock will generally be consumed in production in approximately 20 days.
 
Customers
 
We currently have four retail brands. “Sea to Sky” focuses on females between the ages of 18 to 25. “La Go Go” seeks to appeal to fashionable urban females between the ages of 23 to 28. “Velwin” targets females between the ages of 28 to 33 while “idole” targets females between the ages of 28 to 35. Our products are priced at a middle-to-high level in order to appeal to our targeted customers.
Design and Production
 
We have our own design, production and quality control departments. Our retail brands release new designs twice a year, during October for the spring/summer season and May for the autumn/winter season. Our design team attends many fashion shows each year to track the fashion trends in Europe, Japan and Asia. Our design team produces approximately 5,000 designs each year. Each of our retail brands hosts its own order-placing fair twice each year to determine the new products to be released for the spring/summer and autumn/winter season based on the orders placed by all the regional sales managers at such order-placing fair; our chief designer then decides the designs to be manufactured. The production department will then produce samples for the designer’s approval.  Our quality control department checks the quality of the final products by follow-up inspection. The final products will be shipped to the logistics and distribution centers for sale.
Sales and Marketing
 
Products of our retail brands are sold in flagship stores, stores-within-a-store and e-commerce platform.  The sales department is responsible for developing new sales channels. According to our new store opening plan, the ratio of flagship stores and stores-within-a-store are carefully balanced.  The store-within-a-store enters into contracts with department stores. The flagship stores are carefully chosen at prominent locations and have lease agreements with each property owner.  Under our return and exchange policy, products may be returned or exchanged for any reason within 15 days. During 2018, the return and exchange rate was very low and was not a material factor in our operations.

Store Operation
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,381 stores, including 79 flagship stores, with each store generating average revenue of approximately $13,800 per month. The majority of our retail stores are situated as stores-within-a-store in large, mid-tier department stores located in over 20 provinces in China.
Trademarks
 
We regard our trademarks as an important part of our business due to the name recognition of our customers. We obtained trademark registration at the China Trademark Office for the mark “La Go Go” in class 25 and class 18 in 2010. As of December 31, 2018, we were not aware of any valid claim or challenges to our right to use our registered trademark or any counterfeit or other infringement to our registered trademark.
Information Technology
 
We recognize the importance of high-quality information management systems in the retail operation.  As a result, we use Management Systems to monitor and manage the merchandise planning, inventory and sales information.
Research and Development
 
We have invested in the research and development of high-tech fabrics.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had over 6,500 employees. None of our employees belong to a labor union. We have never experienced a labor strike or work stoppage. We are in full compliance with the Chinese labor laws and regulations and are committed to providing safe and comfortable working conditions and accommodations for our employees.
Labor Costs
 
The manufacture of garments is a labor-intensive business. Although much of our production process is automated and mechanized, we rely on skilled labor to make our products.  During the year ended December 31, 2018, our labor cost increased due to the shortage of skilled workers and rising labor cost in China.
Working Conditions and Employee Benefits
 
We consider our social responsibilities to our workers to be an important objective, and we are committed to providing a safe, clean, comfortable working environment and accommodations. Our employees are also entitled to paid holidays and vacations. In addition, we frequently monitor our third-party manufacturers’ working conditions to ensure their compliance with related labor laws and regulations. We are in full compliance with our obligations to contribute a certain percentage of our employees’ salaries to social insurance funds, as mandated by the PRC government. We expect the amount of contribution to the government’s social insurance funds to increase in the future as we expand our workforce and operations.  
Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
Based on the present nature of our operations, we do not believe that environmental laws and the cost of compliance with those laws have or will have a material impact on our operations.
Description of Property
 
In 2018, we operated four facilities on certain land in the Nanjing Jiangning Economic and Technological Development Zone and Huifeng Road, which are located in Nanjing and Chuzhou, China. For further details concerning our property, see Item 2 of this report regarding Properties.
