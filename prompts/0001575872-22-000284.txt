General Business Overview
 
We are a distributor of various consumer products, such as skin care products, dietary supplements, electronic noise suppressing devices and water purifying machines. Based on the sales and trends of various consumer products, we from time to time select or drop the products that we distribute and sell. 
 
We market and distribute skin care products manufactured by A.C. (USA), Inc. (“A.C.”), which is headquartered in the City of Industry, California and has offices in Taiwan. We market and distribute A.C. skin care products to resellers who will recognize the needs of their targeted customers in various regions in Asia, such as People’s Republic of China (“PRC”), Singapore and Malaysia. We acquire the products from A.C.’s Taiwan warehouses. Our strategy is to target spas, department stores and specialty stores that sell similar skin products. As of the date of this annual report, we have sold the A.C. Products to local distributors and specialty stores.

The skin care products that we will distribute are designed to address various skin care needs. Those products include moisturizers, serums, cleansers, toners, body care, exfoliators, acne and oil correctors, facial masks, cleansing devices and sun care products. A number of those products are developed for use on particular areas of the body, such as the face or hands or around the eyes.
 
We believe the Company, together with its subsidiaries, distributes highly innovative personal care products and ecologically friendly cleaning products in Taiwan and plans to expand its distribution to China, Malaysia, and Thailand. Emperor Star’s product line includes anti-aging products that address the key signs of aging to reinvigorate and provide youthful energy and nutrition supplements. The Company stopped the line of ecologically friendly cleaning products in 2018. 
 
In April 2018, we, through Emperor Star, started purchasing a type of water purifying machines from Cosminergy Hitech Development Co., Ltd. (“Cosminergy”) and reselling such water purifying machines in certain Asian countries and regions. However, we decided not to continue the sales of Cosminergy’s water purifying machines in 2019. 

In November 2019, we started the marketing, promotion, sales and distribution of certain electrical noise suppressing device (the “Calibrator”) globally provided by Ultra Velocity Technology Ltd. (“Ultra Velocity”), a corporation formed under the laws of Taiwan, based on an exclusive patent licensing and distribution agreement (the “Ultra Velocity Agreement”) between Ultra Velocity and us. However, due to the outbreak of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) in mainland China, Ultra Velocity and we terminated the Ultra Velocity Agreement in March 2020 and intended to redefine the cooperation model between the respective parties. 
 
In addition, we provided inventory, membership and business management software that designed by CKS Information Co., Ltd. to our customers in the fiscal year of 2019. 
 
Acquisition of Control Interest in A-Best
 
On August 7, 2019, the Company, A-Best Wire Harness & Components Co., Ltd (“A-Best”), a company formed under the laws of Taiwan, and Ing-Ming Lai, a Taiwanese individual and the majority shareholder of A-Best, entered into a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions therein, the Company shall purchase thirty-one percent (31%) of the issued and outstanding equity interest in A-Best and as consideration, issue ten million (10,000,000) shares (the “Stock Consideration”) of its common stock (the “Common Stock”) to Ing-Ming Lai and pay Ing-Ming Lai fifty-five million (55,000,000) new Taiwanese dollars (“NTD”) (the “Cash Consideration”). The Company currently owns twenty percent (20%) of equity securities in A-Best, and will subsequently own a total of fifty-one percent (51%) of issued and outstanding A-Best shares when Ing-Ming Lai completes transferring his 31% of A-Best’s equity to the Company in accordance with the Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company shall use its best efforts to obtain its shareholder approval to increase the number of authorized common stock to allow legal issuance of the Stock Consideration to Ing-Ming Lai no later than December 31, 2019. In addition, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company shall pay the Cash Consideration to Ing-Ming Lai if and only if the Company successfully completes an Initial Public Offering (the “IPO”) of its common stock, with gross proceeds of no less than $5,000,000 USD. The Purchase Agreement contains the customary confidentiality provision, representations and warranties. The Purchase Agreement also provides for mutual indemnification clauses. A-Best is a Taipei-based company that designs magnetic resonance speakers.
 
In connection with the Purchase Agreement, on August 7, 2019, the Company, A-Best, and Ing Ming Lai entered into an Exclusive Sales Agreement (the “Exclusive Sales Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company is granted the right as the exclusive distributor to sell all of A-Best’s products, including its Micro-ceramic magnetic resonance speakers in the world, and the right to use A-Best’s trademarks and copyrights in connection with the sale of such products. The term of the Exclusive Sales Agreement shall be three (3) years from execution and be automatically renewed for another term of three (3) years unless one party gives the other parties a written notice of termination three (3) months before the end of the term. 
 
In connection with the Purchase Agreement, on August 7, 2019, the Company and Ing-Ming Lai entered into a management agreement (the “Management Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company has agreed to maintain A-Best’s existing operations and Ing-Ming Lai’s positions as A-Best’s President and Chief Executive Officer of A-Best, until A-Best’s board of directors decides to terminate the terms of his positions. Pursuant to the Management Agreement, the Company shall also designate one individual to A-Best’s board of directors, and A-Best’s board of directors shall continue to maintain two director seats, where at least one of the two directors is designated by the Company until the Parties either reach a shareholder agreement or A-Best receives additional capital investment in equity or debt. The Management Agreement became effective upon execution.

On December 30, 2019, the Company, A-Best, and Ing-Ming Lai, a Taiwanese individual and the majority shareholder of A-Best, entered into a termination agreement (the “Termination Agreement”) to, among other things, terminate the Purchase Agreement, Exclusive Sales Agreement, and Management Agreement, all of which were dated August 7, 2019. The Company, A-Best and Mr. Ing-Ming Lai decided to terminate the three agreements primarily because they need more time to agree to a mutually beneficial way to cooperate with each other with respect to the sales of the Micro-ceramic magnetic resonance speakers that A-Best has developed. Pursuant to the Termination Agreement which became effective on December 31, 2019, none of the three parties owes any compensation, payments, damages, penalties or liabilities to one another or has any obligations to perform under any of the Purchase Agreement, Exclusive Sales Agreement, and Management Agreement, except that each party agrees to keep confidential the business plans, research and development information obtained from performing the three agreements. For more information about the Termination Agreement, please refer to the current report on Form 8-K which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 31, 2019. 
 
On March 2, 2020, the Company, A-Best, and Ing-Ming Lai, a Taiwanese individual and the majority shareholder of A-Best (collectively, the “Parties”) entered into a strategic alliance agreement (the “Strategic Alliance Agreement”), pursuant to which the Parties redefined their cooperation with respect to the sales and distribution of A-Best’s micro-ceramic speakers. In accordance with the Strategic Alliance Agreement, A-Best, Mr. Ing-Ming Lai and the Company terminated the Investment Cooperation Agreement dated January 12, 2019 entered by and among the Parties and as a result the Company agreed to return 20% of the equity interest in A-Best to Mr. Ing-Ming Lai, which was valued at approximately $35,142 by the Parties.
 
Furthermore, subject to the terms and conditions of the Strategic Alliance Agreement, A-Best has granted the Company the exclusive sale and distribution right of A-Best’s micro-ceramic speakers in the world for one (1) year (the “Term”), which may be renewed with mutual consent of the Parties two months prior to the expiration of the Term, while A-Best retains its own right to sell and distribute the micro-ceramic speakers on its own. In consideration for the exclusive distribution right of A-Best’s speakers under the Strategic Alliance Agreement, the Company agreed to have A-Best keep the Company’s 10,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, issued under the Investment Cooperation Agreement and the Company may keep the revenue and profits generated from the sale of A-Best speakers until the total revenue from such speakers reaches $15 million U.S. dollars. This Strategic Alliance Agreement contains A-Best’s and Mr. Ing-Ming Lai’s joint representation regarding their intellectual property rights to A-Best ceramic speakers. For more information about this transaction and the Strategic Alliance Agreement, please refer to the current report on Form 8-K which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 5, 2020.
 
On March 2, 2020, the  Company returned 20% equity interest in A-Best to Mr. Ing-Ming Lai pursuant to the Strategic Alliance Agreement.
 
On November 25, 2019, the Company and Ultra Velocity Technology Ltd. (“Ultra Velocity”), a corporation formed under the laws of Taiwan, entered into an exclusive patent licensing and distribution agreement (the “Exclusive Patent Licensing and Distribution Agreement”), pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions therein, Ultra Velocity granted the Company an exclusive license to the patent (Patent M566970 registered in Taiwan) to its electrical noise suppressing device (the “Calibrator”) and the exclusive right to market, promote, distribute and sell the Calibrator globally. In accordance with the Agreement and in consideration for the exclusive patent license and distribution right to the Calibrator, the Company agreed to issue Ultra Velocity three million (3,000,000) restricted shares of its common stock after the execution of this Agreement and upon the shareholder approval to increase the number of authorized capital of the Company (the “Shareholder Approval”). The term of this Agreement was ten years, commencing from the dare thereof. However, on March 30, 2020, the Company and Ultra Velocity terminated the Exclusive Patent Licensing and Distribution Agreement via a mutually agreed written notice, effective March 24, 2020.

Distribution Agreements and Supply Agreement
 
On May 1, 2015, we entered into a written Distribution Agreement with A.C. (USA), Inc. (“A.C.”) pursuant to which we have an exclusive right to market and distribute in Taiwan certain skin care products manufactured by A.C. for a period of 5 years (the “Distribution Agreement”). Pursuant to the provisions of the Distribution Agreement, we will market and promote the A.C. Products as defined therein in the Territory as amended to include PRC, Singapore and Malaysia in addition to Taiwan. Accordingly, we are the exclusive distributor for those A.C. Products in the above Territories.
 
On April 30, 2018, we, through our Emperor Star, entered into a distribution agreement (the “Cosminergy Distribution Agreement”) with Cosminergy Hitech Development Co., Ltd. (Cosminergy”) pursuant to which we started purchasing a type of water purifying machines from Cosminergy and reselling the water purifying machines in certain Asian areas and countries. The Cosminergy Distribution Agreement expired on April 30, 2019 and we did not renew it.
 
We, through one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, entered into a product supply agreement (“Fortune King Product Supply Agreement”) with Fortune King (HK) Trading Limited (“Fortune King”), a company formed under the laws of Hong Kong, to provide and sell any products that Fortune King orders from EOS and its subsidiaries. Pursuant to the Fortune King Product Supply Agreement, we agreed to provide products ordered by Fortune King within five business days from the order date and the products we sell should have the expiration date/shelf life at least one year from the supply date. The Fortune King Product Supply Agreement became effective on October 1, 2018 and was extended to September 30, 2021. We provide marketing information on the products we sell and training services to Fortune King. During the year ended December 31, 2018 and nine months ended September 30, 2019, the majority of EOS’ sales of Nine Layer Transformation Hair Cream, Deep Seawater Mineral Extract, Lifegenes, Youthgenes, and household water purifying machines were to Fortune King. As of June 30, 2019, Fortune King was a related party of us because the founder and officer of Fortune King was a shareholder of EOS. On or about June 30, 2019, the founder and officer of Fortune King transferred her equity interest in the Company and therefore Fortune King is no longer a related party to the Company.

We believe the Cosminergy water purifying machines will be popular in the areas where the water quality is relatively poor. We believe the Cosminergy water purifying machines can effectively kill and stop the reproduction of bacteria in the water.

Marketing and Distribution
 
We believe our market is retailers who recognize the needs of the targeted consumers. Our strategy is to target spas, department stores and specialty stores that sell similar skin care products. We hope that our product positioning will assist in the marketing and distribution of those skin care products. We anticipate that we will reach our targeted reseller market by the following types of resellers: 
 
Spas and Health Clubs – Most high quality day spas and health clubs (and many upscale spas at resort properties) use generic products. Our goal will be to develop affiliations with select spas in urban areas and vacation destinations to whom we will market and sell those skin care products.
 
Lifestyle Retailers – We anticipate that the skin care products will be lifestyle-based rather than the typical soaps and potions of natural product retailers. These retailers exist in almost every city and have developed loyal and sophisticated customer bases.
 
Additionally, we anticipate that we will market those skin care products to cosmetic specialty retailers and boutique department stores.
 
We believe that the targeted in users of those skin care products are between the ages of 20 and 65 and are predominantly female. We believe they are urban professionals with at least some college level education. The targeted users have active lifestyles and are concerned about social and environmental issues. Mind and body wellness are important to them. They belong to a health club; take yoga, pilates or taichi lessons. The maintenance of a youthful appearance are a part of their life. 
 
Cosminergy Water Purifying Machines
 
In 2018, we mainly distributed the Cosminergy water purifying machines in PRC (including Hong Kong), Taiwan and Singapore through retailers in those regions and countries. In April 2019, we ceased the distribution of Cosminergy water purifying machines. We intend to find another strategic supplier for other types of water purification equipment. 
Calibrators
 
We started the sales and distribution of automobile carbon reduction machines or Calibrators for Ultra Velocity in November 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated a gross revenue of approximately $350,000 in the Asian market. 
Patents and Trademarks

At the present we do not own any patents or trademarks. However, we had obtained the exclusive license to the patent (Patent M566970 registered in Taiwan) to the Calibrator from Ultra Velocity pursuant to the Exclusive Patent Licensing and Distribution Agreement, which was terminated on March 24, 2020. 
 
Need for any Government Approval
 
There is no approval required for the marketing and distribution of those A.C. Products in Taiwan; provided, however, pursuant to the Statute for the Control of Cosmetic Hygiene promulgated by the Ministry of Health and Welfare in Taiwan, we are required to file an application with the Ministry of Health and Welfare in Taiwan for reference purposes.

We have been informed by appropriate representatives of A.C. that the skin care products we plan to market and distribute pursuant to the Distribution Agreement are classified as cosmetics not containing any medical, poisonous or potent drugs under the Republic of China Statute for Control of Cosmetic Hygiene. Accordingly, those products are not necessarily subject to any inspection to obtain approval for their sales. The labeling of those packages clearly indicate in Chinese the name and address of the manufacturer, the name of the product, the ingredients, the usage and directions, the weight, the manufacturing date, the expiration date, the name and address of the importer. We were informed by those representatives that those skin care products are, currently, appropriate for marketing and distribution in Taiwan. In the year of 2018, the Customs of Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore approved the imports of the A.C. Products that we brought to the three regions and countries. We were in the process of preparing additional documents for the Customs of the PRC with respect to the imports of the A.C. Products. 
 
Environmental Laws
 
Our operations focused on sales and distribution and therefore are not subject to any environmental laws.
 
Employees and Employment Agreements of the Company, EITB and Emperor Star
 
The Company, EITB and Emperor Star have a total of eight employees. Our President, He Siang Yang, who, currently, devotes 20 or more hours a week to our business, is responsible for the primary operation of our business. There is no outstanding employment agreement.
12 Month Growth Strategy
 
Our goal is to maximize shareholder value. To achieve that goal, we intend to expand our operations and evaluate and cultivate new and alternative revenue generating opportunities. We are committed to marketing and distributing skin care products. While strategic and wisely executed marketing campaigns are key to expanding our operations; offering innovative skin care products should position us in the best possible way for long term success.
