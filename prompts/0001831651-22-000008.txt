Overview
Shoals is a leading provider of electrical balance of system or “EBOS” solutions for solar energy projects in the United States. EBOS encompasses all of the components that are necessary to carry the electric current produced by solar panels to an inverter and ultimately to the power grid. EBOS components are mission-critical products that have a high consequence of failure, including lost revenue, equipment damage, fire damage, and even serious injury or death. As a result, we believe customers prioritize reliability and safety over price when selecting EBOS solutions. We also recently began selling “EV Charging” solutions for public and fleet electric vehicle charging stations in the United States.
EBOS components that we produce include cable assemblies, inline fuses, combiners, disconnects, recombiners, wireless monitoring systems, junction boxes, transition enclosures, splice boxes, wire management solutions and IV curve benchmarking devices. EV Charging solutions that we produce include the following offerings which fulfill nearly all commercial EV charging needs: the EV BLA, raceways which protect the EV BLAs and other power cables, pedestal bases for Level 2 chargers and quick connect bases for Level 3 and high-power chargers, and the power center on a Shoals quick connect base. We derive the majority of our revenue from selling “system solutions” which are complete EBOS systems that include several of our products, many of which are customized for the customer’s project. We believe our system solutions are unique in our industry because they integrate design and engineering support, proprietary components and innovative installation methods into a single offering that would otherwise be challenging for a customer to obtain from a single provider or at all.
We sell our products principally to engineering, procurement and construction firms ("EPCs”) that build solar energy projects and install electric vehicle charging stations. However, given the mission critical nature of EBOS, the decision to use our products typically involves input from both the EPC and the owner of the solar energy project. The custom nature of our system solutions and the long development cycle for solar energy 
projects typically gives us 12 months or more of lead time to quote, engineer, produce and ship each order we receive, and we do not stock large amounts of finished goods.
We derived approximately 73% of our revenue from the sale of system solutions for year ended December 31, 2021. For the same period, we derived substantially all of our revenue from customers in the U.S. We had $299.0 million of backlog and awarded orders, backlog of $119.3 million represents signed purchase orders or contractual minimum purchase commitments with take-or-pay provisions and awarded orders of $179.7 million are orders we are in the process of documenting a contract but for which a contract has not yet been signed, as of December 31, 2021, representing a 94% and 10% increase relative to the same date last year and September 30, 2021, respectively.
Throughout fiscal year 2021, we focused on our growth strategy, including developments in converting customers to our combine-as-you-go system and developing products for the rapidly growing electric vehicle charging infrastructure market. Additionally, we are currently launching four new product families for the EV charging market. The first is the power center which combines equipment needed to protect the charging equipment and transform voltage levels from the electric utility to those needed on the respective site. The power center provides an efficient, cost effective and aesthetically focused option versus traditional methods. The second offering focuses on quick connect solutions for chargers made by any manufacturer and any power level to connect to the Shoals system. The quick connect bases dramatically reduce the time required on site for a deployment and reduce the amount of labor required in the field. The third offering uses our Big Lead Assembly (“BLA”) technology in the EV space to connect multiple chargers to a single power center. This solution eliminates the need for homeruns from each dispenser and is above ground rated which allows wire to be run above ground rather than in underground conduit. The fourth offering is a raceway system that protects the above ground EV BLAs in walk over and drive over applications. The raceway system coupled with the EV BLA deploys much more rapidly and cost effectively than traditional methods of deployment. We introduced these first four offerings in the fourth quarter of 2021 and received our first orders for deployments. Testing and certification of the offerings and overall solution are underway and progressing.
Solar EBOS
The major components of a ground-mounted solar energy project are solar panels, inverters, the mounting system and EBOS. EBOS encompasses all of the components that are necessary to carry the electric current produced by solar panels to an inverter and ultimately to the power grid. Major EBOS components include cable and wire, combiner boxes, wire management solutions and monitoring systems. We believe our current product offerings address approximately 36% of the total spending on EBOS based on a typical project constructed in 2020.
EBOS components represent only 6% of the total cost of a solar energy project based on a typical project constructed in 2020, but the cost of the labor to install them can be equal to, or even greater than, the cost of the components themselves. As a result of the high ratio of installation costs to product costs, many EPCs prefer EBOS products that can be installed faster using general labor over products that are time consuming to install and require licensed electricians to install them even when they are more expensive.
Demand for EBOS is driven primarily by installations of new ground-mounted solar energy projects. Historically, we have derived the majority of our revenue from the sale of EBOS products used in U.S. solar energy projects.
Our Proprietary EBOS System
Most solar energy projects use a wiring architecture known as “homerun.” Conventional homerun EBOS systems have two distinguishing characteristics: every string of solar panels in the project is connected 
to a combiner box with individual positive and negative “wire runs,” and connections between wires are made using a process called “crimping.” The combiner box functions as a central point to “combine” the individual wire runs into a single feeder cable and contains fuses to protect each circuit. Making each wire run from the strings to the combiner boxes is a laborious process. Each wire run must be measured, laid out and fished through conduits that are buried in trenches across the project site. Because each string is individually connected to a combiner box, the same distances are covered with multiple wire runs. Making the crimped connections between wires and interconnecting them in the combiner box is a complex, error prone process that requires special tools. Each wire must be cut and have a precise amount of insulation removed; the bare end must be inserted the correct depth into a terminal; and special tools must be used to deform metal sleeves and torque lock nuts to ensure an environmental seal. The entire installation must be performed by licensed electricians with special training and any mistake in the process can result in a catastrophic system failure.
We invented an alternative to homerun architecture which we refer to as “combine-as-you-go.” Rather than making individual wire runs from each string to combiner boxes, combine-as-you-go architecture connects multiple strings within each row using specialized wire harnesses with integrated fuses that we refer to as “interconnect harnesses.” The interconnect harnesses are then connected to a proprietary above ground feeder cable that we refer to as the BLA. The BLA is our core combine-as-you-go product. The direct connection between the interconnect harness and the BLA and the integration of fuses into the interconnect harness dramatically reduce the number of wire runs required compared to a conventional homerun system and eliminate the need for combiner boxes. We believe our combine-as-you-go architecture using interconnect harnesses and BLA has several advantages when compared to conventional homerun EBOS, including:
•Installing above ground. Wiring for conventional homerun systems is typically run through conduits that are buried in trenches. Trenching is costly and time consuming. Making repairs to buried wire can also be challenging and expensive, as well as run the risk of unintentionally damaging other buried wire that did not need to be repaired. Our BLA is hung from the mounting system used for the solar panels, enabling above ground installation. Above ground installation is less costly and far faster than burying wire in conduits. Future maintenance is also significantly easier and less costly because our BLA is easily accessible if repairs are required.
•Being installable by general labor rather than requiring electricians. Conventional homerun systems use crimps and other specialized procedures to connect wires and install combiner boxes that must be performed by licensed electricians. Because our interconnect harness and BLA use simple push connectors and don’t require combiner boxes, licensed electricians are not needed to install the system.
•Reducing the number of wire runs. We believe using our interconnect harness and BLA reduces the number of string and inverter wire runs required for a typical utility-scale solar energy project by up to 95% when compared to a conventional homerun system. Reducing the number of wire runs speeds installation, lowers material and shipping costs, reduces the number of potential failure points and is beneficial to the environment because less copper, aluminum and plastics are consumed.
•Eliminating combiner boxes. Conventional homerun systems require combiner boxes to interconnect the wire runs from each string into a feeder cable and house fuses that protect each circuit. Because our BLA is connected directly to strings and our interconnect harness has inline fuses, no combiner boxes are required for our system. Eliminating combiner boxes speeds installation, lowers material and shipping costs, reduces the number of potential failure points and is beneficial to the environment because less copper, aluminum and plastics are consumed.
•Requiring fewer connections. We believe using our interconnect harness and BLA reduces the number of connection points in a typical utility-scale solar energy project by more than 80% when 
compared to a conventional homerun system. Requiring fewer connections reduces the number of labor hours required to install the system as well as the number of potential failure points.
•Having greater reliability and lower maintenance costs. Connection points are often the source of failure in EBOS systems and must be inspected regularly. A solar energy project that uses our interconnect harness and BLA will have significantly fewer connections and, as a result, fewer failure points to inspect and maintain than the same project would using a conventional homerun system. We believe fewer potential failure points contributes to higher reliability and lower maintenance costs for solar energy projects that use our combine-as-you-go system when compared to a conventional homerun system.
•Enabling more energy generation. We believe the design of our interconnect harness and BLA reduces electrical resistance significantly when compared to a conventional homerun system. Lower resistance reduces energy loss to waste heat dissipation, which we believe results in greater energy generation from solar projects that use our combine-as-you-go system when compared to a conventional homerun system.
Together, we believe these advantages result in lower installation costs and lower material costs for our combine-as-you-go systems when compared to conventional homerun systems.
Products and Services
System Solutions
We refer to complete EBOS systems that use multiple components produced by us as “system solutions.” When we sell a system solution, we work with our customers to design, specify and customize their EBOS system to maximize reliability and energy production while minimizing cost. We also provide technical support during installation and the transition to operations and maintenance.
We design, manufacture and sell system solutions for the two types of wiring architectures used by the U.S. solar industry: homerun and combine-as-you-go.
Homerun EBOS: We have developed a proprietary EBOS solution for homerun architectures that we refer to as an “interconnect harness.” Rather than the traditional approach of running a separate wire from each string to a combiner box, our interconnect harness connects multiple strings together at each row using a single wire and simple push connector, rather than a wire crimp. Combining multiple strings together at each row reduces the number of wire runs that have to be made to combiner boxes as well as the number of connections that have to be made in each combiner box which reduces either the total number of combiner boxes or the size of combiner boxes required for the system. Using push connectors allows a large portion of the EBOS installation to be completed by laborers rather than requiring licensed electricians. Our homerun EBOS system solutions typically include our interconnect harness, combiners and jumpers. The majority of solar energy projects in operation today use conventional homerun architecture.
Combine-as-you-go EBOS: We invented “combine-as-you-go” architecture in 2014 and began offering combine-as-you-go products widely in 2017. Combine-as-you-go architecture connects all strings in a project to “trunk” wires that feed directly into disconnect boxes, which are connected to the inverter. With our interconnect harness, BLA combines the functionality of cable assemblies, combiner boxes and fusing all into one product that does not require a licensed electrician to install. A combine-as-you-go architecture using BLA has significant advantages over traditional homerun architectures, including using less material, requiring fewer man hours to install and having greater reliability and ease of maintenance. Our combine-as-you-go EBOS 
system solutions typically include our interconnect harness, BLA and disconnects and, in some projects, transition enclosures and splice boxes.
We derived approximately 73% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 from the sale of system solutions.
Components
We design, manufacture and sell a variety of individual EBOS and other components used by the solar industry, including:
Combiners: Enclosures that interconnect wire runs from multiple solar panel strings together so that their current can be fed into a single large cable. 
Plug-n-play branch connectors and inline fuses: Plug-n-play connectors for small commercial and rooftop solar applications in inline fuse, fuse-T, dual inline fuse, T-shaped, X-shaped, Y-shaped and U-shaped configurations.
AC disconnects: Specialized switches that allow the inverter to be isolated from the grid to enable repairs or in cases of emergency.
Recombiners: Enclosures that interconnect feeders from several combiner boxes into a smaller number of cables that run to the inverter.
Wireless monitoring: Specialized devices that monitor current, voltage, temperature, tracker rotation and other performance characteristics.
Junction boxes: Electromechanical interface that provides connection points to collect power from a solar panel.
Wire Management: A system to secure PV wiring for safety and aesthetic purposes.
We derived approximately 27% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, from the sale of components.
Sales and Marketing Strategy
Our sales and marketing strategy is to educate all participants involved in building, owning and maintaining a solar energy project on the merits of our products including their lower installation costs, greater reliability and lower maintenance costs compared with competing products. We educate customers and influencers through a combination of direct marketing, independent third-party studies, training seminars, and participating in industry conferences and events, with the objective of making our innovative EBOS solutions the preferred system globally.
Our Customers
We sell our products principally to EPCs that build solar energy projects. The decision to use our products typically involves input from both the EPC and the owner of the solar energy project given the mission critical nature and high consequence of failure of EBOS. EPCs typically construct multiple projects for several different owners.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, our three largest customers represented approximately 40% of our revenue and were the only customers constituting 10% or greater of total revenue.
Competition
Our EBOS system solutions and components are highly specialized products that are specific to the solar industry. The unique expertise required to design EBOS systems and components as well as customers’ reluctance to try unproven products has confined the number of firms that produce such EBOS products to a relatively small number. Our principal competitors include SolarBOS Inc. and Bentek Corporation. We compete on the basis of product performance and features, installation cost, reliability and duration of product warranty, sales and distribution capabilities, and training and customer support, as well as the ability to provide system solutions rather than individual components. We believe we are significantly larger as measured by revenue than our next largest competitor.
Seasonality
We have experienced seasonal and quarterly fluctuations in the past as a result of seasonal fluctuations in our customers’ business. Our end users’ ability to install solar energy systems is affected by weather, as for example during the winter months in the northeastern U.S. and Europe. Such installation delays can impact the timing of orders for our products.
Manufacturing
We have developed a proprietary manufacturing process for our EBOS products that we believe is unique in our industry. Our process uses specialized manufacturing equipment that we have developed and involves joining wire together using resistance welds and then sealing the joint with two separate layers of insulating material, which we refer to as “undermold/overmold.” Resistance welding produces significantly stronger bonds than competing techniques used by our competitors. Specifying complementary materials for the undermold and overmold significantly reduces the risk of moisture infiltrating the connection and enables us to provide superior UV protection, strain relief, impact resistance, and thermal stability over a wide range of environmental conditions. Together, we believe these techniques substantially reduce the risk that our cable develops a fault over its lifetime.
While highly specialized and flexible, our manufacturing equipment is not costly, and we do not require significant capital expenditures to maintain or increase our manufacturing capacity.
Our principal manufacturing facilities are located in Tennessee, Alabama, and California. Our Alabama facility is ISO 9001:2015 certified.
Research and Development
We continually devote resources to R&D, with the objective of developing innovative new products that reduce the cost and improve the reliability and safety of renewable energy. We believe that we have developed and commercialized most of the new EBOS products and installation methods adopted by the U.S. solar industry over the past five years, including plug-n-play wiring, interconnect harnesses and combine-as-you-go architecture for solar energy projects.
Our development strategy is to identify features that bring value to our customers and differentiate us from our competitors. We measure the effectiveness of our R&D using a number of metrics, beginning with a market requirements definition, which includes a program budget, financial payback, resource requirements, and time required to launch the new product, system, or service into the market. We employ a stringent 
engineering phase gate review process that ensures all R&D programs are meeting their stated objectives from inception to deployment.
We have a strong R&D team with significant experience in solar energy as well as expertise in electrical engineering, systems/control engineering and power electronics. As needed, we collaborate with academia, national laboratories, and consultants to further enhance our capabilities and confirm results independently.
Intellectual Property
The success of our business depends, in part, on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technologies, information, processes and know-how. We rely primarily on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the U.S., confidentiality agreements and procedures and other contractual arrangements to protect our technology. As of January 31, 2022, we had 25 U.S. trademark registrations, 11 pending U.S. trademark applications, 19 issued U.S. patents, 1 issued non-U.S. patents, 12 patent application pending for examination in the U.S. and 154 domain name registrations. Many of our patents relate to more efficient electrical wiring and power transmission from solar panels to power inverters at solar installations. Our U.S. issued patents are scheduled to expire between 2031 and 2037. As of January 31, 2022, our issued U.S. patents had an average remaining life of approximately 12.5 years.
The term of individual patents extend for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance, and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for applications filed in the U.S. are effective for 20 years from the earliest effective filing date of a non-provisional patent application. The duration of patents outside of the U.S. varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a country-to-country basis and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
We rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests with respect to proprietary know-how that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce. We believe that many elements of our manufacturing processes involve proprietary know-how, technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications, including technical processes, test equipment designs, algorithms and procedures.
Our policy is to require research and development employees to enter into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us to address intellectual property protection issues and to assign to us all of the inventions, designs and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us. However, we might not have entered into such agreements with all applicable personnel, and such agreements might not be self-executing. Moreover, such individuals could breach the terms of such agreements.
We also require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our technology or business plans.
Our Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 697 full-time and temporary employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any employment-related work stoppages, and we consider relations with our employees to be good.
We have a team-oriented culture and encourage candor from our employees, which we believe helps us to succeed and drive operational excellence. We also seek to, and have a history of, promoting from within our organization as well as hiring top talent from outside of our company to expand our capabilities.
We aim to hire individuals who share our passion, commitment and entrepreneurial spirit. We are also committed to diversity and inclusion because we believe that diversity leads to better outcomes for our business and enables us to better meet the needs of our customers. We recognize the importance of diversity in leadership roles within our company.
We encourage our employees to operate by a common set of values, which includes:
•making quality foremost in all we do, make, and sell.
•maintaining integrity in how we act, make decisions, and hold ourselves accountable.
•being responsive to change, to each other, and to our partners, customers and users.
•being respectful in how we treat all people.
•seeking innovation in the way we approach challenges and build products.
•being sustainable in our approach to producing our products and our operations.
We believe that operating with purpose, passion and creativity benefits our customers, stockholders, employees and suppliers as well as the communities where we operate and the environment.
