Item 1. Business 
 As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context indicates or otherwise requires, “Synthorx,” “our company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Synthorx, Inc., a Delaware corporation.
 Overview 
 We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on prolonging and improving the lives of people with cancer and autoimmune disorders. Our proprietary, first-of-its kind platform technology expands the genetic code by adding a new DNA base pair and is designed to create optimized biologics, which we refer to as Synthorins. A Synthorin is a protein optimized through incorporation of novel amino acids encoded by our new DNA base pair that enables site-specific modifications, which enhance the pharmacological properties of these therapeutics. Our lead product candidate, THOR-707, is a variant of IL-2 designed to kill tumor cells by increasing CD8+ T and natural killer, or NK, cells without causing vascular leak syndrome, or VLS, observed with approved recombinant IL-2 (aldesleukin). We plan to file an investigational new drug application, or IND, for THOR-707 in the second quarter of 2019 and to thereafter initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in multiple tumor types as a single agent and in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. Based on our preclinical studies, we believe our platform technology can generate a pipeline of additional therapeutics that are differentiated compared to drugs that have been engineered by other means. We have worldwide rights to our Expanded Genetic Alphabet platform technology and our Synthorins. 
 Our Expanded Genetic Alphabet platform technology adds a new DNA base pair, X-Y, to the two naturally occurring base pairs, A-T and G-C, thereby artificially expanding the genetic code. This X-Y base pair can be replicated, maintained, transcribed, and translated into a Synthorin using our proprietary strain of E. coli, a bacterium commonly used to manufacture therapeutic proteins. This bacterial strain incorporates a novel amino acid into specific sites we identify within a target gene where we have placed the X or Y nucleobases, thus coding for its placement in a Synthorin. These novel amino acids are designed to contain dedicated chemical hooks for site-specific bioconjugation with moieties, or parts of a molecule, such as a polyethylene glycol, or PEG. Site-specific bioconjugation refers to the forming of stable chemical links between two molecules, at least one of which is a biomolecule, at a specific amino acid site within the biomolecule. Employing this proprietary methodology for site-specific bioconjugation, we have designed our Synthorins to have optimized therapeutic properties, such as extended half-life or advantageously altered receptor binding, as compared to their native protein counterparts. Attachment of a PEG is an established approach to extend the half-life of drugs. There are currently 14 pegylated drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. 
 We are initially using our platform technology to develop cytokine Synthorins that target validated mechanisms of action with large market opportunities, in which existing therapies have significant drawbacks. Cytokines are proteins that modulate the function of the innate and adaptive immune system and therefore have potential broad applicability in cancer and autoimmune disorders. We have cytokine Synthorin programs, including IL-2, IL-10 and IL-15 for the treatment of cancer, and another IL-2 Synthorin program for the treatment of autoimmune disorders. 
 Aldesleukin has been on the market for over 25 years for the treatment of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, or RCC, and metastatic melanoma. Durable clinical responses and in some cases, cures, have been observed in these patients following treatment with aldesleukin due to increases in CD8+ T cells, which are a subset of T cells that identify and destroy tumor cells. However, widespread use of aldesleukin has been limited by toxicities, which include life-threatening and sometimes fatal VLS, as well as by its short half-life, requiring dosing three or more times per day over a period of five days in multiple cycles. 
 4


Various modifications of IL-2 have been explored by other companies to overcome these challenges, such as using a random, single, stably pegylated version with a much longer half-life that could be dosed once per week. Clinical results with this form were mixed, with comparable anti-tumor effect but also comparable toxicity to the earlier, non-pegylated IL-2. There are more recent versions of IL-2 in clinical development. One employs a prodrug approach with releasable PEG technology, which potentially allows for masking of toxicity and more specific effect at tumor sites. Another employs a mutein of IL-2, designed to not engage the α chain of the IL-2 receptor, linked to an antibody recognizing tumor specific antigens to deliver IL-2 specifically to tumor sites. Despite these advancements, we believe there remains an unmet need for a safer and more effective IL-2 therapeutic. 
 Using our Expanded Genetic Alphabet platform technology, we site-specifically pegylated IL-2 to invent THOR-707 for immuno-oncology, or IO. We have designed THOR-707 to kill tumor cells by increasing CD8+ T and NK cells without causing VLS that has been observed with aldesleukin. In our non-human primate, or NHP, preclinical studies THOR-707 at doses ten times higher than the doses observed to maximally expand CD8+ T cells in NHP did not result in signs of VLS, as measured by increases in eosinophil count and lung and liver weight. Published preclinical literature shows that combining IL-2 treatment with PD-1 inhibitors could have synergistic effects in enhancing CD8+ T cell responses. As a result, we believe that THOR-707 in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors may have greater anti-tumor effects than PD-1 inhibitors alone without the VLS observed with aldesleukin. 
 Our second IL-2 program is focused on autoimmune disorders based on the observation that low doses of IL-2 can dampen immune cell activation through selective proliferation of CD4+ regulatory T cells, or Tregs. Tregs are a subset of T cells that dampen immune responses and play a role in maintaining tolerance to self-antigens and preventing the emergence of autoimmune disorders. However, the short half-life of low dose IL-2 renders its administration impractical for the treatment of chronic autoimmune disorders. As such, we are developing an IL-2 autoimmune, or AI, Synthorin to overcome this limitation. 
 Our Programs 
 We are deploying our novel platform technology to create Synthorins to treat cancer and autoimmune disorders. The following chart summarizes our current programs.

Our Strategy
 Our goal is to utilize our proprietary Expanded Genetic Alphabet platform technology to develop optimized biologics. Our initial focus is the development of cytokine immunotherapies to treat cancer and autoimmune disorders. Key elements of our strategy include: 

▪ | Rapidly advancing our lead product candidate, IL-2 IO Synthorin (THOR-707), through clinical development. We plan to develop THOR-707, an IL-2 Synthorin tuned for preferential CD8+ T cell activation, to treat multiple tumor types. We plan to file an IND with the FDA stating a general solid tumor indication in the second quarter of 2019 and, thereafter, initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of THOR-707 in multiple solid tumor types as both a single agent and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. In this trial, we will evaluate safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, biomarker changes and anti-tumor activity. We believe the administration of THOR-707 combined with the existing standard of care could generate substantial clinical benefit leading to accelerated regulatory approval.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Advancing our second program, IL-2 AI Synthorin, into clinical development for autoimmune disorders. We plan to develop an IL-2 Synthorin tuned for preferential Treg activation to treat autoimmune disorders. We have several lead IL-2 AI Synthorin molecules that have demonstrated activity ex vivo in human immune cells and we are advancing these molecules into in vivo studies. We intend to nominate a lead IL-2 AI Synthorin product candidate in 2019 and start IND-enabling studies thereafter. We plan to file an IND in 2020 and begin clinical development thereafter. We plan to conduct a single ascending dose Phase 1a study in healthy volunteers to assess safety and tolerability as well as proof of mechanism, by monitoring induction of biomarkers in Tregs and their proliferation in the blood. We will also test for inhibition of delayed-type hypersensitivity, or DTH, in those volunteers.

▪ | Leveraging our proprietary Expanded Genetic Alphabet platform technology to pursue additional Synthorin cytokines in scientifically validated pathways. Our initial focus is on well-known and clinically validated cytokines. We believe this approach will allow us to efficiently and rapidly develop product candidates in multiple indications with reduced development risk, allowing us to more rapidly advance our product candidates to regulatory approval. We are currently developing IO Synthorins for IL-10, IL-15 and other undisclosed cytokines.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Further refining and enhancing the capabilities of our Expanded Genetic Alphabet platform technology. We believe our platform technology has broad applicability, and we will continue to invest in process enhancements and new applications to expand beyond our initial focus in cytokines.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Selectively entering into strategic partnerships while retaining key rights to our programs and platform technology in major pharmaceutical markets. We plan to explore potential partnerships on an asset-by-asset basis to maximize the value of each program while ensuring we maintain significant rights to our programs in major pharmaceutical markets. We also plan to opportunistically enter into strategic collaborations in connection with our platform technology to advance the development of our programs.

 Role of Cytokines in Disease 
 We are initially leveraging our platform technology and drug development capabilities to create a portfolio of cytokines designed to be optimized for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune disorders. Cytokines are proteins that modulate the function of the innate and adaptive immune system. These proteins regulate immune responses by acting as chemical messengers for the body’s immune cells through receptor site binding. Interleukins, such as IL-2, are a specific type of cytokine, produced primarily by white blood cells to signal and organize the immune response. Importantly, many cytokines are pleiotropic, meaning that a single cytokine can simultaneously promote multiple effects, such as producing both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on immune cells. The pleiotropic properties of cytokines complicate their use as therapeutics. Nevertheless, their broad potential makes them versatile therapeutic tools across cancer and autoimmune disorders. 
 6


In cancer, cytokines signal the immune system to increase the proliferation and enhance the survival of CD8+ T and NK cells, and then direct these effector cells to infiltrate the tumor and its microenvironment. Through this mechanism, cytokines have demonstrated anti-tumor activity. Two such therapies have received FDA approval for cancer treatment: aldesleukin for metastatic RCC and melanoma and interferon-α for advanced melanoma. However, both of these therapies have limited use due to severe toxicity. 
 In autoimmune disorders, cytokines can attenuate immune cell activation through selective activation of Tregs. Tregs are important mediators in maintaining immune homeostasis and dampening the immune response. These cells can play a role in maintaining tolerance to self-antigens and preventing autoimmune disorders. An imbalance of Tregs drives a number of autoimmune disorders such as chronic graft versus host disease, atopic dermatitis and Crohn’s disease. The use of cytokines in autoimmune disorders has been limited by a poor dosing profile due to their short half-lives, making their therapeutic application in these chronic disorders impractical. 
 Challenges of IL-2 Use for IO 
 Managing the complexities of cytokines, their pleiotropic effects and short half-lives has been the central challenge to their development and adoption as therapeutic agents. The pleiotropic effects of IL-2 are driven by two classes of receptors, the high affinity αßγ and the intermediate affinity ßγ which are expressed on different cell types. Driven by its immune-stimulatory effects on CD8+ T cells which express ßγ, aldesleukin has shown efficacy in treating metastatic RCC and melanoma. In the clinical trial results included in its FDA-approved label, aldesleukin induced objective responses in 15% and cures in 7% of patients with metastatic RCC. Similarly, aldesleukin demonstrated 16% objective response and 6% cures in patients with metastatic melanoma. In these trials, a cure was defined by 60 or more months without disease progression. These anti-tumor effects are observed despite being dampened by activation of immune suppressive Tregs which express the high affinity αßγ receptor at high levels. 
 However, aldesleukin has severe toxicity associated with its binding to α receptors that limits its use. Important mediators of this toxicity are Type 2 innate lymphoid cells, or ILC-2s, that reside in the endothelium of the vasculature and are activated by aldesleukin. ILC-2s release IL-5 which strongly attracts eosinophils, a type of disease-fighting white blood cell, into the blood vessels. Recruited eosinophils express IL-2 receptor α chain in response to IL-5 and become highly responsive to IL-2. This induces them to release mediators that interact with the vascular endothelium, leading to a loss of the capillary seal and VLS. VLS is a potentially fatal complication of IL-2 therapy and is characterized by pulmonary and peripheral edema, systemic hypotension, hypoperfusion-related shock liver and kidney and rhabdomoyolysis. Shock liver and kidney is an acute concomitant failure of both the liver and kidneys, usually related to an acute precipitating event, such as rapid blood loss or vascular permeability accompanied by extravasation of fluids and proteins into the peripheral tissues, which leads to hypotension and hypoperfusion of these critical organs. Rhabdomoyolysis is a condition in which damaged skeletal muscle breaks down rapidly due to hypoperfusion of the musculature.

The differential effects of high dose versus low dose IL-2 are depicted in the following illustration: 
 IL-2 Biology Dual Pharmacology Explains Low Therapeutic Index 
 

As a result of the toxicity of aldesleukin, patients receiving the drug must be carefully monitored, and, therefore it is typically administered in the intensive care unit. A typical course of treatment for aldesleukin is three doses per day over five days due to the relatively short 85 minute terminal half-life of aldesleukin in humans. 
 The FDA-approved clinical aldesleukin dose of 37 mcg/kg results in a transient spike in systemic exposure due to its short half-life and rapid clearance, reaching a peak concentration, or Cmax, close to the half maximal effective concentration, or EC50, for CD8+ T cells and NK cells. This level of activation inefficiently drives their expansion. However, aldesleukin potentially activates memory T cell populations to some extent. Thus, the anti-tumor effect of aldesleukin may be driven predominantly by proliferation of memory T cell populations but is limited in its ability to induce activation of naive CD8+ T cell populations, or induce NK responses, to drive a more robust anti-tumor effect. This may explain aldesleukin’s efficacy in a small percentage of cancer patients treated with the drug. Confounding aldesleukin’s anti-cancer activity, its Cmax dose exposure is above the EC99.8 for activation of Tregs, which highly express the IL-2 receptor α chain. Tregs attenuate CD8+ T cell tumor killing. Furthermore, at its approved dose, aldesleukin also activates vascular ILC-2s that trigger eosinophil activation and consequently, the potentially fatal VLS. Even at lower dosing levels of 6 mcg/kg, patients exhibit a dramatic increase in eosinophil counts. Similar toxicology findings were reported with aldesleukin in NHP in which multiple acute manifestations of VLS were observed at levels greater than 25 mcg/kg including the induction of eosinophilia. The lethal dose of aldesleukin in NHP is 428 mcg/kg.

In order to overcome these limitations, a variety of modifications to high-dose IL-2 regimens have been tested by others, including alterations of dose, schedule and route of administration, as well as chemical alterations of the IL-2 molecular structure. Other modifications, including the addition of toxicity modulators, such as drugs with anti-inflammatory properties or anti-angiogenic agents, have also been tested. 
 One of the original approaches in improving IL-2 involved pegylation to increase IL-2’s half-life and ease of use. In the 1980s, Cetus Corporation developed a form of IL-2 that was covalently and irreversibly pegylated through random conjugation of one PEG per molecule at a lysine residue. While this molecule increased the half-life of IL-2 to 15.7 hours versus 85 minutes for aldesleukin, a dose escalation study with this drug using one intravenous, or IV, dose per week in 66 solid tumor patients, including 13 metastatic melanoma patients and 16 RCC patients, demonstrated a similar toxicity profile relative to aldesleukin at comparable dose levels. Two metastatic RCC patients and one prostate cancer patient achieved partial remissions, and another RCC patient showed a minor response. 
 More recently, Nektar Therapeutics, Inc., or Nektar, initiated development of NKTR-214, a modified IL-2 that functions as a prodrug via reversible pegylation at an average of six random lysine residues. PEG release post-dosing leads to the generation of a diverse population of IL-2 species, with some of them being inactive (consistent with previous findings by Cetus), and the terminal product, free IL-2. At the dose level of NKTR-214 (6 mcg/kg) tested in clinical development in combination with nivolumab, an approved immune checkpoint inhibitor, the Cmax values of the monopegylated, dipegylated and free IL-2 species are expected to be at or below EC50 for CD8+ T and NK cells. NKTR-214 alone and in combination with nivolumab induces the proliferation of peripheral and intratumoral CD8+ T cells in some patients. 
 The need to balance and control multiple biological effects is representative of cytokine drug development challenges and reflects a large unmet need for safer, and potentially more efficacious cytokine therapeutics. We are using our Expanded Genetic Alphabet platform technology to purposefully design pegylated Synthorins to overcome these established cytokine development limitations. 
 Our Solution—Expanded Genetic Alphabet Platform Technology 
 Our first-of-its kind Expanded Genetic Alphabet platform technology is based on the addition of our proprietary and novel orthogonal DNA base pair, dTpT3 and dNaM, abbreviated X-Y, to the two natural base pairs, A-T and G-C, to artificially expand the genetic code. We use X-Y to site-specifically incorporate novel amino acids to create Synthorins. These Synthorins have exhibited unique therapeutic properties in preclinical studies, which we believe cannot be achieved without the site-specific incorporation of novel amino acids enabled by our platform technology. 
 We believe there is broad applicability for our platform technology. To date, we have used our Expanded Genetic Alphabet platform technology to achieve site-specific pegylation of IL-2 and other cytokines. Unlike traditional PEG technologies, which are limited to random conjugation at lysine and cysteine residues or conjugation at the protein’s amino terminus, we believe site-specific, covalent pegylation allows us to specifically design cytokines with optimal pharmacological properties. Our novel X-Y DNA bases enable us to design new codons, which allow for site-specific incorporation of novel amino acids into new, unique proteins. 
 We use our proprietary engineered semi-synthetic bacterial strain, which is based on a well-established E. coli protein manufacturing strain, to express an artificial base transporter that allows for controllable maintenance of X-Y genetic information. Supplementing cultures of this strain with X-Y nucleotides leads to their intracellular accumulation to support replication of the DNA encoding genes containing X-Y. Induction of transcription stimulates the cell to express the Synthorin mRNA harboring codons comprising X or Y, and the orthogonal transfer RNAs comprising X or Y anticodons, or tRNAs, that decode them. Engineered tRNA synthetase enzymes recognize and specifically charge the Synthorx tRNAs with corresponding novel amino acids added to the medium. The novel amino acids contain dedicated chemical hooks for site-specific bioconjugation with moieties such as PEG. The cell’s natural translation machinery uses these components to decode X-Y codons, site-specifically introducing novel amino acids into the desired Synthorin.

The diagram below captures key steps in the production of our cytokines containing genetically-encoded novel amino acids. Our bacterial strain integrates a transporter that makes the X-Y nucleobases available for efficient new codon insertion into DNA and RNA during replication and transcription, and an orthogonal tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair to enable incorporation of a novel amino acid into the cytokine amino acid chain during translation. The cytokine is then purified and bioconjugated with PEG via bio-orthogonal chemistry. 
 Optimization of the Expanded Genetic Alphabet and semi-synthetic E. coli strain has been ongoing since our inception. The position of the new base within a codon was examined for yield and fidelity to determine optimal codons for expression. Various media conditions were tested for growth of the E. coli strain starting with a small scale (0.3 mL) through shake flasks (0.025 to 1 L) and then for fermentation (1-5-30-300 L).

Our Programs 
 Our IL-2 IO Synthorin (THOR-707) 
 Our first Synthorin is THOR-707, a variant of recombinant human IL-2 that is attached to a PEG, or pegylated, at one specific site. This site-specific pegylation is designed to block engagement of the high affinity IL-2 receptor α chain, extend half-life by slowing THOR-707’s clearance from the body, increase tumor distribution and retention and improve solubility and monodispersity. We believe that THOR-707 has broad potential applicability in the treatment of multiple tumor types. Aldesleukin is approved for the treatment of metastatic RCC and melanoma and pegylated IL-2 has shown promising results in clinical trials in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. We plan to file an IND with the FDA stating a general solid tumor indication in the second quarter of 2019 and, thereafter, initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of THOR-707 in multiple solid tumor types as both a single agent and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. We plan to specify particular indications for THOR-707 after our initial clinical trials. In our studies of THOR-707 we plan to target indications historically sensitive to IL-2 and PD-1 inhibitors, such as melanoma, RCC, non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, and urothelial cancer, or UC. 
 THOR-707 was designed to have the following key advantages: 
  
▪ | Improved Selectivity: Preclinical studies have shown that THOR-707 increased intratumoral CD8+ T cells and NK cells without increasing intratumoral Tregs, which we believe is the key prognostic factor for positive clinical outcomes for IO drugs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Increased Therapeutic Index for VLS: THOR-707 does not bind to the high affinity IL-2 α chain thought to be important for cell types responsible for inducing VLS. To date, in NHP preclinical studies we have not observed signs of VLS, as measured by increases in eosinophils and liver and lung weight, at a dose that is ten times higher than that which provides maximal CD8+ T cell expansion. Therapeutic index means the separation between the amount of a therapeutic agent required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and the amount of the same therapeutic agent that causes toxicity.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Ease of Use: We believe the extended half-life of THOR-707 will allow dosing no more frequently than once every two weeks. By comparison, aldesleukin is required to be dosed three or more times per day over a period of five days in multiple cycles, generally in an intensive care unit.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Reduced Risk for Anti-Drug Antibodies: Anti-drug antibody production could limit the efficacy of a drug. We believe our pegylation strategy will limit the production of anti-drug antibodies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 THOR-707 was discovered by creating a library of IL-2 polypeptides with the novel amino acid installed at different single sites known by crystallographic models and mutational analysis to engage the α chain of the IL-2 receptor. As shown in the diagram below, THOR-707 blocks engagement of the IL-2 receptor α chain. The stable covalent attachment of the PEG provides epitope masking for reduced immunogenic potential.

IL-2 IO Synthorin (THOR-707) Market Opportunity 
 We are initially developing THOR-707 in tumor types well-documented to be responsive to IL-2 and PD-1 IO agents, including but not limited to melanoma, RCC, NSCLC and UC. Since most patients with these tumor types will eventually progress when treated with standard of care, there is a need for new combination therapies to improve response and durability. We believe, if successfully developed and approved, THOR-707 in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors and/or current or potential future standard of care agents represents a promising therapeutic option for patients with these serious life-threatening diseases. Based on published literature, worldwide sales of immune checkpoint inhibitors exceeded $10 billion in 2017 and are projected to exceed $20 billion by 2020. We intend to develop THOR-707 to be used in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, as well as with other standard of care therapeutics across different lines of therapy. As a result, we believe that the market opportunity for THOR-707 is comparable to that of immune checkpoint inhibitors. 
THOR-707 Preclinical Results 
 We have conducted numerous preclinical studies to assess the pharmacological activity of THOR-707 across a variety of binding, cell-based and in vivo models. As shown in the figure below, our studies have provided evidence that THOR-707 lacks α chain binding while maintaining similar ß chain binding relative to native IL-2. Thus, THOR-707 has similar affinity for the IL-2 receptor signaling ßγ complex expressed on NK and CD8+ T cells with no measurable affinity for the IL-2 receptor α chain expressed on Tregs, ILC-2s and eosinophils because site-specific pegylation blocks IL-2 receptor α chain engagement. 
 12


Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Binding Study: THOR-707 Did Not Engage the IL-2 Receptor α Chain, But Showed Similar ß Chain Engagement 
 

To obtain additional evidence that THOR-707 has reduced bias for activation of Tregs, we conducted immune cell stimulation studies using freshly isolated, primary human leukocytes. Similar to our binding data, these cell-based studies showed that THOR-707 was a potent IL-2 ßγ receptor agonist that did not engage the IL-2 receptor α chain, as seen in the figures below. In comparison, aldesleukin was 670-fold more potent in activating the Tregs’ αßγ receptor complex compared to CD8+ T cells.

THOR-707 Preclinical Studies 
 We have tested THOR-707 in mice and cynomolgus monkeys for safety and expansion of CD8+ T cells in the periphery and in tumor. Human IL-2 pharmacology was found to be comparable between human and cynomolgus monkey for both Treg and CD8+ T cells. However, for mouse, human IL-2 potency was similar for Treg cells but showed a steep drop in potency for mouse CD8+ T cells. Thus, human IL-2 was much less potent in mouse cells not expressing the α chain of the IL-2 receptor, or IL-2R. As a result, much higher doses were required in mouse compared to monkey. Potency data are summarized in the table below: 

 | Binding KD (SPR) nM | | IL-2R EC50 (pSTAT5) pg/mL | 
-----------+---------------------+------+---------------------------+------
Species | IL-2Rα | | IL-2Rß | | | CD4+ Treg Cell | | CD8+ T Cell
Human | | 1.71 | | | 360 | | | 6.5 | | 4,884
Mouse | | 23.5 | | N.D.* | | | 12.7 | | 366,276 | 
Cynomolgus | | 2.9 | | | 270 | | | 9.15 | | 2,372

 

* Not determined. 
 SPR binding studies suggested that human IL-2 binds similarly to the human and cynomolgus IL-2 receptor α and ß chains; human α KD: 1.71 nM; mouse α KD: 23.5; cynomolgus monkey α KD: 2.9 nM; human ß KD: 360 nM; mouse ß KD: N.D.; cynomolgus monkey ß KD: 270 nM.
 THOR-707 Preclinical Studies in Non-Human Primates (NHPs) 
 NHPs are a well established species for profiling IL-2 pharmacology and toxicology. Therefore, we performed single and repeat dosing studies in cynomolgus monkeys to assess THOR-707’s pharmacology and safety. Pharmacokinetic analysis of THOR-707 showed that the molecule had an improved half-life of 11 hours versus aldesleukin’s 85 minutes, which resulted in an area under the curve, or AUC, of 76,100 ng*h/mL. 
 Upon single administration, THOR-707 primarily induced proliferation of lymphocytes in the white blood cell population with no expansion seen in the eosinophil population as seen in the figure to the left below. This is in strong contrast to aldesleukin, which has been observed to induce both the proliferation of lymphocytes and eosinophils. We believe this observation is critical for two reasons: (1) aldesleukin in humans potently biases white blood cell expansion to eosinophils (see figure to the right below), a key pathogenic component of VLS; and (2) upon single dose administration of 100 and 300 mcg/kg of THOR-707 in NHP, there were no clinical or pathological toxicity observations. As a reference, the strong eosinophilia shown in the figure to the right below corresponds to dosing of aldesleukin at 50 mcg/kg/day IV, slightly above the approved dose of 37 mcg/kg. We believe these data strongly suggest that THOR-707 is an engineered form of IL-2 that drives expansion of tumor killing lymphocytic populations without inducing eosinophil propagation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------


Once a week repeat intravenous, or IV, dosing in NHP also showed that THOR-707 had no significant adverse effects at either the 100 or 300 mcg/kg doses. As was the case for the single dose study, the pharmacodynamic response, demonstrated by lymphocyte proliferation, at 300 mcg/kg was comparable to 100 mcg/kg. At 1000 mcg/kg, there were no signs of VLS as measured by increases in eosinophils and lung and liver weight. THOR-707 had a therapeutic index of greater than or equal to ten in NHP for VLS. Additionally, phenotyping of the lymphocyte population revealed that THOR-707 induces the proliferation of CD8+ T cells, which we believe is a key prognostic factor for positive clinical outcomes for IO drugs. We therefore believe that THOR-707’s therapeutic index will allow us to dose at levels that drive maximal CD8+ T cell expansion without causing VLS. As seen below in the figure on the left, this effect is comparable at 100, 300 and 1000 mcg/kg. When the level of Ki-67 expression was examined in the CD8+ T cell population, it correlated with maximal proliferation, which appeared to be ≥60% as shown in the figure on the right. In this study, THOR-707 induces transient dose-dependent peripheral proliferation of Tregs in NHP after single and repeat IV administration. If expansion of Tregs in the periphery is important to dampen the autoimmune effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors, THOR-707 would be expected to have this property that favors tolerability when used in combination.

As observed in multiple clinical studies evaluating immune checkpoint inhibitors, the absolute CD8+ T cell counts in the peripheral blood and in the tumor microenvironment, or TME, strongly correlate to clinical responses in cancer patients. Therefore, we believe that inducing the proliferation of CD8+ T cells in NHP blood, without inducing notable toxicities at concentrations that maximize CD8+ T cell expansion represents the critical attribute that is required to improve the anti-tumor effect observed with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Based on the results of our NHP studies, we believe that IL-2 receptor α chain binding is not required to induce expansion of CD8+ T cells in humans. 
 THOR-707 Preclinical Studies in Mice 
 In addition to NHP, we examined the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of THOR-707 relative to aldesleukin by performing single IV bolus dosing of these molecules in naïve mice at 300 mcg/kg. Bioconjugation to PEG extended the half-life (from 0.5 hours to 13.3 hours) and increased the AUC of THOR-707 >100-fold (from 432 ng*h/mL to 45,600 ng*h/mL) relative to aldesleukin. This expanded AUC has a pronounced effect on pharmacodynamic markers of IL-2 pharmacology. In our studies, we measured the biomarker pSTAT5 and induction of cell proliferation. Cell proliferation was evaluated using the marker Ki-67 and cell counts. pSTAT5 levels in CD8+ T cells and NK cells were correlated with the pharmacokinetics of both THOR-707 and aldesleukin. For example, data in CD8+ T cells are shown below. Persistent elevation of pSTAT5 was observed in both NK and CD8+ T cells up to 72 hours in mice dosed with THOR-707, while pSTAT5 induction completely returned to baseline after only two hours in mice dosed with aldesleukin. 
 pSTAT5 translated into proliferative responses 72–120 hours post-IV single dosing of THOR-707 (300 mcg/kg) in CD8+ T and NK cells. This was not observed with single IV dose aldesleukin (300 mcg/kg). CD8+ T and NK cell activation was confirmed by the upregulation of Ki-67. Phenotypic analysis of CD8+ T cells revealed substantial expansion of CD44+ memory T cells within this population, as shown below right.

We examined the effect of THOR-707 in eliciting CD8+ T and NK cell infiltration into a mouse syngeneic tumor model of melanoma, B16F10. A single IV dose of THOR-707 at 3,000 mcg/kg elicited infiltration of CD8+ T and NK cells into the tumor with no change in Treg cell numbers (below left). CD8+ T and NK cells infiltrated those tumors with delayed kinetics relative to the peak of proliferation for these cells in the peripheral compartment (below right). The observed increase versus time in CD8+ T cell/Treg ratios suggests that infiltration induced by a single dose of THOR-707 may persist well beyond one week.

THOR-707 has shown a relatively high distribution into the tumor, 8% of the plasma concentration at Cmax, potentially due to a substantially larger hydrodynamic radius because of pegylation relative to aldesleukin. Furthermore, THOR-707 has demonstrated a near doubling in tumor half-life relative to plasma, from 12.6 to 24.6 hours, as shown in the figure below.

THOR-707 has shown anti-tumor effects in a syngeneic mouse model as a single agent and in combination with a murine PD-1 antibody. CT-26 tumor cells were implanted into mice and once growth was established, THOR-707 was administered weekly alone or in combination with twice weekly mPD-1 antibody and tumor volume was measured over time. The anti-tumor effects observed in mice following administration of THOR-707 as a single agent and combined with a PD-1 antibody following dosing every week, or QW, are shown in the figures below.

THOR-707 Preclinical Safety Studies 
 We have tested THOR-707 in multiple initial preclinical safety studies, including mice and NHP. In NHP, there were no signs of clinical toxicity at any of the dose levels examined, including organ weight, clinical chemistry parameters and the release of plasma cytokines, including IL-5 at systemic exposures of THOR-707 over EC99. In mice, we conducted a single IV dose escalation study with doses ranging from 10 to 5,000 mcg/kg. As a control, aldesleukin was administered IV twice a day for three days at the same doses. The most significant difference between THOR-707 and aldesleukin study arms was a pronounced, dose-dependent elevation in peripheral IL-5 observed only with aldesleukin. The release of IL-5 following administration of aldesleukin is associated with a serious adverse event, VLS, which limits the use of aldesleukin. Aldesleukin activates other cell types that reside at the endothelium of the vasculature, including ILC-2s, which express the α chain of the IL-2 receptor at significant levels. These cells release IL-5, a powerful chemoattractant for eosinophils, in response to IL-2 activation. IL-5 induces expression of the IL-2 receptor α chain in eosinophils, making them highly responsive to IL-2. Upon recruitment to the vascular endothelium and activation by IL-2, they release toxic agents that damage the endothelial lining, leading to loss of capillary seal and VLS. IL-2 dosing in humans strongly induces eosinophilia, making this cell type a major component of the leukocyte fraction of IL-2 treated cancer patients, even at relatively low dose levels. 
 19


The substantial dose dependent elevation observed in plasma IL-5, expected from treatment with aldesleukin, was not observed with THOR-707. In comparison, the release of IFN-α was not fundamentally different between THOR-707 and aldesleukin, which is expected from their role in T cell activation. Taken together, these data suggest THOR-707’s “not alpha” pharmacological profile in vivo is favorable, including the lack of activation of IL-5 release, which drives eosinophilia and VLS. 
 Assessment of PEG Stability and Anti-Drug Antibody Formation Risk 
 Covalent pegylation shields the novel amino acid in THOR-707, preventing its presentation by major histocompatibility class II, or MHC-II, complexes, and decreasing its potential to become an immunogen. Our laboratory studies have provided evidence of the stability of THOR-707’s PEG conjugation chemistry at high temperature and in acidic conditions for up to 96 hours, which is equivalent to 8.7 drug half-lives based on NHP data. Nevertheless, we conducted studies to gauge the likelihood of immunogenicity should the PEG become dislodged. In silico analysis of the IL-2 sequence revealed that the region modified with the novel amino acid was lacking MHC-II P1 anchor amino acid residues essential for peptide engagement to this complex. This approach is an FDA recommended strategy to assess the potential immunogenicity of a target site of a biologic therapeutic whose sequence has been mutated. Testing of antigen presenting cells from human donors across 17 common MHC-II haplotypes provided further evidence that the region of THOR-707 pegylated, positions 55-75, is unlikely to be presented. Only one donor haplotype was observed to present the modified region of THOR-707. This contrasts with other regions of IL-2 not modified in THOR-707. Another IL-2 region, positions 78-97, which is not mutated in THOR-707, is mutated in multiple preclinical and clinical IL-2 molecules in development and was presented by 11 out of 17 human donors tested. 
 These findings suggest that the target region for modification exhibits low potential as an immunogen if the covalent, stable attachment of the PEG became dislodged. In addition, THOR-707 has shown improved solubility and hence reduced aggregation relative to aldesleukin. We believe reduced aggregation will eliminate or greatly reduce the potential to generate anti-drug antibodies, or ADAs, caused by cross-linking of B cell receptors. 
 Clinical Development Plan for THOR-707 
 The initial clinical development plan for THOR-707 has the following objectives: 
  
▪ | Observe a safe and pharmacodynamically active dose, detect an optimal biological dose, or OBD, identify the maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, and establish a recommended phase 2 dose, or RP2D, for THOR-707 as a single agent and in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor in solid tumors via dose escalation;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Observe the clinical activity of THOR-707 across select populations of interest as monotherapy, including but not limited to patients with unmet needs, and in combination with PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors as well as with other anti-tumor therapeutics (e.g. chemotherapy, targeted therapies, other cytokines) via dose expansion.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The rationale behind our clinical development plan for THOR-707 is based on the following: 
  
▪ | The approved IL-2 (aldesleukin) is limited by the morbid and sometimes fatal complication of VLS, a result of IL-2 interaction with alpha receptors on innate lymphoid cells situated in the vascular endothelium; THOR-707 has no alpha receptor interaction based-on studies in NHP, where no measurable VLS was seen at the doses explored;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Aldesleukin was approved as a single agent for RCC and melanoma, with response rates of just over 15 percent in clinical trial subjects; these responses are related to IL-2-induced proliferation of tumor-killing CD8+ T cells (effector and memory) via beta-gamma receptor interaction; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Aldesleukin at the approved dose is clinically active as a single agent and in combination with PD-1 inhibitors as both IL-2 and PD-1 inhibitors increase tumor-killing CD8+ T cells; due to severe toxicities, the approved dose of aldesleukin does not reach an effective concentration that maximally activates and expands tumor-killing CD8+ T cells.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The HAMMER Study, or HAMMER, will evaluate THOR-707 in three parts; as a single agent via dose escalation (Part 1), in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor via dose escalation (Part 2) and in combination with other anti-tumor therapeutics including anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 inhibitors via dose expansion (Part 3).
 HAMMER Part 1 will utilize a dose escalation design to establish a RP2D for THOR-707 as a single agent. Subjects with solid tumors and that have likely failed or are unable to tolerate available treatment options will be enrolled in this part of the study. In addition to exploring safety, tolerability and anti-tumor effects at different dose levels, Part 1 of the study will assess different schedules of administration. For example, in one dose cohort THOR-707 will be administered intravenously, or IV, on an every two-week schedule and in another dose cohort THOR-707 will be administered IV on an every three-week schedule. The MTD for THOR-707 as a single agent will be declared when two of six subjects in a dose cohort have experienced a dose-limiting toxicity, or DLT, at the same dose level; the MTD is one dose level below. In the event the MTD for a dose cohort is not reached, a RP2D may be declared by review of other available pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic data from biomarker analysis described above.
 HAMMER Part 1 will utilize select biomarkers to assess receptor engagement using phosphoSTAT5, or pSTAT5, and anti-tumor immune activity using Ki67 expression (a nuclear protein associated with and necessary for cell proliferation, including CD8+ T cells) and peripheral expansion of T cell subpopulations including CD8+ T cells as well as their infiltration within the tumor and its microenvironment (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, or TILs). The TIL assessment will be dependent on the availability of tumor tissue from biopsy. 
 Part 2 of HAMMER will be triggered by review of safety and tolerability in single agent dose cohorts and by observing available biomarker data, which will include signals of anti-tumor immune activity such as CD8+ T cell Ki67 expression at or above the threshold level, an anti-tumor level of proliferating peripheral CD8+ T cells and an anti-tumor level of TILs. 
 HAMMER Part 2 will utilize a dose escalation design to establish a RP2D for THOR-707 in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor. Subjects with solid tumors where PD-1 inhibitor treatment has been established will be enrolled in this part of the study. For each dose level within a cohort THOR-707 will be administered IV every three weeks in combination with the approved dose of a PD-1 inhibitor. The RP2D for THOR-707 in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor will be declared based on the MTD or, in the event the MTD for a dose cohort is not reached, then the RP2D may be declared by review of other available pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic data.
 HAMMER Part 3 dose expansion will begin when the RP2D of THOR-707 has been established as a single agent and/or in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor. 
 Select populations will be enrolled in HAMMER Part 3 to further test the clinical utility of THOR-707 as a single agent in subjects with established unmet needs where a rationale for IL-2 monotherapy exists. Other populations will be enrolled in Part 3 dose expansion to further test the clinical utility of THOR-707 in combination with PD-1 inhibitors as well as to test THOR-707 in combination with PD-L1 inhibitors, with chemotherapy, with targeted therapies, with other cytokines (e.g. IL-10) and with other established and emerging anti-tumor therapeutics across multiple tumor types and lines of therapy.
 Specifically, in HAMMER Part 3 we intend to test the clinical utility of THOR-707 in combination with PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors but also in patients that have relapsed following treatment with PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors or other immuno-oncology therapies, as a single agent and in combination with other anti-tumor therapeutics. 
 In addition, HAMMER Part 3 may test THOR-707 alone or in combination with other anti-tumor therapeutics including PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors in select populations where standard of care immune-based therapies, such as PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors alone or in combination with other anti-tumor therapeutics, have demonstrated to date limited clinical utility. These populations may include but not be limited to subjects with tumors that demonstrate low to non-PD-L1 expression, low tumor mutational burden, low microsatellite instability, low interferon gamma sensitivity, or increased regulation of MHC-II, which facilitates tumor antigen presentation as well as subjects with disseminated disease, primarily to the liver and/or the central nervous system.
 21


Potential post-HAMMER exploratory studies may include combinations of THOR-707 with adoptive cell transfer therapy, vaccines and oncolytic viruses.
 IL-2 Synthorin for Autoimmune (AI) Indications 
 Acute activation of the immune system and its cytotoxic functions are critical to protecting the body from infection. Once the threat has been neutralized, the body downregulates the immune system to minimize damage to normal tissue. This balance of activation and deactivation is called immune homeostasis. Autoimmunity reflects a loss of immune homeostasis and is an immune response directed against the body’s own cells. Tregs are important mediators in maintaining immune homeostasis. An imbalance of Treg function is thought to drive a number of autoimmune disorders, such as chronic graft versus host disease, or GVHD, atopic dermatitis and Crohn’s disease. 
 IL-2 AI Market Opportunity 
 Current therapeutic agents used to treat autoimmune disorders only address symptoms of disease, which at times can mediate disease modification. There continues to be an unmet need for curative treatment options for autoimmune disorders. We plan to develop our IL-2 AI Synthorin initially in chronic GVHD, atopic dermatitis and Crohn’s disease. Based on published data, we project that these three markets represent over a $10 billion worldwide market opportunity for our IL-2 AI Synthorin program. 
Graft Versus Host Disease Market Opportunity 
 GVHD is a common complication of allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or HSCT, that occurs when transplanted donor-derived immune cells recognize the patient’s cells as foreign and attack them. There are roughly 8,500 HSCTs performed each year in the United States. GVHD can manifest as acute or chronic forms and in severe cases, significantly increases the risk of non-relapse mortality. Despite prophylactic treatment, acute GVHD affects 30-70% of recipients and chronic GVHD occurs in 20-50% of recipients depending on the type of transplant, patient characteristics and GVHD prophylaxis regimen. Both forms of GVHD commonly affect organs such as the skin, gastrointestinal tract, liver, oral mucosa and eyes. 
Atopic Dermatitis Market Opportunity 
 Approximately 28 million people in the United States suffer from atopic dermatitis, a chronic, inflammatory skin disease that is most commonly first diagnosed in childhood. Atopic dermatitis is characterized by skin barrier disruption and immune dysregulation. Patients with atopic dermatitis may have chronically inflamed skin lesions. Non-steroidal topical therapies (such as the topical calcineurin inhibitors Elidel and Protopic) are also used in the treatment of atopic dermatitis, but have boxed warnings for side effects that limit their use. Thus, there remains an unmet need for new therapies, especially for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.
Crohn’s Disease Market Opportunity 
 Crohn’s disease is an inflammatory bowel condition that can lead to abdominal pain, severe diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss and malnutrition. Approximately 700,000 people in the United States are affected by Crohn’s disease. In 2016, there were approximately 45,000 newly diagnosed cases of Crohn’s disease in the United States. 
Rationale for IL-2 Synthorin for Autoimmune Indications 
 None of the currently approved therapies for autoimmune disorders are curative. We believe IL-2 therapeutics offer the potential to drive long-lasting tolerance in autoimmune indications by inducing Treg development and function. Doses of IL-2 well below those used for oncology regimens have been observed to preferentially expand Tregs, which we believe could lead to clinical benefit in some autoimmune disorders. Clinical studies have shown that low-doses of IL-2 drive Treg expansion and possible clinical benefit in chronic GVHD and hepatitis C virus-induced vasculitis. 
 22


To date, the use of low-dose IL-2 for autoimmune disorders has been limited by inconvenient dosing because of its short-half-life of 85 minutes. Recently, others have attempted to develop low-dose IL-2 with improved half-life and stronger activation of Treg over CD8+ T cells. Some molecules currently in clinical development involve complex molecular designs, which we believe have the potential to elicit ADAs, while others include pegylated versions. 
 Our IL-2 AI Synthorin 
 Our second development program is focused on the development of an IL-2 Synthorin that is designed to be optimized for autoimmune indications. We have designed several IL-2 Synthorins to have improved half-lives and preferential binding to the IL-2 αßγ receptor complex, which leads to preferential activation of Tregs over CD8+ T cells. We believe that this potential PK/PD profile will allow us to have an increased therapeutic index in autoimmune indications. 
 The Unique Design of Our IL-2 AI Synthorins Reduces ßγ Affinity 
 

 
Short half-life Teff and Treg | Extended half-life Biased to Treg
------------------------------+----------------------------------

 
We are currently screening IL-2 variants for functional activity. As illustrated in the figure below, we have identified multiple potential product candidates for development based on the effect of these Synthorins on the proliferation of CTLL-2 cells that, similar to Tregs, express the αßγ form of the IL-2 receptor complex. CTLL-2 is a subclone of T cells derived from a C57bl/6 mouse. These cells require IL-2 for growth and therefore are used to assay for its presence. Our lead IL-2 AI Synthorin, THOR-805, increased proliferation of CD4+ Tregs in mice in a dose dependent manner following a single IV bolus dose without increases in CD8+ Teff cells. The CD4+ Tregs show increased markers of suppressive function, such as FoxP3, Helios, CD25 and ICOS. Example data are shown in the figures below. We intend to nominate a lead IL-2 AI Synthorin product candidate in 2019 and start IND-enabling studies thereafter. We plan to file an IND in 2020 and begin clinical development thereafter. We expect to conduct a single ascending dose Phase 1a study in healthy volunteers to assess safety and proof of mechanism, by monitoring induction of biomarkers in Tregs and their proliferation in the blood. We will also test for delayed-type hypersensitivity, or DTH, in those volunteers, a facile test to evaluate translation of Treg cell expansion into clinical benefit, by down-modulating T cell responses to a recall antigen. 
 23


Effect of Our IL-2 AI Synthorins On the Proliferation of CTLL-2 Cells That Express IL-2 αßγ Receptors 
 

 
IL-10 IO Synthorin 
 IL-10 is a naturally occurring immune cell growth factor in humans that is critical for the proliferation and cytotoxic activity of tumor specific CD8+ T cells. IL-10 generates tumor immunity by activation of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells, cellular proliferation and induction of IFN-α, which plays a role in MHC class tumor antigen presentation, and cytotoxic proteins mediating target cell lysis. Increased T cell receptor stimulation on CD8+ T cells provides antiapoptotic and proliferation signals. An unexpected role for IL-10 in the TME is the inhibition of pro-inflammatory Th17 cells and cytokines responsible for tumor associated inflammation leading to dampening of anti-tumor effector cell responses. Third-party preclinical studies have shown that IL-10 deficiency increases tumor incidence and reduces immune surveillance. Additionally, treatment of Her2 transgenic mice with pegylated IL-10 has led to tumor rejection but requires expression of IFN-α and granzyme-expressing CD8+ T cells, with a significant increase in CD8+ T cells in the tumor. Clinical studies with a modified IL-10 (AM0010) indicate its potential as a single agent (over 20% response rate in later line RCC), and for use in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors and/or chemotherapeutic agents. An important aspect of IL-10 physiology is its anti-inflammatory activity, which we believe may translate into a larger therapeutic index for combination with agents that are known to elicit immune toxicity, including immune checkpoint inhibitors. 
 24


We are using our Expanded Genetic Alphabet platform technology to develop an IL-10 Synthorin with extended half-life and improved pharmacokinetics. We have selected sites for pegylation that avoid interference with IL-10 dimerization (IL-10 is a “head-to-tail” domain-swapped homodimer) and binding to IL-10 receptor. Our IL-10 Synthorin will have one PEG bioconjugate per monomer (two PEGs per homodimer), which we believe will result in a longer half-life. We expect to begin in vitro and in vivo studies of our Synthorin IL-10 in the first half of 2019 and begin IND-enabling studies thereafter. 
 IL-15 IO Synthorins for IO 
 IL-15 is another immunoregulatory cytokine with a well-established role in the activation of NK and CD8+ T cells. IL-15 shares the same receptor signaling complex with IL-2 (ßγ chains) yet has its own α receptor chain to which it binds with very high affinity. Because of that, IL-15 drives persistence signaling that is key to the establishment and persistence of tumor-fighting memory CD8+ T cell populations. Another difference of IL-15 relative to IL-2 is that it does not induce activation-induced cell death. In cancer, IL-15 may also have potential clinical applications including enhancement of NK antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytolysis. This therapeutic modality taps into the capacity of endogenous NK cells to bind the Fc domain of tumor cell targeting antibodies, effecting their destruction. We believe that our approach, which obviates the need for a toxin conjugate, may result in few toxicities relative to antibody-drug conjugates. Multiple third-party studies are ongoing with several engineered human IL-15 forms at different stages of preclinical and clinical development, including combinations with checkpoint inhibitors. Most of these agents in development involve complex chimeric polypeptide designs, carrying a risk for eliciting anti-drug antibody responses in treated patients. Several studies also target IL-15’s potent activation of NK and CD8+ T cells to enhance the efficacy of adoptive NK cell therapies. 
 We are using our Expanded Genetic Alphabet platform technology to design and develop two different forms of IL-15 Synthorins by site-specific pegylation: (1) a half-life extended form, capable of engaging its three receptor chains; and (2) a “not alpha” form that is also half-life extended, but with a PEG that blocks engagement of the IL-15 receptor α chain designed for fewer toxicities. Both IL-15 Synthorin forms are designed for preservation of IL-15 native potency at the ßγ receptor signaling complex, which is shared between IL-2 and IL-15. We believe that our IL-15 IO Synthorin will have a low risk for ADAs and an extended half-life. We have identified two “not alpha” IL-15 Synthorins and expect to identify a development candidate in the first half of 2019. 
 Our Early Stage Programs 
 In addition to IL-10 and IL-15, we are evaluating other Synthorin programs targeting undisclosed cytokines that play critical roles in the orchestration of anti-tumor responses by innate and adaptive immune cells. Many of these cytokines have been validated in clinical studies as single agents or in combination with other oncology therapeutics. We are using our platform technology to optimize the half-life of these cytokines, which should positively impact their pharmacodynamics and ease of use. 
Competition 
 The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary drugs. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing treatments and new treatments that may become available in the future. 
 We compete with other companies working to develop immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer including divisions of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies of various sizes. These companies are developing cytokines as immunotherapies, as well as different modalities, including monoclonal antibodies, cell therapies, oncolytic viruses and vaccines. 
 25


There are a number of other IL-2 cytokine programs in clinical development for oncology, including programs from Alkermes plc, Alopexx Oncology LLC, Altor Biosciences, Inc., Avadel Pharmaceuticals plc, Cue Biopharma, Inc., Medicenna Therapeutics Corp, Nektar Therapeutics, Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc., Philogen S.p.A., Roche AG, Sutro Biopharma, Inc., Xoma Corporation and one IL-2 therapy that has been approved and marketed as Proleukin (aldesleukin) by Nestle S.A. Additionally, there are a number of IL-10 cytokine programs in clinical development for oncology, including programs from ARMO BioSciences (Eli Lilly and Company), AstraZeneca plc, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and IL-15 cytokine programs from Altor BioSciences, ARMO BioSciences (Eli Lilly and Company), Admune Therapeutics (Novartis AG), Cytune Pharma, Nektar Therapeutics and Xencor, Inc. Our initial targeted indications for THOR-707 include melanoma, RCC, NSCLC and UC. Treatment for these patients has historically been chemotherapies and targeted therapies such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Recently, companies have developed immunotherapies, including monoclonal antibodies, cell therapies, cytokines, oncolytic viruses, vaccines and various combination therapies to improve patient outcomes in these indications. We believe that if THOR-707 were approved for use in oncology, it could potentially be in competition with these therapies in development or other approved therapies. 
 There are a number of other companies developing or marketing treatments for the same autoimmune disorders we are targeting with our IL-2 AI Synthorin program. Additionally, Nektar Therapeutics and Eli Lilly and Company, ILTOO Pharma (Les Laboratoires Servier SAS), Delinia, Inc. (Celgene Corporation), Amgen Inc., Roche and Medicenna all have modified or low-dose IL-2 programs in development for the treatment of autoimmune disorders. 
 Many of our competitors, either alone or with their collaboration partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, preclinical testing, clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing than we do. Future collaborations mergers and acquisitions may result in further resource concentration among a smaller number of competitors. These competitors will also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and subject registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or that may be necessary for, our programs. 
 Our commercial potential could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market or make our development more complicated. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to be efficacy, safety and convenience. 
 Our Other Material Agreements 
 Support Services Agreement with COI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
 In February 2015, we entered into a Support Services Agreement, or the COI Agreement, with COI, which outlines the terms of services provided by COI to us, as well as the fees charged for such services. The agreement was amended and restated in October 2017 and includes research and development services, business development services, general administrative services, facilities support services and laboratory supplies and equipment for use in research and development services. 
 The initial term of the COI Agreement expired in October 2018, at which time the agreement automatically renewed for an additional one-year period. The agreement will continue to renew for additional one-year renewal periods until terminated by the parties. Either party may terminate the agreement with 30 days written notice. 
 26


Master Services Agreement and Scope of Work for Contract Manufacturing Services Agreement with Cytovance 
 In April 2018, we entered into a Master Services Agreement and a Scope of Work for Contract Manufacturing Services with Cytovance. Pursuant to the agreements, Cytovance provides development activities and drug substance and drug product manufacturing services, including formulation of drug substance, component testing, storage, product testing and analysis, and inspection of drug products, or the Services. In addition to payment for the Services, we are obligated to pay Cytovance the cost of raw materials, outsourced testing, shipping and audits. These additional costs include, for example administrative fees ranging from the mid-single-digit percentages of fees paid by us for outsourced testing, outsourced material and waste disposal fees, to fees in the mid-teen percentages of costs paid by us for the purchase of materials. 
 The Master Services Agreement expires in April 2023. Either party may terminate the agreements (i) at any time if the other party becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy and (ii) for material breach if the other party has not cured the breach within 30 days of receiving written notice of the breach. We may terminate the agreements at any time with 60 days written notice. Cytovance may terminate the agreements with 60 days written notice, provided that all Services to be performed pursuant to all work orders under the Master Services Agreement have been completed. 
 Manufacturing 
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any large-scale manufacturing facilities. To date, we have successfully produced active drug of our Synthorins internally and externally working in conjunction with our third party manufacturers for use in our in vitro and in vivo models. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, including Cytovance Biologics and other third parties for the manufacture of our Synthorins using our proprietary E. coli strain, as well as for commercial manufacture if any of our product candidates obtain marketing approval. We are working with these manufacturers to scale up our manufacturing capabilities to support our clinical plans. We also rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to package, label, store and distribute our product candidates, as well as for our commercial products if marketing approval is obtained. We believe that this strategy allows us to maintain a more efficient infrastructure by eliminating the need for us to invest in our own manufacturing facilities, equipment and personnel while also enabling us to focus our expertise and resources on the development of our product candidates. 
 Overview of our Manufacturing Process 
 The Synthorx E. coli strain, which parallels the parental strain BL21(DE3), responds to standard parameters used for fermentation optimization. Typical to E. coli, the overall fermentation process takes less than one week to produce, and the cell paste harvest product can be isolated for downstream processing or stored for later downstream processing. The first step of the downstream purification process is the isolation and preparation of the insoluble inclusion bodies. These are then solubilized and reduced prior to refolding into its active state. The product is then pegylated using bio-orthogonal chemistry. The material is then captured via ion exchange chromatography resin to initially purify it from many of the host cell impurities. Further polishing is done via chromatography and finally the drug substance is exchanged into its final formulation by the way of tangential flow filtration and subsequent conditioning. The drug substance is then tested and can be stored as an intermediate at frozen state. 
 Commercialization Plan 
 We intend to retain significant development and commercial rights to our product candidates and, if marketing approval is obtained, to commercialize our product candidates on our own, or potentially with a partner, in the United States and other regions. We currently have no sales, marketing or commercial product distribution capabilities and have no experience as a company commercializing products. We intend to build the necessary infrastructure and capabilities over time for the United States, and potentially other regions, following further advancement of our product candidates. Clinical data, the size of the addressable patient population, the size of the commercial infrastructure and manufacturing needs may all influence or alter our commercialization plans.

 We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining rights in patents intended to cover our future product candidates and compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture and any other inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on the TSRI Agreement for intellectual property rights that are important or necessary for the development of our product candidates. We also rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets and know-how to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. 
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our current and future product candidates, novel discoveries, product development technologies and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing or in-licensing U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications related to technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, copyright protection, know-how, continuing technological innovation and confidential information to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 
 As for the product candidates we develop and plan to commercialize, as a normal course of business, we intend to pursue composition and therapeutic use patents, as well as novel indications for our product candidates. We also seek patent protection with respect to novel discoveries, including new active agent applications. We have sought and plan to continue to seek patent protection, either alone or jointly with our collaborators, as our license agreements may dictate. 
 Regardless of the coverage we seek under our existing patent applications, there is always a risk that an alteration to the product or process may provide sufficient basis for a competitor to avoid infringement claims. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before a patent is issued and courts can reinterpret patent scope after issuance. Moreover, many jurisdictions, including the United States, permit third parties to challenge issued patents in administrative proceedings, which may result in further narrowing or even cancellation of patent claims. Moreover, we cannot provide any assurance that any patents will be issued from our pending or any future applications or that any current or future issued patents will adequately protect our intellectual property. 
 Our patent estate includes applications with claims directed to our product candidates and claims directed to our Expanded Genetic Alphabet platform technology for potential future products and developments. On a worldwide basis, as of February 15, 2019, our patent estate included eight pending applications for our product candidates and one granted patent and 19 pending applications for our Expanded Genetic Alphabet platform technology. In the United States, as of February 15, 2019, we owned or licensed nine pending applications filed that are directed to our technology. Outside the United States and including PCT applications, as of February 15, 2019, we owned or licensed one granted patent and 18 pending applications. Any patents that issue from these applications are expected to expire between 2034 and 2040 excluding any extension of patent term that may be available. 
 For Synthorins, as of February 15, 2019 we have two solely owned families directed to the composition and therapeutic use of Synthorin IL-2 and IL-15 product candidates. The IL-2 family contains two PCT applications and an application in Argentina and Taiwan, respectively. We also filed a provisional application directed to further compositions and therapeutic uses of Synthorin IL-2 in February 2019. The IL-15 family contains one U.S. provisional application. Any patents that issue from these applications are expected to expire between 2038 and 2040 excluding any extension of patent term that may be available. In addition, in November 2018 we filed a provisional application directed to the composition and therapeutic use of Synthorin IL-10. Any patents that ultimately issue from this provisional application are expected to expire around 2039 excluding any extension of patent term that may be available. Further, in December 2018 we filed a provisional application directed to the composition and therapeutic use of a Synthorin from our undisclosed cytokine programs. Any patents that ultimately issue from this provisional application are expected to expire around 2039 excluding any extension of patent term that may be available.

Our patent portfolio contains six in-licensed patent families from TSRI and one co-owned patent family with TSRI directed to the Expanded Genetic Alphabet platform technology. These patents are subject to retained rights by TSRI to allow academic and non- profit research institutions to practice the licensed technology and patents for non-commercial purposes. As of February 15, 2019, these families also include one granted patent in Taiwan and pending applications in Argentina, Australia, Canada, Europe, Eurasia, Japan and Taiwan. These patents are expected to expire between 2034 and 2038 excluding any extension of patent term that may be available. For more information regarding our license agreement with TSRI, please see “Our License and Collaboration Agreements” appearing in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 In some instances, we submit patent applications directly with the USPTO as provisional patent applications. Provisional applications for patents were designed to provide a lower-cost first patent filing in the United States. Corresponding non-provisional patent applications must be filed not later than 12 months after the provisional application filing date. The corresponding non-provisional application benefits in that the priority date(s) of the patent application is/are the earlier provisional application filing date(s), and the patent term of the finally issued patent is calculated from the later non-provisional application filing date. This system allows us to obtain an early priority date, add material to the patent application(s) during the priority year, obtain a later start to the patent term and to delay prosecution costs, which may be useful in the event that we decide not to pursue examination in an application. While we intend to timely file non-provisional patent applications relating to our provisional patent applications, we cannot predict whether any such patent applications will result in the issuance of patents that provide us with any competitive advantage. 
 We file U.S. non-provisional applications and Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, applications that claim the benefit of the priority date of earlier filed provisional applications, when applicable. The PCT system allows a single application to be filed within 12 months of the original priority date of the patent application, and to designate all of the 152 PCT member states in which national patent applications can later be pursued based on the international patent application filed under the PCT. The PCT searching authority performs a patentability search and issues a non-binding patentability opinion which can be used to evaluate the chances of success for the national applications in foreign countries prior to having to incur the filing fees. Although a PCT application does not issue as a patent, it allows the applicant to seek protection in any of the member states through national-phase applications. 
 At the end of the period of two and a half years from the first priority date of the patent application, separate patent applications can be pursued in any of the PCT member states either by direct national filing or, in some cases by filing through a regional patent organization, such as the European Patent Organization. The PCT system delays expenses, allows a limited evaluation of the chances of success for national/regional patent applications and enables substantial savings where applications are abandoned within the first two and a half years of filing. 
 For all patent applications, we determine claiming strategy on a case-by-case basis. Advice of counsel and our business model and needs are always considered. We file patents containing claims for protection of all useful applications of our proprietary technologies and any products, as well as all new applications and/or uses we discover for existing technologies and products, assuming these are strategically valuable. We continuously reassess the number and type of patent applications, as well as the pending patent claims to ensure that maximum coverage and value are obtained for our processes and compositions, given existing patent office rules and regulations. Further, claims may be modified during patent prosecution to meet our intellectual property and business needs. 
 We recognize that the ability to obtain patent protection and the degree of such protection depends on a number of factors, including the extent of the prior art, the novelty and non-obviousness of the invention and the ability to satisfy the enablement requirement of the patent laws. The patent positions of therapeutic companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted or further altered even after patent issuance. Consequently, we may not obtain or maintain adequate patent protection for any of our future product candidates or for our platform technology. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. 
 29


In addition to patents, we have filed for trademark registration at the USPTO for “Synthorin” and “Synthorx”. Furthermore, we rely upon trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our commercial partners and selected consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. For more information, please see “Risk Factors–Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” appearing in Part I, Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. In addition, we have licensed rights under proprietary technologies of third parties to develop, manufacture and commercialize specific aspects of our future products and services. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, alter our processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. The expiration of patents or patent applications licensed from third parties or our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future technology may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention. 
 For a more comprehensive discussion of the risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” appearing in Part I, Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Patent Term and Patent Term Extensions 
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The term of a patent that covers a drug, biological product or medical device approved pursuant to a pre-market approval may also be eligible for patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review while the patent is in force. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date set for the patent. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be granted an extension and only those claims reading on the approved drug are extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug, however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions. 
 30


Trade Secrets 
 We rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our unpatented technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our trade secrets and proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, collaborators, scientific advisors, suppliers, contractors and other third parties. In addition, we enter into employment agreements that require employees to assign to us any inventions, trade secrets or know-how that they develop while employed by us. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and our trade secrets and other proprietary information may be disclosed. We may not have adequate remedies for any breach and could lose our trade secrets and other proprietary information through such a breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting trade secrets, know-how and inventions. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.” 
Our License and Collaboration Agreements 
 License Agreement with TSRI 
 In July 2014, we entered into the TSRI Agreement with TSRI, which was amended in September 2018. Pursuant to the TSRI Agreement, we have an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license under certain of TSRI’s patent rights, know-how and biological materials, or the Licensed Technology, to make, use, sell, offer for sale and import products covered by the claims of the licensed patent rights or developed by us through the use of the Licensed Technology, or the Licensed Products, and to otherwise exploit the Licensed Technology. The Licensed Technology forms the basis of our proprietary Expanded Genetic Alphabet platform technology. The license granted to us by TSRI under the Licensed Technology is subject to certain U.S. Government rights and certain other limited rights retained by TSRI. 
 Under the TSRI Agreement, upon execution of the license, we made an upfront, non-creditable, non-refundable payment in an amount in the low five-digit dollar range and issued 30,663 shares of our common stock to TSRI. Pursuant to the terms of the TSRI Agreement, in July 2015, we issued 8,711 additional shares of our common stock to TSRI. 
 Since July 2017, we have been required to pay TSRI a minimum annual royalty in the low five-digit dollar range. We are also obligated to pay running royalties in the low single digit percentages on our or our sublicensees’ net sales of the Licensed Products on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis. Certain of these payment obligations may be increased during the pendency of any challenge of the licensed patent rights by us, our affiliates, or sublicensees. In the event that we are required to obtain a license under patent rights held by a third party to prevent infringement of the Licensed Products, we may offset our royalty obligations to TSRI by up to a maximum mid-double digit percentage of any royalties we pay to such third party. However, in no event, can we reduce the royalties payable to TSRI by more than a mid-double digit percentage in any calendar quarter. Our royalty obligations as to each product shall terminate on a country-by-country basis upon the expiration of the last-to-expire of the licensed patent claims in each such country that cover the Licensed Products. These patents are expected to expire between 2034 and 2039 excluding any extension of patent term that may be available. We are also required to pay TSRI (i) an amount in the low-double digit percent range of sublicensing revenues, (ii) an amount in the high-single digit percent range of non-sublicensing transaction revenues, such as amounts received for grants of licenses to third parties and grants of other distribution or marketing rights, payable in shares of the Company’s capital stock and (iii) milestone payments of up to $2.4 million for each Licensed Product relating to such revenues or payments. 
 31


The TSRI Agreement will expire upon the expiration of all of the royalty payment obligations under the TSRI Agreement, unless it is terminated sooner by the parties. The parties may terminate the TSRI Agreement by mutual written consent. TSRI may terminate the TSRI Agreement (i) if we do not make a payment due under the agreement and we fail to cure the non-payment within 15 days after receiving written notice, (ii) if we default on our indemnification or insurance obligations under the TSRI Agreement, (iii) with 45 days’ written notice if TSRI has a reasonable basis to believe that we are not using commercially reasonable efforts to develop and obtain regulatory approval to market the licensed products as promptly as is reasonably and commercially feasible and to produce and sell reasonable quantities of the licensed products sufficient to meet market demand, (iv) if we become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, (v) if an audit shows that we underpaid TSRI by 15% or more in a calendar year and a subsequent audit conducted within three years of the first audit shows similar underpayment for a subsequent calendar year, (vi) if we are convicted of a felony relating to the development, manufacture, use, marketing, distribution or sale of Licensed Products, (vii) if we, our affiliates or sublicensees challenge the licensed patent rights or (viii) if we default in performance of any of our obligations under the TSRI Agreement and do not cure the default within 45 days of receiving written notice of the default. We may terminate the TSRI Agreement by giving 90 days’ advance written notice. 
 Research Funding and Option Agreement with TSRI 
 In July 2014, we entered into a Research Funding and Option Agreement for certain technologies with TSRI, which was amended in September 2015, September 2016, October 2017 and August 2018. Pursuant to this agreement, as amended, we provide funding to TSRI to conduct certain research activities under a research program and TSRI has granted us an exclusive option to acquire during a certain period of time an exclusive, worldwide license, with the right to sublicense to make, use, offer for sale, sell and import certain intellectual property arising from the research program that relate to our Expanded Genetic Alphabet platform technology, for the discovery and development of innovative protein therapeutics for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune disorders. Any intellectual property to which we exercise the foregoing option will be included in the license granted under the TSRI Agreement. Our rights and obligations under the agreement are subject to certain U.S. Government rights and certain other limited rights retained by TSRI. 
 TSRI has the right to adjust the payment amounts owed by us to reflect changes in the indirect cost rate negotiated between TSRI and the U.S. Government that will be in effect during the quarter that the work is performed. TSRI must provide notice to us prior to the effective date of such payment amount adjustments. 
 The agreement will continue in effect until the earlier of (a) July 2019, and (b) the completion of the research program, unless extended or terminated by the parties. The agreement may be terminated by mutual agreement. TSRI may terminate the agreement if we do not make a payment due under the agreement and fail to cure such non-payment within 30 days after receiving notice. Either party may terminate the agreement (i) if the other party fails to perform any obligations under the agreement and fails to cure such failure within 60 days after receiving notice or (ii) if the other party becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy.
 Government Regulation 
 As a biopharmaceutical company that operates in the United States, we are subject to extensive regulation. Our products will be regulated as biologics. With this classification, commercial production of our future products will need to occur in registered and licensed facilities in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, for biologics. 
 32


Government authorities in the United States (at the federal, state and local level) and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of biopharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. Our future product candidates must be approved, or in the case of biologics, licensed, by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States, although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in Europe are addressed in a centralized way, but country-specific regulation remains essential in many respects. The process for obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
 U.S. Product Development Process 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical and biological products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and their implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include, among other actions, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

▪ | completion of nonclinical, also referred to as preclinical, laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices, or GLPs, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | approval by an IRB or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research patients and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | submission to the FDA of a biologics license application, or BLA, for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.
--+---------------------------------------------------

 Before testing any biological product candidate, including our future product candidates, in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. 
 33


The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research patients provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
  
▪ | Phase 1. The biological product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Phase 2. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk to benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human patients, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. 
 34


The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, including risks inferred from other unrelated trials. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Concurrently with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Given that we have introduced a new base pair, this may add additional complexities to the characterization of our bacterial strain and final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 U.S. Review and Approval Processes 
 After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for marketed biological products. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 
 Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. Under PDUFA, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals to complete the review of BLAs. The FDA may give a priority review designation to biological products that offer significant improvements in safety or efficacy, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Under the current PDUFA agreement, these six and ten month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for original BLAs, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. 
 The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, potent, and/or effective for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve a BLA without a REMS, if required. 
 35


Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production and quality control. 
 Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. 
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. However, if only one indication for a product has orphan designation, a pediatric assessment may still be required for any applications to market that same product for the non-orphan indication(s). 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process. 
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee. A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.

Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life- threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Unique to a fast track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA. 
 Any product, submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a fast track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. 
 Breakthrough therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of products that treat serious or life-threatening conditions. The designation by FDA requires preliminary clinical evidence that a product candidate demonstrates substantial improvement over currently available therapy. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The breakthrough therapy designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, which can also be granted to the same product if relevant criteria are met. If a product is designated as breakthrough therapy, FDA will expedite the development and review of such product. 
 Where applicable, we plan to request Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy Designation for our future product candidates. Even if we receive one or both of these designations for our future product candidates, the FDA may later decide that our future product candidates no longer meet the conditions for qualification. In addition, these designations may not provide us with a material commercial advantage. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Any products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved uses (known as “off-label use”), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although a physician may prescribe a legally available product for an off-label use, if the physicians deems such product to be appropriate in his/her professional medical judgment, a manufacturer may not market or promote off-label uses. It is permissible, however, for a manufacturer to share in certain limited circumstances truthful and not misleading information that is consistent with, but outside of, the product’s approved labeling.
 37


After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of biological products. 
 To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHS Act also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend biologics licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases within the United States. 
 In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to applicable manufacturing requirements after approval to ensure the long-term stability of the product. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. 
 The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development in the future. 
 U.S. Marketing Exclusivity 
 The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA, amended the PHSA to authorize the FDA to approve similar versions of innovative biologics, commonly known as biosimilars. A competitor seeking approval of a biosimilar must file an application to establish its molecule as highly similar to an approved innovator biologic, among other requirements. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA. 
 38


Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. This 12-year period of data exclusivity may be extended by six months, for a total of 12.5 years, if the FDA requests that the innovator company conduct certain pediatric clinical investigations of the product. 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our future product candidates, some of our U.S. patents, if granted, may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years, as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA. 
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial. 
 Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 In the United States, our current and future activities with investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, third-party payors, patient organizations and customers are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, our business practices, including our clinical research, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may be required to comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the patient data privacy and security provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, or HIPAA, transparency requirements, and similar state and local laws, each as amended, as applicable. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any good, item, facility or service reimbursable, in whole or part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers and other third parties on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. 
 39


Additionally, the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively, the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Rather, if “one purpose” of the remuneration is to induce referrals, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute is implicated. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act (discussed below). 
 The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for a medical or other item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 
 The federal false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment or approval from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal payors, knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or knowingly making a false statement to improperly avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies are being investigated or, in the past, have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved or off-label, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. 
 HIPAA imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Affordable Care Act amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
 Also applicable to our business are analogous U.S. state laws and regulations, including state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including private insurers our business practices. 
 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, imposes requirements on certain types of individuals and entities relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, including protected health information, or PHI. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates that are independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain PHI in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, may not have the same effect, and are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals, and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 
 40


In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. 
 State and local laws also require pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government, establish marketing compliance programs, restrict payments that may be made to healthcare professionals and entities and other potential referral sources, file periodic reports with the state relating to pricing and marketing, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register field representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. 
 Ensuring that our internal operations and future business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available, it is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal, state and local healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, exclusion, debarment or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. 
 Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any future product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our future products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our future product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 
 41


Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Union, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. 
 The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on healthcare pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 Healthcare Reform 
 In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the ability to profitably sell product candidates for which marketing approval is obtained. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. 
 For example, the Affordable Care Act substantially changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers. Among the Affordable Care Act provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, in addition to those otherwise described above, are the following: 
  
▪ | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs that began in 2011;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, retroactive to January 1, 2010, to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively, and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the AMP;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% point of sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the 340B Drug Discount Program;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 42


 
▪ | expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the FCA and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | requirements to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | a requirement to annually report certain information regarding drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | establishment of a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending that began on January 1, 2011; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | a licensure framework for follow on biologic products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------

 Some of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act have yet to be implemented, and there have been legal and political challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the Affordable Care Act. In December 2017, Congress enacted The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, which included a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. Further, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain Affordable Care Act-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amended the Affordable Care Act, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. In July 2018, CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain Affordable Care Act qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the Affordable Care Act risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the Affordable Care Act, and because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. While neither the Texas District Court Judge, Trump administration nor CMS have stated that the ruling will have an immediate effect, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, if any, and other efforts will impact the Affordable Care Act. Congress is continuing to consider legislation that would alter other aspects of the Affordable Care Act. The ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation on the U.S. healthcare industry is unclear. 
 We anticipate that the Affordable Care Act, if substantially maintained in its current form, will continue to result in additional downward pressure on coverage and the price that we receive for any approved product, and could seriously harm our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our future products. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenue from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates. 
 43


Further legislation or regulation could be passed that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, in August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning on April 1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2027, unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Further, the Trump administration released a “Blueprint”, or plan, to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. HHS has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. For example, in September 2018, CMS announced that it will allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2019, and in October 2018, CMS proposed a new rule that would require direct-to-consumer television advertisements of prescription drugs and biological products, for which payment is available through or under Medicare or Medicaid, to include in the advertisement the Wholesale Acquisition Cost, or list price, of that drug or biological product. On January 31, 2019, the HHS Office of Inspector General proposed modifications to federal Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbors which, among other things, may affect rebates paid by manufacturers to Medicare Part D plans, the purpose of which is to further reduce the cost of drug products to consumers. While some proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. 
 Additionally, individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
 The FCPA prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.

Additional Regulation 
 In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations. 
Europe / Rest of World Government Regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our future products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval of a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a clinical trial application must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the clinical trial application is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries. 
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug or biological product under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit an MAA. The application used to file the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the European Union, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. The designation may provide 10 years of market exclusivity in Europe, subject to certain limited exceptions. However, the designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process. 
 For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 Additionally, the collection and use of personal health data in the European Union are governed by the provisions of the Data Protection Directive, and as of May 2018, the GDPR. These directives impose several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, notification of data processing obligations to the competent national data protection authorities and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. The Data Protection Directive and GDPR also impose strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Union to the United States. Failure to comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Directive, the GDPR, and the related national data protection laws of the European Union Member States may result in fines and other administrative penalties. The GDPR introduces new data protection requirements in the European Union and substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules. The GDPR regulations may impose additional responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. This may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
