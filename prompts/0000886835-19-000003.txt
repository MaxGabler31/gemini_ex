Item 1. Business General
 ﻿
 We provide a wide variety of services and products to the energy industry.  We serve major, national and independent oil and natural gas exploration and production companies around the world and we offer products and services with respect to the various phases of a well’s economic life cycle.  We report our operating results in four business segments: Drilling Products and Services; Onshore Completion and Workover Services; Production Services; and Technical Solutions.  Given our long-term strategy of geographic expansion, we also provide supplemental segment revenue information in three geographic areas:  U.S. land; Gulf of Mexico; and International.

Products and Services
 ﻿
 We offer a wide variety of specialized oilfield services and equipment generally categorized by their typical use during the economic life of a well.  A description of the products and services offered by each of our four segments is as follows:
 ﻿

· | Drilling Products and Services – Includes downhole drilling tools and surface rentals.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

§ | Downhole drilling tools – Includes rentals of tubulars, such as primary drill pipe strings, landing strings, completion tubulars and associated accessories, and manufacturing and rentals of bottom hole tools, including stabilizers, non-magnetic drill collars and hole openers.

  ﻿

§ | Surface rentals – Includes rentals of temporary onshore and offshore accommodation modules and accessories.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Onshore Completion and Workover Services – Includes pressure pumping, fluid management and workover services.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

§ | Pressure pumping – Includes hydraulic fracturing and high pressure pumping services used to complete and stimulate production in new oil and gas wells.

  ﻿

§ | Fluid management – Includes services used to obtain, move, store and dispose of fluids that are involved in the exploration, development and production of oil and gas, including mobile piping systems, specialized trucks, fracturing tanks and other assets that transport, heat, pump and dispose of fluids.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

§ | Workover services – Includes a variety of well completion, workover and maintenance services, including installations, completions, sidetracking of wells and support for perforating operations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

  ﻿

§ | Intervention services – Includes services to enhance, maintain and extend oil and gas production during the life of the well, including coiled tubing, cased hole and mechanical wireline, hydraulic workover and snubbing, pressure control services, production testing and optimization.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Technical Solutions – Includes products and services that generally address customer-specific needs with their applications, which typically require specialized engineering, manufacturing or project planning expertise. Most operations requiring our technical solutions are generally in offshore environments during the completion, production and decommissioning phase of an oil and gas well. These products and services primarily include completion tools and services, well control services and subsea well intervention. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

§ | Completion tools and services – Provides products and services used during the completion phase of an offshore well to control sand and maximize oil and gas production, including sand control systems, well screens and filters, and surface-controlled sub surface safety valves.

§ | Well control services – Resolves well control and pressure control problems through firefighting, engineering and well control training.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

§ | Subsea well intervention – Provides offshore well decommissioning services, consisting of plugging and abandoning wells at the end of their economic life.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 The Technical Solutions segment also includes revenues from oil and gas production related to our 51% ownership interest in our sole federal offshore oil and gas property (which we refer to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as the “oil and gas property”) and related assets.  
 ﻿
 Customers
 ﻿
 Our customers are the major and independent oil and gas companies that are active in the geographic areas in which we operate.  There were no customers that exceeded 10% of our total revenues in 2018.  Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) accounted for approximately 13% and 11% of our revenues in 2017 and 2016, respectively, primarily within the Onshore Completion and Workover Services segment.  The reduction in sales to existing large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations if it is not offset by sales to new or other existing customers.
 ﻿
 Competition 
 ﻿
 We provide products and services worldwide in highly competitive markets, with competitors comprised of both small and large companies.  Our revenues and earnings can be affected by several factors, including changes in competition, fluctuations in drilling and completion activity, perceptions of future prices of oil and gas, government regulation, disruptions caused by weather and general economic conditions.  We believe that the principal competitive factors are price, performance, product and service quality, safety, response time and breadth of products and services.
 ﻿
 Potential Liabilities and Insurance 
 ﻿
 Our operations involve a high degree of operational risk and expose us to significant liabilities.  An accident involving our services or equipment, or the failure of a product sold by us, could result in personal injury, loss of life, and damage to property, equipment or the environment.  Litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence, such as fire, explosion, well blowout or vessel loss, may result in substantial claims for damages.  
 ﻿
 As is customary in our industry, our contracts generally provide that we will indemnify and hold harmless our customers from any claims arising from personal injury or death of our employees, damage to or loss of our equipment, and pollution emanating from our equipment and services.  Similarly, our customers generally agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any claims arising from personal injury or death of their employees, damage to or loss of their equipment or property, and pollution caused from their equipment or the well reservoir (including uncontained oil flow from a reservoir).  Nonetheless, our indemnification arrangements may not protect us in every case.
 ﻿
 We maintain a liability insurance program that covers against certain operating hazards, including product liability, property damage and personal injury claims, as well as certain limited environmental pollution claims for damage to a third party or its property arising out of contact with pollution for which we are liable, but well control costs are not covered by this program.  These policies include primary and excess umbrella liability policies with limits of $350 million per occurrence, including sudden and accidental pollution incidents.  All of the insurance policies we purchase contain specific terms, conditions, limitations and exclusions and are subject to either deductibles or self-insured retention amounts for which we are responsible.  There can be no assurance that the nature and amount of insurance we maintain will be sufficient to fully protect us against all liabilities related to our business.
 ﻿
 Government Regulation 
 ﻿
 Our business is significantly affected by Federal, State and local laws and other regulations.  These laws and regulations relate to, among other things:
 ﻿

· | worker safety standards;
--+-------------------------

  ﻿

· | the protection of the environment;
--+-----------------------------------

  ﻿

· | the handling and transportation of hazardous materials; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | the mobilization of our equipment to, and operations conducted at, our work sites.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Numerous permits are required for the conduct of our business and operation of our various facilities and equipment, including our underground injection wells, marine vessels, trucks and other heavy equipment.  These permits can be revoked, modified or renewed by issuing authorities based on factors both within and outside our control.
 ﻿
 We cannot predict the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations or how such laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings in the future.  We also cannot predict whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted, including changes in regulatory oversight, increase of federal, state or local taxes, increase of inspection costs, or the effect such changes may have on us, our businesses or our financial condition.
 ﻿
 Environmental Matters
 ﻿
 Our operations, and those of our customers, are subject to extensive laws, regulations and treaties relating to air and water quality, generation, storage and handling of hazardous materials, and emission and discharge of materials into the environment.  We believe we are in substantial compliance with all regulations affecting our business.  Historically, our expenditures in furtherance of our compliance with these laws, regulations and treaties have not been material, and we do not expect the cost of compliance to be material in the future.
 ﻿
 Raw Materials
 ﻿
 We purchase various raw materials and component parts in connection with delivering our products and services.  These materials are generally, but not always, available from multiple sources and may be subject to price volatility.  While we generally do not experience significant long-term shortages of these materials, we have from time to time experienced temporary shortages of particular raw materials.  We are always seeking ways to ensure the availability of resources, as well as manage costs of raw materials. 
 ﻿
 Seasonality
 ﻿
 Seasonal weather and severe weather conditions can temporarily impair our operations and reduce demand for our products and services.  Examples of seasonal events that negatively affect our operations include high seas associated with cold fronts during the winter months and hurricanes during the summer months in the Gulf of Mexico, and severe cold during winter months in the U.S. land market area.  
 ﻿
 Employees 
 ﻿
 At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 6,600 employees.  Approximately 6% of our employees are subject to union contracts, all of which are in international locations.  We believe that we have good relationships with our employees. 
 ﻿
 Facilities
 ﻿
 Our principal executive offices are located at 1001 Louisiana Street, Suite 2900, Houston, Texas, 77002.  We own or lease a large number of facilities in the various areas in which we operate throughout the world.
 ﻿
 Intellectual Property 
 ﻿
 We seek patent and trademark protections throughout the world for our technology when we deem it prudent, and we aggressively pursue protection of these rights.  We believe our patents and trademarks are adequate for the conduct of our business, and that no single patent or trademark is critical to our business.  In addition, we rely to a great extent on the technical expertise and know-how of our personnel to maintain our competitive position.
 ﻿
