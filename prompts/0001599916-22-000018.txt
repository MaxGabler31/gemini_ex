The Company’s e-learning programs are offered to its customers who have to be first registered as a member of Force Club. Since 2002, the Company began to offer its e-learning programs to its customers in CD-ROMs with pre-loaded learning content until 2007. Due to the popular trend for internet, starting from 2007, the Company has made its e-learning programs available on its website for its customers, and the customers need to pay a monthly fee in order to access and view the most up-to-date content on the website of the Company. At the advent of digital technology in recent years and in view of the increasing popularity of tablet devices, the Company has released its e-learning programs on smartphones and tablet devices for customer use since 2012 to cater for the popular demand of young learners and users in rural areas of Japan. The e-learning programs of Force Club are targeted at residents of Japan, and thus the e-learning programs are presented in Japanese only and no translated version is available. Since 2015, in addition to e-learning, the Company has started offline business which attracts public attentions such as Abacus School and Robot Programming School. The Company also opened “ixi After School” in Tokyo, which provides after school care services to children. Through these offline businesses, the Company has provided services to general users.
 
The Company regularly updates its e-learning materials and programs. In particular, the learning resources supplementing elementary school, junior high school and senior high school curriculum would be overhauled to correspond to any revision in school curriculum, which generally takes place once in a four-year period. In addition, most of preparation courses for the university entrance examinations and professional qualification examinations would be revised at one to two year intervals to cater for any changes to the examination syllabus. The website of the Company is updated from time to time to reflect the updates and changes to the learning materials and programs and for users with smartphones and tablet devices, these updates can also be downloaded from the website of the Company.

Business Model
 
Apart from using a conventional direct sales marketing strategy, the Company has also adopted multilevel marketing (“MLM”), via the Premium Membership in the Force Club, in operating its businesses.
 
Since 2002, the Company has adopted a direct sales marketing strategy to market its e-learning programs. Subsequently, in 2007, the Company gradually changed its marketing strategy from direct sales to MLM for the purposes of (i) establishing its brand name and penetrating into the rural areas of Japan; (ii) promoting its products to wider customer groups through premium members; and (iii) incentivizing premium members to recruit new members to join Force Club in order to increase the sales of its products and maximize profits for the Company. Currently, the Company has no retail shops or other point-of-sale for its products (e-learning courses).
 
MLM was adopted by the Company in order to expand the sales of its e-learning programs through its Force Club members. There are two tiers of Force Club members, namely standard members and premium members. Among Force Club members, premium members get a tablet device which entitles the premium members to life-time access of all of the Company’s e-learning educational content. Since the Company’s e-learning education programs are distributed in the form of online downloads, it can be used both online and offline.
 
Force Club Membership
 
Force Club members are those who intend to use products and services the Company offers. There are two tiers of Force Club members, namely standard members and premium members. Premium members are those who wish to engage in recruiting new members (“Premium Members”).
 
Premium Members have to join a premium plan under which members are given rights to use all products and services of the Company, and engage in activities to recruit new Force Club members and obtain monetary rewards and bonuses (special income or commissions) from such activities. The Company enters into a contract (the “Premium Member Contract”) with each of its Premium Members. The salient terms of the Premium Member Contract are as follows:
 
Eligibility - the following individuals/corporations are eligible to register as the Company’s Premium Members:
 
(i) Individuals (other than students) who are 20 years old or above and are residents of Japan; and
 (ii) Corporations established in Japan.
 
Applicants are required to provide proof of identity, such as driver’s license, passport or resident card for individual members or a certified copy of the commercial registration for corporate members.
Payments – an applicant who wishes to be a Force Club Premium Member has to join the premium plan and pay an initial payment of JPY420,000 (exclusive of sales tax), comprising:
 
(i) The one-off registration fee of JPY10,000;
 (ii) The premium package fee of JPY390,000; and
 (iii)An advanced payment of monthly membership fees for the initial two months amounting to JPY20,000.
 
Standard members pay the same registration fee, but a reduced monthly rate and no premium package fee. Monthly membership fees payable from the third month onwards will be automatically transmitted from a member’s bank account until termination of membership.
 
Based on provisions described fully in the Premium Member Contract there are fees related to, but not exclusively limited to, cancellation of membership and other stipulations pursuant to certain actions. If a Premium Member does not pay the monthly membership fee before the prescribed due date, such Premium Member will be disqualified and will not be paid any commission with respect to his/her recruitment performance in the preceding month, and Force Club services for such Premium Member will be suspended in the following month. The commission and Force Club services for such Premium Member will be resumed in the subsequent month if the monthly membership fee is paid within three months from the due date. Otherwise, the Premium Member is deemed to have withdrawn from his membership if the monthly membership fee is not paid for three consecutive months after the payment due date.
 
In addition, the Premium Member Contract sets out the rules of conduct required to be observed by Premium Members in recruiting new members to join Force Club. The Company is entitled to suspend a Premium Member’s business activities, suspend his or her commission, demand return of commission(s), remove his or her title, or terminate his or her membership if such Premium Member violates or infringes the rules of conduct or other related laws or regulations, and/or acts in a way that is offensive to public order and morals.
 
Upon registration as Force Club members, applicants will be given a user ID to gain access to the e-learning programs through Force Club platform. Force Club members will be given additional four user IDs after registration so that they can use a total of five user IDs for accessing e-learning content through Force Club platform.
 
The number of Force Club members has increased from approximately 3,989 as of September 30, 2008 to approximately 11,426 as of the date of this report.

Specifically, we believe our biggest competitors at present are Recruit Marketing Partners Co., Ltd., which provides "Study Supplements", JustSystem Corporation, which provides "Smile Zemi", Benesse Corporation which provides "Challenge Touch" and SuRaLa Net Co., Ltd. which provides "SuRaLa", whose product offerings are also consistent of e-learning programs and services.
Current Advertising
 
Our advertising expenses are primarily comprised of, but not limited to, sales events hosted for sales agents, exhibitions to promote and display company product offerings, signboards, and public relations activities.
Future Plans
 
During the year under the review, in Japan where the Company mainly operates its business, State of Emergency were issued several times due to the intermittent outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (“Covid-19”) and the Company’s activities had been significantly restricted. Nevertheless, the Company made efforts to give some incentives to the Force Club members, which resulted in an increase in the number of the members. Accordingly, the membership fee income for the year significantly increased.
 
Over the course of the next twelve months, the Company intends to focus on expanding its sales network in order to strengthen its business activities, based on such an increase in number of the members and cost-effective management, which was gained during the outbreak of Covid-19. We plan to provide some benefits and incentives to the Premium Members as value-added services, in addition to the normal compensation package.
 
Employees
 
The number of the employees of the Company, and all subsidiaries, as of the filing date is thirty-four. All thirty-four employees are considered full-time employees. We do not presently have pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing, or similar benefit plans; however, we may adopt plans in the future. There are presently no personal benefits available to our officers/or directors and or employees.
Government Regulations
 
Companies in Japan are regulated by the “Act on Specified Commercial Transactions in Japan.” The Company believes it is fully in compliance with this Act, which outlines the rules and regulation regarding transactions arising from door-to-door sales, mail order sales, telemarketing sales, and multilevel marketing transactions, among other transactions defined in the Act.
 
The Company has legal counsel in Japan who provides instruction, direction, and reviews Company activities to ensure, to the best of Legal Counsel’s knowledge, that the Company is in compliance with the aforementioned Act.
