 Item 1.    Business
 Magellan Health, Inc. (“Magellan”) is a leader in managing the fastest growing, most complex areas of healthcare, including special populations, complete pharmacy benefits and other specialty areas of healthcare. The Company develops innovative solutions that combine advanced analytics, agile technology and clinical excellence to drive better decision making, positively impact members’ health outcomes and optimize the cost of care for the customers Magellan serves. The Company provides services to health plans and other managed care organizations (“MCOs”), employers, labor unions, various military and governmental agencies and third party administrators (“TPAs”). Magellan operates three segments: Healthcare, Pharmacy Management and Corporate. In this report, references to “we”, “us”, “our” and the “Company” include Magellan and its subsidiaries. Magellan was incorporated in 1969 under the laws of the State of Delaware.  Healthcare

The Healthcare segment (“Healthcare”) is broken down into two reporting units – (i) Behavioral & Specialty Health and (ii) Magellan Complete Care (“MCC”).
 The Behavioral & Specialty Health reporting unit’s customers include health plans, accountable care organizations, employers, state Medicaid agencies, the United States military and various federal government agencies for whom Magellan provides carve-out management services for behavioral health, employee assistance plans (“EAPs”) and other areas of specialty healthcare including diagnostic imaging, musculoskeletal management, cardiac and physical medicine. These management services can be applied broadly across commercial, Medicaid and Medicare populations, or on a more targeted basis for health plan customers. 
 The MCC reporting unit contracts with state Medicaid agencies and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) to manage care for beneficiaries under various Medicaid and Medicare programs. MCC manages a wide range of services from total medical cost to carve out long-term support services. MCC largely focuses on 

 
  1

 
managing care for special populations including individuals with serious mental illness (“SMI”), dual eligibles, the aged, blind and disabled (“ABD”) and other populations with unique and often complex healthcare needs. 
 Magellan’s coordination and management of these healthcare and long-term support services are provided through its comprehensive network of medical and behavioral health professionals, clinics, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, home care agencies and ancillary service providers. This network of credentialed providers is integrated with clinical and quality improvement programs to improve access to care and enhance the healthcare experience for individuals in need of care, while at the same time making the cost of these services more affordable for customers. The Company generally does not directly provide or own any provider of treatment services, although it does employ licensed behavioral health counselors to deliver non‑medical counseling under certain government contracts.

The Company provides its Healthcare management services primarily through: (i) risk‑based products, where the Company assumes all or a substantial portion of the responsibility for the cost of providing treatment services in exchange for a fixed per member per month fee, or (ii) administrative services only (“ASO”) products, where the Company provides services such as utilization review, claims administration and/or provider network management, but does not assume full responsibility for the cost of the treatment services, in exchange for an administrative fee and, in some instances, a gain share.
 Pharmacy Management
 The Pharmacy Management segment (“Pharmacy Management”) is comprised of products and solutions that provide clinical and financial management of pharmaceuticals paid under both the medical and the pharmacy benefit. Pharmacy Management’s services include: (i) pharmacy benefit management (“PBM”) services, including pharmaceutical dispensing operations; (ii) pharmacy benefit administration (“PBA”) for state Medicaid and other government sponsored programs; (iii)  clinical and formulary management programs; (iv) medical pharmacy management programs; and (v) programs for the integrated management of specialty drugs across both the medical and pharmacy benefit that treat complex conditions, regardless of site of service, method of delivery, or benefit reimbursement.
 These services are available individually, in combination, or on a fully integrated manner. The Company markets its pharmacy management services to health plans, employers, third party administrators, state governments, Medicare Part D beneficiaries, government agencies, exchanges, brokers and consultants. In addition, the Company will continue to upsell its suite of pharmacy services to existing customers and market these pharmacy solutions to the Healthcare customer base.
 Pharmacy Management contracts with its customers for services using risk‑based, gain share or ASO arrangements. In addition, the Pharmacy Management segment provides services to the MCC reporting unit within the Healthcare segment.
 Corporate
 This segment of the Company is comprised primarily of amounts not allocated to the Healthcare and Pharmacy Management segments that are largely associated with costs related to being a publicly traded company. 
 See Note 10—“Business Segment Information” to the consolidated financial statements for certain segment financial data relating to our business set forth elsewhere herein.
 Recent Acquisitions
 Healthcare Acquisitions

In recent years, the Company has expanded its Healthcare segment with various acquisitions. The acquisitions of AlphaCare Holdings, Inc. (“AlphaCare Holdings”) in 2013, The Management Group, LLC (“TMG”) in 2016 and SWH Holdings, Inc. (“SWH”) in 2017 expanded the Company’s MCC reporting unit. Magellan also increased its presence within the federal marketplace through the acquisition of Armed Forces Services Corporation (“AFSC”) in 2016 which falls under the Behavioral & Specialty Health reporting unit.

 Pharmacy Management Acquisitions

In recent years, the Company has expanded its Pharmacy Management segment with various acquisitions. The acquisitions of Partners Rx Management, LLC (“Partners Rx”) in 2013, 4D Pharmacy Management Systems, Inc. (“4D”) in 2015 and Veridicus Holdings, LLC (“Veridicus”) in 2016 expanded the Company’s presence in the PBM market. The Company expanded its formulary management programs with the acquisition of CDMI, LLC (“CDMI”) in 2014.  Industry
 According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), national health expenditure growth is expected to average 5.5 percent annually over 2017-2026. Growth in national health spending is projected to be faster than projected growth in Gross Domestic Product (“GDP”) by 1.0 percentage point over 2017-2026. As a result, the report projects the health share of GDP to rise from 17.9 percent in 2016 to 19.7 percent by 2026.
 With the dynamic economic environment, rising healthcare costs, increased fiscal pressures on federal and state governments and the uncertainty around the future of healthcare reform, healthcare spending will continue to be one of the greatest pressing issues for the American public and government agencies. The rapidly evolving clinical and technological environment demands the expertise of specialized healthcare management services to provide both high‑quality and affordable care.
 Business Strategy
 The Company is a leader in managing the fastest growing, most complex areas of health, including special populations, complete pharmacy benefits and other specialty areas of healthcare. Magellan is focused on measured growth while executing against a multi-year margin improvement plan for the current portfolio of customers to bring earnings in line with industry competitive levels. The Company’s strategy is organized around four main focus areas:
1. | Retain customers and drive new sales
---+-------------------------------------


2. | Improve margins by reducing cost of care, lowering pharmacy cost of goods sold and driving operational improvements across the Company
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Maximize and expand the Company’s key value drivers
---+----------------------------------------------------


4. | Engage Magellan’s workforce
---+----------------------------

 
Retain customers and drive new sales: To drive revenue and profit growth long term, the Company has targeted plans to retain existing customers and add new customers across both segments. In Pharmacy Management and Healthcare, the Company is targeting growth through new business wins, increased retention and upselling existing and newly developed services to existing customers. MCC will seek growth within current contracts deploying a local market strategy to increase retention and add new members. MCC will also seek to expand its footprint within existing states and selectively target new geographies as new managed Medicaid opportunities emerge for complex populations.

Improve margins by reducing cost of care, lowering Pharmacy costs of goods sold and driving operational improvements across the organization: Within Pharmacy Management, the Company will continue to grow PBM while retaining specialty carve-out contracts and lowering our cost of goods sold. Within Healthcare, the Company will execute against targeted medical action plans and will have market competitive loss ratios for each customer. Further, teams will drive operational improvements across the company to enhance efficiency.   
Maximize and expand Magellan’s key value drivers:
 Pharmacy Management - continued focus on specialty drug management: With advances in specialty drugs driving the majority of pharmaceutical cost increases, Magellan’s foundation as an industry leader in specialty drug management uniquely positions us to deliver programs across all aspects of drug spend – traditional drugs, as well as specialty drugs paid under both the medical and pharmacy benefits. Our value based strategies are designed to support the 2-3 percent of patients driving the majority of spend through advanced analytics, high-touch clinical programs and comprehensive specialty drug solutions centered around complex conditions.
 Healthcare: The Company will leverage significant Medicaid, behavioral health, specialty healthcare and 

 
  3

 
pharmacy management experience to enhance current and develop new innovative clinical programs for complex populations or niche areas of specialty healthcare, utilizing the Company’s unique expertise to improve quality and outcomes for members served while lowering costs for our customers. 
 Engage the Company’s workforce: The Company will focus on talent acquisition, development and retention, as well as streamlining the Company’s organizational structure. Employee engagement, communication and training for employees will help ensure the workforce can meet Magellan’s evolving needs moving into the future.
 Customer Contracts
 The Company’s contracts with customers typically have terms of one to three years, and in certain cases contain renewal provisions (at the customer’s option) for successive terms of between one and two years (unless terminated earlier). Substantially all of these contracts may be immediately terminated with cause and many of the Company’s contracts are terminable without cause by the customer or the Company either upon the giving of requisite notice and the passage of a specified period of time (typically between 30 and 180 days) or upon the occurrence of other specified events. In addition, the Company’s contracts with federal, state and local governmental agencies generally are conditioned on legislative appropriations. These contracts generally can be terminated or modified by the customer if such appropriations are not made. The Company’s contracts for managed healthcare and specialty solutions services generally provide for payment of a per member per month fee to the Company. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risk‑Based Products” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Reliance on Customer Contracts.”
 The Company provides integrated healthcare services to Medicaid enrollees in the state of Florida pursuant to a contract with the State of Florida (the “Florida Contract”). The Florida Contract generated net revenues that exceeded, in aggregate, ten percent of net revenues for the consolidated Company for the year ended December 31, 2017, however not for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
 The Company also has significant concentrations of business with various counties in the State of Pennsylvania (the “Pennsylvania Counties”) which are part of the Pennsylvania Medicaid Program, with members under its contract with CMS, and with various agencies and departments of the United States federal government. See further discussion related to these significant customers in “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Reliance on Customer Contracts.” In addition, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Dependence on Government Spending” for discussion of risks to the Company related to government contracts.
 Provider Network
 The Company’s managed healthcare services are primarily provided by a contracted network of third‑party providers. The number and type of providers in a particular area depend upon customer preference, site, geographic concentration and demographic composition of the beneficiary population in that area. The Company’s network consists of approximately 220,000 healthcare providers providing various levels of care nationwide. The Company’s network providers are almost exclusively independent contractors located throughout the local areas in which the Company’s customers’ beneficiary populations reside. Outpatient network providers work out of their own offices, although the Company’s personnel are available to assist them with consultation and other needs.
 Non‑facility network providers typically execute standard contracts with the Company under which they are generally paid on a fee‑for‑service basis.
 The Company contracts with facilities on a per diem or fee‑for‑service basis and, in some limited cases, on a “case rate” or capitated basis. The contracts between the Company and inpatient and other facilities typically are for one‑year terms and are terminable by the Company or the facility upon 30 to 120 days notice.
 The Company also provides capability to support client-specific networks. Many of the Company’s clients have their own contracted networks. The Company establishes and administers these private networks segregating and reporting to the clients. In addition, the Company can lease networks on behalf of specific entities in order to enhance coverage.

The Company also has a national network of contracted retail pharmacies which is offered to its pharmacy benefit management customers. We contract with and manage these pharmacies to optimize drug cost and member access to fill covered prescriptions. Pharmacies can work with us both electronically and telephonically at the point of service for member eligibility, claim adjudication and member cost share, if applicable.
 Competition
 The Company’s business is highly competitive. The Company competes with other healthcare organizations as well as with insurance companies, including health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”), preferred provider organizations (“PPOs”), TPAs, independent practitioner associations (“IPAs”), multi‑disciplinary medical groups, PBMs, healthcare information technology companies and other specialty healthcare and managed care companies. Many of the Company’s competitors, particularly certain insurance companies, HMOs, technology companies and PBMs are significantly larger and have greater financial, marketing and other resources than the Company, and some of the Company’s competitors provide a broader range of services. The Company competes based upon quality and reliability of its services, a focus on clinical excellence, product and service innovation and proven expertise across its business lines. The Company may also encounter competition in the future from new market entrants. In addition, some of the Company’s customers that are managed care companies may seek to provide specialty managed healthcare services directly to their members, rather than subcontracting with the Company for such services. Because of these factors, the Company does not expect to be able to rely to a significant degree on price increases to achieve revenue growth, and expects to continue experiencing pricing pressures. Insurance
 The Company maintains a program of insurance coverage for a broad range of risks in its business. The Company has renewed its general, professional and managed care liability insurance policies with unaffiliated insurers for a one‑year period from June 17, 2018 to June 17, 2019. The general liability policy is written on an “occurrence” basis, subject to a $0.05 million per claim un‑aggregated self‑insured retention. The professional liability and managed care errors and omissions liability policies are written on a “claims‑made” basis, subject to a $1.0 million per claim ($10.0 million per class action claim) un‑aggregated self‑insured retention for managed care errors and omissions liability, and a $0.05 million per claim un‑aggregated self‑insured retention for professional liability.
 The Company maintains a separate general and professional liability insurance policy with an unaffiliated insurer for its specialty pharmaceutical dispensing operations. The specialty pharmaceutical dispensing operations insurance policy has a one‑year term for the period June 17, 2018 to June 17, 2019. The general liability policy is written on an “occurrence” basis and the professional liability policy is written on a “claims‑made” basis, subject to a $0.05 million per claim and $0.25 million aggregated self‑insured retention.
 The Company is responsible for claims within its self‑insured retentions, and for portions of claims reported after the expiration date of the policies if they are not renewed, or if policy limits are exceeded. The Company also purchases excess liability coverage in an amount that management believes to be reasonable for the size and profile of the organization.
 See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Professional Liability and Other Insurance,” for a discussion of the risks associated with the Company’s insurance coverage.
 Regulation
 General
 The Company’s operations are subject to extensive and evolving state and federal laws and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we do business. This includes applicable federal and state laws and regulations in connection with its role in providing pharmacy benefit management; behavioral health benefit management; radiology benefit management; utilization review; customer employee benefit plan services; pharmacy; healthcare services; Medicaid; Medicare; health insurance, and laws and regulations impacting its federal government contracts. Regulation of the healthcare industry as well as government contracting is constantly evolving, with new legislative enactments and regulatory initiatives at the state and federal levels being implemented on a regular basis. Consequently, it is possible that a court or regulatory agency may take a position under existing or future laws or regulations, or as a result of a change in 

 
  5

 
the interpretation thereof that such laws or regulations apply to the Company in a different manner than the Company believes such laws or regulations apply. In addition, existing laws and regulations may be repealed or modified. Such changes may require significant alterations to the Company’s business operations in order to comply with such laws or regulations, or interpretations thereof. Expansion of the Company’s business to cover additional geographic areas, to serve different types of customers, to provide new services or to commence new operations could also subject the Company to additional licensure requirements and/or regulation. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
 State Licensure and Regulation
 The Company is subject to certain state laws and regulations governing the licensing of insurance companies, HMOs, PPOs, TPAs, PBMs, pharmacies and companies engaged in utilization review. In addition, the Company is subject to state laws and regulations concerning the licensing of healthcare professionals, including restrictions on business corporations from providing, controlling or exercising excessive influence over healthcare services through the direct employment of physicians, psychiatrists or, in certain states, psychologists and other healthcare professionals. These laws and regulations vary considerably among states, and the Company may be subject to different types of laws and regulations depending on the specific regulatory approach adopted by each state to regulate the managed care and pharmaceutical management businesses and the provision of healthcare treatment services.
 Further, certain regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over the Company possess discretionary powers when issuing or renewing licenses or granting approval of proposed actions such as mergers, a change in ownership, and certain intra‑corporate transactions. One or multiple agencies may require as a condition of such license or approval that the Company cease or modify certain of its operations or modify the way it operates in order to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or policies. In addition, the time necessary to obtain a license or approval varies from state to state, and difficulties in obtaining a necessary license or approval may result in delays in the Company’s plans to expand operations in a particular state and, in some cases, lost business opportunities.
 The Company has sought and obtained licenses as a utilization review agent, single service HMO, TPA, PBM, Pharmacy, PPO, HMO and Health Insurance Company in one or more jurisdictions. Numerous states in which the Company does business have adopted regulations governing entities engaging in utilization review. Utilization review regulations typically impose requirements with respect to the qualifications of personnel reviewing proposed treatment, timeliness and notice of the review of proposed treatment and other matters. Many states also license TPA activities. These regulations typically impose requirements regarding claims processing and payments and the handling of customer funds. Some states require TPA licensure for PBM entities as a way to regulate the PBM lines of business.
 Other states regulate PBMs through a PBM specific license. The Company has obtained these licenses as required to support the PBM business. Certain insurance licenses are required for the Company to pursue Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D business. In some cases, single purpose HMO licenses are required for the Company to take risk on business in that state. Some states require PPO or other network licenses to offer a network of providers in the state. Almost all states require licensure for pharmacies dispensing or shipping medications into the state. The Company has obtained all of these necessary licenses.
 To the extent that the Company operates or is deemed to operate in some states as an insurance company, HMO, PPO or similar entity, it may be required to comply with certain laws and regulations that, among other things, may require the Company to maintain certain types of assets and minimum levels of deposits, capital, surplus, reserves or net worth. Being licensed as an insurance company, HMO or similar entity could also subject the Company to regulations governing reporting and disclosure, coverage, mandated benefits, rate setting, grievances and appeals, prompt pay laws and other traditional insurance regulatory requirements.
 Regulators in a few states have adopted policies that require HMOs or, in some instances, insurance companies, to contract directly with licensed healthcare providers, entities or provider groups, such as IPAs, for the provision of treatment services, rather than with unlicensed intermediary companies. In such states, the Company’s customary model of contracting directly is modified so that, for example, the IPAs (rather than the Company) contract directly with the HMO or insurance company, as appropriate, for the provision of treatment services.
 The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) has developed a “health organizations risk‑based capital” formula, designed specifically for managed care organizations, that establishes a minimum amount of 

 
  6

 
capital necessary for a managed care organization to support its overall operations, allowing consideration for the organization’s size and risk profile. The NAIC also adopted a model regulation in the area of health plan standards, which could be adopted by individual states in whole or in part, and could result in the Company being required to meet additional or new standards in connection with its existing operations. Certain states, for example, have adopted regulations based on the NAIC initiative, and as a result, the Company has been subject to certain minimum capital requirements in those states. Certain other states, such as Maryland, Texas, New York, Florida and New Jersey, have also adopted their own regulatory initiatives that subject entities, such as certain of the Company’s subsidiaries, to regulation under state insurance laws. This includes, but is not limited to, requiring adherence to specific financial solvency standards. State insurance laws and regulations may limit the Company’s ability to pay dividends, make certain investments and repay certain indebtedness.
 Regulators may impose operational restrictions on entities granted licenses to operate as insurance companies or HMOs. For example, the California Department of Managed Health Care has imposed certain restrictions on the ability of the Company’s California subsidiaries to fund the Company’s operations in other states, to guarantee or cosign for the Company’s financial obligations, or to pledge or hypothecate the stock of these subsidiaries and on the Company’s ability to make certain operational changes with respect to these subsidiaries. In addition, regulators of certain of the Company’s subsidiaries may exercise certain discretionary rights under regulations including, without limitation, increasing its supervision of such entities or requiring additional restricted cash or other security.
 Failure to obtain and maintain required licenses typically also constitutes an event of default under the Company’s contracts with its customers. The loss of business from one or more of the Company’s major customers as a result of an event of default or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Licensure requirements may increase the Company’s cost of doing business in the event that compliance requires the Company to retain additional personnel to meet the regulatory requirements and to take other required actions and make necessary filings. Although compliance with licensure regulations has not had a material adverse effect on the Company, there can be no assurance that specific laws or regulations adopted in the future would not have such a result.
 The provision of healthcare treatment services by physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists, pharmacists and other providers is subject to state regulation with respect to the licensing of healthcare professionals. The Company believes that the healthcare professionals, who provide healthcare treatment on behalf of or under contracts with the Company, and the case managers and other personnel of the health services business, are in compliance with the applicable state licensing requirements and current interpretations thereof. Regulations imposed upon healthcare providers include but are not limited to, provisions relating to the conduct of, and ethical considerations involved in, the practice of medicine, psychiatry, psychology, social work and related behavioral healthcare professions, radiology, pharmacy, privacy, accreditation, government healthcare program participation requirements, reimbursements for patient services, Medicare, Medicaid, federal and state laws governing fraud, waste and abuse and, in certain cases, the common law or statutory duty to warn others of danger or to prevent patient self‑injury or the statutory duties to report matters of abuse or neglect of individuals. However, there can be no assurance that changes in such requirements or interpretations thereof will not adversely affect the Company’s existing operations or limit expansion.
 With respect to the Company’s employee assistance crisis intervention program, additional licensing of clinicians who provide telephonic assessment or stabilization services to individuals who are calling from out‑of‑state may be required if such assessment or stabilization services are deemed by regulatory agencies to be treatment provided in the state of such individual’s residence. The Company believes that any such additional licenses could be obtained. In California, the Company’s employee assistance programs are regulated by the California Department of Managed Health Care. This subjects the Company to regulations governing reporting and disclosure, coverage, mandated benefits, grievances and appeals and other traditional insurance regulatory requirements.
 The laws of some states limit the ability of a business corporation to directly provide, control or exercise excessive influence over healthcare services through the direct employment of physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists, or other healthcare professionals, who are providing direct clinical services. In addition, the laws of some states prohibit physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists, or other healthcare professionals from splitting fees with other persons or entities. These laws and their interpretations vary from state to state and enforcement by the courts and regulatory authorities may vary from state to state and may change over time. There can be no assurance that the Company’s existing operations and its contractual arrangements with physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists and other healthcare professionals will not be successfully challenged under state laws prohibiting fee splitting or the practice of a profession by an unlicensed entity, or that the enforceability of such contractual arrangements will not be limited. The Company 

 
  7

 
believes that it could, if necessary, restructure its operations to comply with changes in the interpretation or enforcement of such laws and regulations, and that such restructuring would not have a material adverse effect on its operations.
 Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”)
 Certain of the Company’s services are subject to the provisions of ERISA. ERISA governs certain aspects of the relationship between employer‑sponsored healthcare benefit plans and certain providers of services to such plans through a series of complex laws and regulations that are subject to periodic interpretation by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and the U.S. Department of Labor (“DOL”). In some circumstances, and under certain customer contracts, the Company may be expressly named as a “fiduciary” under ERISA, or be deemed to have assumed duties that make it an ERISA fiduciary, and thus be required to carry out its operations in a manner that complies with ERISA in all material respects. In other circumstances, particularly in the administration of pharmacy benefits, the Company does not believe that its services are subject to the fiduciary obligations and requirements of ERISA. In addition, the DOL has not yet finalized guidance regarding whether discounts and other forms of remuneration from pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to be reported to ERISA‑governed plans in connection with ERISA reporting requirements.
 Numerous states require the licensing or certification of entities performing TPA activities; however, certain federal courts have held that such licensing requirements are preempted by ERISA. ERISA preempts state laws that mandate employee benefit structures or their administration, as well as those that provide alternative enforcement mechanisms. The Company believes that its TPA activities performed for its self‑insured employee benefit plan customers are exempt from otherwise applicable state licensing or registration requirements based upon federal preemption under ERISA and have relied on this general principle in determining not to seek licenses for certain of the Company’s activities in some states. Existing case law is not uniform on the applicability of ERISA preemption with respect to state regulation of PBM or TPA activities. In some states, the Company has licensed its self‑funded pharmacy related business as a TPA or PBM after a review of state regulatory requirements and case law. There can be no assurance that additional licenses will not be required with respect to utilization review or TPA activities in certain states.
 Some of the state regulatory requirements described herein may be preempted in whole or in part by ERISA, which provides for comprehensive federal regulation of employee benefit plans. However, the scope of ERISA preemption is uncertain and is subject to conflicting court rulings. As a result, the Company could be subject to overlapping federal and state regulatory requirements with respect to certain of its operations and may need to implement compliance programs that satisfy multiple regulatory regimes. There can be no assurance that continuing ERISA compliance efforts or any future changes to ERISA will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) and Other Privacy Regulation
 HIPAA contains standards relating to the transmission, privacy and security of health information by healthcare providers and healthcare plans. Confidentiality and patient privacy requirements are particularly strict in the Company’s behavioral managed care business. 
 The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH Act”), passed as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, represented a significant expansion of the HIPAA privacy and security laws. 
 HIPAA generally does not preempt state law. Therefore, because many states have privacy laws that provide more stringent privacy protections than those imposed by HIPAA, the Company must address privacy issues under those state laws as well. 
 In addition to HIPAA and the HITECH Act, the Company is also subject to federal laws and regulations governing patient records involving substance abuse treatment, as well as other federal privacy laws and regulations. 
 The European Union (“EU”) General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) became effective May 25, 2018. The Company believes its exposure to the GDPR is at present limited to EAP services to US-based companies that decide to offer EAP to their EU-based employees, which is a very small subset of the Company’s EAP line of business. The Company does not market its EAP services within the EU or to persons in the EU, or monitor the behavior of persons in the EU, and its EAP contracts with its customers are entered into in the United States with companies 

 
  8

 
established in the US. When a US customer chooses to make EAP services available to EU-based employees, the EAP services are managed through an EU-based subcontractor and EAP personal data subject to the GDPR processed by that subcontractor does not leave the EU. The Company has received contractual assurances from its subcontractor of its subcontractor’s compliance with the GDPR. Thus, the Company does not believe the GDPR at present poses material compliance risks for the Company. However, there can be no assurances that the GDPR could not be interpreted by EU supervisory authorities or courts in a manner that would require the Company to restructure its EAP services in the EU, or the GDPR could be changed or interpreted in a manner causing material adverse impact on the Company.
 Fraud, Waste and Abuse Laws
 The Company is subject to federal and state laws and regulations protecting against fraud, waste and abuse. Fraud, waste and abuse prohibitions cover a wide range of activities, including kickbacks and other inducements for referral of members or the coverage of products, billing for unnecessary services by a healthcare provider and improper marketing. Companies involved in public healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid are required to maintain compliance programs to detect and deter fraud, waste and abuse, and are often subject to audits. The regulations and contractual requirements applicable to the Company in relation to these programs are complex and subject to change.
 The federal healthcare Anti‑Kickback Statute (the “Anti‑Kickback Statute”) prohibits, among other things, an entity from paying or receiving, subject to certain exceptions and “safe harbors,” any remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce the referral of individuals covered by federally funded healthcare programs, or the purchase, or the arranging for or recommending of the purchase, of items or services for which payment may be made in whole, or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE or other federally funded healthcare programs. Sanctions for violating the Anti‑Kickback Statute may include imprisonment, criminal and civil fines and exclusion from participation in the federally funded healthcare programs. The Anti‑Kickback Statute has been interpreted broadly by courts, the Office of Inspector General (“OIG”), the Department of Health and Human Services (“DHHS”) and other administrative bodies.
 It also is a crime under the Public Contracts Anti‑Kickback Act, for any person to knowingly and willfully offer or provide any remuneration to a prime contractor to the United States, in order to obtain favorable treatment in a subcontract. Violators of this law also may be subject to civil monetary penalties. There have been a series of substantial civil and criminal investigations and settlements over the last several years in connection with alleged kickback schemes.
 The federal civil monetary penalty (“CMP”) statute provides for civil monetary penalties for any person who provides something of value to a beneficiary covered under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid, in order to influence the beneficiary’s choice of a provider. ERISA, to which certain of our customers’ services are subject, generally prohibits any person from providing to a plan fiduciary a remuneration in order to affect the fiduciary’s selection of or decisions with respect to service providers. Unlike the federal healthcare Anti‑Kickback Statute, ERISA regulations do not provide specific safe harbors and its application may be unclear.
 The Federal Civil False Claims Act imposes civil penalties for knowingly making or causing to be made false claims with respect to government contracts and governmental programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, for services not rendered, or for misrepresenting actual services rendered, in order to obtain higher reimbursement. Private individuals may bring qui tam or whistleblower suits under the Federal Civil False Claims Act, which authorizes the payment of a portion of any recovery to the individual bringing suit. 
 Further, pursuant to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), a violation of the Anti‑Kickback Statute is also a per se violation of the Federal Civil False Claims Act. The Federal Civil False Claims Act generally provides for the imposition of civil penalties and for treble damages, resulting in the possibility of substantial financial penalties for small billing discrepancies. Criminal provisions that are similar to the Federal Civil False Claims Act provide that a corporation may be fined if it is convicted of presenting to any federal agency a claim or making a statement that it knows to be false, fictitious or fraudulent. Even in situations where the Company does not directly provide services to beneficiaries of federally funded health programs and, accordingly, does not directly submit claims to the federal government, it is possible that the Company could nevertheless become involved in a situation where false claim issues are raised based on allegations that it caused or assisted a government contractor in making a false claim.
 The Company is subject to certain provisions of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (the “Act”). The Act requires entities that receive $5 million or more in annual Medicaid payments to establish written policies that provide detailed information about the Federal Civil False Claims Act and the remedies thereunder, as well as any state laws 

 
  9

 
pertaining to civil or criminal penalties for false claims and statements, the “whistleblower” protections afforded under such laws, and the role of such laws in preventing and detecting fraud, waste and abuse. The Company is also subject to The Dodd‑Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd‑Frank”). Under the law, those with independent knowledge of a financial fraud committed by a business required to report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) or the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) may be entitled to a percentage of the money recovered. Included in Dodd‑Frank are provisions which protect employees of publicly traded companies from retaliation for reporting securities fraud, fraud against shareholders and violation of the SEC rules/regulations. Dodd‑Frank also amends the Sarbanes‑Oxley Act (“SOX”) and Federal Civil False Claims Act to expand their whistleblower protections. 
 Many states have laws and/or regulations similar to the federal fraud, waste and abuse laws described above. Sanctions for violating these laws may include injunction, imprisonment, criminal and civil fines and exclusion from participation in the state Medicaid programs. The Company has a corporate compliance and ethics program, policies and procedures and internal controls in place designed to ensure that the Company conducts business appropriately. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will not be subject to scrutiny or challenge under such laws or regulations and that any such challenge would not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
 Mental Health Parity
 The Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity Act of 2008 (“MHPAEA”) establishes parity in financial requirements (e.g., co‑pays, deductibles, etc.) and treatment limitations (e.g., limits on the number of visits) between mental health and substance abuse benefits and medical/surgical benefits for health plan members. This law does not require coverage for mental health or substance abuse disorders, but if coverage is provided it must be provided at parity. No specific disorders are mandated for coverage; health plans are able to define mental health and substance abuse to determine what they are going to cover. Under the ACA, non‑grandfathered individual and small group plans (both on and off of the Health Insurance Exchange) are required to provide mental health and substance abuse disorder benefits as essential health benefits. These mandated benefits under the ACA must be provided at parity in these plans. Under the ACA, grandfathered individual plans are required to comply with parity if they offer behavioral health benefits. Grandfathered small group plans are exempt from requirements to provide essential health benefits and parity requirements. State mandated benefits laws are not preempted. The law applies to ERISA plans, Medicaid managed care plans and State Children’s Health Insurance Program (“SCHIP”) plans. On November 13, 2013 the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services issued Final Rules on the MHPAEA (“Final Rules”). The Final Rules include some concepts not included under the statute including the requirement to conduct the parity review at the category level within the plan, introducing the concept of non‑quantitative treatment limitations and prohibiting separate but equal deductibles. The Company believes it is in compliance with these requirements. In March 2016, CMS promulgated a final rule on the application of parity to Medicaid Managed Care Plans, CHIP and alternative benefit plans. The Company has been working with our state Medicaid customers on compliance with these rules. On December 7, 2016, the Congress adopted the Twenty-First Century Cures Act, which codified some concepts in the Final Rules. The Company’s risk contracts allow for repricing to occur effective the same date that any legislation/regulation becomes effective if that legislation/regulation is projected to have a material effect on cost of care. Health Care Reform
 The ACA is a broad and sweeping piece of legislation creating numerous changes in the healthcare regulatory environment. Some of the regulations interpreting the ACA, most notably the Medical Loss Ratio regulations, the Internal Claims and Appeals and External Review Processes Regulations and Health Insurance Exchanges have an impact on the Company and its business. Others, such as the regulation on dependent coverage to age 26 and coverage of preventative health services, could impact the nature of the members that we serve and the utilization rates. Medicaid expansion under the ACA has had some impact on the Company’s Medicaid business. The Company has customers that are participating in the state and federal Health Insurance Exchanges. The Company has taken necessary steps to support our customers in their administration of these plans.

The ACA also contains provisions related to fees that impact the Company’s direct public sector contracts and provisions regarding the non‑deductibility of those fees. Our state public sector customers have made rate adjustments to cover the direct costs of these fees and a majority of the impact from non‑deductibility of such fees for federal income 

 
  10

 
tax purposes. There may be some impact due to taxes paid for non‑renewing customers where the timing and amount of recoupment of these additional costs are uncertain. There can be no assurances that public sector customers may make rate adjustments to cover the direct costs of these fees in the future, so there can be no guarantees regarding this adjustment from our state public sector customers and these taxes and fees may have a material impact on the Company. 
 Federal and State Medicaid Laws and Regulations
 The Company directly contracts with various states to provide Medicaid services to states. In addition, the Company directly contracts with various states to provide Medicaid managed care services to state Medicaid beneficiaries. As such, it is subject to certain federal and state laws and regulations affecting Medicaid as well as state contractual requirements. In addition to state regulation, certain Medicaid contracts require the Company to maintain Medicare Advantage special needs plan status, which is regulated by CMS. 
 The Company also is a sub‑contractor to health plans that provide Medicaid managed care services to state Medicaid beneficiaries. In the Company’s capacity as a subcontractor with these health plans, the Company is indirectly subject to certain federal and state laws and regulations as well as contractual requirements pertaining to the operation of this business. If a state or a health plan customer determines that the Company has not performed satisfactorily as a subcontractor, the state or the health plan customer may require the Company to cease these activities or responsibilities under the subcontract. While the Company believes that it provides satisfactory levels of service under its respective subcontracts, the Company can give no assurances that a state or health plan will not terminate the Company’s business relationships insofar as they pertain to these services.
 On May 6, 2016, CMS published final regulations that significantly modified the existing federal Medicaid Managed Care and the SCHIP regulations. On June 30, 2017, CMS issued an Informational Bulletin regarding the applicable effective/compliance dates for the new Medicaid Managed Care and the SCHIP regulations. Magellan is working respectively with state Medicaid agencies and Medicaid Managed Care Plans (our Medicaid customers) to ensure ongoing compliance with those sections of the regulations that are specified as effective based on the determination made by the applicable state Medicaid agency. Nonetheless, CMS issued proposed regulations on November 14, 2018, that would modify certain parts of the 2016 regulation.

In connection with its PBM business, the Company negotiates rebates with and provides services for drug manufacturers. The manufacturers are subject to Medicaid “best price” regulations requiring essentially that the manufacturer provide its deepest level of discounts to the Medicaid program. In some instances, the government has challenged a manufacturer’s calculation of best price and we cannot be certain what effect, if any, the outcome of any such investigation or proceeding will have on our ability to negotiate favorable terms.

Medicare Laws and Regulations
 The Company is contracted with CMS as a Medicare Advantage Organization (“MAO”) and Prescription Drug Plan (“PDP”) to provide health services and prescription drug benefits to Medicare beneficiaries. The regulations and contractual requirements applicable to the Company and other participants in Medicare programs are complex and subject to change. CMS regularly audits the performance of contracted health plans to determine compliance with contracts and CMS regulations, and to assess the quality of services provided to Medicare beneficiaries. CMS penalties for noncompliance include premium refunds, civil monetary penalties, prohibiting a company from continuing to market and/or enroll members in the company’s Medicare products, exclusion from participation in federally funded healthcare programs and other sanctions. In July 2017 CMS issued a civil monetary penalty against one of the Company’s subsidiaries for non-compliance with a contractual standard outlined in its Part D contract. In February 2018 CMS issued civil monetary penalties against the same subsidiary for deficiencies cited as a result of CMS audits conducted in the 2nd and 3rd quarters of 2017. These penalties have not had a material impact on the Company or its Part D business.
      The Company is also a subcontractor to health plans that are MAOs and PDPs. In the Company’s capacity as a subcontractor with these health plans, the Company administers benefits to Medicare beneficiaries and is indirectly subject to certain federal laws and regulations, as well as contractual requirements pertaining to the operation of this business. If CMS or a health plan customer determines that the Company has not performed satisfactorily as a subcontractor, CMS or the health plan customer may require the Company to cease these activities or responsibilities under the subcontract. While the Company believes that it provides satisfactory levels of service under its respective 

 
  11

 
subcontracts, the Company can give no assurances that CMS or a health plan will not terminate the Company’s business relationships with respect to these services.
     CMS requires Part D Plans to report all price concessions received for PBM services. The applicable CMS guidance requires Part D Plans to contractually require the right to audit their PBMs as well as require full transparency as to manufacturer rebates and administrative fees paid for drugs or services provided in connection with the sponsor’s plan, including the portion of such rebates retained by the PBM. Additionally, CMS requires Part D Plans to ensure through their contractual arrangements with first tier, downstream and related entities (which would include PBMs) that CMS has access to such entities’ books and records pertaining to services performed in connection with Part D Plans. The CMS regulations also suggests that Part D Plans should contractually require their first tier, downstream and related entities (subcontractors) to comply with certain elements of the Part D Plan’s compliance program. The Company has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that such disclosure and auditing requirements, to the extent required by its Part D Plan partners, will have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s business.
 The Company expects CMS and the U.S. Congress to continue to closely scrutinize each component of the Medicare program, modify the terms and requirements of the program and possibly seek to modify private insurers’ role. Therefore, it is not possible to predict the outcome of any Congressional or regulatory activity, either of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
 Federal and State Requirements related to Quality and Service Metrics Under Medicare and Medicaid Contracts

The Company’s Medicare and Medicaid business is subject to various quality and performance measures. Failure to maintain satisfactory quality and performance measures may negatively affect the Company’s premium rates, subject it to penalties, limit or reduce membership, impede the Company’s ability to compete for new business in existing or new markets or result in the termination of its contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, rate of growth and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 

Quality scores are used by certain regulatory agencies to establish premium rates and/or calculate performance incentives. In the case of CMS, for example, quality-based metrics are used to pay quality bonuses to Medicare Advantage plans that enable high scoring plans to offer enhanced health benefits for their MA beneficiaries. 

Medicare Advantage plans and Medicare Prescription Drug Plans (together, “MA Plans”) with Star Ratings of four (4.0) stars or higher are eligible for year-round open enrollment; conversely, plans with lower Star Ratings have more restricted times for enrollment of beneficiaries. MA Plans with Star Ratings of less than three (3.0) stars in three consecutive years are denoted as "low performing" plans on the CMS website and in the CMS "Medicare and You" handbook. In addition, CMS recently had its authority to terminate MA Plan contracts for plans rated below three (3.0) stars in three consecutive years reinstated. CMS may begin terminations of low rated MA Plans beginning with plan year 2023. As a result, MA Plans that achieve higher Star Ratings may have a competitive advantage over plans with lower Star Ratings. As a result, lower quality scores/Star ratings compared to our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business, rate of growth, results of operation, financial condition, or cash flows. 

For certain state Medicaid programs, plans that do not meet applicable quality and service measures may be subject to a range of penalties including being placed on a corrective action plan, denial of quality performance incentives, financial sanctions, reduction in capitation, enrollment limitations or termination of contract. We are unable to predict with any certainty what actions a state may take, if any, when assessing our contractual performance. 

Failure to maintain satisfactory quality and service measures could also adversely affect our ability to establish new health plans or expand the business of our existing health plans. In addition, lower quality scores or Star ratings, when compared to our competitors, may adversely affect our ability to attract members and obtain regulatory approval for acquisitions or expansions, including expansion of Medicare Advantage health plans, or succeed in competitive bidding situations. 
     Other Federal and State Laws and Regulations
 Federal Laws and Regulations affecting Procurement. In addition to the laws and regulations cited in the 

 
  12

 
section entitled Fraud, Waste and Abuse laws above, the Company is subject to other federal laws and regulations in connection with its contracts with the federal government. These laws and regulations affect how the Company conducts business with its federal agency customers and may impose added costs on its business. The Company’s failure to comply with federal procurement laws and regulations could cause it to lose business, incur additional costs and subject it to a variety of civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, harm to reputation, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from doing business with federal government agencies. The Company conducts business with federal agency customers and federal contractors to such agencies. 
 The Company is investigating, with the assistance of outside counsel, matters relating to compliance by AFSC with Small Business Administration ( “SBA”) regulations and other federal laws applicable to government contractors and has reported findings to the SBA and the Department of Defense, including facts indicating violations of SBA regulations and other federal laws, such as the Anti-Kickback Act, by former AFSC executives, none of which was disclosed to Magellan prior to its acquisition of AFSC. The Company is voluntarily responding to government requests for further information regarding the Company’s investigation. Contingencies, if any, arising from the results of this investigation and self-reporting could require us to record balance sheet liabilities or accrue expenses, the amount of which we are not able to currently estimate. While the Company believes that it has responded appropriately by self-reporting findings regarding matters that incepted prior to its acquisition of AFSC in order to mitigate the risk of adverse consequences, should the SBA, Department of Defense and/or other federal agencies seek to hold the Company or AFSC responsible for the reported conduct, we may be required to pay damages and/or penalties and AFSC could be suspended or debarred from government contracting. For 2017 and 2018 AFSC’s total revenue comprised approximately 3% and 2%, respectively, of the total revenues of the Company.
 The Company also provides services to various state Medicaid programs. Services procurement related to Medicaid programs is governed in part by federal regulations because the federal government provides a substantial amount of funding for the services. The Company’s State customers risk loss of federal funding if the Company is not in compliance with federal regulations. The Company’s non‑compliance may also lead to unanticipated, negative financial consequences including corrective action plans or contract default risks. 
 FDA Regulation. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) generally has authority to regulate drug promotional activities that are performed “by or on behalf of” a drug manufacturer. The Company provides certain consulting and related services to drug manufacturers, and there can be no assurance that the FDA will not attempt to assert jurisdiction over certain aspects of the Company’s activities. The impact of future FDA regulation could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
 State PBM Regulation. States continue to introduce broad legislation to regulate PBM activities. This legislation encompasses some of the services offered by the Company’s PBM business. Legislation in this area is varied and encompasses licensing, audit provisions, network access, recoupment of funds, submission of claims data to state all payor claims databases, potential fiduciary duties, pass through of cost savings and disclosure obligations, including the disclosure of information regarding the company’s maximum allowable cost pricing with pharmacies. In some circumstances, claims or inquiries against PBMs have been asserted under state consumer protection laws, which exist in most states. The Company has obtained licenses as necessary to support current business and future opportunities. The various state laws do not appear to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s pharmaceutical management business. However, the Company can give no assurance that these and other states will not enact legislation with more adverse consequences in the near future; nor can the Company be certain that future regulations or interpretations of existing laws will not adversely affect its business.
 State Legislation Affecting Plan or Benefit Design. Some states have enacted legislation that prohibits certain types of managed care plan sponsors from implementing certain restrictive formulary and network design features, and many states have legislation regulating various aspects of managed care plans, including provisions relating to pharmacy benefits. Other states mandate coverage of certain benefits or conditions and require health plan coverage of specific drugs, if deemed medically necessary by the prescribing physician. Such legislation does not generally apply to the Company directly, but may apply to certain clients of the Company, such as HMOs and health insurers. These types of laws would generally have an adverse effect on the ability of a PBM to reduce cost for its plan sponsor customers.
 Prompt Pay Laws. Under Medicare Part D and some state laws, the Company or customer may be required to pay network pharmacies within certain time periods and/or by electronic transfer instead of by check. The shorter time 

 
  13

 
periods may negatively impact our cash flow. We cannot predict whether additional states will enact some form of prompt pay legislation.

Legislation and Regulation Affecting Drug Price and Rebates. Specialty pharmaceutical manufacturers generally report various price metrics to the federal government, including “average sales price” (“ASP”), “average manufacturer price” (“AMP”) and “best price” (“BP”). The Company does not calculate these price metrics, but the Company notes that the ASP, AMP and BP methodologies may create incentives for some drug manufacturers to reduce the levels of discounts or rebates available to purchasers, including the Company, or their clients with respect to specialty drugs. Any changes in the guidance affecting pharmaceutical manufacturer price metric calculations could materially adversely affect the Company’s business.
 Additionally, most of the Company’s pharmacy benefit management and dispensing contracts with its customers use “average wholesale price” (“AWP”) as a benchmark for establishing pricing. At least one major third party publisher of AWP pricing data has ceased to publish such data in the past few years, and there can be no guarantee that AWP will continue to be an available pricing metric in the future. The discontinuance of AWP reporting by one data source has not had a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and the Company expects that were AWP data to no longer be available, other equitable pricing measures would be available to avoid a material adverse impact on the Company’s business. Separately, on a monthly basis CMS publishes the National Average Drug Acquisition Cost (“NADAC”), a data set that purports to provide the average acquisition cost of retail drugs based on a nationwide voluntary survey of retail pharmacies. At this time, the Company does not anticipate that NADAC will materially adversely impact its operations, but it is too early to speculate what impact, if any, such a reimbursement shift might have in pharmacy reimbursement and/or costs in the future.

On February 6, 2019, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General published a proposed rule which would remove the anti-kickback regulatory safe harbor protection for prescription drug rebates paid by manufacturers to plan sponsors under Medicare Part D and Medicaid managed care. It also would create a new safe harbor protection for price discounts between manufacturers and PBMs if given at the point-of-sale (“POS”). Comments on the proposed rule are due April 8, 2019. This proposed rule would apply only to Medicare Part D and Medicaid managed care, and not commercial rebates. While we do not believe the proposed rule would have a material adverse impact on our business, President Trump in his State of the Union speech on February 6, 2019 also proposed that Congress adopt laws to control drug prices and other related measures, which could materially and adversely affect our commercial pharmacy benefits management rebate business.
 Regulations Affecting the Company’s Pharmacies. The Company owns three pharmacies that provide services primarily to members of certain of the Company’s health plan customers. The activities undertaken by the Company’s pharmacies subject the pharmacies to state and federal statutes and regulations governing, among other things, the licensure and operation of mail order and nonresident pharmacies, repackaging of drug products, stocking of prescription drug products and dispensing of prescription drug products, including controlled substances. The Company’s pharmacy facilities are located in Florida and Utah, and are duly licensed to conduct business in those states. Almost all states, however, require out‑of‑state mail order pharmacies to register with or be licensed by the state board of pharmacy or similar governing body when pharmaceuticals are delivered by mail into the state, and some states require that an out‑of‑state pharmacy employ a pharmacist that is licensed in the state into which pharmaceuticals are shipped. The Company holds mail order and nonresident pharmacy licenses where required. The Company also maintains Medicare and Medicaid provider licenses where required for the pharmacies to provide services to these plans. In some states, the Company is not able to obtain Medicaid licenses to dispense because those states require that the pharmacy have a physical location in the state to participate in the Medicaid network.
 Regulation of Controlled Substances. The Company’s pharmacies must register with the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (the “DEA”) and individual state-controlled substance authorities in order to dispense controlled substances. Federal law requires the Company to comply with the DEA’s security, recordkeeping, inventory control and labeling standards in order to dispense controlled substances. State controlled substance law requires registration and compliance with state pharmacy licensure, registration or permit standards promulgated by the state pharmacy licensing authority and in some states drug database reporting requirements.
 Employees of the Registrant
 At December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately 10,500 full‑time and part‑time employees.
