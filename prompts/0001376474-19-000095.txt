Item 1. Business
Company Overview
 The Company was incorporated on December 26, 1995 in the state of Nevada as Kayenta Kreations, Inc. In connection with a merger in 2008, the Company changed its name to Geospatial Holdings, Inc., and in 2013, changed its name to Geospatial Corporation (“we” or the “Company”). The Company has one wholly-owned subsidiary, Geospatial Mapping Systems, Inc., which serves as the Company’s operating unit. Our corporate headquarters are located in Sarver, Pennsylvania at 229 Howes Run Road.
 General Description of the Business
 We are a Pennsylvania based technology company. Our core business is the provision of proven cloud-based geospatial solutions to accurately locate and digitally map in three dimensions (“3D”) underground pipelines and other infrastructure. We compete in the software industry within the cloud-

based infrastructure mapping industry. Our professional staff offers the expertise, ability and technologies required to design and execute innovative, challenging solutions that push the Company to the forefront of the cloud-based infrastructure mapping industry. Geospatial Corporation is steadfastly committed to our mission – “To provide our clients with an unparalleled 3D understanding of the world’s underground infrastructure”.
 We carefully listen to each client’s precise needs and provide unique and innovative technological solutions to locate, map and manage our clients’ critical infrastructure data. Our clear communication and time-tested technical expertise enable us to think outside the box as we provide underground infrastructure mapping solutions to benefit our clients and the community.
 We provide two types of services to our clients, data acquisition and data management. Data acquisition entails utilizing various technologies to accurately locate the exact position and depth of underground pipelines and conduits along with information on existing aboveground infrastructure. We provide data management services in which we securely manage this critical infrastructure data through the licensing of our cloud-based GeoUnderground Geographic Information System (“GIS”) software.
 Product Development and Introduction
 The GIS technology and mapping industry is characterized by rapid technological change in computer hardware, operating systems and software. In addition, consumers’ requirements and preferences rapidly evolve, as do their expectations of the performance of their software and the accuracy of the collected data managed by their software. To keep pace with these changes, we maintain a vigorous program of new product development to address demands in the marketplace for our products. Just as the transition from mainframes to personal computers transformed the industry thirty years ago, we believe our industry is undergoing a similar transition from the personal computer to cloud, social and mobile information management and sharing.
 We have dedicated considerable technical and financial resources to research and development to further enhance our existing products and to create new software products and data acquisition technologies. Our software is primarily developed internally. However, we also use independent firms or contractors to perform some of our product development activities.
 Sales and Marketing Efforts
 Along with GeoUnderground, we now provide a cloud-based infrastructure management solution to our clients, which include utilities, municipalities, government agencies, and other facilities. Over the past few years, due to financial constraints, the majority of our sales have resulted from word-of-mouth referrals. We have not had a formal marketing or sales program over the past five years.
 We hope to establish Regional Technical Sales Managers (“RTSMs”) in various sales regions across the United States, Canada, the Middle East, and Australia. Each RTSM will be responsible for developing and implementing a sales program which meets our specific targets. As business is developed in each sales region, we expect field technicians to be assigned to work under each RTSM to assist the RTSM in performing pipeline mapping services.
 We would like to engage in direct-sale marketing efforts, whereby we will require that each of our RTSMs establish relationships and schedule webinar meetings with GIS and utilities managers, engineering companies, major utility companies and major utility contractors within each of their respective sales regions in order to demonstrate our data acquisition technologies, GeoUnderground, and its associated benefits. We also intend to demonstrate the use and functionality of GeoUnderground at numerous national and regional trade shows sponsored by related industry groups. In addition, we will expect each RTSM to generate sales leads through social media and webinars.
 Financing
 From January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2018, we raised approximately $1.1 million in cash through the private sale of our common stock and exercises of warrants to purchase common stock. In addition, during that period we issued common stock for services totaling approximately $334,000. We

intend to continue to sell our common stock in private transactions to fund our general working capital needs.
 Intellectual Property and Licenses
 We maintain a program to legally protect our investment in technology through a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret protections, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions. The nature and extent of legal protection associated with each such intellectual property right depends on, among other things, the type of intellectual property right and the given jurisdiction in which such right arises. We believe our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business.
 Nonetheless, our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. Enforcement of intellectual property rights against alleged infringers can sometimes lead to costly litigation and counterclaims. Our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business. We retain ownership of all software we develop.
 We believe that because of the limitations of laws protecting our intellectual property and the rapid, ongoing technological changes in data collection and GIS software industries, we must rely principally upon data acquisition enhancements, GIS software engineering and marketing skills to maintain and enhance our competitive market position.
 Customers
 To date, we have successfully completed approximately 285 projects for a varied group of clients including contractors, municipalities, government agencies, utilities, telecoms, and engineering companies.
 Government Contracts
 We expect that some of our contracts will be with federal and state government entities. These contracts may be subject to various procurement laws and regulations. If we do not comply with these laws and regulations, we may be prohibited from completing our existing government contracts or suspended from government contracting and subcontracting for some period of time. In addition, through our government contracts, we are subject to routine U.S. federal, state and local government audits. If audit findings are unfavorable, we could experience a reduction in our profitability. We are subject to audits for several years after payments for services have been received. Based on these audits, government entities may adjust or seek reimbursement for previously paid amounts.
Competition
 The markets for our products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid change. We strive to increase our competitive standing by investing in research and development, allowing us to enhance our software and data collection capabilities. We also compete by investing in marketing and sales to more effectively reach new and existing customers.
 Our business is highly competitive with respect to pipeline asset management services. While we believe that our proprietary technologies provide advantages to our clients, we will compete with numerous public and private engineering firms that provide some or all of the services that we provide. Our competitors range from large national and international firms, such as Parsons Brinkerhoff Inc., CH2M Hill Companies, PBS&J, Tetra Tech, Dycom Industries, Inc., Consolidated Utility Services, Inc., URS Corporation and CDM, to a vast number of smaller, more localized firms.
 The software industry has limited barriers to entry, and the availability of computing power with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry. The GIS industry is presently undergoing a platform shift from the personal computer to cloud and mobile computing. This shift lowers the barriers to entry and poses a disruptive challenge to established GIS software companies. In addition, some of our competitors in certain markets have greater financial, technical, sales and marketing and other resources than we do. Because of these and other factors, competitive conditions in our industry are likely to continue to intensify in the future. Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share, any of which could harm our business.

We believe that the principal competitive factors (in the order of importance) in the areas of services we offer are: (i) quality of available technologies and software, (ii) quality of service, (iii) reputation, (iv) experience, (v) technical proficiency, (vi) local geographic presence, and (vii) cost of service. We believe that we are well positioned to compete effectively by emphasizing the quality and proprietary nature of our technologies and the quality of services that we offer. We are also dependent upon the availability of staff and our ability to recruit qualified management professionals and technicians. A shortage of qualified technical professionals currently exists in the engineering/GIS industry in the United States.
 Seasonality
 It is possible that our contract revenue and income from operations may be slightly lower for our first fiscal quarter than for the remaining quarters due to the effect of winter weather conditions, particularly in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions of the United States. Our GIS/data management activities should not be as directly impacted by seasonal weather conditions.
Personnel
 We believe that our success will greatly depend on our ability to identify, attract and retain capable employees. As of April 8, 2018, we had seven employees, all of whom are full-time employees. We believe that our relations with these employees are good. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or otherwise represented under a collective bargaining agreement.
Environmental Compliance
 As our services are applicable to a large number of pipeline industry segments, we will be working, in many cases, in and around environmentally-sensitive areas, and with pipeline materials that may require specific environmental training and strict environmental procedures and guidelines. Failure to comply with these federal, state, or local environmental regulations could result in substantial penalties or fines. We have not incurred any material costs of environmental regulations during 2018 or 2017.
 The enactment of various federal, state, and local environmental regulations, and variations in federal, state, and local funding for environmental compliance and enforcement of these regulations may have an effect on the capital expenditures of our clients, and thus may affect our ability to generate revenue.
 Description of Property
 Our headquarters office is located in Sarver, Pennsylvania at 229 Howes Run Road. This building, which we lease from Mark A. Smith, the Company’s Chairman/CEO, has approximately 3,200 square feet of office space and is used by our corporate and operations staff. This property is rented under a month-to-month lease at $6,500 per month. Mr. Smith agreed to suspend collection of rent effective April 1, 2016.
 We believe that the Company’s existing facilities are adequate to meet its business needs for the foreseeable future.
 Legal Proceedings
 The Company is subject to various claims and legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities. We believe that any liability that may ultimately result from the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or the results of operations of the Company.
