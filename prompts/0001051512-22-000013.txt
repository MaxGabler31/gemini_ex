Item 1. Business
Telephone and Data Systems, Inc. (TDS) provides high-quality communications services to customers with 5.0 million wireless connections and 1.2 million wireline and cable connections at December 31, 2021. TDS conducts all of its wireless operations through its majority-owned subsidiary, United States Cellular Corporation (UScellular). As of December 31, 2021, TDS owned 82% of the combined total of the outstanding Common Shares and Series A Common Shares of UScellular and controlled 96% of the combined voting power of both classes of UScellular common stock. TDS provides broadband, video and voice services through its wholly-owned subsidiaries TDS Telecommunications LLC and TDS Broadband LLC (collectively, TDS Telecom). TDS Common Shares trade under the ticker symbol “TDS” on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). UScellular Common Shares trade on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “USM.”
Under listing standards of the NYSE, TDS is a “controlled company” as such term is defined by the NYSE. TDS is a controlled company because over 50% of the voting power for the election of directors of TDS is held by the trustees of the TDS Voting Trust.
During the first quarter of 2021, TDS modified its reporting segment structure to combine its Wireline and Cable segments into a single reportable segment for TDS Telecom. TDS Telecom believes this presentation better articulates its progress and performance against its strategy, which includes a focus on overall broadband growth and future fiber deployment across its markets. This change also reflects TDS Telecom's progress in aligning its organizational, operational and support structures to leverage one cost base to better support its customers across all of its markets. Prior periods have been updated to conform to this revised presentation.
TDS has two business segments: UScellular and TDS Telecom. TDS operations also include the operations of its wholly-owned hosted and managed services (HMS) subsidiary, which operates under the OneNeck IT Solutions brand, and its wholly-owned subsidiary Suttle-Straus, Inc. (Suttle-Straus). HMS' and Suttle-Straus’ financial results were not significant to TDS’ operations. TDS operates entirely in the United States. See Note 19 — Business Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about TDS' segments.
The map below highlights TDS’ consolidated areas of operations:
UScellular OPERATIONS
General
UScellular provides wireless telecommunications services to customers with 5.0 million connections in portions of 21 states collectively representing a total population of 32 million. UScellular operates in one reportable segment, and all of its wireless operating markets are in the United States. 
Operating Strategy and Community Focus
UScellular’s strategy is to attract and retain customers through a value proposition comprising a high-quality network, outstanding customer service, and competitive devices, plans and pricing - all provided with a community focus. 
UScellular operates a regional wireless network. UScellular’s interests in wireless spectrum licenses include both direct interests whereby UScellular is the licensee and investment interests in entities which are licensees; together, these direct and investment interests involve operating and non-operating wireless spectrum licenses covering portions of 30 states and a total population of approximately 51 million at December 31, 2021.
As part of its business development strategy, UScellular may periodically be engaged in negotiations relating to strategic partnerships and/or the acquisition, exchange or disposition of companies, strategic properties, investment interests or wireless spectrum, including through Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auctions. The FCC conducts auctions through which additional spectrum is made available for the provision of wireless services. Historically, UScellular has participated in certain FCC auctions both directly and indirectly through its limited partnership interests. 
UScellular has a longstanding commitment to supporting its local communities through donations and volunteerism. UScellular focuses its Corporate Social Responsibility program on addressing gaps in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) education and connecting tomorrow’s innovators with the resources they need today to help shape their future opportunities. UScellular serves its local communities through exclusive partnerships with acclaimed national nonprofit partners. In 2021, UScellular continued exploring ways to leverage its assets, brand, partnerships, and resources to begin to close the digital divide with a focus on helping to ensure youth in its markets have reliable and fast internet access in school and at home. UScellular continues to contribute to the TDS Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) program. UScellular believes in serving as a good steward of the environment and enacting governance practices that align with its corporate values and commitment to its customers, associates and its communities.
Customers, Services, Products and Seasonality
Customers. UScellular focuses on consumer, business and government customers located in its operating markets. These customers are served primarily through UScellular’s retail and direct sales channels. 
Services. UScellular provides a wide variety of wireless services accessible on a broad range of devices. Customers can obtain wireless services on a postpaid or prepaid basis. A single account may include monthly wireless services for a variety of handsets and connected devices. A postpaid connection represents an individual line of service for a device for which a customer is generally billed one month in advance for a monthly access charge in return for access to and usage of network services. UScellular’s prepaid service enables individuals to obtain services without credit verification by paying for all services in advance. Approximately 90% of retail connections were postpaid connections as of December 31, 2021.
UScellular offers various service plans with nationwide coverage tailored to the needs of customers. Depending on those needs at a particular time, service plans may include features related to, among other things: unlimited or metered voice and data; high definition video features; the ability to use a device as a Wi-Fi hotspot; international voice, text, and data; and varying data rates depending on the plan and usage on that plan. Service offerings vary from time to time based on customer needs, technology changes and market conditions - and may be provided as standard plans or as part of limited time promotional offers.
UScellular offers advanced wireless solutions to consumers and business and government customers, including a fast-growing and expansive suite of connected Internet of things (IoT) solutions and software applications across the categories of monitor and control (e.g., sensors and cameras), business automation/operations (e.g., e-forms, office solutions), communication (e.g., enterprise messaging, back-up router for business continuity services), fleet and asset management, smart water solutions, private cellular networks and custom, bespoke end-to-end IoT solutions et al. Additionally, for first responders, UScellular offers both Wireless Priority Services (WPS) and Quality Priority and Preemption (QPP) options. UScellular intends to continue to further enhance these offerings for customers in 2022 and beyond. 
Products. UScellular offers a comprehensive range of devices such as smartphones and other handsets, tablets, wearables, mobile hotspots, routers, and IoT devices. In addition, UScellular also offers a wide range of accessories, including wireless essentials such as cases, screen protectors, chargers, memory cards and consumer electronics such as audio, home automation and networking products. UScellular allows customers to purchase certain devices and accessories on installment plans, allowing for customers to pay over a specified period of time.
UScellular also offers services that enable customers to replace or repair their devices, including the Device Protection+ program, which provides as soon as next-day delivery of a replacement device for damaged, lost and stolen devices, and AppleCare services for Apple iOS customers. UScellular's Device Protection+ Advanced program also includes local or on-demand repair for eligible devices. In addition, UScellular offers a Trade-In program through which UScellular buys customers' used equipment.
UScellular purchases devices and accessory products from a number of original equipment manufacturers and distributors. UScellular manages relationships with its suppliers to ensure best possible pricing and identifies opportunities for promotional support from its suppliers. UScellular does not own significant product warehousing and distribution infrastructure; rather, it contracts with third party providers for the majority of its product warehousing, distribution and direct customer fulfillment activities. UScellular also contracts with third party providers for services related to its device service programs.
Seasonality. Seasonality in operating expenses may cause operating income to vary from quarter to quarter. UScellular’s operating expenses tend to be higher in the fourth quarter due to increased marketing and promotional activities during the holiday season.
Sales and Distribution Channels
UScellular supports a multi-faceted distribution program, including retail sales, direct sales, telesales, ecommerce, indirect sales, independent agents and third-party national retailers.
Company retail store locations are designed to market wireless services and products to the consumer and small business segments in a setting familiar to these types of customers. Direct sales representatives and the indirect channel sell traditional wireless services as well as IoT and other specialized products and solutions to medium and large-sized businesses and governmental entities. Additionally, the telesales and ecommerce channels enable customers to purchase services and devices via phone and online, respectively.
UScellular has relationships with exclusive and non-exclusive agents (collectively “agents”), which are independent businesses that obtain customers for UScellular on a commission basis. UScellular provides support and training to its agents to increase customer satisfaction and to ensure a consistent customer experience. UScellular’s agents are generally in the business of selling wireless devices, wireless service plans and other related products.
In order to expand its retail presence, UScellular also maintains relationships with national retailers. National retailers sell prepaid devices, and some also sell postpaid devices.
Competition
The wireless telecommunication industry is highly competitive. UScellular competes directly with several wireless service providers in each of its markets. In general, there are between two and four competitors in each wireless market in which UScellular provides service, excluding resellers and mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs). In its footprint, UScellular competes to varying degrees against each of the national wireless companies: Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile USA, and an emerging Dish as the fourth national carrier, in addition to smaller regional carriers, cable and other MVNOs in specific areas of its footprint. In addition, UScellular competes with other companies that use alternative communication technology and services to provide similar services and products.
Since each of these competitors operates on systems using spectrum licensed by the FCC and has comparable technology and facilities, competition among wireless service providers for customers is principally on the basis of types of services and products, price, size of area covered, network quality, network speed and responsiveness of customer service. Types of services and products include non–wireless related services such as content offerings that are bundled with wireless services. 
Technology
Network Technology. Wireless telecommunication systems transmit voice and data signals over networks of radio towers using radio spectrum licensed by the FCC. Access to local, regional, national and worldwide telecommunications networks is provided through system interconnections. A high-quality network, supported by continued investments in that network, is an important factor for UScellular to remain competitive.
UScellular continues to devote efforts to enhance its network capabilities. UScellular has completed its deployment of VoLTE technology. VoLTE technology allows customers to utilize a 4G LTE network for both voice and data services and offers enhanced services such as high definition voice and simultaneous voice and data sessions. 
5G technology helps address customers’ growing demand for data services and creates opportunities for new services, including high-speed fixed wireless home internet services, requiring high speed and reliability as well as low latency. UScellular's 5G deployment is initially focused on mobility services using its low band spectrum. UScellular has acquired high-band and mid-band spectrum, which it will deploy in the future to further enable the delivery of 5G services. UScellular has launched commercial 5G services in portions of substantially all of its markets and will continue to launch in additional areas in the coming years.
Roaming. Inter-carrier roaming agreements are negotiated between wireless operators to enable customers to use wireless services outside of their home service area. UScellular has entered into 4G LTE and VoLTE roaming agreements with national wireless companies and, as a result, customers have access to these services on a nationwide basis. In addition, UScellular offers a variety of international roaming options and launched 5G roaming in 2021.
TDS TELECOM OPERATIONS
General
TDS Telecom provides communications services to 1.2 million connections in 32 states. TDS Telecom operates in one reportable segment, and its operating markets are located in a mix of more than 1,100 rural and suburban communities throughout the United States. TDS Telecom operates as an Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (ILEC), Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (CLEC), and as a cable company. TDS Telecom is also investing in a fiber-to-the-home program in new markets to expand its network and drive growth.
Operating Strategy and Community Focus
TDS Telecom’s strategy is to be the preferred broadband provider in the markets it serves. TDS Telecom invests in high-quality networks, services and products, with the constant focus on delivering a best-in-class customer experience. Through its investments, TDS Telecom intends to grow its broadband services in its incumbent markets and by expanding its footprint into new markets. TDS Telecom will augment that broadband growth by bundling with video and voice services to build customer loyalty. 
A key strategic initiative for TDS Telecom is investing in fiber in incumbent and expansion markets to provide broadband speeds of up to 2 Gigabits per second (Gbps). Increased fiber deployment provides the opportunity to deliver more robust residential and commercial products which drives future growth and returns. Fiber builds in strategically selected locations allow TDS Telecom to target attractive, growing markets to increase its total footprint. TDS Telecom continues to scale up its fiber market expansions in Wisconsin, the Pacific Northwest and North Carolina since first beginning with a trial market in Wisconsin in 2017. TDS Telecom may also seek to grow its operations through the acquisition of businesses that support and complement its existing markets or by creating entirely new clusters of markets in attractive locations. 
TDS Telecom believes that being a good corporate citizen is fundamental to its long-term success. TDS Telecom is committed to growing with its communities and meeting the needs of customers through great products and services, sponsorships, fundraising, and volunteering. TDS Telecom serves its local communities by financially supporting local projects to serve those in need and by providing TDS Telecom associates with paid time off each year to volunteer. TDS Telecom believes serving its local communities through donations and volunteerism aligns with its corporate values and commitments to its customers, associates, and communities.
Technology
TDS Telecom continues to upgrade and enhance its networks by utilizing various technologies to increase levels of performance and provide additional speed and security to increase value for its customers. The network is transitioning from its legacy circuit-switched network to a highly reliable IP-based broadband network to facilitate the integration of broadband, video and voice services.
In order to provide IP-based services, TDS Telecom has developed and deployed an inter-regional data routing infrastructure using owned and leased fiber capacity which allows it to leverage its 100-gigabit core network. This configuration, along with the continued development of an IP network that interconnects substantially all the existing service territories, provides redundancy and allows for next generation IP service offerings.
TDS Telecom utilizes centralized monitoring and management of its core network to reduce costs and improve service reliability. TDS Telecom continues to standardize equipment and processes to increase efficiency in maintaining its network. Network standardization has aided TDS Telecom in operating its 24-hours-a-day/7-days-per-week Network Management Centers, which continuously monitor the network to proactively identify, minimize, and correct network faults prior to any customer impact. 
Customers, Services and Products
Residential. TDS Telecom residential customer operations provide high-speed broadband, video and voice services. These services are bundled at competitive prices to encourage cross-selling within the customer base and to attract new customers. Approximately 62% of residential customers have at least two services. 
•Broadband: TDS Telecom offers reliable high-speed internet connections and all-home Wi-Fi. Fiber technology is being deployed to select markets to provide internet speeds of up to 2 Gbps. In certain non-fiber markets, TDS Telecom is deploying fiber-to-the-node and copper-based vectoring/pair bonding technology to increase data speeds reaching up to 100 Mbps. DOCSIS 3.1 technology is utilized across nearly all cable markets and offers speeds of up to 1 Gbps. Premium security and support services are available to enhance customers’ high-speed internet experience.
•Video: TDS Telecom provides advanced home TV entertainment that includes basic channels and premium programming available in high-definition television combined with a digital video recording (DVR) service. TDS Telecom offers an integrated cloud television platform called TDS TV+ which enhances the customer experience by combining linear and non-linear programming, adding interfaces to mobile devices, personalized content recommendations, and network-based DVR functionality. TDS TV+ offers video content and features not available on existing TDS platforms. In certain markets, TDS Telecom partners with a satellite TV provider to offer digital television.
•Voice: Call plans include local and long-distance telephone service, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and enhanced services like Find-Me/Follow-Me, collaboration, instant messaging and more. Many features are bundled with calling plans to give customers the best value. Voice offerings continue to be impacted by the industry-wide decline in access lines and TDS Telecom expects to continue to experience erosion in voice connections due to competition from alternative technologies.
Commercial. TDS Telecom commercial customer operations provide secure and reliable broadband, IP-based services, and hosted voice and video collaboration services to small- and medium-sized businesses. TDS Telecom's commercial service focus is to lead with broadband bundled with a voice product and video solution.
Wholesale. TDS Telecom’s wholesale market focus is on access revenues, which is the compensation received from the interexchange carriers for carrying data and voice traffic on TDS Telecom’s networks. Federal Connect America Fund (CAF), including A-CAM, and state Universal Service Fund (USF) revenues, which support the cost of providing communication services in underserved high- cost areas, are also included in wholesale service revenues.
Marketing, Sales and Distribution Channels and Customer Service
Marketing. TDS Telecom’s marketing plan is focused on acquiring, retaining and growing customer relationships by maintaining a high-quality network, providing outstanding customer service, and offering a comprehensive portfolio of services and products built around customer needs at fair prices with a local focus. TDS Telecom uses door-to-door selling, digital marketing, targeted mailings and mass advertising to market services and products. TDS Telecom differentiates itself from competitors using a hyper-localized sales and marketing effort to maximize broadband penetration. This approach utilizes area specific marketing plans and community events combined with a bundling strategy.
Sales and Distribution Channels. TDS Telecom operates and uses sales contact centers, direct sales forces, retail stores, sales agents and an online platform to sell services and products.
Customer Service. TDS Telecom manages customer retention by focusing on outstanding customer service through extensive training of front-line sales and support associates. 
Competition
TDS Telecom faces broadband, video, and voice competition from other wireline and cable providers, fiber overbuilders, VoIP providers, satellite providers, wireless providers and providers using other emerging technologies. TDS Telecom also competes with other fiber overbuilders to be the first provider to identify and develop potential expansion markets.
TDS Telecom continues to develop and maintain an efficient cost structure to ensure that it can compete with price-based initiatives from competitors. In addition to price, TDS Telecom competes based on a variety of factors including the reliability of its network, the diversity and range of its product offerings and its exceptional customer service. Finally, TDS Telecom is selecting markets in order to grow in areas where it has determined customers are underserved in terms of these criteria.
TDS — REGULATION
TDS’ operations are subject to federal, state and local regulation. Key regulatory considerations are discussed below.
UScellular
The construction, operation and transfer of wireless systems in the United States are regulated to varying degrees by the FCC pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Communications Act). The FCC currently does not require wireless carriers to comply with a number of statutory provisions otherwise applicable to common carriers that provide, originate or terminate interstate or international telecommunications. However, the FCC has enacted regulations governing construction and operation of wireless systems, licensing (including renewal of wireless spectrum licenses) and technical standards for the provision of wireless services under the Communications Act.
Wireless spectrum licenses segmented by geographic areas are granted by the FCC. The completion of acquisitions, involving the transfer of control of all or a portion of a wireless system, requires prior FCC approval. The FCC determines on a case-by-case basis whether an acquisition of wireless spectrum licenses is in the public interest. Wireless spectrum licenses are granted generally for a ten-year term or, in some cases, for a twelve-year or fifteen-year term. The FCC establishes the standards for conducting comparative renewal proceedings between a wireless license holder seeking renewal of its license and challengers filing competing applications. All of UScellular’s wireless spectrum licenses for which it applied for renewal since 1995 have been renewed. UScellular expects to continue to meet the criteria of the FCC’s license renewal process.
As part of its data services, UScellular provides internet access. Such internet access services may be subject to different regulatory requirements than other wireless services.
Although the Communications Act generally pre-empts state and local governments from regulating the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless carriers, certain state and local governments regulate other terms and conditions of wireless services, including billing, termination of service arrangements, imposition of early termination fees, advertising, network outages, the use of handsets while driving, zoning, land use, privacy, data security and consumer protection. Further, the Federal Aviation Administration also regulates the siting, lighting and construction of transmitter towers and antennae.
TDS Telecom
The FCC generally exercises jurisdiction over all facilities of, and services offered by, TDS Telecom’s ILECs as telecommunications common carriers, to the extent they provide, originate or terminate interstate or international telecommunications. State public utility commissions generally exercise jurisdiction over intrastate telecommunications facilities and services. In addition, the ILECs are subject to various other state and local laws, including laws relating to privacy, data security and consumer protection.
The Communications Act requires, among other things, that telecommunications common carriers offer interstate services when requested at just and reasonable rates at terms and conditions that are non-discriminatory. Maximum rates for regulated interstate services are prescribed by the FCC. In many states, local rates paid by end user customers and intrastate access charges paid by carriers continue to be subject to state commission approval.
TDS Telecom’s CLEC and expansion fiber operations are subject to similar but reduced regulation compared to ILECs.
Cable operations are subject to regulation by the FCC, covering matters such as technical operations, administrative requirements, consumer protection, access by people with disabilities, customer privacy and content. 
Providing video services requires TDS Telecom to obtain franchises from state or local governmental authorities to occupy public rights of way with network facilities. These franchises are nonexclusive and typically limited in time, contain various conditions and limitations, and provide for the payment of fees to the local authority, determined generally as a standard percentage of revenues.
General
