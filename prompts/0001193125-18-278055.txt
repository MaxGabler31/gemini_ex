ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 The following discussion of our business solely relates to ongoing operations. 
 General Development of Business 
 Our company was founded in 1980 and, through its subsidiaries, primarily manufactures a wide range of recreational vehicles (RVs) in the United States and sells those vehicles primarily in the United States and Canada. We are incorporated in Delaware and are the successor to a corporation of the same name which was incorporated in Nevada on July 29, 1980. Our principal executive office is located at 601 East Beardsley Avenue, Elkhart, Indiana 46514 and our telephone number is (574) 970-7460. Our Internet address is www.thorindustries.com. We maintain copies of our recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), available free of charge, on our web site. Unless the context otherwise requires or indicates, all references to Thor, the Company, we, our and us refer to Thor Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
 Our principal recreational vehicle and other operating subsidiaries are Airstream, Inc. (Airstream), Thor Motor Coach, Inc. (Thor Motor Coach), Keystone RV Company (Keystone, which includes CrossRoads and Dutchmen), Heartland Recreational Vehicles, LLC (Heartland, which includes Bison Horse Trailers, LLC dba Bison Coach (Bison), Cruiser RV, LLC (CRV) and DRV, LLC (DRV)), K.Z., Inc.

Acquisitions and Other Significant Events 
 Fiscal 2018 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 On June 19, 2018, the Companys Board of Directors authorized Company management to utilize up to $250,000 to purchase shares of the Companys common stock through June 19, 2020. 
 Under the share repurchase plan, the Company is authorized to repurchase, from time-to-time, outstanding shares of its common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of share repurchases will be determined by the Companys management team based upon its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The share repurchase plan may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time, and the Company has no obligation to repurchase any amount of its common stock under the plan. The Company intends to make all repurchases and to administer the plan in accordance with applicable laws and regulatory guidelines, including Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 
Joint Venture 
 On February 15, 2018, the Company announced the formation of a joint venture with Tourism Holdings Limited (thl) called TH2connect, LLC (TH2). The Company and thl each have a 50% ownership position in TH2 and equal representation on the board of directors of TH2. The Company contributed cash totaling $46,902 to TH2 in early March 2018 while thl contributed various assets with the same approximate fair value. The Companys investment in TH2 was funded entirely from cash on hand. In accordance with the operating agreement, TH2s future capital needs, which are not expected to be material to the Company, will be funded proportionally by thl and the Company, and an additional $3,500 was contributed to TH2 by both Thor and thl in June 2018. The Companys investment in TH2 is accounted for under the equity method of accounting, and the results of this joint venture are recorded on a one-month lag basis. 
 TH2 was formed to own, improve and sell innovative and comprehensive digital applications through a platform designed for the global RV industry. TH2 will offer a variety of products focused on enhancing the enjoyment, safety, connectivity and convenience of RV ownership and use.

 Tax Reform 
 On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), was signed into law. The Tax Act includes numerous changes to tax laws impacting business, the most significant being a permanent reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%. The rate reduction took effect on January 1, 2018. As the Companys 2018 fiscal year ended on July 31, 2018, the Companys federal blended corporate income tax rate for fiscal year 2018 is 26.9%, based on the applicable tax rates before and after the Tax Act and the number of days in the fiscal year to which the two different rates applied. As a result of other Tax Act changes, the Companys income tax rate for fiscal year 2019 will be negatively impacted by the repeal of the domestic production activities (Code Section 199) deduction and limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation. 
 As a result of the reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate, the Company was required to perform a revaluation of its net deferred tax assets. Based on currently available information, the Company has performed an analysis of the impact of the Tax Act and has recorded a non-recurring, non-cash reduction of its net deferred tax assets due to the reduced federal income tax rate, and a corresponding charge to income tax expense, of approximately $34,000 for the year ended July 31, 2018. The Company also recorded a provisional amount of $2,000 of additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 as a result of recent guidance related to limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation as provided under the Tax Act. The Company is still analyzing the impacts of the Tax Act which potentially could affect the measurement of the deferred tax balances. 
 The reduction in the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate is expected to positively impact the Companys future U.S. after-tax earnings. For fiscal 2019, after considering the lower federal income tax rate of 21.0%, an estimated blended state income tax rate, the elimination of the Code Section 199 deduction and the limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation, the Company currently estimates an overall effective income tax rate between 23.0% and 25.0%, before consideration of any discrete tax items. 
Fiscal 2016 
 Jayco Acquisition 
 On June 30, 2016, the Company closed on a Stock Purchase Agreement (Jayco SPA) for the acquisition of all the issued and outstanding capital stock of towable and motorized recreational vehicle manufacturer Jayco for cash consideration of $562,690, net of cash acquired. This acquisition was funded from the Companys cash on hand and $360,000 from an asset-based revolving credit facility as more fully described in Notes 2 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company purchased Jayco to complement its existing towable and motorized RV product offerings and dealer base. The fiscal 2016 results included in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income only include one month of Jaycos operating results. 
Discontinued Operations 
 On July 31, 2013, we entered into a definitive Stock Purchase Agreement and sold our bus business to Allied Specialty Vehicles, Inc. The sale closed on October 20, 2013. Thors bus business included Champion Bus, Inc., General Coach America, Inc., Goshen Coach, Inc., El Dorado National (California), Inc., and El Dorado National (Kansas), Inc. As a result of the divestiture of the bus business, the results of operations of the bus business are reported as a loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income for the year ended July 31, 2016.

 Recreational Vehicles 
 Overview 
 We manufacture a wide variety of recreational vehicles in the United States and sell those vehicles primarily throughout the United States and Canada, as well as related parts and accessories. Recreational vehicle classifications are based upon standards established by the RV Industry Association (RVIA). The principal types of towable recreational vehicles that we produce include conventional travel trailers and fifth wheels. In addition, we also produce equestrian and other specialty towable recreational vehicles, as well as Class A, Class C and Class B motorhomes. 
 Travel trailers are non-motorized vehicles which are designed to be towed by passenger automobiles, pickup trucks, SUVs or vans. Travel trailers provide comfortable, self-contained living facilities for camping and vacationing purposes. We produce conventional and fifth wheel travel trailers. Conventional trailers are towed by means of a frame hitch attached to the towing vehicle. Fifth wheel trailers, designed to be towed by pickup trucks, are constructed with a raised forward section that is attached to a receiver in the bed area of the pickup truck. 
 A motorhome is a self-powered vehicle built on a motor vehicle chassis. Motorhomes are self-contained with their own lighting, heating, cooking, refrigeration, sewage holding and water storage facilities, so that they can be utilized without being attached to utilities. 
 Class A motorhomes, generally constructed on medium-duty truck chassis, are supplied complete with engine and drivetrain components by motor vehicle manufacturers such as Ford, Freightliner and Spartan Motors. We design, manufacture and install the living area and drivers compartment of Class A motorhomes. Class C and Class B motorhomes are generally built on a Ford, General Motors or Mercedes Benz small truck or van chassis, which includes an engine, drivetrain components and a finished cab section. We construct a living area which has access to the drivers compartment and attaches to the cab section. Although they are not designed for permanent or semi-permanent living, motorhomes can provide comfortable living facilities for camping and vacationing purposes. 
 Production 
 In order to minimize finished inventory, our recreational vehicles generally are produced to dealer order. Our facilities are designed to provide efficient assembly-line manufacturing of products. Capacity increases can generally be achieved relatively quickly and at relatively low cost, largely by acquiring, leasing, or building additional facilities and equipment and increasing the number of production employees. Similarly, capacity decreases can generally be achieved relatively quickly and at relatively low cost, mainly by decreasing the number of production employees. 
 We purchase many of the components used in the production of our recreational vehicles in finished form. The principal raw materials used in the manufacturing processes for motorhomes and travel trailers are aluminum, lumber, plywood, plastic, fiberglass and steel purchased from numerous suppliers. We believe that, except for chassis and certain key towable RV components sourced from one major supplier, substitute sources for raw materials and components are generally available with no material impact on our operations. 
 
4 


 Our relationship with our chassis suppliers is similar to our other RV vendor relationships in that no long-term contractual commitments are entered into by either party. Historically, chassis manufacturers resort to an industry-wide allocation system during periods when chassis supply is restricted. These allocations are generally based on the volume of chassis previously purchased. Sales of motorhomes rely on these chassis and are affected accordingly, as approximately half of the material cost of our motorhomes relates to chassis. We have not experienced any recent significant cost increases from our chassis suppliers. 
 Generally, all of our RV operating subsidiaries introduce new or improved lines or models of recreational vehicles each year. Changes typically include new sizes and floor plans, different decors or design features and engineering and technological improvements. 
 Seasonality 
 Since recreational vehicles are used primarily by vacationers and campers, our recreational vehicle sales tend to be seasonal and, in most geographical areas, tend to be lower during the winter months than in other periods. As a result, our recreational vehicle sales are historically lowest during our second fiscal quarter, which ends on January 31 of each year. 
Marketing and Distribution 
 We sell our recreational vehicles to independent, non-franchise dealers located primarily throughout the United States and Canada. Each of our recreational vehicle operating subsidiaries sell to their own network of independent dealers, with many dealers carrying more than one of our product lines, as well as products from other manufacturers. As of July 31, 2018, there were approximately 2,300 dealerships carrying our products in the U.S. and Canada. We believe that the working relationships between our management and sales personnel and the independent dealers provide us with valuable information on customer preferences and the quality and marketability of our products. 
 While each of our recreational vehicle operating subsidiaries has an independent sales force, the most important retail sales events occur at the major recreational vehicle shows which take place throughout the year at different locations across the country. We also benefit from the recreational vehicle awareness advertising and major marketing programs sponsored by the RVIA in national print media and television. 
 In our selection of individual dealers, we emphasize the dealers ability to maintain a sufficient inventory of our products, as well as their financial stability, credit worthiness, reputation, experience and ability to provide service to the end customer. Many dealers carry the recreational vehicle lines of one or more of our competitors. Generally, each of our recreational vehicle operating subsidiaries have separate agreements with their dealers. 
 One of our dealers, FreedomRoads, LLC, accounted for 20% of our continuing consolidated net sales in each of fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016. This dealer also accounted for 26% of the Companys consolidated trade accounts receivable at July 31, 2018 and 30% at July 31, 2017. 
 We generally do not finance dealer purchases. Most dealers are financed on a floor plan basis by an unrelated bank or financing company, which lends the dealer all or substantially all of the wholesale purchase price and retains a security interest in the vehicles purchased. As is customary in the recreational vehicle industry, we will execute a repurchase agreement with a lending institution financing a dealers purchase of our products upon the lending institutions request. Repurchase agreements provide that, typically for a period of up to eighteen months after a unit is financed and in the event of default by the dealer and notification from the lending institution of the dealer default, we will repurchase all the dealer units repossessed by the lending institution for the amount then due, which is often less than 100% of the dealers cost. The risk of loss under repurchase agreements is spread over numerous dealers and is further reduced by the resale value of the units which we would be required to repurchase. We believe that any future losses under these agreements would not have a material adverse effect on our Company. The Companys total commercial commitments under standby repurchase obligations on dealer inventory financing as of July 31, 2018 and July 31, 2017 were $2,748,465 and $2,200,544, respectively. The losses incurred due to repurchase were not material in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016. 
 Backlog 
 As of July 31, 2018, the backlog for towable and motorized recreational vehicle orders was $766,965 and $634,092, respectively, compared to $1,416,240 and $915,559, respectively, at July 31, 2017, reflecting decreases of 45.8% and 30.7%, respectively. These decreases are mainly attributable to our capacity expansions since the prior year allowing for increased production and therefore quicker delivery of units to dealers, elevated existing dealer inventory levels in certain locations and a more typical seasonal order pattern compared to the elevated order levels from the prior year. 
 Backlog represents unfilled dealer orders on a particular day which can and do fluctuate on a seasonal basis. The manufacturing time in the recreational vehicle business is relatively short. The existing backlog of towable and motorized recreational vehicles is expected to be filled in fiscal 2019. 
 
5 


 Product Warranties 
 We generally provide retail purchasers of our recreational vehicles with a one-year or two-year limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship with longer warranties on certain structural components. The chassis and engines of our motorhomes are generally warranted for various periods in excess of one year by their manufacturers. 
Regulation 
 We are subject to the provisions of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (NTMVSA) and the safety standards for recreational vehicles and recreational vehicle components which have been promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Department of Transportation. Because of our sales in Canada, we are also governed by similar laws and regulations issued by the Canadian government. 
 We are a member of the RVIA, a voluntary association of recreational vehicle manufacturers which promulgates recreational vehicle safety standards. We place an RVIA seal on each of our recreational vehicles to certify that the RVIAs standards have been met. 
 Both federal and state authorities have various environmental control standards relating to air, water and noise pollution which affect our business and operations. For example, these standards, which are generally applicable to all companies, control our choice of paints, our air compressor discharge, our waste water and the noise emitted by our factories. We rely upon certifications obtained by chassis manufacturers with respect to compliance by our vehicles with all applicable emission control standards. 
 We are also subject to the regulations promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Our plants are periodically inspected by federal agencies concerned with health and safety in the work place, and by the RVIA, to ensure that our plants and products comply with applicable governmental and industry standards. 
 We believe that our products and facilities comply in all material respects with applicable vehicle safety, environmental, RVIA and OSHA regulations. 
 We do not believe that ongoing compliance with the regulations discussed above will have a material effect in the foreseeable future on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. 
 Competition 
 The recreational vehicle industry is generally characterized by low barriers to entry. The recreational vehicle market is intensely competitive, with several other manufacturers selling products that compete directly with our products. We also experience a certain level of competition between our own operating subsidiaries. Increased activity in the market for used recreational vehicles also impacts manufacturers sales of new products. Competition in the recreational vehicle industry is based upon price, design, value, quality and service. We believe that the price, design, value and quality of our products and the warranty coverage and service that we provide allow us to compete favorably for retail purchasers of recreational vehicles. There are approximately 60 RV manufacturers in the U.S. and Canada, according to RVIA. 
 Our primary competitors within the towable and motorized segments are Forest River, Inc. and Winnebago Industries, Inc. We are the largest recreational vehicle manufacturer in North America in terms of both units produced and revenue. According to Statistical Surveys, Inc., for the six months ended June 30, 2018, Thors combined U.S. and Canadian market share was approximately 49.6% for travel trailers and fifth wheels combined and approximately 40.0% for motorhomes. 
 Trademarks and Patents 
 We have registered United States trademarks, Canadian trademarks, certain international trademarks and licenses carrying the principal trade names and model lines under which our products are marketed. We hold and protect certain patents related to our business. We are not dependent upon any patents or technology licenses of others for the conduct of our business. 
Employee Relations 
 At July 31, 2018, we employed approximately 17,500 full-time employees in the United States, of which approximately 1,950 were salaried. None of our employees are represented by certified labor organizations. We believe that we maintain a good working relationship with our employees.

 Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales 
 We manufacture all of our recreational vehicles in the United States. Export sales, predominantly to Canada, were $788,894, $628,176 and $368,426 in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and accounted for 9.5%, 8.7% and 8.0% of the Companys consolidated net sales for those respective years.
