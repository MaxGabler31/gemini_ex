ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview 
 
Our business develops technology and processes to promote the regeneration and reuse of materials to sustain a circular economy. Currently, the focus of our business is on depolymerizing waste PET plastics and converting them into valuable chemicals, ready to be reintroduced into the manufacturing of virgin PET plastic. Our proprietary technology breaks down PET into its base chemicals, PTA and MEG, at a recovery rate of over 90% and under normal atmospheric pressure and at room temperature. 
 
Depolymerization presents two unique advantages in recycling resin-based products: (i) the ability to return a recovered resin to virgin-resin-like quality, and (ii) the potential to recover a valuable feedstock from products that are economically challenging to recycle. When plastic is mechanically recycled, even small levels of contamination can compromise the performance of the resin. However, because depolymerization breaks down plastics into monomer form, all contamination is removed. Our unique depolymerization process can be applied to all sorts of post-consumer PET, including degraded, colored or heavily contaminated PET that is not currently recyclable.
 
We are a development-stage company and have not yet generated any revenues. Our depolymerization technology must be scaled-up before we can commercialize the technology and generate any revenues. We intend to commercialize our technology by selling depolymerized LOOP™-branded PET resin to sustainably focused customers. During January 2016, we announced the successful completion of a pilot plant facility in Montreal, Canada with a production capacity of 2.5 metric tons per day of high purity PTA and MEG. In February 2017, we also announced the entry into an agreement for services with DrinkFinity, an affiliate of PepsiCo, effective as of January 1, 2017, pursuant to which, we will participate in a mail back recycling program, whereby PepsiCo and its affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, will be provided custom-made bags for consumers to mail certain specified recyclable products to us and we will process the returned items through our proprietary technology. A copy of this agreement is filed as an exhibit to  our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K,  filed with the SEC on May 30, 2017. 
 
Raw Material
 
Our technology uses waste PET plastics such as water bottles, soda bottles, consumer packaging, carpets and industrial waste as feedstock to process. These feedstocks are available through municipal triage centers, industrial recycling and landfill reclamation projects.
 
PET does not create a direct hazard to the environment, but due to its substantial fraction volume in the plastic waste stream and its high resistance to atmospheric and biological agents, it could be considered as a noxious material. PET accounts for 8% by weight and 12% by volume of the world’s solid waste.
 
PET bottles are characterized by high strength, low weight and permeability of gases (mainly CO2), as well as by their aesthetic appearance (good light transmittance, smooth surface) and do not have any known adverse side effects on humans. Many attempts are currently directed toward recycling of PET waste, because of the interests in environmental protection, energy preservation and economic benefits.
 
Among the different recycling techniques (primary, mechanical, chemical and energy recovery), chemical recycling the most acceptable, according to the principles of “sustainable development ”,  since it leads to the formation of the raw materials from which the polymer is made, as well as of other secondary value-added products. Chemical recycling has been defined as the process leading to the total depolymerization of PET into monomers, or partial depolymerization into oligomers and other chemical substances.

According to NAPCOR (National Association for PET Container Resources), in 2015 in the United States: 
 


· | PET bottles represented a total of 5.9 billion lbs. of PET available to be recycled;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Only 1.79 billion lbs. were collected; and 
· | There was only a 30.1% PET bottle recycling rate. 

 
Among the various methods of PET recycling the most common is mechanical recycling, which refers to operations that aim to recover plastics waste via mechanical processes (grinding, washing, separating, drying, re-granulating and compounding).
 
The disadvantages of mechanical recycling of PET are that sorting is very labor intensive, and high energy costs are required to process the material. Mechanical PET recycling is also limited to single stream PET with no contamination. Other challenges include quality degradation and loss of clarity in the resulting recycled PET. 
 
Depolymerization
 
We have developed a proprietary process that enables us to depolymerize PET into its purest form of PTA and MEG under normal atmospheric pressure and at room temperature. Our unique depolymerization process can bring even degraded, colored or heavily contaminated PET that is not recyclable back to life in the form of its base monomers. The resulting monomers (PTA & MEG) can be repolymerized to produce virgin quality PET.
 
Our PET depolymerization process is completed through a series of chemical reactions:
 


· | Post-consumer (i.e. waste) PET are shredded into approximately 5 mm size pieces; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Shredded PET is put into a large reactor, where certain chemicals are added; 
· | The PET molecular chain is broken down . ; 
· | PTA (solid) and MEG (liquid) and mother liquor (the solution that remains after crystallization, containing the original solute as well as other impurities that were not filtered out) are separated using a combination of centrifugation and distillation;
· | The mother liquor is returned to the reactor to be reused in the process; and 
· | PTA and MEG are processed and used to produce PET. 

 
Our depolymerized PET has been tested in third-party laboratory settings. This testing was conducted to determine whether the PTA and MEG meet certain levels of purity to be able to be used for making PET resin, and we have concluded that the PTA and MEG are of industrial grade purity, meaning they are suitable for use in commercial beverage bottles.
 
Prospective Future Growth
 
We believe that the production of PET plastic resin using PTA and MEG that has been produced through our proprietary depolymerization technology will become a new standard in plastic manufacturing. With the dual benefits of plastic waste control and reduction in the use of fossil fuels we believe that the adoption of Loop’s PET manufacturing process will be widespread.
 
In the medium term, we plan to establish depolymerization and PET manufacturing facilities in strategically located sites based on the availability of post-consumer PET for feedstocks in North America and Europe. 
 
Our long-term growth plans include the development of other technology and processes that will support and promote the circular economy using other types of material, such as other forms of plastic or nylon.

Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of patent and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights, which are primarily our patents, brand names, product designs and marks. 
 
We have an issued U.S. patent with claims relating to our proprietary technology for depolymerization of PET. We expect the patent to expire on or around July 2035. Additionally, we have patent filings covering the same proprietary technology with jurisdictions that are parties to the Patent Cooperation Treaty, Argentina, members of the Gulf Cooperation Council and Taiwan. If patents are ultimately granted from these jurisdictions, we expect these patents to also expire on or around July 2035.
 
We also have a pending U.S. trademark application protecting the trademark name LOOP.
