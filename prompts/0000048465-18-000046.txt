Item 1.  BUSINESS
(a)  General Development of Business

Hormel Foods Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the Company), was founded by George A. Hormel in 1891 in Austin, Minnesota, as Geo. A. Hormel & Company.  The Company started as a processor of meat and food products and continues in this line of business.  The Company’s name was changed to Hormel Foods Corporation on January 31, 1995.  The Company is primarily engaged in the production of a variety of meat and food products and the marketing of those products throughout the United States and internationally.  Although pork and turkey remain the major raw materials for its products, the Company has emphasized for several years the manufacturing and distribution of branded, value-added consumer items rather than the commodity fresh meat business.  The Company has continually expanded its product portfolio through organic growth, new product development, and acquisitions.

Internationally, the Company markets its products through Hormel Foods International Corporation (HFIC), a wholly owned subsidiary.  HFIC has a global presence in the international marketplace through joint ventures and placement of personnel in strategic foreign locations such as Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Japan, and the Philippines.  HFIC has a minority position in a food company in the Philippines (The Purefoods-Hormel Company, Inc., 40% holding).

On August 16, 2018, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Fremont, Nebraska, processing facility to WholeStone Farms, LLC. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to be completed in December 2018.
On November 27, 2017, the Company acquired Columbus Manufacturing, Inc. (Columbus), an authentic premium deli meat and salami company, from Chicago-based Arbor Investments, for $857.4 million.  The transaction was funded with cash on hand along with borrowing $375.0 million under a term loan facility and $375.0 million under a revolving credit facility.   Columbus specializes in authentic premium deli meat and salami and allows the Company to enhance its scale in the deli by broadening its portfolio of products, customers, and consumers.

On August 22, 2017, the Company acquired Cidade do Sol (Ceratti) for a purchase price of $103.3 million. The transaction was funded by the Company with cash on hand.  The acquisition of the Ceratti® brand allows the Company to establish a full in-country presence in the fast-growing Brazilian market with a premium brand.

On August 16, 2017, the Company acquired Fontanini Italian Meats and Sausages (Fontanini), a branded foodservice business, from Capitol Wholesale Meats, Inc. for a purchase price of $425.7 million.  The transaction was funded by the Company with cash on hand and by utilizing short-term financing.  Fontanini specializes in authentic Italian meats and sausages, as well as a variety of other premium meat products including pizza toppings and meatballs and allows the Company to expand its foodservice business.

On January 3, 2017, the Company completed the sale of Clougherty Packing, LLC, parent company of Farmer John and Saag’s Specialty Meats, along with PFFJ, LLC, farm operations in California, Arizona, and Wyoming.  The closing price was $145.0 million in cash.

On May 26, 2016, the Company acquired Justin’s, LLC (Justin’s) of Boulder, Colorado, for a purchase price of $280.9 million.   The purchase price was funded by the Company with cash on hand and by utilizing short-term financing.  This acquisition allowed the Company to enhance its presence in the specialty natural and organic nut butter category.

On May 9, 2016, the Company completed the sale of Diamond Crystal Brands resulting in proceeds of $110.1 million, net of selling costs.
On July 13, 2015, the Company acquired Applegate Farms, LLC (Applegate) of Bridgewater, New Jersey, for a final purchase price of $774.1 million in cash. The purchase price was funded by the Company with cash on hand and by utilizing short-term financing. This acquisition allows the Company to expand the breadth of its protein offerings to provide consumers more choice in this fast growing category. 
The Company has not been involved in any bankruptcy, receivership, or similar proceedings during its history.  Substantially all the assets of the Company have been acquired in the ordinary course of business. The Company had no other significant change in the type of products produced or services rendered, or in the markets or methods of distribution, since the beginning of the 2018 fiscal year.

(c)  Description of Business

Products and Distribution
The Company’s products primarily consist of meat and other food products.  The meat products are sold fresh, frozen, cooked, and canned.  The percentages of total revenues contributed by classes of similar products for the last three fiscal years are as follows:

 | Fiscal Year Ended
 | October 28, 2018 | | October 29, 2017 | | October 30, 2016
Perishable | 55.9 | % | | 53.7 | % | 53.1 | %
Poultry | 19.3 | % | | 19.1 | % | 20.5 | %
Shelf-stable | 18.5 | % | | 20.2 | % | 18.2 | %
Miscellaneous | 6.3 | % | | 7.0 | % | 8.2 | %
Total | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %


Reporting of revenues from external customers is based on similarity of products, as the same or similar products are sold across multiple distribution channels such as retail, foodservice, or international.  Revenues reported are based on financial information used to produce the Company’s general-purpose financial statements.

The Perishable category includes fresh meats, frozen items, refrigerated meal solutions, sausages, hams, guacamole, and bacon (excluding Jennie-O Turkey Store) products.  Shelf-stable includes canned luncheon meats, peanut butter, chilies, shelf-stable microwaveable meals, hash, stews, flour and corn tortillas, salsas, tortilla chips, and other items that do not require refrigeration.  The Poultry category is composed primarily of JOTS products.  The Miscellaneous category primarily consists of nutritional food products and supplements, dessert and drink mixes, and industrial gelatin products.

Domestically, the Company sells its products in all 50 states.  The Company’s products are sold through its sales personnel, operating in assigned territories or as dedicated teams serving major customers, coordinated from sales offices located in most of the larger U.S. cities. The Company also utilizes independent brokers and distributors.  As of October 28, 2018, the Company had approximately 1,030 sales personnel engaged in selling its products.  Distribution of products to customers is primarily by common carrier.

Through HFIC, the Company markets its products in various locations throughout the world.  Some of the larger markets include Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, England, Japan, Mexico, Micronesia, the Philippines, Singapore, and South Korea.  The distribution of export sales to customers is by common carrier, while the China and Brazil operations own and operate their own delivery system.  The Company, through HFIC, has licensed companies to manufacture various Company products internationally on a royalty basis, with the primary licensees being Tulip International of Denmark and CJ CheilJedang Corporation of South Korea.

Raw Materials
The Company has, for the past several years, been concentrating on branded products for consumers with year-round demand to minimize the seasonal variation experienced with commodity-type products.  Pork continues to be the primary raw material for Company products.  The Company’s expanding line of branded products has reduced, but not eliminated, the sensitivity of Company results to raw material supply and price fluctuations.

The majority of the hogs harvested by the Company are purchased under supply contracts from producers located principally in Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska, and Kansas.  The cost of hogs and the utilization of the Company’s facilities are affected by both the level and the methods of pork production in the United States.  The Company uses supply contracts to ensure a stable supply of raw materials.  The Company’s contracts are based on market-based formulas and/or markets of certain swine production inputs, to better balance input costs with customer pricing, and all contract costs are fully reflected in the Company’s reported financial statements.  In fiscal 2018, the Company purchased 96 percent of its hogs under supply contracts.  The Company also procures a portion of its hogs through farms it either owns or operates in Colorado.

In fiscal 2018, JOTS raised turkeys representing approximately 76 percent of the volume needed to meet its raw material requirements for branded turkey products and whole birds.  Turkeys not sourced within the Company are contracted with independent turkey growers. JOTS’ turkey-raising farms are located throughout Minnesota and Wisconsin.

Production costs in raising hogs and turkeys are subject primarily to fluctuations in feed grain prices and fuel costs.  To manage this risk, the Company hedges a portion of its anticipated purchases of grain using futures contracts.

Additionally, the cost and supply of avocados, peanuts, whey, and natural and organic protein are impacted by the changing market forces of supply and demand, which can impact the cost of the Company’s products. The Company uses long-term supply contracts and forward buying in an attempt to manage these risks.

Manufacturing
The Company has one plant that harvests hogs for processing. Quality Pork Processors, Inc. of Dallas, Texas, operates the harvesting facility in Austin, Minnesota, under a custom harvesting arrangement.  The Company currently has seven turkey harvest and processing operations, and 30 facilities that produce and distribute other manufactured items.  Albert Lea Select Foods, Inc. operates the processing facility in Albert Lea, Minnesota, under a custom manufacturing agreement.  Company products are also custom manufactured by several other companies.  The following are the Company’s larger custom manufacturers: Abbyland Foods, Inc., Abbotsford, Wisconsin; Agropur Division Natrel USA, Maplewood, Minnesota; Algood Food Company, Louisville, Kentucky; Cargill Meat Solutions, Minneapolis, MN; Cooper Farms, Van Wert, Ohio: Deitz & Watson, Inc., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Harris Ranch Beef Company, Gilroy, California; HP Hood LLC, Lynnfield, Massachusetts; OSI Industries LLC, Chicago, Illinois; Reichel Foods, Inc., Rochester, Minnesota; Reser’s Fine Foods, Topeka, Kansas; and Steuben Foods, Jamaica, New York.  Exel, Inc., based in Westerville, Ohio, operates distribution centers for the Company in Dayton, Ohio, and Osceola, Iowa.
Patents and Trademarks
There are numerous patents and trademarks important to the Company’s business.  The Company holds 45 U.S. issued and 9 foreign patents.  Most of the trademarks are registered.  Some of the more significant owned or licensed trademarks used by the Company or its affiliates are:
HORMEL, ALWAYS TENDER, APPLEGATE, AUSTIN BLUES, BACON 1, BLACK LABEL, BREAD READY, BURKE, CAFÉ H, CERATTI, CHI-CHI’S, COLUMBUS, COMPLEATS, CURE 81, CYTOSPORT, DAN’S PRIZE, DI LUSSO, DINTY MOORE, DON MIGUEL, DOÑA MARIA, EMBASA, EVOLVE, FAST ‘N EASY, FIRE BRAISED, FONTANINI, HERDEZ, HORMEL GATHERINGS, HORMEL VITAL CUISINE, HOUSE OF TSANG, JENNIE-O, JUSTIN’S, LA VICTORIA, LAYOUT, LLOYD’S, MARY KITCHEN, MUSCLE MILK, NATURAL CHOICE, OLD SMOKEHOUSE, OVEN READY, PILLOW PACK, RANGE BRAND, ROSA GRANDE, SKIPPY, SPAM, SPECIAL RECIPE, THICK & EASY, VALLEY FRESH, and WHOLLY GUACAMOLE.

The Company’s patents expire after a term that is typically 20 years from the date of filing, with earlier expiration possible based on the Company’s decision to pay required maintenance fees.  As long as the Company intends to continue using its trademarks, they are renewed indefinitely.
Customers and Backlog Orders
During fiscal 2018, sales to Walmart Inc. (Walmart) represented approximately 13.6 percent of the Company’s revenues (measured as gross sales less returns and allowances), compared to 14.4 percent in fiscal 2017.  Walmart is a customer for all four segments of the Company.  The five largest customers in each segment make up approximately the following percentage of segment sales: 42 percent of Grocery Products, 38 percent of Refrigerated Foods, 42 percent of JOTS, and 18 percent of International & Other.  The loss of one or more of the top customers in any of these segments could have a material adverse effect on the results of such segment.  Backlog orders are not significant due to the perishable nature of a large portion of the products.  Orders are accepted and shipped on a current basis.
Competition
The production and sale of meat and food products in the United States and internationally are highly competitive.  The Company competes with manufacturers of pork and turkey products, as well as national and regional producers of other meat and protein sources, such as beef, chicken, fish, peanut butter, and whey.  The Company believes its largest domestic competitors for its Refrigerated Foods segment in 2018 were Tyson Foods, Inc. and Smithfield Foods, Inc.; for its Grocery Products segment, Conagra Brands, Inc., General Mills, Inc., Campbell Soup Co., J. M. Smucker Co., and Treehouse Foods Inc.; and for JOTS, Cargill, Inc. and Butterball, LLC.

All segments compete on the basis of price, product quality and attributes, brand identification, breadth of product line, and customer service.  Through aggressive marketing and strong quality assurance programs, the Company’s strategy is to provide higher quality products that possess strong brand recognition, which would then support higher value perceptions from customers.

Employees
As of October 28, 2018, the Company had approximately 20,100 active domestic and foreign employees.
