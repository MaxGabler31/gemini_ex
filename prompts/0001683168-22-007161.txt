Financial Information about Industry Segments
 
We do not report our financial results by segment. See financial statements.
 
Our Growth Strategy
 
If the FDA clears or approves our product candidates to be marketed commercially, we intend to enter into agreements with qualified distributors throughout the United States. A similar approach will be pursued if our product candidates are cleared or approved for marketing outside of the United States. We intend to require such distributors to pay us an initial license fee, as well as royalties based on gross sales. Retaining exclusivity, will be based on a mutually agreeable semi-annual or quarterly sales minimum. We have determined to focus on international growth because, generally, such international license agreements provide a stronger path to revenue and earnings than purely domestic products.
 
Our objective is to grow revenue through marketing and sales of each of our product candidates, CardioMap® and Save a Life, and the two neuro-steroids, PRV-002 and PRV-001 if they gain regulatory approvals. Although no assurances can be given, management anticipates company growth from the following areas:
 

1) | Distribution or License Agreements. In most cases, we will enter into distribution agreements with companies who have sales professionals with experience selling through a variety of sales methods. These distribution agreements will allow us to more quickly achieve sales and revenue in the health products industries.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Generate revenues from sales of CardioMap® and Save a Life. When approved for sale by regulatory agencies we intend to market our products through third party distributors and through our own efforts. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3) | Identify and develop our products for additional proprietary uses. When funding allows, we intend to pursue development of CardioMap® technology for use in other areas of the human body, such as the brain, liver and kidney. We also intend to utilize our proprietary nasal delivery system to deliver other drugs to the brain to treat brain related medical issues.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4) | The development and acquisition of new products. We intend to pursue development and acquisition of other product candidates and market any new products, if cleared or approved. We intend, as capital resources permit, to develop such opportunities if and when they present themselves.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5) | Seek partners to assist in the further development of our drug device combination products. We intend to seek partners to assist with the further development and clinical trials of both PRV-001 and PRV-002. Partnerships could be in the form of government grants or from industry pharmaceutical companies who have an interest in brain related drug therapies.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We currently have no products authorized for commercial distribution in either the United States, Europe or any other country. We have development programs for devices and pharmaceutical drugs, which are in various stages of development. Currently we are only funding the development of PRV-002 intended to treat concussion. Due to funding constraints and market conditions the CardiMap® and the choking rescue device programs have been suspended. All of our products require regulatory clearance or approvals and we cannot begin marketing and selling our product candidates until we obtain applicable authorizations from the respective regulatory agency. FDA clearance or approval to market the products will be required to sell in the United States.

About CardioMap®
 
The CardioMap® System is intended to be a heart monitoring and screening device based on a novel method of Dispersion Mapping in ECG analysis for the early, non-invasive testing for coronary heart disease (“CHD”). The heart monitoring system is intended to provide high quality 3-D visualization and diagnosis of the heart using advanced signal analysis. The product is being designed for use in a professional setting or in remote settings including in-home use. We have exclusive, royalty free rights to USPTO patent number 7,519,416 B2 related to the CardioMap technology.
 
FDA cleared or approved, CardioMap® could provide a better level of diagnosis with its improved sensitivity levels that can detect early warning signs that would normally be invisible with standard ECG devices. The system could dramatically cut the costs associated with the detection of ischemic heart disease and will prove to be an invaluable testing device for cardiologists, physicians, clinics, hospitals, the fitness industry, sports teams, emergency facilities and general public. CardioMap® was developed by VE Science Technology LLC, from whom we have purchased the product rights. We have a working model of the device and associated software and plan to further develop the technology for clinical trials and a 510K FDA submission when funding is secured. To sell, market and distribute the CardioMap® product, clearance or approval from the FDA is required. Such clearance or approval has not been obtained at this time.

About Save-a-Life®
 
In July 2019, we purchased all intellectual property including two patents for the choking rescue device: patent Number RE45, 535 E, and patent Number 8,454,624 B2. The Save a Life® (“SAL”) choking rescue device is currently in development and is designed to be a safe, and easy-to-use device for removing a lodged mass from the throat of a choking victim. The device includes a pump for creating a vacuum chamber, which is connected seamlessly with a replaceable/disposable mouthpiece. In an emergency, the SAL may be easily inserted into the victim’s mouth, which depresses the tongue providing a clear application. By pressing an activation button on the device, the internal pump is intended to deliver the appropriate amount of instantaneous vacuum to dislodge the mass without harm or damage to the person. The application is intended to be instantly effective as the device will be operational and effective in a matter of seconds. To sell, market and distribute the Save-a-Life product, clearance or approval from the FDA is required. Clinical trials for the device will be conducted on anatomically correct models to demonstrate device performance. The regulatory pathway is expected to be a 510k submission to the FDA once successful clinical data is obtained. FDA clearance or approval has not been obtained at this time. The Development Plan for the Save-a-Life is below.

About the neurosteroid PRV-001
 
The neurosteroid, PRV-001, is intended to improve function and lifespan in pediatric disorders where Central Nervous System (CNS) de-myelination and cell death is widespread in the cortex, subcortical nuclei, brainstem, and cerebellar regions. PRV-001, a new chemical entity, is designed to work through gene amplification to simultaneously remove intra-neuronal debris while promoting antioxidant capacity and myelin repair/cell proliferation. Disorders like Nieman Pick Type C disease are multi-faceted in their pathology and require a treatment that can work at many levels to stop progression. The chemical compound for the neurosteroid being developed has completed an initial safety study in rats. Results of preclinical studies suggest that PRV-001 may improve neuromotor, cognitive and mental performance. To market the PRV-001 neurosteroid, further development and clinical studies are required. PRV-001 will also require approval by the FDA to be sold in the United States.
 
Per our agreement with Prevacus, Inc. a Tallahassee, Florida based biotech company, we have fifty percent (50%) ownership in the drug compound and associated intellectual property. The original agreement also called for a joint venture to be created by the two companies. The term to create the joint venture has expired and a joint venture is no longer planned. The United States Patent and Trademark Office issued patents covering methods of PRV-001 synthesis.

About the neurosteroid PRV-002
 
On March 1, 2021, Odyssey Health, Inc. purchased one hundred percent (100%) of the drug compound PRV-002 from Prevacus, Inc. PRV-002 is a fully synthetic, non-naturally occurring neurosteroid being developed for the treatment of mTBI (concussion). Results of preclinical studies suggest that PRV-002 has an equivalent, and potentially superior, neuroprotective effects compared to related neurosteroids. In animal models of mild brain injury PRV-002 reduced the behavioral pathology associated with brain injury symptoms such as short-term memory loss, depression/anxiety-like behavior, and motor-sensory impairment. The drug is administered through the nasal passage from a novel device. PRV-002 is lipophilic and can cross the blood-brain barrier thus supporting its potential to rapidly eliminate swelling, oxidative stress, and inflammation in the brain while restoring proper blood flow through gene amplification.
 
The drug has completed toxicology studies in rat and dog. Studies show that PRV-002 has a safety margin over 200X its predicted efficacious dose. PRV-002 to date has been shown to be stable up to 104 degrees for 18-months. The drug candidate is spray-dry manufactured into a powder and filled into the intranasal device. The device is lightweight and easy to use in the field. Odyssey’s novel intranasal device is breath-propelled causing the soft palate to close in the back of the nasopharynx. This mechanism traps PRV-002 in the nasal cavity allowing for a more abundant and faster drug availability in the traumatized brain. Safety studies have established a dosing regimen of 2X/day for fourteen (14) days. The Phase I clinical trial was performed in Melbourne, Australia with a Contract Research Organization (CRO), Avance Clinical Pty Ltd and Nucleus Network Pty Ltd. The country of Australia provides a greater than twenty six percent (26%) currency exchange advantage and a forty-three and one half percent (43.5%) rebate at the end of our fiscal year from the Australian government on all Research and Development performed in Australia.
 
A comprehensive Investigator’s Brochure was created and approved by the Alfred Ethics Committee by Odyssey Health’s CRO in Australia. Phase 1 was designed to determine the safety profile of the drug in healthy human subjects. It was double-blinded, randomized and placebo controlled (3:1, drug: placebo). Phase 1 used a Single Ascending/Multiple Ascending (SAD/MAD) drug administration design. The SAD component was a 1X treatment (low, medium, or high dose) and the MAD component was a 1X/day treatment for five (5) consecutive days (low and medium dose). Blood and urine samples were collected at multiple time points for safety pharmacokinetics. Standard safety monitoring was provided for each body system.

Forty (40) human subjects (31 males, 9 females) were successfully enrolled in Phase I. The Safety Review Board, made up of medical doctors, has reviewed the trial data and has determined the drug is safe and well tolerated at all dosing levels.
 
In Phase II clinical trial, PRV-002 will be administered to acutely concussed patients, 2x a day for fourteen (14) days. Based on the Phase I data, we plan to apply for an Investigational New Drug application with the FDA and conduct a Phase II trial in the United States.
 
Patents on PRV-002 have been filed and/or issued and a patent has been filed on the nasal delivery device:
