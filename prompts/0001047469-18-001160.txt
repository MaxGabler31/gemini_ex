     ITEM 1.    BUSINESS 
  Overview 
         Theravance Biopharma, Inc. ("Theravance Biopharma") is a diversified biopharmaceutical company with the core purpose of creating medicines that help improve the lives of patients suffering from serious illness. 
         In our relentless pursuit of this objective, we strive to apply insight and innovation at each stage of our business, including research, development and commercialization, and utilize both internal capabilities and those of partners around the world. Our research efforts are focused in the areas of inflammation and immunology. Our research goal is to design localized medicines that target diseased tissues, without systemic exposure, in order to maximize patient benefit and minimize risk. These efforts leverage years of experience in developing localized medicines for the lungs to treat respiratory disease. The first potential medicine to emerge from our research focus on immunology and localized treatments is an oral, intestinally restricted pan-Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, currently in development to treat a range of inflammatory intestinal diseases. Our pipeline of internally discovered product candidates will continue to evolve with the goal of creating transformational medicines to address the significant needs of patients. 
         In addition, we have an economic interest in future payments that may be made by Glaxo Group or one of its affiliates (GSK) pursuant to its agreements with Innoviva, Inc. relating to certain programs, including Trelegy Ellipta. 
   2017 Highlights 
         In 2017, we accomplished a number of key corporate goals. As pipeline programs advanced in various stages of development, clinical results in a number of key programs further informed our plans towards creating medicines to help improve the lives of patients. We reported data in our intestinally restricted JAK inhibitor program for inflammatory intestinal diseases with findings from the initial cohort of our Phase 1b study of TD-1473 that provided the basis to begin to plan a larger Phase 2b/3 induction and maintenance study in ulcerative colitis patients and a Phase 2 induction study in Crohn's disease, both of which are expected to initiate in 2018. We reported positive top-line results from the Phase 3 twelve-month safety study of revefenacin (TD-4208) in COPD, complementing previously announced findings from two replicate Phase 3 efficacy studies of revefenacin, and we subsequently filed a new drug application ("NDA") with the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and received a Prescription Drug User Fee Act ("PDUFA") target action date of November 13, 2018. Additionally, we advanced a Phase 3b study of revefenacin in patients with low peak inspiratory flow rate ("PIFR"), designed to support commercialization if revefenacin is approved. We progressed forward two other key programs in Phase 2 development: our highly selective 5-HT4 receptor agonist velusetrag (TD-5108) in gastroparesis, for which we announced positive top-line results, and our norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor (NSRI) TD-9855 in neurogenic orthostatic hypotension ("nOH"). For TD-9855, based on encouraging treatment responses in the first part of the exploratory study, we amended the study design to include an extension phase in order to assess the durability of response. We completed enrollment in the Telavancin Observational Use Registry (TOURTM), a patient registry study designed to assess how VIBATIV is being used in real-world clinical settings. Outside of our internally managed programs, multiple milestones were achieved in 2017 with Trelegy Ellipta, a respiratory program managed by GSK and Innoviva, Inc. ("Innoviva") in which we have an economic interest that effectively entitles us to indirectly receive an upward tiering royalty of approximately 5.5% to 8.5% of worldwide net sales of Trelegy Ellipta. In late 2017, GSK announced regulatory approvals of Trelegy Ellipta in the US and European Union ("EU") for appropriate patients with COPD, plus positive

   Program Highlights 
   Intestinally Restricted Pan-Janus Kinase (JAK) Inhibitor Program (TD-1473) 
         JAK inhibitors function by inhibiting the activity of one or more of the Janus kinase family of enzymes (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, TYK2) that play a key role in cytokine signaling. Inhibiting these JAK enzymes interferes with the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and, in turn, modulates the activity of a wide range of pro-inflammatory cytokines. JAK inhibitors are currently approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and myelofibrosis and have demonstrated therapeutic benefit for patients with ulcerative colitis. However, these products are known to have side effects based on their systemic exposure. Our goal is to develop an orally administered, intestinally restricted pan-JAK inhibitor specifically designed to distribute adequately and predominantly to the tissues of the intestinal tract, treating inflammation in those tissues while minimizing systemic exposure. We are focused on utilizing targeted JAK inhibitors for potential treatment of a range of inflammatory intestinal diseases, including ulcerative colitis. TD-1473 is our lead intestinally restricted pan-JAK inhibitor that is progressing into multiple clinical studies in 2018, as further described below. TD-3504 is a back-up compound that has successfully completed Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers. Development of TD-3504 has been paused, consistent with the strategy we generally apply to back-up compounds and due to our significant investments in TD-1473. 
 Phase 1 Single Ascending Dose (SAD) and Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) Studies 
         In June 2016, we completed a Phase 1 clinical study of TD-1473, an internally-discovered JAK inhibitor that has demonstrated a high affinity for each of the JAK family of enzymes. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single ascending and multiple ascending doses of TD-1473 in healthy volunteers. A key secondary objective of the trial was to characterize the pharmacokinetics of TD-1473, including the determination of the amount of TD-1473 that entered systemic circulation following oral administration. Data from the study demonstrated TD-1473 to be generally well tolerated. Study results also demonstrated that systemic exposures of TD-1473 were low relative to that reported for tofacitinib, a JAK inhibitor currently in development 
 5

   for ulcerative colitis. At steady state, the plasma exposures of TD-1473 were significantly lower than the plasma exposure of tofacitinib. 
         Furthermore, subjects exhibited high stool concentrations of TD-1473, which were comparable to concentrations associated with efficacy in preclinical colitis models. Preclinical studies also demonstrated penetration of TD-1473 into the intestinal wall and membrane. The data generated from the study met our target pharmacokinetic profile and support clinical progression of the compound. 
         Previously announced findings from a preclinical model of colitis evaluating TD-1473 and tofacitinib demonstrated that both compounds significantly reduced disease activity scores. However, at doses providing similar preclinical efficacy, the systemic exposure of TD-1473 was much lower than that of tofacitinib and, in contrast to tofacitinib, TD-1473 did not reduce systemic immune cell counts. Also, we completed six and nine month toxicology studies of TD-1473 and demonstrated favorable safety margins in these studies, in support of the dose ranges planned in the Phase 3 registrational program. Based on these preclinical findings, we believe that TD-1473 represents a potential breakthrough approach to treating ulcerative colitis without the risk generally associated with systemically active therapies. 
   Phase 1b Study 
         In late 2016, we announced dosing of the first patient in a Phase 1b clinical study of TD-1473 in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. The Phase 1b exploratory study in 40 patients was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of TD-1473 over a 28-day treatment period. In addition, the study incorporates biomarker analysis and clinical, endoscopic, and histologic assessments to evaluate biological effect. 
         In August 2017, we announced encouraging data from the first cohort of patients in the Phase 1b study. Data from the first cohort demonstrated evidence of localized biological activity for TD-1473 after four weeks of treatment, based on a compilation of clinical, endoscopic, and biomarker assessments. Pharmacokinetic data demonstrated minimal systemic exposure, and there was no evidence of systemic immunosuppression. 
   Janssen Biotech Collaboration 
         In early February 2018, we announced a global co-development and commercialization agreement with Janssen Biotech, Inc. ("Janssen") for TD-1473 and related back-up compounds for inflammatory intestinal diseases, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Under the terms of the agreement, we will receive an upfront payment of $100 million and will be eligible to receive up to an additional $900 million in potential payments, if Janssen elects to remain in the collaboration following the completion of certain Phase 2 activities. Upon such election, we and Janssen will jointly develop and commercialize TD-1473 in inflammatory intestinal diseases, and we and Janssen will share profits and losses in the US and expenses related to a potential Phase 3 program (67% to Janssen; 33% to us). In addition, we would receive royalties on ex-US sales at double-digit tiered percentage royalty rates. 
         In 2018, the Company plans to initiate a large, Phase 2b/3 adaptive design induction and maintenance study in ulcerative colitis with TD-1473, as well as a Phase 2 study in Crohn's disease. Following completion of the Phase 2 Crohn's study and the Phase 2b induction portion of the ulcerative colitis study, Janssen can obtain an exclusive license to develop and commercialize TD-1473 and certain related compounds by paying us a fee of $200 million, the closing of which portion of the transaction is also subject to clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act ("HSR Act"). After Phase 2, Janssen would lead subsequent development of TD-1473 in Crohn's disease if it makes such election. We will lead development of TD-1473 in ulcerative colitis through completion of the Phase 2b/3 program. If TD-1473 is commercialized, we 
 6

   have the option to co-commercialize in the US, and Janssen would have sole commercialization responsibilities outside the US. 
   TD-9855 
         TD-9855 is an investigational norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor ("NSRI"). TD-9855 completed a Phase 2 study in patients with fibromyalgia, demonstrating statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in pain and core symptoms at the highest dose tested compared to placebo. 
         We are assessing the potential use of TD-9855 in neurogenic orthostatic hypotension ("nOH"), and in May 2016, we initiated an exploratory Phase 2a study of TD-9855 in this indication. The Phase 2a study was designed to evaluate postural changes in blood pressure, symptom reduction, and safety and tolerability of single ascending doses in patients with nOH. 
         Based on encouraging treatment responses in the first part of the study, we announced in February 2017 our plan to amend the study design to allow those patients who respond to continue dosing for up to 20 weeks to assess the durability of their response. We believe the ability to demonstrate a durable effect in nOH could lead to significant benefits for patients over existing therapy. Given many nOH patients suffer from underlying conditions that can cause rapid deterioration of their health, the endpoints of the extended dosing portion of the study evaluate patient responses following 4 weeks of therapy. We expect data from the extended Phase 2a study at the end of the first half of 2018. 
         In parallel with the Phase 2a study, we plan to seek regulatory support for an orphan drug designation and an expedited development pathway for TD-9855 in nOH. 
   Long-Acting Muscarinic AntagonistRevefenacin (TD-4208) 
         Revefenacin is an investigational long-acting muscarinic antagonist ("LAMA") under regulatory review for the treatment of COPD, with an FDA PDUFA target action date in November of 2018. We believe that revefenacin may become a valuable addition to the COPD treatment regimen and that it represents a significant commercial opportunity. Our market research indicates there is an enduring population of COPD patients in the US that either need or prefer nebulized delivery for maintenance therapy. LAMAs are a cornerstone of maintenance therapy for COPD, but existing LAMAs are only available in handheld devices that may not be suitable for every patient. Revefenacin has the potential to be a best-in-class once-daily single-agent product for COPD patients who require, or prefer, nebulized therapy. The therapeutic profile of revefenacin, together with its physical characteristics, suggest that this LAMA could serve as a foundation for combination products and for delivery in metered dose inhaler and dry powder inhaler ("MDI/DPI") products. 
   Mylan Collaboration 
         In January 2015, Mylan Ireland Limited ("Mylan") and we established a strategic collaboration for the development and, subject to regulatory approval, commercialization of revefenacin. Partnering with a world leader in nebulized respiratory therapies enables us to expand the breadth of our revefenacin development program and extend our commercial reach beyond the acute care setting where we currently market VIBATIV. Mylan funded the Phase 3 development program, enabling us to advance other high value pipeline assets alongside revefenacin. 
         Under the terms of the Mylan Development and Commercialization Agreement (the "Mylan Agreement"), Mylan and we are co-developing nebulized revefenacin for COPD and other respiratory diseases. We are leading the US Phase 3 development program, and Mylan is responsible for reimbursement of our costs related to the registrational program up until the approval of the first new drug application ("NDA"), after which costs will be shared. If a product developed under the collaboration is approved in the US, Mylan will lead commercialization and we will retain the right to 
 7

   co-promote the product in the US under a profit-sharing arrangement (65% Mylan/35% Theravance Biopharma). Outside the US (excluding China), Mylan will be responsible for development and commercialization and will pay us a tiered royalty on net sales at percentage royalty rates ranging from low double-digits to mid-teens. 
         Under the Mylan Agreement, Mylan paid us an initial payment of $15.0 million in cash in the second quarter of 2015. Also, pursuant to an ordinary share purchase agreement entered into on January 30, 2015, Mylan Inc., the indirect parent corporation of Mylan, made a $30.0 million equity investment in us, buying 1,585,790 ordinary shares from us in early February 2015 in a private placement transaction at a price of approximately $18.918 per share, which represented a 10% premium over the volume weighted average price per share of our ordinary shares for the five trading days ending on January 30, 2015. In February 2016, we earned a $15.0 million development milestone payment for achieving 50% enrollment in the Phase 3 twelve-month safety study. As of December 31, 2017, we are eligible to receive from Mylan additional potential development, regulatory and sales milestone payments totaling up to $205.0 million in the aggregate, with $160.0 million associated with revefenacin monotherapy and $45.0 million for future potential combination products. Of the $160.0 million associated with monotherapy, $150.0 million relates to commercialization and $10.0 million relates to regulatory actions in the EU. We do not expect to earn any milestone payments from Mylan in 2018. 
         We retain worldwide rights to revefenacin delivered through other dosage forms, such as a MDI/DPI, while Mylan has certain rights of first negotiation with respect to our development and commercialization of revefenacin delivered other than via a nebulized inhalation product. In China, we retain all rights to revefenacin in any dosage form. 
   Phase 3 Study in COPD and NDA Submission 
         In September 2015, we announced, with our partner Mylan, the initiation of the Phase 3 development program for revefenacin for the treatment of COPD. The Phase 3 development program included two replicate three-month efficacy studies and a single twelve-month safety study. The two efficacy studies examined two doses (88 mcg and 175 mcg) of revefenacin inhalation solution administered once-daily via nebulizer in patients with moderate to severe COPD. The Phase 3 efficacy studies were replicate, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials designed to provide pivotal efficacy and safety data for once-daily revefenacin over a dosing period of 12 weeks, with a primary endpoint of trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) on day 85. The Phase 3 safety study was an open-label, active comparator study of 12 months duration. 
         In October 2016, we announced positive top-line results from the two replicate Phase 3 efficacy studies of revefenacin in more than 1,200 moderate to very severe COPD patients, and in May and November 2017 we reported additional data from these studies. Both Phase 3 efficacy studies met their primary endpoints, demonstrating statistically significant improvements over placebo in trough FEV1 after 12 weeks of dosing for each of the revefenacin doses studied (88 mcg once daily and 175 mcg once daily). The studies also demonstrated that the 88 mcg and 175 mcg doses of revefenacin were generally well-tolerated, with comparable rates of adverse events and serious adverse events across all treatment groups (active and placebo). In July 2017, we announced positive top-line results from the twelve-month safety study in more than 1,000 COPD patients. Data demonstrated that both the 88 mcg and 175 mcg doses of revefenacin were generally well-tolerated, with low rates of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), comparable to those seen with the active comparator. Together, the three studies enrolled approximately 2,280 patients. 
         In November 2017, we submitted to the FDA for filing a NDA for revefenacin supported by data from the two replicate Phase 3 efficacy studies and twelve-month safety study. In January 2018, the FDA accepted the NDA for filing and assigned a PDUFA target action date of November 13, 2018.

     Phase 3b PIFR Study 
         In March 2017, we initiated a Phase 3b study of revefenacin in patients with suboptimal peak inspiratory flow rate ("PIFR"). This study is not required for NDA approval and was designed to support commercialization, if revefenacin is approved. The purpose of the study was to assess whether nebulized revefenacin was superior to handheld tiotropium (dosed via the Handihaler® device) in a broad population of COPD patients with suboptimal PIFR. The primary endpoint was improvement in lung function, as measured by trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) after 4 weeks of treatment. 
         The PIFR study was completed in the first quarter of 2018. In the overall population of approximately 200 moderate to very severe (GOLD Stage 2/3/4) COPD patients, we saw numerical improvements for revefenacin over tiotropium, but these improvements were not statistically significant, and as a result the study failed to meet the predefined threshold for superiority. In the pre-specified subgroup of severe and very severe (GOLD 3/4) COPD patients, which represented approximately 80% of the patients in the study, revefenacin demonstrated nominally statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements in trough FEV1 versus tiotropium. Data generated in the study provided important insights to inform future potential studies of revefenacin in COPD patients with suboptimal PIFR. Revefenacin was well tolerated in this study, with no new safety issues identified. The Company plans to publish the results from this study in a future medical meeting or publication. 
   Velusetrag (TD-5108) 
         Velusetrag is an oral, investigational medicine developed for gastrointestinal motility disorders. It is a highly selective agonist with high intrinsic activity at the human 5-HT4 receptor. Velusetrag, which was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA for the treatment of symptoms associated with idiopathic and diabetic gastroparesis, is being developed in collaboration with Alfasigma S.p.A. ("Alfasigma") (formerly Alfa Wassermann S.p.A.). Positive top-line results from the initial Phase 2 proof-of-concept study under this partnership, which evaluated gastric emptying, safety and tolerability of multiple doses of velusetrag, were announced in April 2014. 
         In August 2017, we announced positive top-line results from a 12-week, Phase 2b study of velusetrag characterizing the impact on symptoms and gastric emptying of three oral doses of velusetrag (5, 15 and 30 mg) compared to placebo administered once daily over 12 weeks of therapy. Results from the study demonstrated statistically significant improvements in gastroparesis symptoms and gastric emptying for patients receiving 5 mg of velusetrag as compared to placebo. Patients in the 15 and 30 mg velusetrag study arms demonstrated statistically significant improvements in gastric emptying, but they did not experience statistically significant improvements in gastroparesis symptoms. Velusetrag was shown to be generally well-tolerated, with 5 mg and placebo having comparable rates of adverse events and serious adverse events. We are in dialogue with regulators regarding the velusetrag program in gastroparesis and expect to provide an update in the first half of 2018. 
         Under our collaboration with Alfasigma, Alfasigma is entitled to exercise its option to progress velusetrag to the next stage of development in certain countries outside the US. We are eligible to receive a $10 million option fee if Alfasigma exercises its option, as well as potential development, regulatory and sales milestone payments and royalties. 
   VIBATIV® (telavancin) 
         VIBATIV is a bactericidal, once-daily injectable antibiotic to treat patients with serious, life-threatening infections due to  Staphylococcus aureus and other Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant ("MRSA") strains. VIBATIV is approved in the US for the treatment of adult patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections ("cSSSI") caused by susceptible Gram-positive bacteria and for the treatment of adult patients with hospital-acquired and ventilator- 
 9

   associated bacterial pneumonia ("HABP"/"VABP") caused by susceptible isolates of Staphylococcus aureus when alternative treatments are not suitable. In addition, in 2016, the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") allowed us to add new clinical data to the VIBATIV label concerning concurrent bacteremia in cases of HABP/VABP and cSSSI. VIBATIV is also indicated in Canada and Russia for cSSSI and HABP and VABP caused by Gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA. 
         Our acute care sales force markets VIBATIV in the US, and we maintain an independent marketing and medical affairs team. This same organization will support revefenacin, if approved in the US, alongside our partner for the program. Outside of the US, our strategy is to market VIBATIV through a network of partners. To date, we have secured partners for VIBATIV in the following geographies: Canada, Middle East and North Africa, Israel, Russia, China and India. Since we and Clinigen reached a mutual decision for Clinigen to return to us the commercial rights to market and distribute VIBATIV in the EU, we have been unable to secure another partner to commercialize VIBATIV in the EU. Accordingly, in early 2018 we filed a withdrawal notice with the European Medicines Agency which will extinguish VIBATIV's EU marketing authorization. 
         Given the challenges we have faced commercializing VIBATIV in the US in a highly competitive environment against a variety of generic drugs, we are reducing and closely managing our overall spending related to the product. Although we continue to view VIBATIV as an important medicine to treat serious infections in very sick patients and we intend to continue to support the product, we plan to reduce our VIBATIV commercial expenditures over the course of 2018 to a level more commensurate with its net sales. 
   Phase 3 Registrational Study in Staphylococcus aureus Bacteremia 
         As part of our effort to explore additional settings in which VIBATIV may offer patients therapeutic benefit, in February 2015, we initiated a Phase 3 registrational study for the treatment of patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. The 250-patient registrational study is a multi-center, randomized, open-label study designed to evaluate the non-inferiority of telavancin in treating Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia as compared to standard therapy. Key secondary outcome measures of the study include an assessment of the duration of bacteremia post-randomization and the incidence of development of metastatic complications, as compared to standard therapy. 
         In February 2018, the study stopped enrolling new patients following an interim analysis conducted by an independent review committee and company-wide review of investment priorities. The committee concluded the study is underpowered and therefore unlikely to achieve the primary study objective, without a significant increase in study size beyond the planned sample size of approximately 250 patients. Given the incremental investment required, we elected to close the study. No new safety issues were identified in the study, and as a result patients currently enrolled will be allowed to complete dosing. We plan to submit data generated from the study for future scientific publication. 
   Telavancin Observational Use Registry ("TOURTM") Study 
         Initiated in February 2015, the 1,000-patient TOURTM study is designed to assess the manner in which VIBATIV is used by healthcare practitioners to treat patients. By broadly collecting and examining data related to VIBATIV treatment patterns, as well as clinical effectiveness and safety outcomes in medical practice, we aim to create an expansive knowledge base to guide clinical use and future development of the drug. Data from this study is providing information about the use of VIBATIV in real-world clinical settings, including reports of positive clinical responses in patients with bacteremia, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, skin and respiratory infections. During 2017, we concluded the TOURTM registry study and completed the data base. We have begun and plan to continue to analyze the data and publish in a number of areas reflecting real world use of VIBATIV at future medical meetings and medical journals.

     Janssen Pharmaceutica License Agreement 
         In 2002, we entered into a License Agreement with Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V. ("Janssen Pharmaceutica") pursuant to which we have licensed rights under certain patents owned by Janssen Pharmaceutica covering an excipient used in the formulation of telavancin. Pursuant to the terms of this license agreement, we are obligated to pay royalties to Janssen Pharmaceutica of 2.5% to 5% of any net commercial sales of VIBATIV (telavancin). The license will terminate in 2019 on the later of 10 years from first commercial sale of VIBATIV and the date of expiration of the last applicable Janssen Pharmaceutica patent covering VIBATIV. The license is terminable by us upon prior written notice to Janssen Pharmaceutica or upon an uncured breach or a liquidation event of one of the parties. 
   Neprilysin (NEP) Inhibitor Program (TD-0714 and TD-1439) 
         Neprilysin ("NEP") is an enzyme that degrades natriuretic peptides. These peptides play a protective role in controlling blood pressure and preventing cardiovascular tissue remodeling. Inhibiting NEP may result in clinical benefit for patients, including diuresis, control of blood pressure, and reversing maladaptive changes in the heart and vascular tissue in patients with congestive heart failure. Our primary objective for this program is to develop a NEP inhibitor that could be used across a broad population of patients with cardiovascular and renal diseases, including acute and chronic heart failure and chronic kidney disease, including diabetic nephropathy. We aim to create a platform for multiple combination products with our NEP inhibitor with features that are differentiated from currently available products. Our NEP inhibitor program consists of two compounds (TD-0714 and TD-1439), each of which demonstrated characteristics in line with our target product profile in Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers. 
   TD-0714 
   Phase 1 Single Ascending Dose (SAD) and Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) Studies 
         In March 2016, we completed a Phase 1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose ("SAD") study in healthy volunteers of our most advanced NEP inhibitor compound, TD-0714. The study was designed to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of TD-0714, as well as measure biomarker evidence of target engagement and the amount of the drug that is eliminated via the kidneys. Results from the SAD study of TD-0714 demonstrate that the compound achieved maximal and sustained levels of target engagement for 24 hours after a single-dose, supporting the drug's potential for once-daily dosing. Target engagement was measured by dose-related increases in the levels of cyclic GMP (cGMP, a well-precedented biomarker of NEP engagement). TD-0714 also demonstrated very low levels of renal elimination, as evidenced by intravenous microtracer testing technology, and a favorable tolerability profile. 
         In October 2016, we completed a Phase 1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose ("MAD") study in healthy volunteers of TD-0714. The findings from the MAD study were consistent with the Phase 1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, SAD study in healthy volunteers we completed in March 2016, demonstrating sustained target engagement, low levels of renal elimination, and a favorable tolerability profile. 
   TD-1439 
         TD-1439 is a second NEP inhibitor compound, which is structurally distinct from TD-0714. In the first half of 2017, we announced favorable results from Phase 1 SAD and a Phase 1 MAD studies of TD-1439. In both Phase 1 studies, TD-1439 demonstrated characteristics which met our target product profile, including sustained 24-hour target engagement, low levels of renal elimination and a favorable tolerability profile.

           We are currently evaluating next steps for both compounds in our NEP inhibitor program clinical program. The results from the Phase 1 programs provide confidence for pursuing future efficacy studies of either compound in a broad range of cardiovascular and renal diseases, including in patients with compromised renal function. 
   Selective 5-HT4 Agonist (TD-8954) 
   Takeda Collaborative Arrangement 
         In June 2016, we entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement with Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Millennium") (the "Takeda Agreement"), in order to establish a collaboration for the development and commercialization of TD-8954 (TAK-954), a selective 5-HT4 receptor agonist. Millennium is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE: 4502), a publicly-traded Japanese corporation listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (collectively with Millennium, "Takeda"). TD-8954 is being developed for potential use in the treatment of gastrointestinal motility disorders, including short-term intravenous use for enteral feeding intolerance ("EFI") to achieve early nutritional adequacy in critically ill patients at high nutritional risk, an indication for which the compound received FDA Fast Track designation. Under the terms of the Takeda Agreement, Takeda will be responsible for worldwide development and commercialization of TD-8954. We received an upfront cash payment of $15.0 million and will be eligible to receive success-based development, regulatory and sales milestone payments by Takeda. The first $110.0 million of potential milestones are associated with the development, regulatory and commercial launch milestones for EFI or other intravenously dosed indications. We will also be eligible to receive a tiered royalty on worldwide net sales by Takeda at percentage royalty rates ranging from low double-digits to mid-teens. 
 Other Programs 
   Economic Interest in GSK-Partnered Respiratory Programs 
         We are entitled to receive an 85% economic interest in any future payments that may be made by GSK (pursuant to its agreements with Innoviva) relating to the GSK-Partnered Respiratory Programs, which Innoviva partnered with GSK and assigned to Theravance Respiratory Company, LLC ("TRC") in connection with Innoviva's separation of its biopharmaceutical operations into its then wholly-owned subsidiary Theravance Biopharma. The GSK-Partnered Respiratory Programs consist primarily of the Trelegy Ellipta program and the inhaled Bifunctional Muscarinic Antagonist-Beta2 Agonist ("MABA") program, each of which are described in more detail below. We are entitled to this economic interest through our equity ownership in TRC. Our economic interest does not include any payments associated with RELVAR® ELLIPTA®/BREO® ELLIPTA®, ANORO® ELLIPTA® or vilanterol monotherapy. The following information regarding the Trelegy Ellipta and MABA programs is based solely upon publicly available information and may not reflect the most recent developments under the programs. 
   Trelegy Ellipta (the combination of fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol, previously referred to as the Closed Triple) 
         Trelegy Ellipta is the first treatment to provide the activity of an inhaled corticosteroid (FF) plus two bronchodilators (UMEC, a LAMA, and VI, a long-acting beta2 agonist, or LABA) in a single delivery device administered once-daily. Trelegy Ellipta is approved for use in the US and EU for the long-term, once-daily, maintenance treatment of appropriate patients with COPD. We are entitled to receive an 85% economic interest in the royalties payable by GSK to TRC on worldwide net sales. Those royalties are upward-tiering from 6.5% to 10%, resulting in cash flows to Theravance Biopharma of approximately 5.5% to 8.5% of worldwide net sales of Trelegy Ellipta. Theravance Biopharma is not responsible for any costs related to Trelegy Ellipta.

           Innoviva and GSK conducted two global pivotal Phase 3 studies of Trelegy Ellipta in COPD, the IMPACT study and the FULFIL study. 
         The IMPACT study, which enrolled 10,355 COPD patients, was initiated in July 2014. In September 2017, GSK and Innoviva disclosed positive headline results from the IMPACT study, in which data demonstrated statistically significant reductions in the annual rate of on-treatment moderate/severe exacerbations for Trelegy Ellipta (100/62.5/25mcg) when compared with two, once-daily dual COPD therapies RELVAR® ELLIPTA®/BREO® ELLIPTA® (FF/VI), an ICS/LABA combination, and ANORO® ELLIPTA® (UMEC/VI), a LAMA/LABA combination. In addition, statistically significant improvements were observed across all pre-specified key secondary endpoints and associated treatment comparisons. 
         The FULFIL study, which enrolled 1,810 COPD patients, was initiated in February 2015. In June 2016, GSK and Innoviva disclosed positive top-line results from the FULFIL study, in which data demonstrated superiority of Trelegy Ellipta as compared to twice-daily SYMBICORT® TURBOHALER® (budesonide/formoterol) in improving lung function and health-related quality of life, as well as reducing exacerbations in COPD patients. 
         In September 2017, GSK and Innoviva announced the US FDA approved Trelegy Ellipta for the long-term, once-daily, maintenance treatment of appropriate patients with COPD. In November 2017, GSK and Innoviva announced the submission of data from the IMPACT study to the FDA to support an expanded label for Trelegy Ellipta. If this sNDA is approved, FF/UMEC/VI could be used by physicians to treat a wider population of patients with COPD who are at risk of an exacerbation and require triple therapy. In December 2017, GSK and Innoviva announced the European Commission granted marketing authorization for Trelegy Ellipta as a maintenance treatment for appropriate patients with COPD. 
         In February 2018, GSK and Innoviva announced the submission of the IMPACT data to the European Medicines Agency as part of a type II variation to support an expanded label for Trelegy Ellipta in Europe for the maintenance treatment of moderate to severe COPD. Approval of the submission would mean Trelegy Ellipta, the only once-daily single inhalation triple therapy for the treatment of COPD, could be used by physicians to treat a wider population of patients with the condition who are at risk of an exacerbation and require triple therapy. 
         Additionally, in December 2016, GSK and Innoviva announced the initiation of the Phase 3 (CAPTAIN) study of Trelegy Ellipta in patients with asthma. The CAPTAIN study is expected to be completed in 2018. 
   Inhaled Bifunctional Muscarinic Antagonist-Beta2 Agonist (MABA) 
         GSK961081 ('081), also known as batefenterol, is an investigational, single-molecule bifunctional bronchodilator with both muscarinic antagonist and beta2 receptor agonist activity that was discovered by us when we were part of Innoviva. 
         If a single-agent MABA medicine containing '081 is successfully developed and commercialized, we are entitled to receive an 85% economic interest in the royalties payable by GSK to TRC on worldwide net sales, which royalties range between 10% and 20% of annual global net sales up to $3.5 billion, and 7.5% for all annual global net sales above $3.5 billion. If a MABA medicine containing '081 is commercialized only as a combination product, such as '081/FF, the royalty rate is 70% of the rate applicable to sales of the single-agent MABA medicine. If a MABA medicine containing '081 is successfully developed and commercialized in multiple regions of the world, TRC is eligible to receive contingent milestone payments from GSK. The agreements allow for total milestones of up to $125.0 million for a single-agent medicine and an incremental $125.0 million for a combination medicine. Of these amounts, $112.0 million in potential milestones remain for a single-agent medicine, and $122.0 million remain for a combination medicine. In each case, we would be entitled to receive an 85% economic interest in any such payments.

  Theravance Respiratory Company, LLC ("TRC") 
         Our equity interest in TRC is the mechanism by which we are entitled to the 85% economic interest in any future payments made by GSK under the strategic alliance agreement and under the portion of the collaboration agreement assigned to TRC by Innoviva. The drug programs assigned to TRC include all Trelegy Ellipta products and the MABA program, as monotherapy and in combination with other therapeutically active components, such as an inhaled corticosteroid ("ICS"), as well as any other product or combination of products that may be discovered and developed in the future under these GSK agreements. 
   Our Strategy 
         Our core purpose is to create medicines that help improve the lives of patients suffering from serious illness. We strive to apply insight and innovation at each stage of our business, including research, development and commercialization. With our successful drug discovery and development track record, commercial infrastructure, experienced management team and efficient corporate structure, we believe that we are well positioned to create value for our shareholders and make a difference in the lives of patients. 
         We follow these core guiding principles in our mission to drive value creation:
 

 Focus on insight and innovation; 
 Outsource non-core activities; 
 Create and foster an integrated environment; and 
 Aggressively manage uncertainty. 

         We manage our pipeline with the goal of optimizing program value and allocation of resources. We employ multiple strategies for commercialization of our products. Our approach may involve retaining product rights and marketing a product independently in the US or we may partner a product to extend our commercial reach to expand our geographic reach, and/or to manage the financial risk associated with the program. Alternatively, we may monetize or divest an asset that we designate as outside our core business, where we believe the program is optimized by leveraging partner capabilities and removing or limiting our research and development costs. 
   Manufacturing 
         We rely primarily on a network of third-party manufacturers, including contract manufacturing organizations, to produce our active pharmaceutical ingredient ("API") and our drug product. We believe that we have in-house expertise to manage this network of third-party manufacturers and we believe that we will be able to continue to negotiate third-party manufacturing arrangements on commercially reasonable terms and that it will not be necessary for us to obtain internal manufacturing capacity in order to develop or commercialize our products. However, if we are unable to obtain contract manufacturing or obtain such manufacturing on commercially reasonable terms, or if manufacturing is interrupted at one of our suppliers, whether due to regulatory or other reasons, we may not be able to develop or commercialize our products as planned. 
         We have a single source of supply of API for telavancin and another, separate single source of supply of VIBATIV drug product. If, for any reason, either single-source third-party manufacturer of telavancin API or of VIBATIV drug product is unable or unwilling to perform, or if the performance of either does not meet regulatory requirements, including maintaining current Good Manufacturing Practice ("cGMP") compliance, we may not be able to obtain sufficient quantities of API or drug product in a timely manner. Similarly, any inability to acquire sufficient quantities of API in a timely manner from current or future sources would adversely affect the commercialization of VIBATIV and 
 14

   could disrupt our research and development programs, for example the conduct of future clinical trials. For more information, see the risk factors under the headings "We rely on a single manufacturer for the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient ("API") for telavancin and a separate, single manufacturer for VIBATIV drug product supply. Our business will be harmed if either of these single-source manufacturers are not able to satisfy demand and alternative sources are not available" and "We rely on a single source of supply for a number of our product candidates, and our business will be harmed if any of these single-source manufacturers are not able to satisfy demand and alternative sources are not available" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
   Government Regulation 
         The development and commercialization of VIBATIV and our product candidates by us and our collaboration partners and our ongoing research are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. Before marketing in the United States, any medicine must undergo rigorous preclinical studies and clinical studies and an extensive regulatory approval process implemented by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Outside the United States, the ability to market a product depends upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. In any country, however, the commercialization of medicines is permitted only if the appropriate regulatory authority is satisfied that we have presented adequate evidence of the safety, quality and efficacy of our medicines. 
         Before commencing clinical studies in humans in the United States, we must submit to the FDA an investigational new drug application ("IND") that includes, among other things, the general investigational plan and protocols for specific human studies, and the results of preclinical studies. An IND will go into effect 30 days following its receipt by the FDA unless the FDA issues a clinical hold. Once clinical studies have begun under the IND, they are usually conducted in three phases and under FDA oversight. These phases generally include the following: 
  Phase 1.    The product candidate is introduced into patients or healthy human volunteers and is tested for safety, dose tolerance and pharmacokinetics. 
         Phase 2.    The product candidate is introduced into a limited patient population to assess the efficacy of the drug in specific, targeted indications, assess dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. 
  Phase 3.    If a compound is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, the clinical study will be expanded to further demonstrate clinical efficacy, optimal dosage and safety within an expanded patient population. 
         The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies must be submitted to the FDA as part of a NDA. The NDA also must contain extensive manufacturing information. PDUFA establishes timeframes for FDA review of NDAs, with a performance goal of reviewing and acting on 90 percent of priority new molecular entity ("NME") NDA submissions within 6 months of the 60-day filing date, and to review and act on 90 percent of standard NME NDA submissions within 10 months of the 60-day filing date. The 2007 Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act gave the FDA authority to require implementation of a formal Risk Evaluation and Management Strategy to ensure that the benefits of a product outweigh its risks. At the end of the review period, the FDA communicates either approval of the NDA or a complete response listing the application's deficiencies. 
         Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety or quality issues are identified after the product reaches the marketplace. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing studies, sometimes referred 
 15

   to as Phase 4 studies, to monitor the safety and effectiveness of approved products, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. The FDA has broad post-market regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize products, withdraw approvals, enjoin violations, and initiate criminal prosecution. 
         If regulatory approval for a medicine is obtained, the clearance to market the product will be limited to those diseases and conditions approved by FDA and for which the medicine was shown to be effective, as demonstrated through clinical studies and specified in the medicine's labeling. Even if this regulatory approval is obtained, a marketed medicine, its manufacturer and its manufacturing facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA. The FDA ensures the quality of approved medicines by carefully monitoring manufacturers' compliance with its cGMP regulations. The cGMP regulations for drugs contain minimum requirements for the methods, facilities, and controls used in manufacturing, processing, and packaging of a medicine. The regulations are intended to make sure that a medicine is safe for use, and that it has the ingredients and strength it claims to have. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a medicine, manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions on the medicine or manufacturer, including costly recalls or withdrawal of the medicine from the market. 
         We and our collaboration partners are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA and other regulatory authorities have broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize products, withdraw approvals, enjoin violations, and initiate criminal prosecution, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
         Outside the United States our ability to market our products will also depend on receiving marketing authorizations from the appropriate regulatory authorities. Risks similar to those associated with FDA approval described above exist with the regulatory approval processes in other countries. 
   United States Healthcare Reform 
         The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (together the "Healthcare Reform Act"), substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and impacts pricing and reimbursement with respect to our VIBATIV business, and any potential additional commercial operations. Moreover, certain legislative changes to and regulatory changes under the Healthcare Reform Act have occurred in the 115th US Congress and under the current administration and additional changes remain possible. We expect that the Healthcare Reform Act, as currently enacted or as it may be amended in the future, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to maintain or increase sales of our existing products or to successfully commercialize our product candidates, if approved. For more information, see the risk factor under the heading "Changes in healthcare law and implementing regulations, including government restrictions on pricing and reimbursement, as well as healthcare policy and other healthcare payor cost-containment initiatives, may negatively impact our ability to generate revenues" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement 
         We participate in and have certain price reporting obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program. Our participation in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program is described in greater detail under the risk factor "If we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug 
 16

    Rebate program or other governmental pricing programs, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
         Our ability to commercialize our products successfully, and to attract commercialization partners for our products, depends in significant part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third party payors, including, in the United States, governmental payors such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, managed care organizations, and private health insurers. The reimbursement environment is described in greater detail under the risk factor "Changes in healthcare law and implementing regulations, including government restrictions on pricing and reimbursement, as well as healthcare policy and other healthcare payor cost-containment initiatives, may negatively impact our ability to generate revenues" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
   Fraud and Abuse Laws 
         Our interactions and arrangements with customers and third-party payors are subject to applicable fraud and abuse laws. These laws and the related risks are described in greater detail under the risk factor "Our relationships with customers and third-party payors are subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, transparency and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, exclusion, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Data Privacy and Protection 
         We are subject to laws and regulations that address privacy and data security. In the US, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act), govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. Similar obligations apply in foreign countries. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation which will enter into force on May 25, 2018 will amplify existing data protection obligations in the EU. These laws and related risks are described in greater detail under the risk factor "If we fail to comply with data protection laws and regulations, we could be subject to government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity, which could negatively affect our operating results and business" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Patents and Proprietary Rights 
         We will be able to protect our technology from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our technology is covered by valid and enforceable patents or is effectively maintained as trade secrets. Our success in the future will depend in part on obtaining patent protection for our product candidates. Accordingly, patents and other proprietary rights are essential elements of our business. Our policy is to seek in the United States and selected foreign countries patent protection for novel technologies and compositions of matter that are commercially important to the development of our business. For proprietary know-how that is not patentable, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of our drug discovery process that involve proprietary know-how and technology that is not covered by patent applications, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. We require all of our employees, consultants and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements. Where it is necessary to share our proprietary information or data with outside parties, our policy is to make available only that information and data required to accomplish the desired purpose and only pursuant to a duty of confidentiality on the part of those parties. 
 17

           As of December 31, 2017, we owned 459 issued United States patents and 1,960 granted foreign patents, as well as additional pending United States patent applications and foreign patent applications. The claims in these various patents and patent applications are directed to compositions of matter, including claims covering product candidates, lead compounds and key intermediates, pharmaceutical compositions, methods of use and processes for making our compounds along with methods of design, synthesis, selection and use relevant to multivalency in general and to our research and development programs in particular. In particular, our wholly-owned subsidiary Theravance Biopharma Antibiotics IP, LLC owns the following US patents which are listed in the FDA Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (Orange Book) for telavancin: US Patent No. 6,635,618 B2, expiring on September 11, 2023; US Patent No. 6,858,584 B2, expiring on August 24, 2022; US Patent No. 6,872,701 B2, expiring on June 5, 2021; US Patent No. 7,008,923 B2, expiring on May 6, 2021; US Patent No. 7,208,471 B2, expiring on May 1, 2021; US Patent No. 7,351,691 B2, expiring on May 1, 2021; US Patent No. 7,531,623 B2, expiring on January 1, 2027; US Patent No. 7,544,364 B2, expiring on May 1, 2021; US Patent No. 7,700,550 B2, expiring on May 1, 2021; US Patent No. 8,101,575 B2, expiring on May 1, 2021; and US Patent No. 8,158,580 B2, expiring on May 1, 2021. Thus, the last-to-expire patent currently listed in the Orange Book for telavancin expires on January 1, 2027. 
         United States issued patents and foreign patents generally expire 20 years after filing. The patent rights relating to VIBATIV (telavancin) currently consist of United States patents that expire between 2019 and 2027, additional pending United States patent applications and counterpart patents and patent applications in a number of jurisdictions, including Europe. Additionally, our patent rights relating to revefenacin, velusetrag and TD-9855 currently include issued United States composition of matter patents that expire in 2025, 2025 and 2030, respectively (not including any patent term extensions that may be available under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984), as well as additional issued United States patents, pending United States patent applications and counterpart patents and patent applications in a number of jurisdictions. Nevertheless, issued patents can be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing similar products and threaten our ability to commercialize our product candidates. Our patent position, similar to other companies in our industry, is generally uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. To maintain our proprietary position we will need to obtain effective claims and enforce these claims once granted. It is possible that, before any of our products can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force only for a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent. Also, we do not know whether any of our patent applications will result in any issued patents or, if issued, whether the scope of the issued claims will be sufficient to protect our proprietary position. 
         In 2002, we entered into a License Agreement with Janssen Pharmaceutica pursuant to which we have licensed rights under certain patents owned by Janssen Pharmaceutica covering an excipient used in the formulation of telavancin. Pursuant to the terms of this license agreement, we are obligated to pay royalties to Janssen Pharmaceutica of 2.5% to 5% of any net commercial sales of VIBATIV (telavancin). The license will terminate in 2019 on the later of 10 years from first commercial sale of VIBATIV and the date of expiration of the last applicable Janssen Pharmaceutica patent covering VIBATIV. The license is terminable by us upon prior written notice to Janssen Pharmaceutica or upon an uncured breach or a liquidation event of one of the parties. 
   Competition 
         Our marketed product and development programs target four therapeutic areasinfectious disease, respiratory, gastrointestinal and cardiovascularand our research efforts are focused in the areas of inflammation and immunology, with a goal of designing localized medicines that target diseased tissues, without systemic exposure, in order to maximize patient benefit and minimize risk. Our commercial infrastructure is focused primarily on the acute care setting. We expect that any 
 18

   medicines that we commercialize with our collaborative partners or on our own will compete with existing and future market-leading medicines. 
         Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and personnel resources than we have. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly greater commercial infrastructures than we have. Our ability to compete successfully will depend largely on our ability to leverage our experience in drug discovery, development and commercialization to:
 

 discover and develop medicines that are superior to other products in the market; 
 attract and retain qualified scientific, clinical development and commercial personnel; 
 obtain patent and/or other proprietary protection for our medicines and technologies; 
 obtain required regulatory approvals; 
 commercialize approved products; and 
 successfully collaborate with pharmaceutical companies in the discovery, development and commercialization of new medicines. 

         VIBATIV (telavancin).    VIBATIV competes with vancomycin, linezolid and daptomycin, generic drugs that are manufactured by a variety of companies, as well as other drugs marketed to treat complicated skin and skin structure infections and hospital acquired and ventilator associated bacterial pneumonia caused by Gram-positive bacteria. Currently marketed branded competitive products include but are not limited to Sivextro® (tedizolid) marketed by Merck & Co., Inc.; Teflaro® (ceftaroline) and Dalvance (dalbavancin) marketed by Allergan; and Orbactiv (oritavancin) marketed by Melinta Therapeutics. To date, VIBATIV has not been broadly accepted by physicians, patients, third-party payors, or the medical community in general, we believe primarily due to the availability of low cost generic antibiotic products such as vancomycin and daptomycin. 
  Revefenacin (TD-4208) long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA).    If approved as the first once-daily nebulized LAMA, revefenacin would be expected to compete predominantly with short-acting nebulized bronchodilators used 3 to 4 times per day and the nebulized LAMA LonhalaTM MagnairTM (SUN-101/eFlow®) used twice per day. Revefenacin has the potential to be a primary maintenance therapy or to be used with nebulized long-acting beta agonist (LABA) products used two times per day. 
         Trelegy Ellipta or FF/UMEC/VI (fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol).    Trelegy Ellipta competes in Europe with Trimbow (beclometasone dipropionate/formoterol fumarate/glycopyrronium bromide, dosed twice per day) from Chiesi Farmaceutici and, in the future, may compete with other closed triple products that are currently under development. AstraZeneca and Novartis both have closed triple products dosed twice per day in late stage development for COPD and/or asthma. 
   Research and Development 
         We spent $173.9 million, $141.7 million, and $129.2 million on research and development, net of reimbursements from collaboration partners for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Additional information regarding these expenditures is included in Note 1, "Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 19

     Employees 
         As of December 31, 2017, we had 340 permanent employees, of which 219 were engaged in research and development activities. Of our 340 employees, 330 were located in the US, nine were located in Ireland, and one was located in England. We consider our employee relations to be good.
