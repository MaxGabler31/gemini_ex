ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contain forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including those set forth in the section entitled Item 1A - Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
Business overview 
 We are a specialist medical diagnostics company focused on the research, development and manufacture of in vitro diagnostic test devices for consumer and professional point-of-care use. 
 We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on September 14, 2001 and our shares of common stock in the form of CHESS Depositary Interests (CDIs) have been quoted on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) since December 13, 2006. Our securities are not currently traded on any other public market. Our wholly owned subsidiary and primary operating vehicle, Universal Biosensors Pty Ltd (UBS) was incorporated as a proprietary limited company in Australia on September 21, 2001. UBS conducts our primary research, development and manufacturing activities in Melbourne, Australia. A subsidiary of UBS, Hemostasis Reference Laboratory Inc. (HRL) was incorporated in British Columbia, Canada on November 30, 2016. HRL conducts coagulation testing and calibration services for products we manufacture as well as for other customers in Hamilton, Canada. 
 Our principal place of business is 1 Corporate Avenue, Rowville, Victoria 3178, Australia. Our principal telephone number in Australia is +61 3 9213 9000. HRLs principal place of business is 15(H) Wing, Second Floor, 711 Concession Street, Hamilton, Ontario and its registered office is 310-318 Homer Street, Vancouver, British Columbia V6B 2V2, Canada. We also maintain a website at www.universalbiosensors.com and HRL maintains a website at www.hemostasislab.com. The information contained in, or that can be accessed through, our websites is not part of this 
Form 10-K.
We have rights to an extensive patent portfolio, with certain patents owned by UBS and a number licensed to UBS by LifeScan, Inc. and other third party licensors. The Companys first global strategic partnership was established with LifeScan in diabetes care. We developed a blood glucose product with LifeScan (OneTouch Verio®) which as of December 31, 2018 was available in countries that represent over 90% of the world self-monitoring blood glucose market. During 2018, LifeScan gave notice and exercised its right to convert its obligation to pay quarterly service fees to UBS. Accordingly, we will not receive any further quarterly service fees beyond 2018 and we do not expect to receive any further revenues from LifeScan unless we enter into a new agreement with LifeScan in the future. In October 2018, Platinum Equity acquired LifeScan, Inc. from Johnson & Johnson. Unless otherwise noted, references to LifeScan in this document are references collectively or individually to LifeScan, Inc., and/or LifeScan Europe. 
 We are using our electrochemical cell technology platform to develop point-of-care testing systems for a number of different markets. Our current focus is on the coagulation testing market. 
 We have, since 2012 worked with Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc. (Siemens) in relation to a range of products for the point-of-care coagulation testing market, pursuant to a Collaboration Agreement with Siemens (Collaboration Agreement). The first such product developed with Siemens, the Xprecia Stride Coagulation Analyzer, received CE mark on December 9, 2014 and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance on October 4, 2016. The Xprecia Stride Coagulation Analyzer is now available in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Canada. Under the terms of a supply agreement with Siemens (Supply Agreement), UBS is the manufacturer of test strips for this product and further tests still in development for Siemens. In addition, for part of the year, UBS was engaged in point-of-care coagulation product development for the consumer, home testing market which could be distributed globally. In order to reduce expenditures and manage cash flow, management suspended development spending on the companys in house coagulation test device and redirected those engineering and science resources to the Siemens program development initiatives. 
 We are required to file a Form 10-K as a result of UBI being registered under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

 Description of our business 
 We are a specialist medical diagnostics company focused on the research, development and manufacture of in vitro diagnostic test devices for consumer and professional point-of-care use.     
 Industry background 
 We operate in the high growth, point-of-care segment of the global in vitro diagnostics (IVD) industry. A large proportion of clinical diagnostics has historically been performed by trained personnel at dedicated or centralized testing sites including hospital laboratories and commercial pathology laboratories. Significant interest has developed in techniques and technologies that allow testing to be performed on-the-spot (in real time at the patients side). Point-of-care testing can be further divided into consumer self-testing or testing of patients by one of a variety of medical or laboratory professionals in locations such as clinics, physicians office laboratories and emergency departments. While not all tests are suited to being performed at the point-of-care, we believe our electrochemical cell technology and other technologies could be a suitable platform for adapting a number of relevant central laboratory tests to a point-of-care format. 
 Point-of-care tests in development and partnering strategy 
 We are also working to demonstrate the broader application of our technology platform for markets with significant commercial potential. To date, we have developed a blood glucose test with LifeScan and a coagulation Prothrombin Time International Normalized Ratio (PT-INR) test with Siemens, both of which are now sold by LifeScan and Siemens, respectively. Assuming neither we nor Siemens terminates the Collaboration Agreement, we intend to continue to work with Siemens to develop other test strip and analyzer products for the point-of-care coagulation market. 
 Principal Products and Services 
 UBS is the manufacturer of PT-INR coagulation test strips for Siemens Xprecia StrideTM Coagulation Analyzer. We continue to work with Siemens to develop other products for the point-of-care coagulation testing market which UBS expects to manufacture once approved for sale. UBS also conducts research and development to demonstrate the broader application of our technology platform.

 On February 8, 2019, we entered into a term sheet agreement with UBS and Siemens (the Term Sheet Agreement). The Term Sheet Agreement provides that we have agreed to negotiate with UBS and Siemens in good faith for a specified period (subject to extension if mutually agreed) possible modifications to our commercial relationship, including the Collaboration Agreement and Supply Agreements. Under the term sheet agreement, our obligations, as well as those of UBS and Siemens, to apply commercially reasonable efforts and to apply reasonably necessary resource to certain research and development activities under the Collaboration Agreement have been suspended pending the outcome of the negotiation. Under the Term Sheet Agreement, we and UBS have also agreed to not make any dividend payments or similar distributions, or engage in M&A transactions (subject to an exception which would allow us and UBS to enter into M&A transactions where the directors of either company determine, in good faith, that not proceeding with such a transaction would be inconsistent with their fiduciary duties). 
 On September 21, 2018 LifeScan exercised its right to convert its obligation to pay quarterly service fees to us. We received the lump sum service fees of US$31,503,880 (equivalent to A$44,635,704) from LifeScan on February 18, 2019, which are restricted as described above pursuant to the Term Sheet Agreement with Siemens. We assessed if any amount of the lump sum service fees were attributable to the remaining obligation under the Master Services and Supply Agreement that states that LifeScan could require us to provide manufacturing services at our Rowville facility to recommence production of glucose strips. We conclude that this obligation has no fair value attributable to it due to (i) high set-up costs to recommence manufacturing, (ii) the required lead time to gain regulatory compliance, and (iii) the fact there is deemed to be no commercial rationale for LifeScan to request us to recommence glucose-strip manufacturing on the basis of current information. As such, the lump sum service fee revenue has been fully recognized this fiscal year and no revenue has been deferred. As LifeScan has exercised its right to convert its obligation to pay quarterly service fees to us, beyond 2018 we will not be receiving any quarterly services fees from LifeScan. After the payment of the one-time lump sum service fee, LifeScan has the ability to terminate the Master Services and Supply Agreement with 12 months notice. 
 Facilities 
 Universal Biosensors Pty Ltd leases approximately 5,000 square meters of office, research and development and manufacturing facilities at 1 Corporate Avenue, Rowville in Melbourne, Australia. We have had ISO 13485 certification continuously at that site since May 2007. The lease for 1 Corporate Avenue expires on March 31, 2022 with an option to renew the lease for two further terms of three years each. 
 HRL leases approximately 482 square meters of office and laboratory facilities at 15(H) Wing, Second Floor, 711 Concession Street, Hamilton, Ontario. As part of the acquisition of the assets of the Hemostasis Reference Laboratory business in December 2016, HRL was transferred ISO 13485:2003 and ISO 13485 certification, which has been held continuously at the site since May 15, 2014 and July 2011, respectively. The lease for 711 Concession Street expires on January 31, 2020 with 2 further options to renew each for 5 years. Either HRL or its landlord can terminate the lease early by giving 6 months notice. 
 Raw materials 
 Raw materials essential to our business are purchased worldwide in the ordinary course of business from numerous suppliers. In general, these materials are available from multiple sources. Certain of our products in development may be more reliant on sole sources of supply. We seek to enter into long term contracts of supply with respect to these materials and intend to develop mitigation strategies, which may include development work to enable substitute materials to be used. 
 Distribution 
 Siemens is responsible for the sales and distribution of its products.

 Regulatory clearances 
 In all major territories of the world, regulatory clearances are required prior to marketing diagnostic tests. The regulatory clearance requirements vary from country to country and product to product, however, regulatory clearances typically require a satisfactory technical dossier, which provides the regulatory bodies with details of the design and previous testing of the product including safety and efficacy data as well as the details of the conduct of trials which show the suitability for use of the product at the point-of-care. Regulators also require demonstration of continuing compliance with an appropriate quality management system. There is no common international regulatory body and we, or our relevant customer or partner or distributor, would be required to submit for clearance to sell in each of the major jurisdictions in which we or our relevant customers and partners seeks to market products. For example, for Europe, a designated Notified Body assesses the quality system and product technical dossier, whereas in the United States, the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, is the regulatory body responsible for the examination of the design and performance of the device and for assessment of our quality system. 
 In the case of point-of-care tests, there are often additional requirements that a manufacturer must meet such as an examination of certain aspects affecting test suitability for non-laboratory professional users. In Europe, certain codified standards describe the requirements of tests whilst in the United States, tests to be used by non-laboratory professionals must gain CLIA waiver status under the United States Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) of 1988. Amongst other clearances, we also require clearance for export of medical devices from the Therapeutics Goods Administration, or TGA, in Australia, for all products under our name. 
 If we are developing a product for a customer or partner, our customers and partners are generally responsible for obtaining and maintaining all applicable regulatory clearances and determining the location and timing for the individual submissions. We may provide a supporting role in this process. 
 The importance and duration of all our patents, trademarks and licenses 
 We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights which in the aggregate we believe to be of material importance to us in the operation of our business. Our continued success depends to a large extent on our ability to protect and maintain our owned and licensed patents and patent applications, copyright, trademark and trade secrets. 
 Our point-of-care tests in development draw upon an extensive portfolio of patents and patent applications as well as know-how either owned by UBS or licensed to UBS. We patent the technology, inventions and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business.                 
 We rely on the owned patent applications and the patents and patent applications licensed to us in the manufacture of the point-of-care diagnostic tests being developed by us and to enable us to grant rights to our customers and partners to commercialize products that we may develop. 
 Our owned and licensed patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. Based on current product sales and our projects, the owned and licensed patents and patent applications that we consider most significant by virtue of their importance to our platform together with the last of the patents to expire within the patent family are set forth in the table below.

 We intend to continue to file and prosecute patent applications when and where appropriate to attempt to protect our rights in our proprietary technologies. 
 Pursuant to our License Agreement with LifeScan, LifeScan is responsible for prosecution and maintenance of the patents and patent applications licensed to us by them. In the event that LifeScan elects not to proceed with the prosecution of a patent application licensed to us by them or discontinues the payment of fees, we have the right to assume and continue at our own expense the prosecution of any such patent or patent applications. We also license intellectual property from Siemens and SpeeDx Pty Ltd, who are both primarily responsible for the prosecution and maintenance of the patents and patent applications licensed to us by them. 
 Our ability to build and maintain our proprietary position for our technology and products will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and those claims being enforced once granted and, with respect to intellectual property licensed to us, the licensees success in obtaining effective claims and those claims being enforced once granted. The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. Some countries in which we or our customers or partners may seek approval to sell point-of-care tests that we have been involved in developing, may fail to protect our owned and licensed intellectual property rights to the same extent as the protection that may be afforded in the United States or Australia. Some legal principles remain unresolved and there has not been a consistent policy regarding the breadth or interpretation of claims allowed in patents in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Australia or elsewhere. In addition, the specific content of patents and patent applications that are necessary to support and interpret patent claims is highly uncertain due to the complex nature of the relevant legal, scientific and factual issues. Changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Australia or elsewhere may diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection. 
 Trademarks 
 It is anticipated that we may brand products that we manufacture and distribute as part of a future strategy in the consumer, home, point-of-care testing and self-testing coagulation markets. In such a case our intention is to own our brands applied to those products. We have filed trademark applications in significant markets in accordance with that strategy. 
Seasonality 
 We do not expect sales of our products and services to be materially impacted by seasonality. 
 The practices of the registrant and the industry (respective industries) relating to working capital items. 
 The nature of the Companys business requires it to maintain sufficient levels of inventory to meet contractually agreed delivery requirements of its customers. Significant amounts of inventory are not retained by the Company as it does not have to meet rapid delivery requirements. The Company provides its customers with payment terms prevalent in the industry. The Company does not provide extended payment terms to its customers.

 Dependence on single customer 
 In 2018, we continued to receive a significant portion of our revenue from LifeScan. All revenue from products was recognized in connection with the manufacture of the test strips for Siemens Xprecia StrideTM Coagulation Analyzer. During 2018, LifeScan gave notice and exercised its right to convert its obligation to pay quarterly service fees to UBS. Accordingly, we will not receive any further quarterly service fees beyond 2018 and we do not expect to receive any further revenues from LifeScan unless we enter into a new agreement with LifeScan in the future.

 In 2018, revenue from services was primarily represented by the lump sum service fees, which are restricted pursuant to the Term Sheet Agreement with Siemens, and the quarterly service fees from LifeScan. 
 We did not have any significant backlog orders as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. 
 Competitive conditions of our business 
 Siemens is responsible for all sales and marketing decisions with respect to the products we develop for them and for any decision to introduce the products to new territories and the timing of those decisions. In December 2014, Siemens received the CE mark for sale of the Xprecia StrideTM Coagulation Analyzer in Europe and initiated a limited release in Europe. On October 4, 2016, Siemens received regulatory clearance from the US FDA to sell the Xprecia Stride Coagulation Analyzer in the US and initiated sales activities in the US in May 2017. 
 The worldwide point-of-care coagulation testing market was estimated at around US$1.0 billion in 2011 and is forecast to grow by around 10% per annum to US$1.8 billion by 2017. The coagulation testing market is dominated by PT-INR testing, which represents around 70% of this market. Roche is currently the largest player in the point-of-care professional PT-INR testing market. Roche has a well established brand recognition, sales and marketing force, and has significant resources available to support its product. 
 Core to our business strategy is the extension of our intellectual property platform to enable other tests currently done in the central laboratory to be migrated to the point-of-care settings. Our belief is that much testing done in the central lab can be more efficiently and profitably performed at the point-of-care. With the exception of blood glucose testing, most point-of-care testing is currently conducted in professional settings. The healthcare professional has a choice and can request tests from a central laboratory, or services provider, or choose to have the test performed at the point-of-care. Thus we face competition not just from other companies active in the point-of-care space, but also the providers of testing who operate in centralized settings. Further our belief is that self-service, home, point-of-care testing can be more efficient and at lower cost to the healthcare system and directly involve the patient in their medical information collection and healthcare decision making.
