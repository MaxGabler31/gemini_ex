Background
In this era of Smart Everything, we have seen a remarkable proliferation of consumer and wireless electronic products, particularly mobile devices. The growth of the Internet and cloud computing has provided people with new ways to create, store, and share information. At the same time, the increasing use of electronics in cars, buildings, appliances, and other consumer products is creating a connected landscape of smart devices. Numerous software applications have been developed to expand the potential of these connected devices. The increasing impact of artificial intelligence and machine learning is driving an increase in the activity of new and existing chip and system design companies around the world.
These developments have been fueled by innovation in the semiconductor and software industries. It is now common for a single chip to combine many components (processor, communications, memory, custom logic, input/output) and embedded software into a single system-on-chip (SoC), necessitating highly complex chip designs. The most complex chips today contain more than a billion transistors. Transistors are the basic building blocks for ICs, each of which may have features that are less than 1/1,000th the diameter of a human hair. 
These devices are manufactured using masks to direct beams of light onto a wafer of silicon. At such small dimensions, the wavelength of light itself can become an obstacle to production, proving too big to create such dense features and requiring creative and complicated new approaches. Designers have turned to new manufacturing techniques to solve these problems, such as multiple-patterning lithography and FinFET 3D transistors, which in turn have introduced new challenges to design and production.
The popularity of mobile devices and other electronic products has increased demand for chips and systems with greater functionality and performance, reduced size, and lower power consumption. Our customers, who design those products, are facing intense pressure to deliver innovative offerings in shorter timeframes and at lower prices. In other words, innovation in chip and system design often hinges on providing products “better,” “sooner,” and “cheaper” than competitors. The design of these chips and systems is extremely complex and necessitates state-of-the-art solutions. Over the past several years, market verticals including artificial intelligence (AI), 5G, automotive and cloud computing infrastructure have contributed to the ongoing demand for our products and services.
A similar dynamic is at work in the software arena, whether the software is embedded on a chip or used in other applications. The pace of innovation often requires developers to deliver more secure, high-quality software, which can include millions of lines of code, in increasingly frequent release cycles. Bugs, defects and security vulnerabilities in code can be difficult to detect and expensive to fix. Despite these challenges, it is crucial to have high-quality, secure code to ensure consumers' privacy and safety, especially at a time when software is critical in many industries across a growing array of smart devices.
Our Role—As the Silicon to Software Partner
Synopsys' Silicon to Software technologies and services are designed to help our customers—chip and system engineers and software developers—to speed up time to market, achieve the highest quality of results, mitigate risk, and maximize profitability.
Chip and system designers must determine how best to design, locate and connect the building blocks of chips, and to verify that the resulting design behaves as intended and can be manufactured efficiently and cost-effectively. This is a complex, multi-step process that is both expensive and time-consuming. Our wide range of products help at different steps in the overall design process, from the design of individual ICs to the design of larger systems. Our products increase designer productivity and efficiency by automating tasks, keeping track of large amounts of data, adding intelligence to the design process, facilitating reuse of past designs and reducing errors. Our IP products offer proven, high-quality pre-configured circuits that are ready to use in a chip design, saving customers time and enabling them to direct resources to features that differentiate their products. Our global service and support engineers also provide expert technical support and design assistance to our customers.
Software developers are responsible for writing code that not only accomplishes its goals as efficiently as possible, but also runs securely and is free of defects. We offer products that can help developers write higher quality, more secure code by analyzing code for quality defects and known security vulnerabilities, adding intelligence and automation to the software testing process, and helping to eliminate defects in a systematic manner. As developers make use of open source software in their code, our products can help developers better manage the composition and security of the code. Our products enable software developers to catch flaws earlier in the development cycle, when they are less costly to fix.

We use employee feedback to drive and improve processes that support our customers and ensure a deep understanding of our culture and vision among our employees. Through our semi-annual SHAPE Synopsys surveys, we obtain employee insights on our values, manager effectiveness, ability to innovate, perceptions on inclusion and diversity, and other critical factors. By inviting employees to share their experiences, we create space for important conversations about who we are, where we are going, and how we can connect with each other and our work.
At mid-year fiscal 2022, approximately 90% of our employee population participated in the SHAPE survey. Results showed our global workforce to be highly engaged, with our overall score outpacing the industry engagement benchmark. We saw strong scores from our people regarding their connection to our culture, their personal investment in Synopsys’ strategies and objectives, and their team’s ability to innovate. As we grow, we aspire to maintain our results-oriented culture by balancing productivity with smart investments in our people’s development, while also supporting individual wellbeing.
Ongoing performance feedback encourages greater engagement in our business and improved individual performance. Each year, our employees participate in our performance development process that summarizes key accomplishments for the preceding year, establishes new stretch goals, and identifies critical capabilities for development. As part of this process, we encourage managers to solicit and share supportive multi-rater feedback, further strengthening the focus on teamwork and team success.
Talent Development and Succession Planning
We provide several leadership programs to address the career advancement and associated business impact of our employees. Through our digital learning platform, which was heavily utilized in fiscal 2022, we foster and support an “always learning” culture where employees can access training, external articles, videos and blogs. In addition, we hosted a series of in-person and on-demand learning sessions designed to build capability and adaptability required for the future. As employees advance in their careers, our training framework builds new capabilities on established foundational skills.
Based upon the belief that our employees deserve great managers, our management training is designed to increase capability in the areas of communication, engagement, coaching, inclusion and diversity, hiring and on-boarding, business skills and ensuring an ethical and supportive work environment free from bias and harassment. In fiscal 2022, we also focused on training and resources for our managers to help them effectively manage and lead hybrid teams to enable effective team dynamics as more team members transition back to the office. In addition, our regions and business teams customize development programs for their specific needs.
We remain committed to equipping leaders for the future. Because the depth and readiness of our leadership pipeline is critically important to our business, in fiscal 2022 we identified key roles across our enterprise, ensured qualified successors were in place for those roles and have committed to establishing development plans that will be tracked, assessed for effectiveness, and adjusted as we move ahead. We believe these actions will enable us to sustain a culture that honors the importance of learning, leading and growing.
