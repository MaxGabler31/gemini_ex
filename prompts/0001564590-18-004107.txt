Item 1. Business.
Overview
 We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on helping patients through the discovery and development of unique RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene therapy and other genetic medicine approaches for the treatment of rare neuromuscular diseases. 
 Applying our proprietary, highly-differentiated and innovative RNA-targeted platform technologies, we are able to develop candidate therapies for a broad range of diseases and disorders. 
 Our first commercial product in the U.S., EXONDYS 51, was granted accelerated approval by the FDA on September 19, 2016. EXONDYS 51 is indicated for the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 51 skipping. 
A summary description of our product and main product candidates is as follows:
  
• | EXONDYS 51, our first product, uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin gene. EXONDYS51 is designed to bind to exon 51 of dystrophin pre- messenger RNA (“mRNA”), resulting in exclusion of this exon during mRNA processing in patients with genetic mutations that are amenable to exon 51 skipping. Exon skipping is intended to promote the production of an internally truncated but functional dystrophin protein.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Golodirsen, one of our main product candidates, uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 53 of the DMD gene. Golodirsen is designed to bind to exon 53 of dystrophin pre-mRNA, resulting in exclusion, or “skipping”, of this exon during mRNA processing in patients with genetic mutations that are amenable to exon 53 skipping. Exon skipping is intended to promote the production of an internally truncated but functional dystrophin protein.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Casimersen, one of our main product candidates, uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 45 of the DMD gene. Casimersen is designed to bind to exon 45 of dystrophin pre-mRNA, resulting in exclusion, or “skipping”, of this exon during mRNA processing in patients with genetic mutations that are amenable to exon 45 skipping. Exon skipping is intended to promote the production of an internally truncated but functional dystrophin protein.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | SRP-5051, one of our main product candidates, uses our next-generation chemistry platform, PPMO, and our exon-skipping technology to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin gene. SRP-5051, a peptide conjugated PMO, is designed to bind to exon 51 of dystrophin pre-mRNA, resulting in exclusion of this exon during mRNA processing in patients with genetic mutations that are amenable to exon 51 skipping. Exon skipping is intended to promote the production of an internally truncated but functional dystrophin protein. In addition to SRP-5051, our 2018 plans currently include IND-enabling pre-clinical work on 5 additional PPMOs.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition to advancing our exon-skipping product candidates for DMD, we are working with several strategic partners under various agreements to research and develop multiple treatment approaches to DMD. These strategic partners include:
  
• | Nationwide Children’s Hospital, with whom we are collaborating on the advancement of (1) their micro-dystrophin gene therapy program under a research and exclusive license option agreement and (2) their Galgt2 gene therapy program under an exclusive license agreement;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Genethon, with whom we are collaborating on the advancement of their micro-dystrophin gene therapy program under a sponsored research and exclusive license option agreement;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Duke University, with whom we are collaborating on the advancement of gene editing CRISPR/Cas9 technology for muscular dystrophy under a sponsored research and exclusive license option agreement that grants us rights to certain of Duke University’s intellectual property for CRISPR/Cas9; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Summit (Oxford) Ltd. (“Summit”), with whom we are collaborating under an exclusive License and Collaboration Agreement that grants us exclusive rights to Summit’s utrophin modulator pipeline, including ezutromid, in Europe, Turkey and the Commonwealth of Independent States and an option to acquire rights in Latin America.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Objectives and Business Strategy
 We believe that our proprietary technology platforms and collaborations can be used to develop novel pharmaceutical products to treat a broad range of diseases and address key currently-unmet medical needs. We intend to leverage our technology platforms, organizational capabilities, collaborations and resources to become a leading developer and marketer of precision genetic medicines, including the treatment of rare, neuromuscular and other diseases, with a diversified portfolio of product candidates. In pursuit of this objective, we intend to continue engaging in the following activities:

• | executing on strategic initiatives designed to achieve a successful commercialization of and access to EXONDYS 51 in the U.S.;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanding the global footprint of eteplirsen by pursuing regulatory approval or establishing early access programs in jurisdictions where regulatory approval has not yet been obtained;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | advancing the development of exon-skipping drug and gene therapy candidates targeting DMD;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | advancing the research and development of our technology platforms, including PMO, PPMO and gene therapy, and identifying product candidates to target additional therapeutic areas;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanding our portfolio through internal research, strategic partnerships, collaborations and other potential opportunities; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ensuring we have the appropriate capitalization to fund our business objectives and strategies, including by raising additional capital through licensing, collaborations and offerings of Company equity and / or debt.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Proprietary Platform Technologies
 We have developed the following platform technologies, which can potentially be applied to various disease areas. 
 PMO. The original PMO structure and variations of this structure that are so-called PMO-based (collectively “PMO-based”) are central to our proprietary chemistry platform. PMO-based therapeutics have been safely dosed in over 400 patients. PMO-based compounds are synthetic compounds that bind to complementary sequences of RNA by standard Watson-Crick nucleobase pairing. The two key structural differences between PMO-based compounds and naturally occurring RNA are that the PMO nucleobases are bound to synthetic morpholino rings instead of ribose rings, and the morpholino rings are linked by phosphorodiamidate groups instead of phosphodiester groups. Replacement of the negatively charged phosphodiester in RNA with the uncharged phosphorodiamidate group in PMO eliminates linkage ionization at physiological pH. Due to these modifications, PMO-based compounds are resistant to degradation by plasma and intracellular enzymes. Unlike the RNA-targeted technologies such as siRNAs and DNA gapmers, PMO-based compounds operate by steric blockade rather than by cellular enzymatic degradation to achieve their biological effects. Thus, PMOs use a fundamentally different mechanism from other RNA-targeted technologies.
 PMO technologies can be used to selectively up-regulate or down-regulate the production of a target protein through pre-mRNA splice alteration. This mechanism can be used to correct disease-causing genetic errors by inducing the targeted expression of novel proteins. Thus, PMO-based compounds have the potential to be designed to create more, less, or none of certain proteins, or produce analogues of endogenous proteins. 
 The safety of therapeutic agents is paramount. We believe that our PMO-based compounds significantly reduce the potential for off-target effects specifically because of their demonstrated inactivity with key molecular mechanisms that are known to be toxicologically active when stimulated. Additionally, consistent with our research and development to date, we believe that PMO-based compounds do not exhibit coagulation and immune stimulatory effects, do not stimulate toll-like receptors or receptors of the RIG-I-like receptor family, and do not sequester metal ions away from the catalytic centers of polymerases.

In addition to our original PMO technology, we have also developed three new PMO-based chemistry platforms. We believe that the novel characteristics intrinsic to these new platforms will allow for the development of drug candidates with favorable safety and efficacy characteristics.
 PPMO. The first of these novel chemistries is based on cell-penetrating PPMOs. This technology features covalent attachment of a cell-penetrating peptide to a PMO with the goal of enhanced delivery into the cell. In pre-clinical research, our proprietary class of PPMO compounds demonstrated an increase in dystrophin production and a more durable response compared to PMO. In addition, PPMO treatment in non-human primates is well tolerated and results in high levels of exon-skipping in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle tissues. Preclinical trials also indicate that PPMOs may require less frequent dosing than PMOs, and that PPMOs could potentially be tailored to reach other organs beyond muscle. 
 PMOplus®. The second of these chemistries, PMOplus®, features the selective introduction of positive charges to the PMO backbone. We believe that PMOplus® has potentially broad therapeutic applications.
 PMO-X®. The third of these chemistries, PMO-X®, incorporates novel and proprietary chemical modifications to the PMO backbone linkages. We believe PMO-X® may provide enhanced in vivo potency and efficacy, as well as greater flexibility in the modulation of selective tissue targeting and cellular delivery.
 Emerging Technologies – Gene Therapy and Gene Editing
 As further described under “Strategic Alliances” below, we collaborate with different partners to explore a gene therapy approach to DMD. The programs in collaboration with Nationwide Children’s Hospital and Genethon look to express a smaller but still functional version of dystrophin (“micro-dystrophin”).  Micro-dystrophin is used because normal-sized dystrophin is too large to fit in an adeno-associated virus (AAV). An additional program, also in collaboration with Nationwide Children’s Hospital, aims to express the enzyme GALGT2 from an AAV vector.  We believe that GALGT2 modifies the dystrophin associated protein complex (DAPC) and up-regulates utrophin (a protein significantly homologous to dystrophin) to protect muscle from damage in the absence of dystrophin. The micro-dystrophin and GALGT2 technologies have the potential to treat all or nearly all DMD patients regardless of mutation.  
 We are also exploring, in collaboration with Duke University, the gene-editing technology CRSPR/Cas9 that aims to restore dystrophin expression by removing or “excising” exons directly from the dystrophin gene to correct out-of-frame mutations. CRSPR/Cas9 technology can also potentially be used to fix stop codon mutations in the dystrophin gene so that dystrophin can be translated to a function protein.  
 DMD Focus
 We primarily focus on rapidly advancing the development of our potentially disease-modifying pipeline of exon-skipping drug candidates targeting DMD. DMD is a rare x-linked recessive genetic disorder affecting children (primarily males) that is characterized by progressive muscle deterioration and weakness. It is the most common type of muscular dystrophy. DMD is caused by an absence of dystrophin, a protein that protects muscle cells. The absence of dystrophin in muscle cells leads to significant cell damage and ultimately causes muscle cell death and fibrotic replacement. In the absence of dystrophin protein, affected individuals generally experience the following symptoms, although disease severity and life expectancy vary:
  
• | muscle damage characterized by inflammation, fibrosis and loss of myofibers beginning at an early age;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | muscle weakness and progressive loss of muscle function beginning in the first few years of life;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | decline of ambulation and respiratory function after the age of seven;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | total loss of ambulation in the pre-teenage or early teenage years;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | progressive loss of upper extremity function during mid- to late-teens; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | respiratory and/or cardiac failure, resulting in death before the age of 30.

EXONDYS 51: Our First Commercial Product
 EXONDYS 51, our first commercial product, approved by the FDA on September 19, 2016, is indicated for the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 51 skipping. EXONDYS 51 targets the most frequent series of mutations that cause DMD. Approximately 13% of DMD patients are amenable to exon 51 skipping. We are in the process of conducting, starting or planning various EXONDYS 51 clinical trials, including studies that are required to comply with regulatory new drug application (“NDA”) and/or marketing authorization application (“MAA”) filing requirements as well as studies we need to conduct to comply with our post-marketing FDA requirements/commitments to verify and describe clinical benefit of EXONDYS 51.
 Our Pipeline: A Comprehensive Approach to DMD       In addition to EXONDYS 51, our DMD pipeline includes other product candidates, which are at various stages of development. The chart below summarizes the status of our more advanced programs as of the date of this report, including those with our strategic partners:

Golodirsen (SRP-4053). We are enrolling and dosing patients in ESSENCE (Study 4045-301), our phase 3 placebo controlled confirmatory trial in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 45 or 53 skipping using casimersen and golodirsen, respectively. Golodirsen, an exon 53-skipping product candidate, is currently in the clinic as part of a Phase 1/2 study. Part I has been completed, and Part II, an open-label portion of this study, is ongoing (Study 4053-101). In September 2017, we announced positive results of an analysis that included biopsies of the bicep muscle at baseline and on-treatment at the Part II, Week 48 time point. The study results demonstrated statistical significance on all primary and secondary biological endpoints. Golodirsen will potentially address one of the most prevalent sets of mutations in DMD that are amenable to exon-skipping. We have recently announced that we are targeting a meeting with the FDA in the first quarter of 2018 to discuss golodirsen.
 Casimersen (SRP-4045). We are enrolling and dosing patients in ESSENCE, further described above. Casimersen is an exon 45-skipping product candidate. Pursuant to an ongoing Sarepta-sponsored Phase 1/2 clinical trial studying casimersen (Study 4045-101), we have completed a dose titration portion (Phase 1) and are currently conducting the open-label portion of the study (Phase 2). Casimersen will potentially address one of the most prevalent sets of mutations in DMD that are amenable to exon-skipping.

SRP-5051. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we received clearance from the FDA and commenced a first-in-human, single ascending dose, study for our PPMO for the treatment of DMD in patients who are amenable to exon 51 skipping (SRP-5051). We expect to have data regarding safety and future dosing for SRP-5051 in the second half of 2018. We also plan to submit an IND for our next PPMO candidate, SRP-5053, in the second half of 2018. 
 Micro-Dystrophin. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the IND application for the micro-dystrophin gene therapy program, in collaboration with Nationwide Children’s Hospital, was cleared by the FDA, and a Phase 1/2a clinical trial in individuals with DMD was initiated.
 GALGT2. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the IND application for the GALGT2 gene therapy program, in collaboration with Nationwide Children’s Hospital, was cleared by the FDA, and a Phase 1/2a clinical trial in individuals with DMD was initiated.
 Our DMD pipeline includes additional product candidates, which are at various stages of development. Our pipeline reflects our multifaceted approach to DMD and our aspiration to apply our expertise in precision genetic medicine to address a variety of neuromuscular conditions.
 Manufacturing, Supply and Distribution
 We have developed proprietary state-of-the-art manufacturing techniques that allow synthesis and purification of our product and product candidates to support clinical development as well as commercialization. Our current main focus in manufacturing is to continue scaling up production of our PMO-based products and optimizing manufacturing for PPMO. We have entered into certain manufacturing and supply arrangements with third-party suppliers which will in part utilize these techniques to support production of certain of our product candidates and their components. In 2017, we opened a facility in Andover, Massachusetts, which we believe should significantly enhance our research and development manufacturing capabilities. However, we currently do not have internal manufacturing capabilities to produce our product and product candidates for commercial and/or clinical use.
 For our current and future manufacturing needs, we have entered into supply agreements with specialized contract manufacturing organizations (each a “CMO”) to produce custom raw materials, the APIs and finished goods for our product candidates. All of our CMO partners have extensive technical expertise, Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”) experience and experience manufacturing our specific technology. For our commercial DMD program, we have commenced work with our existing manufacturers to increase product capacity from mid-scale to large-scale.
 While there are a limited number of companies that can produce raw materials and APIs in the quantities and with the quality and purity that we require for our product, based on our diligence to date, we believe our current network of manufacturing partners are able to fulfill these requirements, and are capable of continuing to expand capacity as needed. Additionally, we have, and will continue to evaluate further relationships with additional suppliers to increase overall capacity as well as further reduce risks associated with reliance on a limited number of suppliers for manufacturing.  
 Manufacturers and suppliers of product candidates are subject to the FDA’s current GMP (“cGMP”) requirements and other rules and regulations prescribed by foreign regulatory authorities. We depend on our third-party partners for continued compliance with cGMP requirements and applicable foreign standards.
 EXONDYS 51 is distributed in the U.S. through a limited network of home infusion specialty pharmacy providers that deliver the medication to patients and a specialty distributor that distributes EXONDYS 51 to hospitals and hospital outpatient clinics. With respect to the pre-commercial distribution of eteplirsen to patients outside of the U.S., we have contracted with third party distributors and service providers to distribute eteplirsen in certain countries on a named patient basis and through our ex-U.S. MAP. We plan to continue building out our network for commercial distribution in jurisdictions in which eteplirsen is approved.
 Material Agreements
 We believe that our RNA-targeted technologies could be broadly applicable for the potential development of pharmaceutical products in many therapeutic areas. To further exploit our core technologies, we have and may continue to enter into research, development or commercialization alliances with universities, hospitals, independent research centers, non-profit organizations, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and other entities for specific molecular targets or selected disease indications. We may also selectively pursue opportunities to access certain intellectual property rights that complement our internal portfolio through license agreements or other arrangements.

University of Western Australia
 In April 2013, we entered into an agreement with University of Western Australia (“UWA”) under which an existing exclusive license agreement between the two parties was amended and restated (the “Amended and Restated UWA License Agreement”). The Amended and Restated UWA License Agreement grants us specific rights to the treatment of DMD by inducing the skipping of certain exons. EXONDYS 51, golodirsen and casimersen fall under the scope of the license agreement. Under the Amended and Restated UWA License Agreement, we may be required to make payments of up to $6.0 million in aggregate to UWA based on the successful achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones relating to EXONDYS 51 and up to five additional product candidates. As of the date of this report, a portion of the $6.0 million development and regulatory milestone payments has been made. We may also be obligated to make payments to UWA of up to $20.0 million upon the achievement of certain sales milestones. Additionally, we may be required to pay a low-single-digit percentage royalty on net sales of products covered by issued patents licensed from UWA during the term of the Amended and Restated UWA License Agreement. However, we have the option to purchase future royalties up-front. Under this option, prior to the First Amendment (defined below), we could be required to make a one-time royalty payment of $30.0 million to UWA. 
 In June 2016, we entered into the first amendment to the Amended and Restated UWA License Agreement (the “First Amendment”) with UWA. Under the First Amendment, we were obligated to make an up-front payment of $7.0 million to UWA upon execution of the First Amendment. Under the terms of the First Amendment, UWA has waived rights to certain royalties and amended the timing of certain other royalty payments under the Amended and Restated UWA License Agreement, including lowering the one-time royalty payment that is due by us upon exercise of the option to purchase future royalties up-front. Upon exercise of the option to purchase future royalties up-front, we will be obligated to make a $23.0 million payment to UWA. Additionally, we would still be obligated to make up to $20.0 million in payments to UWA upon achievement of certain sales milestones.
 Currently, the latest date on which an issued patent covered by our agreement with UWA expires is November 2030 (excluding any patent term extension, supplemental protection certificate or pediatric extensions that may be available); however, patents granted from pending patent applications could result in a later expiration date.
 Summit (Oxford) Ltd.
 On October 3, 2016, we entered into the exclusive Collaboration and License Agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) with Summit which grants us the exclusive right to commercialize products in Summit’s utrophin modulator pipeline in the E.U., Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Turkey and the Commonwealth of Independent States (the “Licensed Territory”).
 Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, we made an up-front payment of $40.0 million to Summit, with the potential for additional payments of up to $192.0 million based on achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones for ezutromid. For each of Summit’s future generation small molecule utrophin modulators, we may be required to make up to $290.0 million in development and regulatory milestone payments. Additionally, on a product-by-product basis, we may be required to make up to $330.0 million in sales milestone payments.
 The Collaboration Agreement also grants us an option to expand the Licensed Territory. If we exercise this option, then we will be liable for a one-time $10.0 million option fee as well as up to $7.0 million in regulatory milestone payments. For each of Summit’s lead product candidate, ezutromid, for the treatment of DMD, and its second generation and future generation small molecule utrophin modulators (collectively, the “Licensed Product”), we may be liable for up to $82.5 million in sales milestone payments.
 Additionally, we may be required to make tiered royalty payments ranging from a low to high teens percentage of net sales on a product-by-product basis in the Licensed Territory.
 Under the Collaboration Agreement, Summit was solely responsible for all research and development costs for the Licensed Products until December 31, 2017. Currently, Summit is responsible for 55.0% of the budgeted research and development costs related to the Licensed Products in the Licensed Territory, and we are be responsible for 45.0% of such costs. Any costs in excess of 110.0% of the budgeted amount will be borne by the party that incurred such costs. Summit is also obligated to spend a specified minimum amount on the research and development of certain Licensed Products prior to the end of 2019.
 -10-


Manufacture and Supply of Licensed Products
 Under the Collaboration Agreement, Summit has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to supply to us API, finished drug product and placebo so that we may conduct research, development and commercialization activities for the Licensed Products. We will also have the right to establish back up and second source suppliers under certain circumstances.
Commercialization
 Under the Collaboration Agreement, we will be solely responsible for all commercialization activities and associated costs relating to the Licensed Products in the Licensed Territory. We have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize the Licensed Products in specified countries within the Licensed Territory and, if the exclusive option to expand the Licensed Territory to include specified countries in South and Central America (the “Option Territory”) is exercised, to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize the Licensed Products in certain specified countries within the Option Territory.
 BioMarin
 License Agreement
 On July 17, 2017, Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. and Sarepta International C.V. (collectively, “Sarepta”) and BioMarin Leiden Holding BV, BioMarin Nederlands BV and BioMarin Technologies BV (collectively, “BioMarin”) executed a License Agreement (the “License Agreement”), pursuant to which BioMarin granted Sarepta a royalty-bearing, worldwide license under patent rights (“Licensed Patents”) and know-how (“Licensed Know-How”) controlled by BioMarin with respect to BioMarin’s DMD program, which are potentially necessary or useful for the treatment of DMD, to practice and exploit the Licensed Patents and Licensed Know-How in all fields of use and for all purposes, including to develop and commercialize antisense oligonucleotide products that target one or more exons of the dystrophin gene to induce exon skipping, including eteplirsen (collectively, the “Products”). 
 The license granted by BioMarin to Sarepta under the terms of the License Agreement is exclusive, even as to BioMarin, with respect to the Licensed Patents, and is non-exclusive with respect to Licensed Know-How. Under the License Agreement, BioMarin has the option to convert the exclusive license under the Licensed Patents into a co-exclusive license (co-exclusive with BioMarin) (“BioMarin Co-Exclusive Option”). 
 Under the terms of the License Agreement, Sarepta is required to pay BioMarin an upfront payment of $15 million, and BioMarin will be eligible to receive up to $20 million from Sarepta per dystrophin gene exon (other than exon 51) targeted by one or more Products in specified regulatory milestones, as well as an additional $10 million milestone, payable following the regulatory approval of eteplirsen by the EMA. BioMarin will also be eligible to receive $15 million from Sarepta upon the achievement of $650 million in sales, as well as royalties segmented by specified geographic markets, in some jurisdictions dependent on the existence of a patent, ranging from four (4) to eight (8) percentages of net sales on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis. 
 Milestones and royalties are payable with respect to eteplirsen (an exon 51 skipping Product), casimersen (an exon 45 skipping Product), golodirsen (an exon 53 skipping Product) and other Products. For eteplirsen, casimersen and golodirsen, the royalty term will expire upon the end of 2023 in the U.S., upon September 30, 2024 in the EU and no later than September 30, 2024 in other countries provided certain conditions are met. For Products other than exon 45 skipping Products, exon 51 skipping Products and exon 53 skipping Products, the royalty term will end on a country-by country basis upon expiration of granted Licensed Patents covering the applicable Product. The royalties for all Products are subject to reduction upon BioMarin’s exercise of the BioMarin Co-Exclusive Option. All royalties are subject to further potential reductions, including for generic competition and, under specified conditions, for a specified portion of payments that Sarepta may become required to pay under third-party license agreements, subject to a maximum royalty reduction.
 Unless earlier terminated, the License Agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last-to-expire royalty term. Either party may terminate the License Agreement in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach. BioMarin may also terminate the License Agreement on a Licensed Patent-by-Licensed Patent basis under specified circumstances relating to patent challenges by Sarepta.
 -11-


Settlement Agreement
 On July 17, 2017, Sarepta and The University of Western Australia on the one hand, and the BioMarin Parties and Academisch Ziekenhuis Leiden (“AZL”) on the other hand (collectively, the “Settlement Parties”), executed a Settlement Agreement pursuant to which all legal actions in the U.S. and certain legal actions in Europe (the “Actions”) would be stopped or withdrawn as between the Settlement Parties. Specifically, the terms of the Settlement Agreement require that existing efforts pursuing ongoing litigation and opposition proceedings would be stopped as between the Settlement Parties, and the Settlement Parties would cooperate to withdraw the Actions before the European Patent Office (except for actions involving third parties), the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the High Court of Justice of England and Wales, except for the cross-appeal of the Interlocutory Decision of the Opposition Division dated April 15, 2013 of the European Patent Office of EP 1619249B1 (“EP ‘249 Appeal”) in which Sarepta will withdraw its appeal and BioMarin/AZL will continue with its appeal with Sarepta having oversight of the continued appeal by BioMarin/AZL. 
 Additionally, under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the Settlement Parties agree to release each other and the customers, end-users, agents, suppliers, distributors, resellers, contractors, consultants, services and partners of Sarepta or BioMarin (as applicable) from claims and damages related to (i) the patent rights controlled by the releasing party that are involved in the Actions, (ii) with respect to Sarepta and UWA, its patent rights related to the patent rights involved in the Actions, and (iii) with respect to BioMarin and AZL, all of the Licensed Patents and Licensed Know-How. 
 Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Sarepta made an upfront payment of $20 million to BioMarin.
 Strategic Alliances
 In connection with our multi-front battle against DMD, we have entered into a number of partnering opportunities. We believe these collaborations, taken along with our own programs, represent the most comprehensive approach to treating DMD.   
Duke University
 In October 2017, we entered into a sponsored research and exclusive license option agreement with Duke University, granting us an option to an exclusive license to intellectual property and technology related to certain CRISPR/Cas9 technology developed in the laboratory of Charles A. Gersbach, Ph.D. The underlying premise of Dr. Gersbach’s approach is to restore dystrophin expression by removing or “excising” exons from the dystrophin gene. This includes a strategy to excise exons potentially enabling treatment for a majority of the DMD patient population. 
Genethon
 In May 2017, we entered into a gene therapy exclusive license option agreement with Genethon to jointly develop micro-dystrophin gene therapy products for the treatment of DMD. Under the terms of the collaboration, Genethon is responsible for the early development work, and we have the option to co-develop Genethon’s micro-dystrophin program, which includes exclusive U.S. commercial rights. 
Nationwide Children’s Hospital
 In December 2015, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Nationwide Children’s Hospital to acquire exclusive rights to their Galgt2 gene therapy program. This program explores the potential surrogate gene therapy approach to DMD. Under this approach, the gene therapy looks to induce genes that make proteins that can perform a similar function as dystrophin, with the goal of producing a muscle cell that can function normally even when dystrophin is absent. This approach has the potential to be used broadly in several muscular dystrophies, regardless of their mutation. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the IND application for the Galgt2 gene therapy program was cleared by the FDA, and a Phase 1/2a clinical trial in individuals with DMD was initiated.
 In addition, in December 2016, we entered into a research and exclusive license option agreement with Nationwide Children’s Hospital for their micro-dystrophin gene therapy program. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the IND application for the micro-dystrophin gene therapy program was cleared by the FDA, and a Phase 1/2a clinical trial in individuals with DMD was initiated at Nationwide Children’s Hospital. Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy has committed $2.2 million to the trial, with support from additional Duchenne foundations and families. We have committed to the trial through a research agreement with Nationwide Children’s Hospital, and we have an exclusive option to exclusively license the program.

Charley’s Fund Agreement
 In October 2007, Charley’s Fund, Inc. (“Charley’s Fund”), a nonprofit organization that funds drug development and discovery initiatives specific to DMD, awarded us a research grant of approximately $2.5 million and, in May 2009, the grant authorization was increased to a total of $5.0 million. Pursuant to the related sponsored research agreement, the grant was provided to support the development of product candidates related to exon 50 skipping using our proprietary exon-skipping technologies. As of December 31, 2017, Charley’s Fund had made payments of approximately $3.4 million to us. Revenue associated with this research and development arrangement is recognized based on the proportional performance method. To date, we have recognized approximately $0.1 million as revenue. We have deferred $3.3 million of previous receipts, which are anticipated to be recognized as revenue upon resolution of outstanding performance obligations.
 Previously, we noted unexpected toxicology findings in the kidney as part of our series of preclinical trials for AVI-5038, our PMO-based candidate designed for the treatment of individuals with DMD who have an error in the gene coding for dystrophin that can be treated by skipping exon 50. We have conducted additional preclinical trials and have not alleviated the toxicity problem. Pursuant to the terms of our agreement with Charley’s Fund, the receipt of additional funds is tied to the satisfaction of certain clinical milestones. Because of the toxicity issues with AVI-5038, satisfaction of the additional milestones under the agreement is unlikely and we do not expect to receive any additional funds from Charley’s Fund.

 Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technologies and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as regulatory exclusivity and contractual protections.
 Our patents and patent applications are directed to our product candidates as well as to our PMO-based technologies platform. We seek patent protection for certain of our product candidates and proprietary technologies by filing patent applications in the U.S. and other countries as appropriate.
 Our product candidates and our technologies are primarily protected by composition of matter and use patents and patent applications. Currently, our exon skipping clinical product candidates for DMD include EXONDYS 51 (eteplirsen), casimersen and golodirsen.
 We own patents and have exclusively licensed patents from UWA that provide primary patent protection for eteplirsen, casimersen and golodirsen as follows:

 In addition to the foregoing patents that protect eteplirsen, casimersen and golodirsen, we either solely own or exclusively license from UWA, BioMarin or AZL patents and patent applications in the U.S. and in major foreign markets that provide additional protection for eteplirsen as well as our DMD follow-on exon-skipping candidates (e.g., casimersen and golodirsen), which cover the composition of matter, preparation and/or uses of these drug candidates. These patents, and patent applications, if granted, expire between 2025 and 2037, such expiration dates not accounting for any patent term extension, supplemental protection certificate or pediatric extensions that may be available. 

 We separately own patents and patent applications in the U.S. and in major foreign markets that cover our proprietary PMO-based technologies (e.g., PPMO, PMOplus®, PMO-X®). These patents, and patent applications, if granted, expire between 2024 and 2037, such expiration dates not accounting for any patent term extension, supplemental protection certificate or pediatric extensions that may be available. We are the owner of multiple federal trademark registrations in the U.S. including, but not limited to, Sarepta®, Sarepta Therapeutics®, PMOplus®, PMO-X® the Sarepta Therapeutics logo, EXONDYS®, and EXONDYS 51®. In addition, we have multiple pending trademark applications in the U.S. and in major foreign markets.
 We do not have patents or patent applications in every jurisdiction where there is a potential commercial market for our product candidates. For each of our programs, our decision to seek patent protection in specific foreign markets, in addition to the U.S., is based on many factors, including:
  
• | our available resources;
--+-------------------------


• | the number and types of patents already filed or pending;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | the likelihood of success of the product candidate;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | the size of the commercial market;
--+-----------------------------------


• | the presence of a potential competitor in the market; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | whether the legal authorities in the market effectively enforce patent rights.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We continually evaluate our patent portfolio and patent strategy and believe our owned and licensed patents and patent applications provide us with a competitive advantage; however, if markets where we do not have patents or patent applications become commercially important, our business may be adversely affected.
 Government Regulation
 The testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, exportation and marketing of our products are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and in other countries. In the U.S., the FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations, regulates pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of approval of approved products, warning letters, untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecution.

U.S. Drug Approval Process
 To obtain FDA approval of a product candidate, we must, among other things, submit clinical data providing substantial evidence of safety and efficacy of the product for its intended use, as well as detailed information on product composition, its manufacture and controls and proposed labeling. The testing and collection of data and the preparation of necessary applications are expensive and time-consuming. The FDA may not act quickly or favorably in reviewing these applications, and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs in our efforts to obtain FDA approvals that could delay or preclude us from marketing our products.
 The steps required before a drug may be approved for marketing in the U.S. generally include the following:
  
• | preclinical laboratory tests and animal toxicity testing;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | submission of an IND for conducting human clinical testing to the FDA, which must become effective before human clinical trials commence;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug product for each indication, including controlled studies or comparison of treated group from clinical trials to data from natural history data or studies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission of a complete and compliant NDA containing chemistry, manufacturing and control information for the drug substance and drug product, reports of nonclinical and clinical trials, product labeling and administrative information;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the commercial manufacturing facilities at which the drug substance and drug product are made to assess compliance with cGMP;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory FDA audit of the clinical trial site(s) that generated the pivotal safety and efficacy data included in the NDA and also potentially the nonclinical trial site(s) in the form of pre-approval inspections; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 Preclinical trials may include laboratory evaluations of the product chemistry, pharmacology, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the pharmacokinetics, metabolism, bio-distribution, elimination and toxicity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements. The results of the preclinical trials, manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed first in human clinical trial protocol are submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may be initiated. The IND will become effective approximately 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the supportive data, or the study design, particularly regarding potential safety issues with conducting the clinical trial as described in the protocol. In this situation, the trials are placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns before clinical trials can proceed.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patient participants under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the study, the administration of the investigational product, study procedures, parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as a submission to the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) requirements and federal and state laws and regulations protecting study subjects. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) at or servicing each institution in which the clinical trial will be conducted. The IRB will consider, among other things, rationale for conducting the trial, clinical trial design, participant informed consent, ethical factors, the safety and rights of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution. The FDA can temporarily or permanently halt a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial subjects. The IRB may also require the clinical trial at a particular site be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with GCP or the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
 Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential drug development phases (Phases 1, 2 and 3) prior to approval, and a portion of these phases may overlap. A fourth post-approval phase (Phase 4) may include additional clinical trials. A general description of clinical trials conducted in each phase of development is provided below. However, the number of study subjects involved in each phase of drug development for rare diseases can be significantly less than typically expected for more common diseases with larger patient populations:
 -16-


 
• | Phase 1. Phase 1 clinical trials involve the initial introduction of the drug into human subjects. These studies are usually designed to determine the safety of single and multiple doses of the compound and determine any dose limiting toxicities or intolerance, as well as the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of the drug in humans. Phase 1 studies usually involve less than 100 subjects and are conducted in healthy adult volunteers, unless it is unethical to administer the study drug to healthy volunteers, in which case they are tested in patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. Phase 2 clinical trials are usually conducted in a limited patient population to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the drug for a specific indication to determine optimal dosage and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. Phase 2 studies usually involve patients with the disease under investigation and may vary in size from several dozen to several hundred.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. If an investigational drug is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in early phase studies, larger Phase 3 clinical trials are conducted to confirm clinical efficacy, dosage and safety in the intended patient population, which may involve geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials which establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for a specific indication are required for approval of an NDA. Phase 3 studies usually include several hundred to several thousand patients for larger, non-orphan drug indications/diseases. However, clinical trials for rare or orphan diseases generally have fewer patients due to their lower prevalence. For these orphan diseases, a company may also try to demonstrate efficacy and safety by comparing treated patients in clinical trials to untreated patients participating in placebo-controlled clinical trials or to observational natural history studies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4. Phase 4 trials are clinical trials conducted after the FDA has approved a product for marketing. Typically there are two forms of Phase 4 trials: those that are conducted to fulfill mandatory conditions of product approval and those that are voluntarily conducted to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. The mandatory studies are used to confirm clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under the accelerated approval regulations or to provide additional clinical safety or efficacy data for “full” approvals. Failure to promptly conduct and complete mandatory Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products approved under accelerated approval regulations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A company seeking marketing approval for a new drug in the U.S. must submit the results of the preclinical and clinical trials to the FDA in the form of an NDA, together with, among other things, detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product candidate and proposed labeling, including payment of a user fee for FDA review of the application. The user fee is waived for an application for a product intended to treat an Orphan Indication. The FDA assesses all submitted NDAs for completeness before it accepts them for filing. In some cases, the FDA may request additional information before accepting an NDA for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Applications receive either standard or priority review. Under the current goals mandated under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (the “PDUFA”), the FDA has ten months in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months for a priority NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard or priority NDAs. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the NDA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date. The FDA may refer an application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. Though the FDA is not bound by such recommendations, it considers them carefully when making decisions. If the FDA’s evaluations of the NDA and the clinical and manufacturing procedures and facilities are favorable, the FDA may issue an approval letter. If the FDA finds deficiencies in the NDA, it may issue a complete response letter, which defines the conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will issue an approval letter, authorizing commercial marketing of the drug. Sponsors that receive a complete response letter may submit to the FDA information that represents a complete response to the issues identified by the FDA. Resubmissions by the NDA sponsor in response to a complete response letter trigger new review periods of varying length (typically two to six months) based on the content of the resubmission. If the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and the commercial manufacturing procedures and facilities is not favorable, the FDA may not approve the NDA. 
 A sponsor may also seek designation of its drug candidates under programs designed to accelerate the FDA’s review and potential approval of NDAs. For instance, a sponsor may seek FDA designation of a drug candidate as a “fast track product.” Fast track products are those products intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. If fast 
 -17-


track designation is obtained, the FDA may initiate early and frequent communication and begin reviewing sections of an NDA before the application is complete. This “rolling review” is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the remaining information. Eteplirsen was granted fast track status in 2007.
 The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (“FDASIA”) enacted and signed into law in 2012 amended the criteria for the fast track and accelerated approval pathways and, as a result, the pathways now share many common eligibility criteria. FDASIA provides both the sponsor companies and the FDA with greater flexibility and expedited regulatory mechanisms. The statute clarifies that a fast track product may be approved pursuant to an accelerated approval (Subpart – H) or under the traditional approval process. In addition, FDASIA codified the accelerated approval pathway as separate and apart from the fast track pathway, meaning that for drugs to be eligible for accelerated approval, they do not need to be designated under the fast track pathway. FDASIA reinforces the FDA’s authority to grant accelerated approval of a drug that treats a serious condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies and demonstrates an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (“IMM”) that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit (i.e., an intermediate clinical endpoint). Approvals of this kind typically include requirements for appropriate post-approval Phase 4 clinical trials to confirm clinical benefit. FDASIA retains this requirement and further requires those studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. 
 Additionally, FDASIA established a new, expedited regulatory mechanism referred to as breakthrough therapy designation. Breakthrough therapy designation, fast track, and accelerated approval are not mutually exclusive and are meant to serve different purposes. The breakthrough therapy designation is focused on expediting the development and review process and by itself does not create an alternate ground for product approval. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a drug candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA issued guidance entitled “Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions––Drugs and Biologics” in May 2014. 
 Finally, if a drug candidate demonstrates a significant benefit over existing therapy, it may be eligible for priority review, which means it will be reviewed within a six-month timeframe from the date a complete NDA is accepted for filing.
 We cannot be sure that any of our drug candidates will qualify for any of these expedited development, review and approval programs, or that, if a drug does qualify, that the product candidates will be approved, will be accepted as part of any such program or that the review time will be shorter than a standard review. 
 Holders of an approved NDA are required to:
  
• | report serious adverse drug reactions to the FDA;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | submit annual and periodic reports summarizing product information and safety data;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | continue to have quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP after approval; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | conduct any post-marketing study designated as a required condition of the NDA approval.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA periodically inspects the sponsor’s records related to safety reporting and/or manufacturing; this latter effort includes assessment of compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal of the product from the market.
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity in the U.S.
 In the U.S., the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a drug for this type of disease or 
 -18-


condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that drug. An orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. An orphan drug designation does not shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. The approval of an orphan designation request does not alter the regulatory requirements and process for obtaining marketing approval. Safety and efficacy of a compound must be established through adequate and well-controlled studies. If a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is generally entitled to an orphan drug exclusivity period, which means the FDA may not grant approval to any other application to market the same chemical entity for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as where an alternative product demonstrates clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. In addition, holders of exclusivity for orphan drugs are expected to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of their orphan drugs to meet the needs of patients. Failure to do so could result in the withdrawal of orphan exclusivity for the drug. Competitors may receive approval of different drugs or biologics for the indications for which a prior approved orphan drug has exclusivity. The FDA granted orphan drug exclusivity to EXONDYS 51 through September 19, 2023, which is seven years from its approval date, September19, 2016, for the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 51 skipping.
 Distinct from orphan drug exclusivity, the FDA may provide six months of pediatric exclusivity to a sponsor of an NDA, if the sponsor conducted a pediatric study or studies of such product. This process is applied to products developed for adult use and is initiated by the FDA as a written request for pediatric studies that applies to a sponsor’s product. If the sponsor conducts qualifying studies and the studies are accepted by the FDA, then an additional six months of pediatric exclusivity will be added to previously granted exclusivity, such as orphan drug exclusivity and new chemical entity exclusivity. 
 Foreign Regulatory Requirements
 We are pursuing regulatory approval of eteplirsen in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. On December 19, 2016, we announced that the EMA validated for centralized assessment our previously submitted MAA for eteplirsen to treat DMD amenable to exon 51 skipping. The review process is underway, and we expect to receive a response from the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use on our application in mid-2018. We have also initiated key activities in support of the potential launch of eteplirsen in the EU, such as building out commercial infrastructure and scaling-up manufacturing. As of the date of this report, EXONDYS 51 has not been approved for sale or marketing by any regulatory agency or authority outside of the U.S.
 Thus, in addition to regulations in the U.S., our business is subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products.  Irrespective of whether it is an FDA approved drug or an investigational drug, approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries are required before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. For example, in the EU, the conduct of clinical trials is governed by the currently applicable Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC concerning conduct of clinical trials in the EU and the Directive 2005/28/EC laying down the principles and guidelines on GCP, a system for the approval of clinical trials that has been implemented through national legislation in the member states in the EU. Under this system, a sponsor must obtain approval from the competent national authority of an EU member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted, or in multiple member states if the clinical trial is to be conducted in a number of countries. Furthermore, the sponsor may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The Clinical Trials Application (“CTA”) must include the supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC, corresponding national laws of the member states, and as further detailed in the applicable guidance documents. 
 In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive. The new Clinical Trials Regulation has come into force, but will come into application in all EU Member States in October 2018 without the need for any national implementing legislation. The new regulation provides an overhaul of the system to ensure greater consistency in the approval of clinical trials with the highest standards of patient safety in the EU. Specifically, the new legislation seeks to simplify and streamline approval. Under the new coordinated procedure for the approval, the sponsor of a clinical trial is required to submit a single application to a reporting EU Member State. The reporting Member State will consult and coordinate with all other Member States in which the clinical trial is planned to be conducted (concerned Member States). If the application is rejected, it can be amended and resubmitted through a central EU Portal. If an approval is issued, the sponsor can start the clinical trial in all concerned Member States. However, a concerned Member State can in certain cases declare an “opt-out” from the 
 -19-


approval. In such a case, the clinical trial cannot be conducted in those Member State(s). The Clinical Trials Regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting for clinical trials.
 In order to obtain marketing authorization for a medicinal product in the EU, applicants are required to submit an MAA to either the national Competent Authorities or the EMA for the Centralized authorization procedures, using the ICH Common Technical Document (“CTD”). Applicants are required to demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicinal product in the application for marketing authorization. This includes the requirement to conduct human clinical trials to generate the necessary clinical data. Submission of data in compliance with an agreed Pediatric Investigation Plan (“PIP”) is essential for the validation or acceptance of an MAA for review. Medicinal products are authorized in the EU through one of several different procedures, either by the national competent authorities of the EU Member States (through the decentralized, mutual recognition, or national procedures), or through the centralized authorization procedure administered by the EMA. Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down the centralized procedure for the authorization of medicinal products, for which there is a single application, a single evaluation and a single approval allowing direct access to the single market of the EU. Approval via the Centralized Procedure is a two-step process whereby the CHMP first adopts an “Opinion” recommending grant of a marketing authorization following a review of the submitted data to inform an assessment of benefit/risk. The adopted Opinion can be positive or negative.  A positive CHMP opinion is followed by European Commission (“EC”) binding decision to grant a marketing authorization. The marketing authorization is valid throughout the EU and is automatically recognized in three of the four European Free Trade Association states (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). These countries collectively belong to the European Economic Area. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA leading to the CHMP opinion is 210 days (discounting procedural clock-stops) from receipt of a valid application for marketing authorization. This time period to complete the scientific review is generally longer than the 210 days as “clock stops” are required to respond to additional written or oral information requested by the EMA. Following a positive CHMP opinion, the EU Commission has 67 days to issue the EC Decision (i.e. the marketing authorization).
 Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 defines the scope and eligibility of applications for evaluation under the centralized procedure through which medicinal products must ("mandatory scope") or may ("optional scope" or "Generic/Hybrid") be authorized by the Community. The centralized procedure is compulsory for certain medicinal products, including medicinal products derived from biotechnological processes, orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products and products indicated for the treatment of certain diseases including treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. It is optional for new active substances and products that can demonstrate a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, where approval would be in the interest of public health. Our portfolio of innovative orphan products for neurodegenerative diseases is subject to the mandatory centralized procedure.
 Accelerated evaluation may be granted in exceptional cases, following a justified request from the applicant, when a medicinal product is of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. CHMP determines what constitutes a major public interest on a case by case basis. Justifications must include the major benefits expected and present the arguments to support the claim that the medicinal product introduces new methods of therapy or improves on existing methods, thereby addressing, to a significant extent, the greater unmet needs for maintaining and improving public health. During an accelerated assessment, the opinion of the CHMP is given, in principle, within 150 days. The EU Commission Decision is then issued according to the timetable described above.
 Innovative medicinal products authorized in the EU on the basis of a full stand-alone MAA consisting of pharmaceutical and preclinical testing results and clinical trial data (as opposed to an application for a generic marketing authorization that relies on the results of pre-clinical and clinical trials available in the marketing authorization dossier for another, previously approved, reference medicinal product) are treated as reference medicinal products and accordingly entitled to eight years’ data exclusivity. During this period, applicants for approval of generics of these innovative products cannot reference or rely upon data contained in the marketing authorization dossier submitted for the innovative medicinal product. Even if the generic product is approved, it cannot be placed on the market until the full 10-year period of market protection has elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference medicinal product. This period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the MA holder for the innovative product obtains an authorization for new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies or as the result of significant preclinical or clinical trials.

In the EU, orphan medicinal product designation is considered by the EMA for drugs intended to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or very serious condition with a prevalence of no more than 5 in 10,000 people in the EU. In addition, the sponsor is required to demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition that has been authorized in the EU or if such method exists, the medicinal product is of significant benefit to those affected by the condition as compared to approved methods. Medicinal products developed for treating serious and chronic conditions would likely not be marketed without incentives due to low market return on the sponsor’s development investment. As such, they may also be eligible for an EU orphan drug designation.  Benefits of being granted orphan designation are significant, including up to ten years of market exclusivity. During this ten-year period, the EMA may not accept a new marketing application for a similar medicinal product for the same therapeutic indication as the approved orphan medicinal product. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) 1901/2006 on medicinal products for pediatric use, the 10-year orphan market exclusivity can be extended to a maximum period of 12 years on the satisfactory completion of all the key elements of the agreed PIP. We have been granted orphan drug designation for eteplirsen in the EU.
 Similarly to the U.S., marketing authorization holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA and/or the national competent authorities of the EU Member States. This oversight applies both before and after the granting of manufacturing and marketing authorizations. It includes compliance with EU GMP and GDP rules in relation to such activities as distribution, importing and exporting of medicinal products, rules governing conduct of pharmacovigilance and requirements governing advertising, promotion and sale of medicinal products. 
 Failure to comply with the EU Member State laws implementing the EU Community Code on medicinal products, and EU rules governing the promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices, with the EU Member State laws that apply to the promotion of medicinal products, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or with other applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the relevant EU Member State authorities. This may include any of the following: fines, imprisonment, orders forfeiting products or prohibiting or suspending their supply to the market, orders to suspend, vary, or withdraw the marketing authorization or requiring the manufacturer to issue public warnings, or to conduct a product recall. 
 The collection and use of personal health data and other personal information in the EU is governed by the provisions of the Data Protection Directive as implemented into national laws by the EU Member States. This Directive imposes a number of strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer patient data, including sensitive health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. There is, moreover, a growing trend towards imposition of an obligation of public disclosure of clinical trial data in the EU, which adds to the complexity of obligations relating to the processing of health data from clinical trials. Such public disclosure obligations are provided in the new EU Clinical Trials Regulation, EMA disclosure initiatives, and voluntary commitments by industry. The Data Protection Directive also includes requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals prior to processing their personal data or personal health data, notification of data processing obligations to the competent national data protection authorities and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. The Data Protection Directive also prohibits the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EU Member States that are not considered by the EU to provide an adequate level of data protection. These countries include the U.S. Failure to comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Directive and the related national data protection laws of the EU Member States may result in fines and other administrative penalties. Data protection authorities from the different EU Member States may interpret the EU Data Protection Directive and national laws differently, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the EU Guidance developed at both EU level and at national level in individual EU Member States concerning implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised. 
 In December 2015, a proposal for an EU General Data Protection Regulation, intended to replace the current EU Data Protection Directive, was agreed between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission. The EU General Data Protection Regulation, which was officially adopted in April 2016 and will be applicable in May 2018, will introduce new data protection requirements in the EU, as well as substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules. The EU General Data Protection Regulation will increase our responsibility and liability in relation to any personal data that we process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the new EU data protection rules.

The approval process in other countries outside the U.S. and the EU varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for the FDA approval. In addition, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement for market access vary greatly from country to country. In all cases, clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 Expanded / Early Access 
 In certain countries, drug products approved in the U.S. or the EU can be accessed by patients before the drug has obtained marketing approval in such country. There are various forms of this access including, but not limited to, the actual purchase of product by the purchaser, which is often times the government for patients, on a named patient basis, and providing the product free of charge on a named patient basis for compassionate use. Each country has its own laws and regulations that apply to these forms of access and the extent and nature of such laws and regulations vary by country.
 We have initiated a MAP for eteplirsen in select countries in Europe, North America, South America and Asia where it currently has not been approved. The MAP provides a mechanism through which physicians can prescribe eteplirsen, within their professional responsibility, to patients who meet pre-specified medical and other criteria and can secure funding. We have commenced shipments through the MAP and continue to expand the MAP to include more countries. In addition, we contracted with third party distributors and service providers to distribute eteplirsen in certain areas outside the U.S., such as Israel and certain countries in the Middle East, on a named patient basis.
 Other Regulatory Requirements
 In addition to regulations enforced by the FDA and foreign authorities relating to the clinical development and marketing of products, we are or may become subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential future foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations. Although we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws that apply to us, we cannot predict whether new regulatory restrictions will be imposed by state or federal regulators and agencies or whether existing laws and regulations will adversely affect us in the future.
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws
 We are subject to various federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, including anti-kickback and false claims laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by crime or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and/or exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Federal and state authorities are paying increased attention to enforcement of these laws within the pharmaceutical industry, and private individuals have been active in alleging violations of the laws and brining suits on behalf of the government under the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”). Violations of international fraud and abuse laws could result in similar penalties, including exclusion from participation in health programs outside the U.S. If we were subject to allegations concerning, or were convicted of violating, these laws, our business could be harmed. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute generally prohibits, among other things, a pharmaceutical manufacturer from directly or indirectly soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration in cash or in kind where one purpose is either to induce the referral of an individual for, or the purchase or prescription of a particular drug that is payable by a federal health care program, including Medicare or Medicaid. The Healthcare Reform Act clarifies the intent requirements of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, providing that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or a specific intent to violate the statute. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute can result in exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs as well as civil and criminal fines and penalties of up to $50,000 per violation and three times the amount of the unlawful remuneration. In addition, the Healthcare Reform Act revised the FCA to provide that a claim arising from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. The majority of states also have anti-kickback, false claims, and similar fraud and abuse laws and although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad, and there may not be regulations, guidance or court decisions that apply the laws to particular industry practices. There is therefore a possibility that our practices might be challenged under the anti-kickback statutes or similar laws. 
 -22-


Federal and state false claims laws generally prohibit anyone from knowingly and willfully, among other activities, presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for drugs or services that are false or fraudulent (which may include claims for services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary services). False or fraudulent claims for purposes of the FCA carry fines and civil penalties for violations ranging from $10,957 to $21,916 for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the federal government and, most critically, may provide the basis for exclusion from federally funded healthcare programs. There is also a criminal FCA statute by which individuals or entities that submit false claims can face criminal penalties. In addition, under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General has the authority to exclude from participation in federal health care programs or to impose civil penalties against any person who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, certain false or otherwise improper claims. Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. 
 Laws and regulations have also been enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers; require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government; and/or require disclosure to the government and/or public of financial interactions (so-called “sunshine laws”). The Healthcare Reform Act requires manufacturers to submit information to the FDA on the identity and quantity of drug samples requested and distributed by a manufacturer during each year. Recent scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing practices by certain companies may lead to changes in laws that currently allow substantial flexibility in pricing decisions by pharmaceutical manufacturers. Such changes could occur at the federal level or state level and may be adopted by statute, rule, or sub-regulatory policies. State laws may also require disclosure of pharmaceutical pricing information and marketing expenditures. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our activities could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent federal and state laws and regulations.
 Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement
 Our first commercial product in the U.S., EXONDYS 51, was granted accelerated approval by the FDA on September 19, 2016. We have an ongoing dialogue with payors with the goal of obtaining broad coverage for EXONDYS 51. To date, payors’ policies on coverage for EXONDYS 51 have varied on their approach, including policies that allow broad coverage per the EXONDYS 51 prescribing information, policies that provide limited coverage, to policies that have denied coverage. The majority of payors have policies that provide for case-by-case coverage or restricted coverage. Our revenue depends, in part, upon the price that payors, including government authorities or programs, private health insurers and other organizations, reimburse on behalf of patients and physicians for the cost of EXONDYS 51. 
 Third Party Reimbursement and Pricing in the U.S. 
 Commercial Insurance. Coverage and reimbursement of our EXONDYS 51 varies from commercial payor to commercial payor. Many commercial payors, such as managed care plans, manage access to FDA approved products’ coverage partly to control costs to their plans, and may use drug formularies and medical policies to limit their exposure. Exclusion from policies can directly reduce product usage in the payor’s patient population and may negatively impact utilization in other payor plans, as well.
 Medicaid. Our product EXONDYS 51 is eligible to be reimbursed by Medicaid. Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that is administered by the states for low income and disabled beneficiaries. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, participating manufacturers are required to pay a rebate for each unit of product reimbursed under the state Medicaid programs. The amount of the rebate for each product is set by law and may be subject to an additional discount if certain pricing increases more than inflation. State Medicaid programs and Medicaid managed care plans can seek additional “supplemental” rebates from manufacturers in connections with favorable positioning on formularies. 
 Medicare. Medicare is a federal program that is administered by the federal government that covers individuals age 65 and over as well as those with certain disabilities. Our product EXONDYS 51 is eligible for reimbursement under Medicare Part B. Medicare Part B generally covers drugs that must be administered by physicians. Medicare Part B pays for such drugs under a payment methodology based on the average sales price (“ASP”) of the drugs. Reimbursement 
 -23-


levels and reimbursement methodologies have come under scrutiny and may be subject to change. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) are also increasingly bundling drug reimbursement into procedure costs, which can severely decrease the reimbursement rates for some manufacturers’ drugs. 
 Federal Purchasers. Drug products are subject to discounted pricing when purchased by federal agencies via the Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”). FSS participation is required for a drug product to be covered and reimbursed by certain federal agencies and for coverage under Medicaid, Medicare Part B and the Public Health Service (“PHS”) 340B drug pricing program. FSS pricing is negotiated periodically with the Department of Veterans Affairs. FSS pricing is intended not to exceed the price that a manufacturer charges its most-favored non-federal customer for its product. In addition, prices for drugs purchased by the Veterans Administration, Department of Defense (including drugs purchased by military personnel and dependents through the TRICARE retail pharmacy program), Coast Guard, and PHS are subject to a cap on pricing (known as the “federal ceiling price”) and may be subject to an additional discount if pricing increases more than the rate of inflation.
 PHS 340B Drug Pricing Program. To maintain coverage of drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and Medicare Part B, manufacturers are required to extend discounts to certain purchasers under the PHS 340B drug pricing program. Purchasers eligible for discounts include hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of financially needy patients, community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the PHS. 
 Healthcare and Other Reform. In the U.S., federal and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reform delivery of, or payment for, health care, which include initiatives to reduce the cost of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Healthcare Reform Act, which expanded health care coverage through Medicaid expansion and the implementation of the individual mandate for health insurance coverage and which included changes to the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government healthcare programs. Under the Trump administration, there have been ongoing efforts to modify or repeal all or certain provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act. The Trump administration may also take executive action in the absence of legislative action.  For example, in October 2017, the President announced that his administration will withhold the cost-sharing subsidies paid to health insurance exchange plans serving low-income enrollees. Actions by the administration are widely expected to lead to fewer Americans having more comprehensive health insurance compliant with the Healthcare Reform Act, even in the absence of a legislative repeal.  Tax reform legislation was also enacted at the end of 2017 that includes provisions that will affect healthcare insurance coverage and payment, such as the elimination of the tax penalty for individuals who do not maintain sufficient health insurance coverage beginning in 2019.  In a November 2017 report, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the elimination will increase the number of uninsured by 4 million in 2019 and 13 million in 2027.
 There have also been efforts by government officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products, including legislation on drug importation. Recently, there has been considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and proposals to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals.  There have also been recent state legislative efforts to address drug costs, which generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug costs or limiting drug prices.
 General legislative cost control measures may also affect reimbursement for our products. The Budget Control Act, as amended, resulted in the imposition of 2% reductions in Medicare (but not Medicaid) payments to providers in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Any significant spending reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented and/or any significant taxes or fees that may be imposed on us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
 Third Party Reimbursement and Pricing outside the U.S.
 In the EU and certain other territories, price controls and Health Technology Assessments for new, highly priced medicines are expected. Uncertainty exists about the pricing and reimbursement status of newly approved products in the EU. Criteria such as cost-effectiveness, cost per quality-adjusted life year, budget impact, or others, in addition to the clinical benefit, are often required to demonstrate added value or benefit of a drug and vary by country. Third party reimbursement limits may reduce the demand for our products. The pace of the application process in some countries could also delay commercial product launches. Gaining acceptance of our product pipeline and an

economically viable reimbursement terms in the EU and other markets will require strong education and awareness efforts around DMD.
 Competition
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive, and any product candidate developed by us would likely compete with existing drugs and therapies. There are many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, public and private universities, government agencies and research organizations that compete with us in developing various approaches to the treatment of rare, neuromuscular and other diseases. Many of these organizations have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing and marketing resources than we have. Several of them have developed or are developing therapies that could be used for treatment of the same diseases that we are targeting. In addition, some of these competitors have significantly greater commercial infrastructures than we have. Our ability to compete successfully will depend largely on:

• | our ability to complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the efficacy, safety and reliability of our product candidates;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | the timing and scope of regulatory approvals;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | product acceptance by physicians and other health-care providers;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | protection of our proprietary rights and the level of generic competition;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the ability to have freedom to operate to commercialize our product candidates;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the speed at which we develop product candidates;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | our ability to supply commercial quantities of a product to the market;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | obtaining reimbursement for product use in approved indications;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | our ability to recruit and retain skilled employees; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | the availability of substantial capital resources to fund development and commercialization activities, including the availability of funding from the U.S. government.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 DMD Program Competition. Currently, other than EXONDYS 51, no disease-modifying product in the U.S. has been approved for the treatment of DMD and no such product is commercially available outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Other companies, however, have product candidates or other interests in development for the treatment of DMD.  
 PTC Therapeutics (“PTC”) has a small molecule candidate, ataluren, which targets nonsense mutations in development. The European Commission granted conditional marketing authorization for ataluren for the treatment of a subset of DMD patients in August 2014. In January 2016, PTC announced the completion of its rolling submission of an NDA for ataluren to the FDA and submission of its Phase 3 Ataluren Confirmatory Trial (“ACT”) DMD clinical trial result to the EMA. In October 2017, PTC announced its receipt of a complete response letter from FDA and PTC’s intent to file a formal dispute resolution request. In February 2018, PTC announced that the FDA reiterated its prior position and denied PTC’s appeal of the complete response letter. Ataluren uses a distinct scientific approach that addresses a different genotype of DMD patients compared to eteplirsen. Therefore, we do not believe ataluren is appropriate for the treatment of DMD patients that are amenable to exon-skipping therapy.
 BioMarin has an exon 51-skipping product candidate, drisapersen. An NDA for drisapersen was filed by the FDA and an MAA was submitted to the EMA in June 2015. In January 2016, the FDA issued a complete response letter and declined the approval for drisapersen for the treatment of DMD. BioMarin announced on May 31, 2016 its intent to discontinue clinical and regulatory development of drisapersen as well as its other clinical stage candidates, BMN 044, BMN 045 and BMN 053, then-currently in Phase 2 studies for distinct forms of DMD.  BioMarin further announced its intent to continue to explore the development of next generation oligonucleotides for the treatment of DMD.
 Wave Life Sciences (“Wave”) announced the selection of its exon-skipping candidate, WVE-210201, to target deletions of Exon 51. In November 2017, Wave announced the initiation of a global Phase 1 clinical trial for WVE-210201 in DMD patients amenable to exon 51 skipping.
 -25-


Nippon Shinyaku Co. Ltd. (“Nippon”) has reported early clinical development data for its exon 53 skipping candidate, NS-065, and the first patient dosed in a phase 2 study.  An extension study of this Phase 2 study currently is enrolling by invitation. It has also reported a phase 1/2 study in Japan. NS-065 has been reported to have received an orphan drug designation in the U.S. and was granted Fast Track by FDA.
 Daiichi Sankyo has reported a phase 1/2 clinical trial being underway in Japan for its exon 45 skipping candidate, DS-5141b.  
 Solid Biosciences, LLC (“Solid”) has reported that the safety and efficacy of its micro-dystrophin gene transfer product candidate for DMD, SGT-001, are being evaluated in a phase 1/2 clinical trial. 
 Pfizer Inc., following its acquisition of Bamboo Therapeutics, Inc., has initiated a phase 1 clinical trial to test the safety and tolerability of its micro-dystrophin gene transfer product candidate for DMD, PF-06939926.
 Other companies continue to pursue approval of products for the treatment of DMD and their products may or may not prove to be safer and/or more efficacious than the products and product candidates in our DMD pipeline. Regarding any of these competitors, it is unknown if further clinical development of these or other exon-skipping compounds is planned.
 Additionally, companies such as Santhera, Summit, Catabasis, Pfizer and Tivorsan have unique product candidates in different stages of development or approval in DMD which we believe could be seen as complementary to exon skipping and not a direct replacement of our clinical candidates at this time.
 In addition, several companies and institutions have recently entered into collaborations or other agreements for the development of product candidates, including mRNA, gene (CRISPR, AAV, etc.) or small molecule therapies that are potential competitors for therapies being developed in the muscular dystrophy, neuromuscular and rare disease space, including but not limited to Biogen Inc., Ionis, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Sanofi, Shire, Eli Lilly, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Moderna Therapeutics, Inc., Summit, Akashi, Catabasis, Capricor Therapeutics, Oxford University, Exonics Therapeutics, and Editas Medicine.
 Platform Technology Competition. We believe that other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies share a focus on RNA-targeted drug discovery and development. Competitors with respect to our RNA-targeted technologies include, but are not limited to, Alnylam, Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corp., Ionis, BioMarin, Sanofi, Synthena AG, Santaris Pharma A/S (now Roche), Nippon, Daiichi Sankyo and Wave.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 255 employees, 113 of whom hold advanced degrees. Of these employees, 121 are engaged directly in research and development activities and 134 are in selling, general and administration including 29 in the sales force. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we consider relations with our employees to be good.
General Corporate Information
 We were originally incorporated in the State of Oregon on July 22, 1980, and on June 6, 2013, we reincorporated in the State of Delaware. Our principal executive offices are located at 215 First Street, Suite 415, Cambridge, MA 02142 and our telephone number is (617) 274-4000. On July 12, 2012, our common stock began trading under the symbol “SRPT” on the NASDAQ Global Market on a split-adjusted basis following a one-for-six reverse stock split that was effective on July 11, 2012. Our common stock is quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the same symbol. 
 While we achieve revenue from EXONDYS 51 in the U.S. and through distribution of eteplirsen on a named-patient basis or through our MAP outside the U.S., we are likely to continue to incur operating losses in the near term associated with our ongoing operations, research and development activities and potential business development activities. For more information about our revenues and operating losses, see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 -26-


As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $1,089.9 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments, consisting of $599.7 million of cash and cash equivalents, $479.4 million of short-term investments, $10.0 million of long-term investments and $0.8 million of long-term restricted cash and investments. We believe that our balance of cash, cash equivalents and investments is sufficient to fund our current operational plan for at least the next twelve months. In addition to pursuing additional cash resources through public or private financings, we may also seek to enter into contracts, including collaborations or licensing agreements with respect to our technologies, with third parties, including government entities.
