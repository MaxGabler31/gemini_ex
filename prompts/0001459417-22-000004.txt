Item 1.    Business
Overview
We are a leading online education platform company. Our mission is to expand access to high-quality educational opportunities that unlock human potential. In November 2021, we acquired substantially all of the assets of edX Inc. (the “edX Acquisition”), including the edX brand, website and marketplace. As a result of the edX Acquisition, we expanded our digital education offerings to include open courses and micro-credential offerings at the undergraduate and graduate levels and added an education consumer marketplace, edx.org, with over 42 million registered learners.
Following the completion of the edX Acquisition, we now serve more than 230 top-ranked global universities and other leading institutions, and offer more than 3,600 high-quality online learning opportunities, including open courses, executive education offerings, boot camps, micro-credentials, professional certificates as well as undergraduate and graduate degree programs. 
With the edX Acquisition, we are now positioned as one of the world’s most comprehensive free-to-degree online learning platforms. We believe our platform and robust consumer marketplace provide our clients with the digital infrastructure to launch world-class online education offerings and allow students to easily access high-quality, job-relevant education offerings without the barriers of cost or location. 
Business Segments
We have two reportable segments: the Degree Program Segment and the Alternative Credential Segment.
In our Degree Program Segment, we provide the technology and services to nonprofit colleges and universities to enable the online delivery of degree programs. Students enrolled in these programs are generally seeking an undergraduate or graduate degree of the same quality they would receive on campus.
In our Alternative Credential Segment, we provide premium online open courses, executive education programs, technical, skills-based boot camps and micro-credential programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels through relationships with nonprofit colleges and universities and other leading institutions. Students enrolled in these offerings are generally seeking to reskill or upskill for career advancement or personal development through shorter duration, lower-priced offerings. Following the edX Acquisition, we changed the name of our “short courses” in our Alternative Credential Segment to “executive education” to more clearly align with industry terminology. 
Our Platform
Our platform consists of a seamlessly integrated ecosystem of technology, people and data. Through our platform, we provide the tools and services our clients need to bring high-quality online education offerings to students around the world and we provide students an expansive range of offerings to support their educational and career goals.
Degree Program Segment: Technology and Services

For our open course and micro-credential offerings, we provide course strategy and design consultation services and other self-help resources to assist our clients in creating engaging content for our platform. 
edX Marketplace
Our marketplace, available at edX.org, provides the full catalog of online offerings ranging from free offerings to graduate degree programs that we enable. Once we have completed integration of the edX marketplace with our broader business, we believe this thriving consumer marketplace will enable our clients to efficiently reach a large audience of global learners and expand the impact of their institutions and brands, and allow students to access relevant, high-quality education offerings from top-tier academic institutions and other industry leading entities. We believe the edX marketplace provides an opportunity to increase the efficiency of our marketing efforts by combining the strength of the edX brand and large global audience with a comprehensive range of high-quality education offerings and our strong offering-specific marketing capabilities. As we continue to increase the range of offerings on the edX marketplace, we believe we will attract additional students to the marketplace, some of whom will enroll in additional offerings.
Key Benefits of our Solution
We believe our solutions provide the following key benefits:
•Extend Institutional Reach and Impact. Our platform enables our university and institutional clients to extend their brands and increase their impact by delivering high-quality education offerings to students anywhere in the world at a wide range of prices and credential levels. 
•Low Financial Risk for Clients. We make many of the initial investments required to launch new offerings across our portfolio. In our Degree Program Segment, in particular, we make significant investments in technology, integration, content production, marketing, student and faculty support, and other services. Our revenue-share model, combined with long contractual terms in this segment, enables us to make these investments without significant financial risk to our university clients. Our platform provides a broad set of capabilities that would otherwise require universities to 
purchase multiple, disparate point solutions, and significantly increase headcount in marketing, data analytics, technology and other areas.
•Marketing Reach. As part of the edX Acquisition, we acquired edX’s thriving consumer marketplace and global brand. Once we have completed our integration activities, we believe the edX marketplace together with the strong consumer-facing brand, will enable our clients to efficiently reach a large audience of potential students. As we continue to expand the scope of offerings on the edX marketplace, we believe we will generate additional interest in our offerings among students and incentivize clients to create additional offerings on our platform ranging from free-to-degree.
•Comprehensive Scope of Offerings. We provide a broad range of education offerings to students that range from free open courses to graduate degree programs. Our breadth of offerings allows students to gain the skills and credentials they need to reach their career and personal goals and provides the flexibility to “stack” credentials to progress towards a more advanced credential or degree. 
•Outcomes. Our platform allows students to pursue a wide range of high-quality education offerings provided by leading universities and other top-tier institutions. Through these offerings, students obtain valuable skills and credentials that can create upward career mobility, facilitate a transition to a new field and lead to personal enrichment.
•Scalable Support. High-quality student support is a central pillar of our platform. We provide student support for all offerings in our portfolio that is tailored to student needs based on offering type. For many of our offerings our support teams work with prospective students prior to enrollment as they consider and apply to a particular offering. Once enrolled, we augment the academic experience by assigning a dedicated advisor to provide ongoing individualized non-academic support and career guidance for certain offerings. For our self-paced offerings such as our open courses, we provide students with platform technical support as needed. 
Our Growth Strategy
We intend to continue our industry leadership as a provider of a digital education platform that enables our clients to deliver high-quality online education at scale and provides students with lifelong learning opportunities to unlock their potential. Our approach to growth is disciplined and focused on long-term success. The principal elements of our strategy are:
•Adding Offerings with New and Existing Clients and Increasing Enrollments in Our Offerings. We intend to add additional top-tier universities and other entities to our client base and to increase the number of offerings we power on behalf of our existing client base. We believe that once we have fully integrated the edX marketplace with our existing business, and enhanced search functionality of the marketplace, potential students will be able to more efficiently search for and find courses of interest from free-to-degree. We also intend to scale enrollments in our offerings by expanding the reach and diversity of our marketing channels and making incremental improvements to our learning technology. 
•Expanding Offerings from Free-to-Degree. We intend to continue evolving our offering portfolio to meet the demands of lifelong learners by expanding our offerings in accordance with our client’s roadmaps. This expansion could include new offering types, course bundles or stacks, or additional credentialing options. 
•Expanding Enterprise Channel. We believe expanding our enterprise channel presents a significant opportunity for us. Our deep catalog of over 3,600 high-quality free-to-degree offerings enables us to partner with a wide range of institutions seeking to upskill and train employees at any level of their organizations with exceptional digital learning experiences in job-relevant subject areas. 
•Expanding Globally. The edX marketplace generates significant traffic across the globe and the edX offerings have a large non-US student base. We believe this creates a significant opportunity to expand our offerings with top-tier international universities and other entities and to attract additional non-US students to our existing offerings.
Clients
As of December 31, 2021, we had more than 230 clients with more than 3,600 offerings. Our clients are nonprofit colleges and universities as well as leading corporations and non-profit entities. 
Competition
The overall market for technology solutions that enable higher education providers to deliver education online is highly fragmented, rapidly evolving and subject to changing technology, shifting needs of students, faculty and clients and frequent introductions of new delivery methods. 
We face competition from various companies in the online education sector, including companies that provide direct-to-consumer online education offerings, corporate training programs and technology solutions and services to universities that offer online learning programs. Many of these companies provide components of the technology and services we provide, and these companies may choose to pursue some of the institutions we target. Moreover, nonprofit colleges and universities may elect to continue using or develop their own online learning solutions in-house.
We expect that the competitive landscape will continue to expand as the market for online education offerings at nonprofit institutions matures. We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following: 
•quality and reputation of university client base and track record of performance;
•robustness and evolution of technology solutions and marketplace capabilities;
•scope and quality of educational content;
•strength of brand awareness and reputation among consumers; 
•ability of online education offerings to deliver desired student outcomes;
•breadth and depth of service offering;
•ability to make significant investments in launching and operating degree programs;
•expertise in marketing, student acquisition and student retention;
•student and faculty experience;
•ease of deployment and use of technology solutions; and
•level of customization, configurability, integration, security, scalability and reliability of technology solutions.
We believe we compete favorably on the basis of these factors. Our ability to remain competitive will depend, to a great extent, on our ability to consistently deliver high-quality offerings; meet client needs for content development; attract, support and retain students; and deliver desired student, faculty and client outcomes.
Seasonality
We experience seasonality in our marketing and sales expense in both our Degree Program Segment and our Alternative Credential Segment. We typically reduce our paid search and other marketing and sales efforts during late November and December because of less demand during the holiday season. We generally do not experience pronounced seasonality in our revenue, although revenue can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to variations driven by the varying academic schedules of our offerings and university clients.
Intellectual Property
We protect our intellectual property by relying on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and contractual agreements. For example, we rely on trademark protection in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions to protect our rights to various marks, including 2U, NO BACK ROW, GETSMARTER, TRILOGY, EDX and other distinctive logos associated with our brand. We continue to evaluate developing and expanding our intellectual property rights in patents, trademarks and copyrights, as available through registration in the United States and internationally.
We ensure that we own intellectual property created for us by signing agreements with employees, independent contractors, consultants, companies, and any other third party that creates intellectual property for us that assign any intellectual property rights to us.
We have also established business procedures designed to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information, including the use of confidentiality agreements with employees, independent contractors, consultants and companies with which we conduct business.
We also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our technology or services. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our technology and services, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms.
For important additional information related to our intellectual property position, please review the information set forth in “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
Education Laws and Regulations
The higher education industry is heavily regulated. Institutions of higher education that award degrees and certificates to signify the successful completion of an academic program are subject to regulation from three primary entities: the U.S. Department of Education, or DOE, accrediting agencies and state licensing authorities. Each of these entities promulgates and enforces its own laws, regulations and standards, which we refer to collectively as education laws.
We contract with postsecondary institutions that are subject to education laws. In addition, we ourselves are required to comply with certain education laws as a result of our role as a service provider to institutions of higher education, either directly or indirectly through our contractual arrangements with university clients. Our failure, or that of our university clients, to comply with education laws could adversely impact our operations. As a result, we work closely with our university clients to maintain compliance with education laws.
Federal Laws and Regulations
Under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, or the HEA, institutions offering postsecondary education must comply with certain laws and related regulations promulgated by the DOE in order to participate in the Title IV federal student financial assistance programs. Most of our university clients participate in the Title IV programs.
The HEA and the regulations promulgated thereunder are frequently revised, repealed or expanded. Congress historically has reauthorized and amended the HEA at regular intervals but has failed to do so in recent years. The reauthorization process and congressional oversight of the DOE is nonetheless ongoing, such as oversight and investigations of the education sector and DOE conducted on behalf of Congress by the Government Accountability Office, or GAO.
The reauthorization of the HEA, or other legislation, could alter the regulatory landscape of the higher education industry, and thereby impact the manner in which we conduct business and serve our university clients. In addition, the DOE frequently conducts rulemakings that may impact our business and we expect each incoming administration to change the DOE rules in accordance with its policy priorities regardless of whether the HEA is reauthorized by Congress. The DOE also issues formal and informal guidance instructing institutions of higher education and other covered entities how to comply with various federal laws and regulations. DOE guidance is subject to change and such changes may impact our business model.
Although we are not considered an institution of higher education and we do not directly participate in Title IV programs, we are required to comply with certain regulations promulgated by the DOE as a result of our role as a service provider to institutions that do participate in Title IV programs. These include, for example, regulations governing student privacy under Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, or FERPA. While online executive education courses and boot camps are typically not eligible for Title IV aid, when offered by or on behalf of Title IV eligible institutions, many education laws, such as FERPA, remain applicable to us or our university clients even in the Alternative Credential Segment.
Current DOE rules material to our business include the incentive compensation rule, the misrepresentation rule, the “written arrangements” rules and state authorization requirements, which are discussed in further detail below. 
Incentive Compensation Rule
The HEA provides that any institution that participates in the Title IV federal student financial assistance programs must agree with the DOE that the institution will not provide any commission, bonus or other incentive payment to any person or entity engaged in any student recruiting or admission activities as those terms and activities are defined in DOE regulations and policy guidance.
Under DOE’s incentive compensation regulations, each higher education institution agrees that it will not “provide any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based in any part, directly or indirectly, upon success in securing enrollments or the award of financial aid, to any person or entity who is engaged in any student recruitment or admission activity, or in making decisions regarding the award of Title IV, HEA program funds.” Pursuant to this rule, we are prohibited from offering our covered employees, who are those involved with or responsible for recruiting or admissions activities, any bonus or incentive-based compensation based on the successful recruitment, admission or enrollment of students into a postsecondary institution.
At the time the incentive compensation rule was last revised, in July 2011, the revised rule initially raised a question as to whether entities could be prohibited from entering into tuition revenue-sharing arrangements with university clients. On March 17, 2011, the DOE issued official agency guidance, known as a “Dear Colleague Letter,” or the DCL, providing guidance on this point. The DCL states that “[t]he Department generally views payment based on the amount of tuition generated as an indirect payment of incentive compensation based on success in recruitment and therefore a prohibited basis upon which to measure the value of the services provided” and that “[t]his is true regardless of the manner in which the entity compensates its employees.” But the DCL also provides an important exception to the ban on tuition revenue-sharing arrangements between institutions and third parties. According to the DCL, the DOE does not consider payment based on the 
amount of tuition generated by an institution to violate the incentive compensation ban if the payment compensates an “unaffiliated third party” that provides a set of “bundled services” that includes recruitment services, such as those we provide. Example 2-B in the DCL is described as a “possible business model” developed “with the statutory mandate in mind.” Example 2-B describes the following as a possible business model:
“A third party that is not affiliated with the institution it serves and is not affiliated with any other institution that provides educational services, provides bundled services to the institution including marketing, enrollment application assistance, recruitment services, course support for online delivery of courses, the provision of technology, placement services for internships, and student career counseling. The institution may pay the entity an amount based on tuition generated for the institution by the entity’s activities for all the bundled services that are offered and provided collectively, as long as the entity does not make prohibited compensation payments to its employees, and the institution does not pay the entity separately for student recruitment services provided by the entity.”
The DCL guidance indicates that an arrangement that complies with Example 2-B will be deemed to be in compliance with the incentive compensation provisions of the HEA and the DOE’s regulations. Our business model and contractual arrangements with our university clients closely follow Example 2-B in the DCL. In addition, we assure that none of our “covered employees” are paid any bonus or other incentive compensation in violation of the rule.
Because the bundled services rule was promulgated in the form of agency guidance issued by the DOE in the form of a DCL and is not codified by statute or regulation, the rule could technically be altered or removed without customary administrative procedural requirements, such as adequate prior notice, that accompany formal agency rulemaking. Similarly, a court could invalidate the rule in an action involving our company or our university clients, or in an action that does not involve us at all. Finally, while most states defer to DOE regulations, different versions of the federal incentive compensation rule exist under state law, and such statutes or rules, or their interpretation, may change at any time. The revision, removal or invalidation of the bundled services rule by Congress, the DOE or a court could require us to change our business model, and separate revisions at the state level could require us to amend certain of our contracts.
Misrepresentation Rule
The HEA prohibits an institution that participates in the Title IV programs from engaging in any “substantial misrepresentation” regarding three broad subject areas: (i) the nature of the school’s education programs, (ii) the school’s financial charges and (iii) the employability of the school’s graduates.
Under the DOE rule, “misrepresentation” is defined broadly as any false, erroneous or misleading statement, written, visual or oral. This may include even statements that “have the likelihood or tendency to deceive.” Therefore, a statement need not be intentionally deceitful to qualify as a misrepresentation. “Substantial misrepresentation” is defined loosely as a misrepresentation on which the person to whom it was made could reasonably be expected to rely, or has reasonably relied, to that person’s detriment.
The regulation also covers statements made by any representative of an institution, including agents, employees and subcontractors, and statements made directly or indirectly to any third party, including state agencies, government officials or the public, and not just statements made to students or prospective students.
Violations of the misrepresentation rule are subject to various sanctions by the DOE and violations may be used as a basis for legal action by third parties or as a defense to the obligation to repay student loans. The DOE rules regarding misrepresentation change frequently and DOE has indicated it may revise aspects of the rule and related student recruiting standards as part of its ongoing rulemakings. In addition, the DOE has designated an investigations unit to enforce rules related to deceptive student marketing, which is expected to work with other federal agencies. 
Similar rules apply under state laws or are incorporated in institutional accreditation standards, and the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, applies similar rules that prohibit any unfair or deceptive marketing practices by vendors in the education sector. As a result, we and our employees and subcontractors, as agents of our university clients, must use a high degree of care to comply with such rules and are prohibited by contract from making any false, erroneous or misleading statements about our university clients. To avoid an issue under the misrepresentation rule and similar state and federal rules, we assure that all marketing materials are approved in advance by our university clients before they are used by our employees.
Accreditation Rules and Standards
Accrediting agencies primarily examine the academic quality of the instructional programs of an educational institution, and a grant of accreditation is typically viewed as confirmation that an institution or an institution’s programs meet generally accepted academic standards. Accrediting agencies also review the administrative and financial operations of the institutions they accredit to ensure that each institution has the resources to perform its educational mission. The DOE also relies on accrediting agencies to determine whether institutions qualify to participate in Title IV programs.
In addition to institutional accreditation, colleges and universities may require specialized programmatic accreditation for particular educational programs. Many states and professional associations require professional programs to be accredited, and require individuals to have graduated from accredited programs in order to sit for professional license exams. Programmatic accreditation, while not a sufficient basis for institutional Title IV Program certification by the DOE, assists graduates to practice or otherwise secure appropriate employment in their chosen field. Common fields of study subject to programmatic accreditation include teaching and nursing.
Although we are not an accredited institution and are not required to maintain accreditation, accrediting agencies are responsible for reviewing an accredited institution’s third-party contracts with service providers like us and may require an institution to obtain approval from or to notify the accreditor in connection with such arrangements. One purpose of the notification and approval requirements is to verify that the accredited institution remains responsible for providing academic instruction leading to a credential and provides oversight of other activities undertaken by third parties like us that are within the scope of its accreditation. We work closely with our university clients to assure that the standards of their respective accreditors are met and are not adversely impacted by us.
Accrediting agencies are also responsible for assuring that any “written arrangements” to outsource academic instruction meet accreditation standards and related regulations of the DOE. Our operations are generally not subject to such “written arrangements” rules because academic instruction is provided by our university client institutions and not by us; however, the “written arrangements” rules may apply to online programs in the Alternative Credential Segment to the extent such courses are outsourced by university clients. 
State Laws and Regulations
Each state has at least one licensing agency responsible for the oversight of educational institutions operating within its jurisdiction. Continued approval by such agencies is necessary for an institution to operate and grant degrees, diplomas or certificates in those states. Moreover, under the HEA, approval by such agencies is necessary to maintain eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. State attorneys general are also active in enforcing education laws, and the level of regulatory oversight varies substantially from state to state.
We and our university clients may be subject to regulation in each state in which we or they own facilities, provide distance education or recruit students. State laws establish standards for, among other things, student instruction, qualifications of faculty, location and nature of facilities, recruiting practices and financial policies. The need to comply with applicable state laws and regulations may limit or delay our ability to market or expand our offerings. In addition, the interpretation of state authorization regulations is subject to substantial discretion by the state agency responsible for enforcing the regulations.
DOE requires, among other things, that an institution offering distance learning or online programs secure the approval of those states which require such approval and provide evidence of such approval to the DOE upon request. This regulation increases the importance of state authorization because failure to obtain the necessary state authorization for online programs (which may also be obtained through participation in a state authorization reciprocity agreement) could result in an obligation to return federal funds received by an institution. The federal state authorization rules were updated in July 2020 to, among other things, require more detailed disclosure requirements about whether particular states have authorized programs that may lead to professional licensure, which created an additional compliance burden for many of our partner institutions. The DOE is currently considering further changes to its state authorization requirements.
All states except California now participate in the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement, or SARA, governing the licensing of online offerings. All SARA-member institutions may provide online offerings in SARA states without obtaining separate state authorization (this includes externships, recruiting, local advertising, and faculty presence). SARA-member institutions must still obtain a separate authorization in order to open a physical location in another state and are also required to obtain any additional approvals that may be required for offerings leading to professional licensure in a state (e.g., nursing, teaching, or counseling). Most of our university clients are SARA members and the DOE accepts participation in a reciprocity agreement as evidence of state approval.
Finally, many programs leading to professional licensure, such as graduate degree programs in nursing or teaching, also require approval from, and are subject to ongoing oversight by separate state agencies such as state nursing boards. Membership in SARA does not encompass approvals by professional licensing boards, which must be obtained separately.
We monitor state law developments closely and work closely with our university clients to assist them with obtaining any required approvals.
Other Laws
Our activities or those of our university clients are also subject to other federal and state laws. These regulations include, but are not limited to, consumer marketing and unfair trade practices laws and regulations, including those promulgated and enforced by the FTC, state and federal consumer lending laws, including those enforced by the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, student accessibility requirements, federal and state data protection and privacy requirements and foreign and U.S. anti-corruption regulations.
Human Capital Resources
General Information About Our Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 3,982 full-time employees and 3,206 part-time employees worldwide. Approximately 6,220 of our employees are located in the U.S., approximately 835 of our employees are located in Cape Town, South Africa, and approximately 133 employees are located in other jurisdictions. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. 
Our Culture
2U was founded on a set of “guiding principles” that are core to our culture and guide big and small decisions every day. New employees are introduced to the guiding principles in orientation and are expected to bring these guiding principles to life as they work with their teams, interact with our university clients and students or otherwise represent 2U in the community.
•Cherish each opportunity. Life is short, so treasure every moment.
•Give a damn. Care about what you do each day.
•Strive for excellence. Don’t settle for second best. 
•Be bold and fearless. Question the status quo and embrace change.
•Be candid, honest and open. Listen to others and offer respectful feedback. 
•Have fun. Fun is important. Fun is simply better. 
•Make service your mission. Give the highest level of support to our partners and to one another.
•Don’t let the skeptic win. “No” is easy. “Yes” is hard. Fight for “yes.”
•Relationships matter. Invest the time, build trust, and value differences.
Human Capital Measures and Objectives
2U is dedicated to eliminating the back row in higher education and our employees are critical to achieving this mission. We believe that when our employees feel appreciated and included they can be more creative, innovative, and better serve our university clients and students. Human capital measures and objectives that we focus on in managing our business include talent acquisition and retention, diversity and inclusion, employee development and training, community involvement and employee experience and wellness. 
•Talent Acquisition and Retention. We seek to recruit, retain and incentivize highly talented employees and our compensation and benefits programs are aligned with these goals. We are committed to providing total rewards programs for our employees that are market-competitive and based on each employee’s contribution and performance. To foster a stronger sense of ownership and align the interests of employees with stockholders, we provide equity compensation in the form of performance and service-based restricted stock units to eligible employees under our broad-based stock compensation program. We also offer eligible employees the ability to participate in our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which enables them to purchase shares of our stock at a discount. We also provide 
comprehensive benefits for employees and their families, which are tailored to the various geographies in which we operate. Depending on the jurisdiction, our benefits may include health insurance coverage, 401(k) matching, paid parental leave, and unlimited paid time off. 
•Diversity and Inclusion. We believe an equitable and inclusive environment with diverse teams produces more creative solutions and results in better outcomes for our university clients and students. We strive to attract, retain and promote diverse talent at all levels of the organization. Our Board is 27% women and 27% people of color and our executive team is 28% women and 33% people of color. We have established a diversity and inclusion committee, known as MOSAIC, that serves as a liaison with management on diversity and inclusion issues and we maintain executive-sponsored business resource networks (“BRNs”) that offer a forum for employees to network and engage in professional development activities. As of December 31, 2021 we had 6 BRNs focused on the following groups: Black/African American, Women, LGBTQ+, Asian Pacific Islander, Latinx and People Who Are Differently Abled. To further support our diversity and inclusion goals, starting in 2020 the Company bonus plan included a diversity and inclusion component for our employees at and above the vice president level. 
•Employee Development and Training. We provide a range of mandatory and optional employee development programs and opportunities for employees to develop the skills they need to be successful. Our learning and development teams create and teach a variety of live courses and our employees also have free access to a library of learning resources via LinkedIn Learning. Our diversity and inclusion principles are also reflected in our employee training programs. We require all managers to complete trainings on allyship, unconscious bias, cultural communication and thriving across differences and we offer additional training on emotional intelligence and leading with empathy. In addition, we offer a tuition reimbursement benefit for employees, which allows eligible employees and their family members to receive reimbursement for completion of certain of our offerings. 
•Community Involvement. We are committed to making an impact in our local communities through volunteering, financial donations, scholarships and other forms of engagement. Our corporate social responsibility program, “2U Engage”, supports local non-profit organizations in each location where we have a 2U office with a focus on organizations that are aligned with our mission to provide access to quality education. Employees are encouraged to volunteer for these organizations throughout the year using our “Volunteer Paid Time Off” program and bi-annually through Company-organized “Days of Service” events. We also endeavor to support the local community through scholarship initiatives, which focus on reaching the Black, Latinx and indigenous communities, as well as women and individuals from low income households. 
•Employee Experience and Wellness. We strive to create employee programs that promote our guiding principles, support employee wellness and enable employees to work productively. Particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic with our global workforce working primarily remotely, supporting and engaging our employees has been our top priority. These efforts include providing access to free wellness resources such as meditation and mental health support, monthly stipends for home Wi-Fi access, a Company-wide “Daily Dose of Team Time” call to foster employee engagement and connection and hosting remote-versions of our annual employee events. We regularly survey our employees to assess wellness and additional support needs.
