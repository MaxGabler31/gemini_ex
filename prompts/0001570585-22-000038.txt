General Development of Business
As a result of a series of mergers that were completed on June 7, 2013, Liberty Global became the publicly-held parent company of the successors by merger of Liberty Global, Inc. (the predecessor to Liberty Global) and Virgin Media Inc. (Virgin Media). In the following text, the terms “we”, “our”, “our company” and “us” may refer, as the context requires, to Liberty Global (or its predecessor) or collectively to Liberty Global (or its predecessor) and its subsidiaries, including any joint ventures. Unless otherwise indicated, convenience translations into United States (U.S.) dollars are calculated as of December 31, 2021, and operational data, including subscriber statistics and ownership percentages, are as of December 31, 2021.
Acquisitions and Dispositions
We have also completed a number of strategic acquisitions and dispositions over the last several years. We made these acquisitions and dispositions in order to execute on our strategy to concentrate on markets where we have focused on creating national champion converged businesses in core markets and to unlock significant synergies. 
Acquisitions. Our significant acquisitions include:
•On November 11, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Sunrise Communications Group AG (Sunrise) through the settlement of the all cash public tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Sunrise (the Sunrise Acquisition). In April 2021, we completed a statutory “squeeze-out” procedure, under applicable Swiss law, to acquire the remaining Sunrise Shares that were not acquired pursuant to the tender offer and, accordingly, now hold 100% of the share capital of Sunrise. The combined business in Switzerland, which we wholly own, is now referred to as Sunrise UPC.
•On June 3, 2019, Telenet Group Holding N.V. (Telenet) acquired the remaining 50.0% of De Vijver Media NV (De Vijver Media) that it did not already own (the De Vijver Media Acquisition). De Vijver Media provides content production, broadcasting and advertising services in Belgium. 
•On June 19, 2017, Telenet acquired Coditel Brabant sprl, operating under the brand name SFR BeLux (SFR BeLux), which provided broadband operations in Belgium (Brussels and Wallonia) and Luxembourg.
Joint Ventures. We completed the following significant joint venture transactions during 2021: 
•On September 1, 2021, we (i) contributed certain assets and liabilities to a newly-formed 50:50 joint venture (the Atlas Edge JV) that was established for the purpose of acquiring and commercializing European technical real estate for edge colocation and hosting services and (ii) sold certain other assets to the Atlas Edge JV. In addition, we sold certain other assets to the Atlas Edge JV during the fourth quarter of 2021. We account for our 50% interest in the Atlas Edge JV as an equity method investment. 
•On June 1, 2021, Liberty Global and Telefónica, S.A. (Telefónica) completed a transaction (the U.K. JV Transaction) whereby (i) we contributed Virgin Media’s U.K. operations and certain other Liberty Global subsidiaries to a 50:50 joint venture (the VMO2 JV) and (ii) Telefónica contributed its U.K. mobile business to the VMO2 JV, creating a nationwide integrated communications provider. We account for our 50% interest in the VMO2 JV as an equity method investment. 
Dispositions. We have also completed the following dispositions during the past several years:
•On July 31, 2019, we completed the sale of our operations in Germany, Romania, Hungary and the Czech Republic to Vodafone Group plc (Vodafone). The operations of Germany, Romania, Hungary and the Czech Republic are collectively referred to herein as the “Vodafone Disposal Group.” In connection with the sale of the Vodafone Disposal Group, we have agreed to provide certain transitional services to Vodafone for a period of up to four years. These services principally comprise network and information technology-related functions.
•On May 2, 2019, we completed the sale of our direct-to-home satellite (DTH) operations, which serves customers in Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania (UPC DTH) to M7 Group (M7). In connection with the sale of UPC DTH, we agreed to provide certain transitional services to M7 for a period of up to two years. These services principally comprised network and information technology-related functions.
•On July 31, 2018, we completed the sale of our Austrian operations (UPC Austria) to Deutsche Telekom AG (Deutsche Telekom). In connection with the sale of UPC Austria, we have agreed to provide certain transitional 
I-2


services to Deutsche Telekom for a period of up to four years. These services principally comprise network and information technology-related functions. 
•On December 29, 2017, we effected the split-off of our LiLAC Group (the Split-off Transaction) by distributing 100% of the common shares of Liberty Latin America Ltd. (Liberty Latin America) to holders of our then LiLAC ordinary shares (the LiLAC Shares). The “LiLAC Group” consisted of our businesses, assets and liabilities in Latin America and the Caribbean, including C&W, VTR.com SpA, a 60% interest in Liberty Cablevision of Puerto Rico LLC and related cash and cash equivalents and indebtedness. Following such distribution, the LiLAC Shares were redesignated as deferred shares (with virtually no economic rights) and subsequently canceled. In connection with the Split-off Transaction, Liberty Latin America became a separate publicly-traded company. 
Pending Transaction
On September 22, 2021, we entered into the Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which we agreed to sell 100% of our operations in Poland (UPC Poland) to a third party for a total enterprise value of Polish zloty (PLN) 7,025.0 million ($1,743.8 million), subject to customary debt and working capital adjustments at completion. Closing of the transaction, which we currently expect to occur in the first half of 2022, is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including receipt of requisite regulatory approvals. 
The proceeds from the sale are expected to be used (i) to repay a portion of the UPC Holding borrowing group’s outstanding indebtedness and (ii) for general corporate purposes, which may include reinvestment into our business and support for our share repurchase program. 
We have agreed to provide certain transitional services for a period of up to five years, depending on the service. These services principally will comprise network and information technology-related functions. The annual charges will depend on the actual level of services required by the purchaser.
For additional information on our acquisitions, pending and completed dispositions and joint ventures see notes 5, 6 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements, respectively, included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, we have completed various other smaller acquisitions and dispositions in the normal course of business. Further, we are evaluating a change in jurisdiction of incorporation to Bermuda, which has U.S.-style corporate laws and lower administrative costs. To the extent we determine to move forward with any re-domicile transaction, we would seek shareholder approval in advance.
Equity Transactions 
Share repurchases are an important part of our strategy in creating value for our shareholders. Pursuant to our most recent share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors, we are authorized to repurchase ten percent of our outstanding shares (measured at the start of each year) during each of 2022 and 2023. The following table provides the details of our share repurchases during 2021: 

Title of shares | | Number of shares | Average price paid per share(1) | | Aggregate purchase price(1)
 | | | | | in millions 
Class A ordinary shares | 8,445,800 | | $ | 27.31 | | | $ | 230.6
Class C ordinary shares | 49,604,048 | | $ | 27.23 | | | 1,350.5 | 
 | | | | | $ | 1,581.1 |

(1)Amounts include direct acquisition costs.

Description of Business
We are one of the world’s leading converged video, broadband and communications companies, with a commitment to providing our customers the “best in class” communications and entertainment services. These services are delivered to our residential and business customers over our networks and include broadband internet, video, telephony and mobile services. Telenet, the VMO2 JV, the VodafoneZiggo JV and Sunrise UPC deliver mobile services as mobile network operators, VM Ireland and UPC Poland deliver mobile services as MVNOs through third-party networks. Sunrise UPC also delivers some mobile services as an MVNO pursuant to a legacy contract that is being phased out as a result of the Sunrise Acquisition. We design our services to enable our customers to access the digital world on their own terms and at their own pace. Offering “best in class” connectivity is at the core of our strategy. Today, our extensive broadband network enables us to deliver ultra high-speed internet service across our markets, be it through fiber, cable or mobile technology. We are striving to extend our reach and reinforce our speed leadership. In most of our footprint we offer converged fixed and mobile experiences in and out of the home, and it is our ambition to further enhance this proposition and make it available to all our customers. 
We provide residential and business telecommunication services in Ireland through Virgin Media Ireland, Belgium through Telenet, Switzerland through Sunrise UPC, Poland through UPC Poland and Slovakia through UPC Slovakia. We are a leading fixed network provider in each of these countries. We also have investments in the VodafoneZiggo JV and the VMO2 JV, each of which is a fixed network leader in their respective countries. 
A breakdown of our revenue by major category for our consolidated reportable segments appears in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
By connecting our customers through our telecommunication services, we recognize that we are a global corporate citizen and that we play a role in addressing the environmental impacts generated through our business. By seeking to address these issues, we strengthen our company and provide strong benefits to the communities in which we operate. We remain a leader in our sector on climate change with an unwavering commitment to reducing our impact on the environment. We continue to improve our operations to meet our new 2030 and 2050 science-based targets in line with the Paris Climate Accord, including by working to become more carbon efficient and striving to minimize e-waste through our various environmental initiatives. Our gigabit broadband deployments in cities throughout our operating territories and efforts to accelerate the transition to 5G will underpin a low carbon economy, while revolutionizing healthcare, flexible working regimes and countless other aspects of our lives. Diversity and inclusion have long been priorities for Liberty Global and our operating companies, and will become even more integral moving forward. Over the past several years, Liberty Global, Virgin Media, the VodafoneZiggo JV, Telenet, Sunrise UPC, UPC Slovakia, UPC Poland and, since its inception, the VMO2 JV, have all pursued gender diversity as a strategic goal, with an emphasis on building a gender-diverse pipeline. Similarly, inclusion is a key focus area and we are committed to providing an environment that empowers everyone to bring their full selves to work while creating more inviting workplaces regardless of age, race, gender, ethnicity or sexual orientation.

__________________
(1)Homes Passed are homes, residential multiple dwelling units or commercial units that can be connected to our networks without materially extending the distribution plant. Certain of our Homes Passed counts are based on census data that can change based on either revisions to the data or from new census results. Due to the fact that we do not own the partner networks (defined below) used in Switzerland (see note 9 below), we do not report homes passed for Switzerland’s partner networks.
(2)Fixed-Line Customer Relationships are the number of customers who receive at least one of our internet, video or telephony services that we count as Revenue Generating Units (RGUs), without regard to which or to how many services they subscribe. Fixed-Line Customer Relationships generally are counted on a unique premises basis. Accordingly, if an individual receives our services in two premises (e.g., a primary home and a vacation home), that individual generally will count as two Fixed-Line Customer Relationships. We exclude mobile-only customers from Fixed-Line Customer Relationships. 
(3)Internet Subscribers are homes, residential multiple dwelling units or commercial units that receive internet services over our networks, or that we service through a partner network. In Switzerland, we offer a 10 Mbps internet service to our Video Subscribers without an incremental recurring fee. Our Internet Subscribers in Switzerland include 47,300 subscribers who have requested and received this service.
(4)Video Subscribers are homes, residential multiple dwelling units or commercial units that receive our video services over our broadband network or through a partner network. We have approximately 31,400 “lifeline” customers that are counted on a per connection basis, representing the least expensive regulated tier of video cable service, with only a few channels. 
(5)Telephony Subscribers are homes, residential multiple dwelling units or commercial units that receive voice services over our networks, or that we service through a partner network. Telephony Subscribers exclude mobile telephony subscribers. In Switzerland, we offer a basic phone service to our Video Subscribers without an incremental recurring fee. Our Telephony Subscribers in Switzerland include 215,400 subscribers who have requested and received this service. 
(6)RGU is separately a Video Subscriber, Internet Subscriber or Telephony Subscriber. A home, residential multiple dwelling unit, or commercial unit may contain one or more RGUs. For example, if a residential customer subscribed to our video service, fixed-line telephony service and broadband internet service, the customer would constitute three RGUs. Total RGUs is the sum of Video, Internet and Telephony Subscribers. RGUs generally are counted on a unique premises basis such that a given premise does not count as more than one RGU for any given service. On the other hand, if an individual receives one of our services in two premises (e.g., a primary home and a vacation home), that individual will count as two RGUs for that service. Each bundled cable, internet or telephony service is counted as a separate RGU regardless of the nature of any bundling discount or promotion. Non-paying subscribers are counted as subscribers during their free promotional service period. Some of these subscribers may choose to disconnect after their free service period. Services offered without charge on a long-term basis (e.g., VIP subscribers or free service to 
I-7


employees) generally are not counted as RGUs. We do not include subscriptions to mobile services in our externally reported RGU counts. In this regard, our RGU counts exclude our separately reported postpaid and prepaid mobile subscribers. 
(7)Our Mobile Subscriber count represents the number of active subscriber identification module (SIM) cards in service rather than services provided. For example, if a mobile subscriber has both a data and voice plan on a smartphone this would equate to one mobile subscriber. Alternatively, a subscriber who has a voice and data plan for a mobile handset and a data plan for a laptop would be counted as two mobile subscribers. Customers who do not pay a recurring monthly fee are excluded from our mobile subscriber count after periods of inactivity ranging from 30 to 90 days, based on industry standards within the respective country. In a number of countries, our mobile subscribers receive mobile services pursuant to prepaid contracts. As of December 31, 2021, our mobile subscriber count included 457,500 and 320,400 prepaid Mobile Subscribers in Switzerland and Belgium, respectively.
(8)Pursuant to service agreements, Switzerland offers broadband internet, video and telephony services over networks owned by third-party cable operators (“partner networks”). A partner network RGU is only recognized if there is a direct billing relationship with the customer. At December 31, 2021, Switzerland’s partner network accounted for 113,100 Fixed-Line Customer Relationships and 291,800 RGUs, which include 106,800 Internet Subscribers, 102,500 Video Subscribers and 82,500 Telephony Subscribers. Subscribers to our video services provided over partner networks largely receive video services from the partner networks as opposed to our operations. Due to the fact that we do not own these partner networks, we do not include the 464,900 homes passed by Switzerland’s partner networks at December 31, 2021. In addition, with the completion of the acquisition of Sunrise, we now service homes through Sunrise’s existing agreements with Swisscom AG (Swisscom), Swiss Fibre Net and local utilities, which are not included in Switzerland’s homes passed count. Including these arrangements, our operations in Switzerland have the ability to offer fixed services to a national footprint. 
(9)Amounts related to the VodafoneZiggo JV’s fixed-line and mobile products include business and multiple dwelling unit subscribers. Prepaid mobile customers are excluded from the VodafoneZiggo JV’s mobile subscriber count after a period of inactivity of nine months.
(10)The mobile subscriber count for the VMO2 JV includes wholesale mobile subscribers. Prepaid mobile customers are excluded from the VMO2 JV’s mobile subscriber count after a period of inactivity of three months. 
Additional General Notes to Table:
Most of our broadband communications subsidiaries provide broadband internet, video, telephony, mobile, data or other business services. Certain of our business service revenue is derived from small or home office (SOHO) subscribers that pay a premium price to receive enhanced service levels along with video, internet or telephony services that are the same or similar to the mass marketed products offered to our residential subscribers. All mass marketed products provided to SOHOs, whether or not accompanied by enhanced service levels and/or premium prices, are included in the respective RGU and customer counts of our broadband communications operations, with only those services provided at premium prices considered to be “SOHO RGUs” or “SOHO customers”. To the extent our existing customers upgrade from a residential product offering to a SOHO product offering, the number of SOHO RGUs or SOHO customers will increase, but there is no impact to our total RGU or customer counts. With the exception of our business SOHO subscribers, we generally do not count customers of business services as customers or RGUs for external reporting purposes.
In Belgium, Telenet leases a portion of its network under a long-term finance lease arrangement. These tables include operating statistics for Telenet’s owned and leased networks. 
While we take appropriate steps to ensure that subscriber statistics are presented on a consistent and accurate basis at any given balance sheet date, the variability from country to country in (1) the nature and pricing of products and services, (2) the distribution platform, (3) billing systems, (4) bad debt collection experience and (5) other factors add complexity to the subscriber counting process. We periodically review our subscriber counting policies and underlying systems to improve the accuracy and consistency of the data reported on a prospective basis. Accordingly, we may from time to time make appropriate adjustments to our subscriber statistics based on those reviews. 
Subscriber information for acquired entities is preliminary and subject to adjustment until we have completed our review of such information and determined that it is presented in accordance with our policies.

Products and Services
Our main products and services are WiFi and internet services, video, mobile, and telephony services.
Intelligent WiFi and Internet Services
Connectivity is a critical building block for vibrant communities. As highlighted by the current COVID-19 pandemic, all aspects of society, including families, businesses, education and healthcare, to name a few, rely heavily on connectivity and the digital services that depend on it. To meet our customers’ expectations of seamless connectivity, we are developing a fully digital, cloud based connectivity ecosystem that we call “ONE Connect,” built on top of our fiber-rich fixed broadband network and recently expanded mobile network. The ONE Connect is orchestrated by a fully cloud-based digital journey, enabling fast and flexible introduction of new hardware and services, as well as cloud to cloud open API integration, simplifying the on-boarding of new services and devices. The devices used within our ONE Connect ecosystem are connected and protected through our security gateway and VPN, both at home and on the go. At home, our customers can benefit from the gigabit speeds enabled by our “Connect Box” (described below), as well as “Intelligent WiFi”, which has optimization functionalities, such as the ability to adapt to the number of people and devices online at any given time in order to improve and extend wireless connectivity reach and speeds. We have completed the rollout of our award-winning Intelligent WiFi across all our markets. In addition, we introduced our first “Smart Home” bundles in select markets, enabling those customers to take their smart home ambitions to the next level, including enhanced entertainment, home automation and home security. Finally, our “Connect App” is the digital touchpoint that allows customers to access and manage all of our services. 
Our Connect Box is our next generation intelligent WiFi and telephony gateway that enables us to maximize the impact of our ultrafast broadband networks by providing reliable wireless connectivity anywhere in the home. This gateway can be self-installed and allows customers to customize their home WiFi service. Our latest versions of the gigabit Connect Box are based on DOCSIS 3.1 technology and WiFi 6, providing even better in-home WiFi service. Our new DOCSIS 3.1 Connect Box runs our “One Firmware” stack, a middleware software system based on the Reference Design Kit for Broadband (RDK-B). RDK-B is an open source initiative with wide participation from operators, device manufacturers and silicon vendors that standardizes core functions used in broadband devices, set-top boxes and internet of things solutions. We have extended the One Firmware stack to support our ONE Connect ecosystem. One Firmware runs on system-on-a-chip (SoC) technology from multiple vendors and can run on any SOC that is RDK-B compliant, enabling greater speed and agility in on-boarding of new customer premises equipment platforms and ecosystem features, allowing us to build once and port to many. It is expected that we will roll-out One Firmware to the base of DOCSIS 3.0 legacy customer premises equipment during 2022. To support the adoption of fiber to the home, cabinet, building or node networks (fiber-to-the-home/-cabinet/-building/-node is referred to herein as FTTx) access in both on-net and off-net scenarios, we plan to add XGS-PON (an updated standard for passive optical networks that supports higher-speed 10 Gbps symmetrical data transfers) and Ethernet-based Connect Boxes with WiFi 6, providing speeds up to 10 Gbps that run our One Firmware and support our ONE Connect ecosystem. Our Connect Box is available in all our markets, and currently, approximately 11 million of our customers have a Connect Box. In addition to our core markets, we distribute our Connect Box to other markets in Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean. Robust wireless connectivity is increasingly important with our customers spending more and more time using bandwidth-heavy services on multiple devices. We also offer our Connect App that, among other things, allows our customers to optimize their WiFi coverage and manage their connected devices. In addition, we provide intelligent WiFi mesh boosters, which increase speed, reliability and coverage by adapting to the environment at home. 
Internet speed is of crucial importance to our customers, as they spend more time streaming video and other bandwidth-heavy services on multiple devices. Our extensive broadband network enables us to deliver ultra-high-speed internet service across our markets. Our residential subscribers access the internet via cable modems connected to their internet capable devices, or wirelessly via a WiFi gateway device. We offer multiple tiers of broadband internet service up to Gigabit speeds and available to over 15 million homes across our footprint. The speed of service depends on the customer location and their service selected. In 2021, our networks continued to be recognized, with the VodafoneZiggo JV winning both the Best Internet Provider award in the Netherlands for the 11th year in a row and Best Fixed Network in the Netherlands.
By leveraging our existing fiber-rich broadband networks, we are in a position to deliver gigabit services by deploying the next generation DOCSIS 3.1 technology. DOCSIS 3.1 technology is an international standard that defines the requirements for data transmission over a cable system. Not only does DOCSIS 3.1 technology improve our internet speeds and reliability, it allows for efficient network growth. Currently, our ultra-high-speed internet service is based primarily on DOCSIS 3.1 technology, and we offer this technology in all of our markets. In 2022, the VMO2 JV completed an upgrade of its entire national network to gigabit speeds, such that every VMO2 JV customer has access to internet speeds of at least 1 Gbps.
I-9


We offer value-added broadband services in certain of our markets for an incremental charge. These services include Intelligent WiFi features, security (e.g., anti-virus, anti-spyware, firewall and spam protection), Smart Home services, and online storage solutions and web spaces. Subscribers to our internet service pay a monthly fee based on the tier of service selected. In addition to the monthly fee, customers pay an activation service fee upon subscribing to an internet service. This one-time fee may be waived for promotional reasons. We determine pricing for each different tier of internet service through an analysis of speed, market conditions and other factors. 
In all of our markets, we have deployed community WiFi via routers in the home (the Community WiFi), which provides secure access to the internet for our customers. Community WiFi is enabled by a cable modem WiFi access point (WiFi modem) in a Connect Box, a set-top box or a Horizon box of our internet customers. The Community WiFi is created through the sharing of access to the public channel of our customers’ home wireless routers. The public channel is a separate network from the secure private network used by the customer within the home and is automatically enabled when the WiFi modem is installed. Public WiFi access points (covering train stations, hotels, bars, restaurants and other public places) are also available for no additional cost.
Video Services
Our video service is, and continues to be, one of the foundations of our product offerings in our markets. Our cable operations offer multiple tiers of digital video programming and audio services, starting with a basic video service. Subscribers to our basic video service pay a fixed monthly fee and receive digital video channels (including a growing number of high definition (HD) and ultra-high definition 4K resolution (4K) channels) and several digital and analog radio channels, as well as an electronic programming guide. We tailor our video services in each country of operation based on programming preferences, culture, demographics and local regulatory requirements. 
We also offer a variety of premium channel packages to meet the special interests of our subscribers. For an additional monthly charge, a subscriber may upgrade to one of our extended digital tier services and receive an increased number of video and radio channels, including the channels in the basic tier service and additional HD and 4K channels. Our channel offerings include general entertainment, sports, movies, series, documentaries, lifestyles, news, adult, children and ethnic and foreign channels.
Discounts to our monthly service fees are available to any subscriber who selects a bundle of two or more of our services (bundled services): video, internet, fixed-line telephony and, in most of our markets, mobile services. Bundled services consist of double-play for two services, triple-play for three services and, where available, quad-play for four services. 
To meet customer demands, we have enhanced our video services with additional relevant content services and features, which increase viewing comfort and address individual user needs. Our latest next generation product suite is called “Horizon 4”, a multi-screen entertainment platform that combines linear television (including recording and Replay TV features), premium video-on-demand (“VoD”) offerings, an increasing amount of integrated premium global and local video apps and mobile viewing into one entertainment experience. Horizon 4 comes with a state-of-the-art personal user interface that is intuitively easy to navigate. Content recommendations and favorite channel settings can be customized to individual user profiles. Video playback control, such as pause and resume, navigation shortcuts and content searches can all be conducted via a voice control button on the remote control, a feature highly appreciated by our customers. Horizon 4 is available in all of our markets on the latest set top boxes capable of delivering 4K video content and achieved significant positive customer feedback, manifesting in high product net promoter score figures. Horizon 4 is marketed under the name “Telenet TV-Box” in Belgium, “UPC TV” and “Sunrise TV” in Switzerland, “Virgin TV360” in the U.K., through the VMO2 JV, and Ireland, “UPC TV 4K Box” in Poland and “MediaBox Next” in the Netherlands through the VodafoneZiggo JV. 
The predecessor version of Horizon 4, Horizon 3, is deployed on set-top boxes in the Netherlands (through the VodafoneZiggo JV), Switzerland and Ireland. While in Switzerland and Ireland these set-top boxes will continue to be exchanged for the latest hardware with Horizon 4 over time, in the Netherlands the boxes can be flashed with the latest Horizon 4 software. 
In the U.K., the forerunner product of Horizon 4 is based on the TiVo platform and was developed under a strategic partnership agreement with TiVo Inc. The TiVo platform is deployed on a basic set-top box as well as the Virgin Media V6 box. Similar to Horizon 4, the Virgin Media V6 box combines 4K video, including high dynamic range, with improved streaming functionalities and more processing power. The Virgin Media V6 box allows customers to record six channels simultaneously while watching a seventh channel. Customers can also start watching programming on one television and pick up where they left off on other boxes in another room or through an app on their smart phones and tablets. Over 70% of the VMO2 JV’s customers have the Virgin Media V6 box. Similar to the deployed hardware in the Netherlands via the 
I-10


VodafoneZiggo JV, over time these V6 boxes will be flashed with the latest Horizon 4 software, bringing our latest and most successful television and entertainment experience to the VMO2 JV’s customers without the need of exchanging the installed hardware. The V6 boxes can now be flashed with the latest Horizon 4 software. 
One of our key video services is “Replay TV”. Through Replay TV, the last seven days of content (subject to rights related to blackouts) is made available via the electronic programming guide (EPG) for on demand viewing. Customers can simply open the EPG, scroll back and replay linear programming instantly. This same technical solution also allows our customers to replay a television program from the start even while the live broadcast is in progress. Additionally, customers have the option of recording TV programs in the cloud (or onto the hard disk drive in the set top box in the U.K., through the VMO2 JV, and in Ireland). Replay TV is one of the most used and appreciated features on our platforms. 
In most of our markets, we offer transactional VoD giving subscribers access to thousands of movies and television series. In several of our markets, our subscription VoD service is included in certain of our video offerings. This service is tailored to the specific market based on available content, consumer preferences and competitive offers, and includes various programming, such as music, kids, documentaries, adult, sports and TV series. We continue to develop our VoD services to provide a growing collection of programming from local and international suppliers, such as Disney/Fox, NBC/Universal, CBS/Paramount, Warner Bros. and Sony, among others. In addition, in all of our markets we offer global premium over the top (OTT) services such as Netflix, YouTube and Amazon Prime Video, and we also offer local OTT services via a large portion of our set-top boxes. 
Most of this content is also available via our online mobile app, “Horizon Go”, which is available on mobile devices (iOS and Android) and, in some markets as well, via Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV and Android TV devices. Thanks to the 360 integration of Horizon 4 across multiple screens, customers can pause a program, series or movie and seamlessly continue watching from where they left off on another device, whether a television, tablet, smart phone or laptop. Additionally, Horizon Go enables customers to remotely schedule the recording of a television program on their Horizon 4 box at home. 
In the summer of 2020, we launched our first IP-only streaming device in Poland, which runs the full Horizon 4 product suite and features a small puck-like form factor that can be tucked away behind a TV screen. This all-IP mini 4K capable TV box has extremely low power consumption, and its casing is made from recycled plastic, proudly winning us the Digital TV Europe’s Video Tech Innovation Sustainability Award in December 2020 as well as the Red Dot Product Design Award in 2021. We have also launched the all-IP 4K capable TV box in Switzerland and intend to continue the roll out the all-IP TV box to additional markets. UPC Poland and the VodafoneZiggo JV announced in July and December of 2021, respectively, that they are entering into agreements with Nordic Entertainment Group (NENT) to provide the “Viaplay” streaming service, a new entrant to the Polish and Dutch markets.
Mobile Services
Mobile services are another key building block for us to provide customers with seamless connectivity. Telenet, the VMO2 JV, the VodafoneZiggo JV and UPC Sunrise offer mobile services as mobile network providers, and UPC Poland and Virgin Media in Ireland offer mobile services as an MVNO over third-party networks. Sunrise UPC and the VMO2 JV also offers mobile services under certain legacy MVNO agreements. 
Where mobile telephony services are provided via MVNOs, the relevant mobile operator leases a third-party’s radio access network and owns the core network, including switching, backbone and interconnections. An MVNO arrangement permits us to offer our customers in these markets mobile services without having to build and operate a cellular radio tower network. 
Our MVNO partners are:

Country | | Partner
U.K. | Vodafone / EE Limited(1)
Switzerland | Swisscom(2) 
Ireland | Three (Hutchison) 
Poland | Orange/Play 

____________
(1)The VMO2 JV is in the process of migrating its subscribers to its platform, but certain subscribers currently remain on MVNO plans.
I-11


(2)Sunrise UPC in Switzerland is in the process of migrating its subscribers to the Sunrise UPC network, but certain subscribers currently remain on an MVNO plan.
In each of our markets, we offer a range of mobile related services. The majority of subscribers take a post-paid service plan, which has an agreed monthly fee for a set duration (typically 1 to 2 years). The monthly fee will vary depending on the country and service package selected. Service packages can have different levels of data allowances, voice minutes and network speed, as well as differing other aspects, such as roaming charges and contract duration. Post-paid services are also offered as a bundle with fixed services, and by taking a “converged” offering, customers typically receive some benefits such as lower total cost or additional features. Post-paid services are offered to both business and retail consumers. In addition, we offer pre-paid mobile services, where the customers pay in advance for a pre-determined amount of airtime or data and which generally have no minimum contract term. In countries where we operate as a mobile service operator, we also offer a number of MVNOs, where other mobile providers use our mobile network for their mobile offering.
Telephony Services
Multi-feature telephony services are available through voice-over-internet-protocol (VoIP) technology in most of our broadband communication markets. In the U.K., the VMO2 JV also provides traditional circuit-switched telephony services. We pay interconnect fees to other telephony and internet providers when calls by our subscribers terminate on another network and receive similar fees from providers when calls by their users terminate on our network through interconnection points. 
Our telephony service may be selected in several of our markets on a standalone basis and in all of our markets in combination with one or more of our other services. Our telephony service includes a basic fixed-line telephony product for line rental and various calling plans, which may consist of any of the following: unlimited network, national or international calling, unlimited off-peak calling and minute packages, including calls to fixed and mobile phones. We also offer value added services, such as a personal call manager, unified messaging and a second or third phone line at an incremental cost. 
Multiple Dwelling Units and Partner Networks
Pursuant to an agreement executed on June 28, 2008 (the PICs Agreement) with four associations of municipalities in Belgium (the pure intercommunales or PICs), Telenet leases the PICs broadband communications network and, accordingly, makes its services available to all of the homes passed by the cable network owned by the PICs. Telenet has a direct customer relationship with the video subscribers on the PICs network. Pursuant to the PICs Agreement, Telenet has full rights to use substantially all of the PICs network under a long-term finance lease. Unless extended, the PICs Agreement will expire on September 23, 2046, and cannot be terminated earlier (except in the case of non-payment or bankruptcy of Telenet). For additional information on the PICs Agreement, see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
For over 70% of the basic video subscribers of Sunrise UPC, Sunrise UPC maintains billing relationships with landlords or housing associations and provides basic video service to the tenants. The landlord or housing association administers the billing for the basic video service with their tenants and manages service terminations for their rental units. When tenants select triple-play bundles with or without mobile service from Sunrise UPC, they then migrate to a direct billing relationship with us.
Sunrise UPC offers broadband internet, enhanced video and telephony services directly to the video cable subscribers of those partner networks that enter into service operating contracts with Sunrise UPC. Sunrise UPC has the direct customer billing relationship with these subscribers. By permitting Sunrise UPC to offer some or all of its broadband internet, video and telephony products directly to those partner network subscribers, Sunrise UPC’s service operating contracts have expanded the addressable markets for Sunrise UPC’s digital products. In exchange for the right to provide digital products directly to the partner network subscribers, Sunrise UPC pays to the partner network a share of the revenue generated from those subscribers. Sunrise UPC also provides network maintenance services and engineering and construction services to its partner networks.
Business Services
In addition to our residential services, we offer business services in all of our operations. For business and public sector organizations, we provide a complete range of voice, advanced data, video, wireless and cloud-based services, as well as mobile and converged fixed-mobile services. Our business customers include SOHO (generally up to five employees), small business and medium and large enterprises. We also provide business services on a wholesale basis to other operators. 
Our business services are designed to meet the specific demands of our business customers with a wide range of services, including increased data transmission speeds and virtual private networks. These services fall into five broad categories:

•wireless services for mobile voice and data, as well as managed WiFi networks;
•video programming packages and select channel lineups for targeted industries or full programming packages for SOHO customers; and 
•value added services, including managed security systems, cloud enabled business applications, storage and web hosting.
Our intermediate to long-term strategy is to enhance our capabilities and offerings in the business sector so we become a preferred provider in the business market. To execute this strategy, customer experience and strategic marketing play a key role.
Our business services are provided to customers at contractually established prices based on the size of the business, type of services received and the volume and duration of the service agreement. SOHO and small business customers pay business market prices on a monthly subscription basis to receive enhanced service levels and business features that support their needs. For more advanced business services, these customers generally enter into a service agreement. For medium to large business customers, we enter into individual agreements that address their needs. These agreements are generally for a period of at least one year.

Technology 
Our broadband internet, video and fixed-line telephony services are primarily transmitted over a hybrid fiber coaxial (HFC) cable network. This network is composed primarily of national and regional fiber networks, which are connected to the home over the last few hundred meters by coaxial cable. Alongside our HFC network, we are increasingly rolling out services based on fiber to the home (FTTH) and leveraging fixed wireless access (FWA) technologies to service customers not covered by our fixed networks in areas where it may not be cost effective to deploy fixed networks.
We closely monitor our network capacity and customer usage. Where necessary, we increase our capacity incrementally, for instance by splitting nodes in our cable network. We also continue to explore improvements to our services and new technologies that will enhance our customer’s connected entertainment experience. These actions include:
•recapturing bandwidth and optimizing our networks by: 
◦increasing the number of nodes in our markets; 
◦increasing the bandwidth of our hybrid fiber coaxial cable network to 1 GHz;
◦converting analog channels to digital;
◦moving channels to IP delivery;
◦deploying additional DOCSIS 3.1 channels; 
◦replacing copper lines with modern optic fibers; and 
I-14


◦using digital compression technologies.
•freeing spectrum for high-speed internet, VoD and other services by encouraging customers to move from analog to digital services;
•increasing the efficiency of our networks by moving headend functions (encoding, transcoding and multiplexing) to cloud storage systems;
•enhancing our network to accommodate business services;
•using wireless technologies to extend our services outside of the home;
•offering remote access to our video services through laptops, smart phones and tablets; 
•expanding the availability of Horizon TV and Virgin TV Go, as well as Horizon 4, and related products and developing and introducing online media sharing and streaming or cloud-based video; and
•testing new technologies. 
As stated above, we are expanding our HFC and FTTH footprint. In addition, we are seeking mobile service opportunities where we have established cable networks and expanding our fixed-line networks where we have a strong mobile offering. This will allow us to offer converged fixed-line and mobile services to our customers. 
We deliver high-speed data and fixed-line telephony over our broadband network in our markets. The cable networks of our operations in Europe are connected to our “Aorta” backbone. The Aorta backbone is recognized as a Tier 1 Carrier, which permits us to serve our customers through settlement free collaboration with other carriers without the cost of using a third-party network. 
    In support of our connectivity strategy, we are moving our customers into a gigabit society. All of our broadband networks are already capable of supporting the next generation of ultra-high-speed internet service at gigabit speeds. To provide these speeds to our subscribers, we plan to grow our base of DOCSIS 3.1 technology throughout our footprint. The use of DOCSIS 3.1 technology provides us significantly higher efficiencies on our networks and allow us to offer faster speeds, in-home WiFi and better services. The new gateways and the continued upgrades to our network in the coming years will allow us to maximize high-speed connectivity over our broadband networks and deliver gigabit services in a cost-effective manner. It will also allow us to meet the expectations of our customers for high-speed internet access both in cities and rural areas of our footprint. While DOCSIS 3.1 technology will provide up to 2.5 Gbps, in 2022, we plan to deploy XGS-PON technology across our FTTH footprint, enabling speeds of up to 10Gbps. In addition, we will begin to prototype DOCSIS 4 technology that is anticipated to equally provide 10Gbps capabilities across our HFC footprint.
Supply Sources 
Content. In our markets, entertainment platforms remain a key part of the telecommunication services bundle. Therefore, in addition to providing services that allow our customers to view programming when and where they want, we are investing in content that customers want. Our content strategy is based on: 
•proposition (exceeding our customers' entertainment desires and expectations); 
•product (delivering the best content available); 
•procurement (investment in the best brands, shows and sports); and 
•partnering (strategic alignment, acquisitions and growth opportunities).
We license almost all of our programming and on-demand offerings from content providers and third-party rights holders, including broadcasters and cable programming networks. Under our channel distribution agreements, we generally pay a monthly fee on a per channel or per subscriber basis, with occasional minimum pay guarantees. For on-demand programming, we generally pay a revenue share for transactional VoD (occasionally with minimum guarantees) and either a flat fee or a monthly fee per subscriber for subscription VoD. For a majority of our agreements, we seek to include the rights to offer the licensed programming to our customers through multiple delivery platforms and through our apps for smart phones and tablets. 
In seeking licenses for content, we, including the VMO2 JV and the VodafoneZiggo JV, as applicable, partner with leading international and regional Pay TV providers, such as Disney/Fox, Warner Media (including HBO), Sony, UKTV Viacom, AMC, NBCUniversal, RTL, the BBC and Discovery. We also seek to carry in each of our markets key public and private broadcasters and in some markets we acquire local premium programming through select relationships with companies such as 
I-15


Sky plc (Sky) BT Group plc (BT), HBO and Canal+. For our VoD services, we license a variety of programming, including box sets of television series, movies, music, kids’ programming and documentaries. 
In recent years, OTT apps have become increasingly important in the content space and, as part of our content strategy, we have put in place deals with a number of global and regional app providers. We currently have arrangements with Netflix International B.V. (Netflix) and with Amazon Europe Core S.A.R.L. (Amazon). Pursuant to these arrangements, the Netflix service and Amazon Prime Video services respectively are available via certain of our set-top boxes to our video customers across many of our markets each as premium OTT services. The Netflix app is available to customers in the U.K., through the VMO2 JV, the Netherlands through the VodafoneZiggo JV, Ireland, Switzerland and Belgium. The Amazon Prime Video app is currently available to our customers in the U.K. through the VMO2 JV, Ireland, the Netherlands through the VodafoneZiggo JV, Belgium, Switzerland and Poland. We also entered into an arrangement with, Google Ireland Limited (Google) for the YouTube and YouTube Kids services, apps for which are available via certain of our set top boxes to our customers in the U.K. through the VMO2 JV, Ireland, the Netherlands through the VodafoneZiggo JV, Belgium, Switzerland and Poland. In order to tailor our entertainment offerings to each market we have added various locally relevant apps such as BBC iPlayer in the U.K. through the VMO2 JV, NPO Start and Videoland in the Netherlands through the VodafoneZiggo JV, VRT NU in Belgium and BluePlay in Switzerland. In addition, we have concluded deals with NENT for the Viaplay service in the Netherlands, through the VodafoneZiggo JV, where the service is due to launch in March 2022 and in Poland where the service is already available as a premium service.
Exclusive content is another element of our content strategy. To support this approach, we are investing in content assets. We have invested in various content companies, including ITV plc, All3Media Ltd., LionsGate Entertainment, Virgin Media TV (formerly TV3 Group in Ireland) and De Vijver Media. We are also investing in sports, both as a broadcaster and as a rights owner. We have our own sports channels, Play Sports in Belgium which is exclusively available to Telenet customers, MySports in Switzerland, which Sunrise UPC licenses to other platforms in Switzerland, and VMSports in Ireland. Also, the VodafoneZiggo JV owns Ziggo Sport and commissions the production of certain shows such as Rondo and Race Cafe. The basic Ziggo Sport service is available exclusively to the VodafoneZiggo JV’s customers; however, the premium service is widely available through license arrangements. 
In addition, we have commissioned our own drama series content. Through All3Media Ltd., we co-produced a television series, known as The Feed, which was released in 2019 in several of our markets, and co-produced Blood in Ireland, which aired in 2018 and 2020. With Lionsgate Entertainment, we pre-purchased the spy thriller series The Rook, which premiered in 2019. In addition, we have produced the Swiss sitcom Fassler-Kunz, the Swiss series Im Heimatland and the original Belgium series Chaussée d’Amour and De Dag with local production companies. These television series will primarily be available to our customers on an on-demand basis. We will also continue to commission, produce and/or co-produce content for our free-to-air (FTA) assets and VoD platforms in Ireland, and Telenet will continue to commission, produce and/or co-produce content for its FTA assets via SBS Belgium and VoD platforms in Belgium mainly via Streamz, its newly created joint venture for subscription VoD with DPG Media.
Customer Premises Equipment. We purchase each type of customer premises equipment from a number of different suppliers. Customer premises equipment includes set-top boxes, modems, WiFi routers and boosters, digital video recorders (DVRs), tuners and similar devices. For each type of equipment, we retain specialists to provide customer support. For our broadband services, we use a variety of suppliers for our network equipment and the various services we offer. Similarly, we use a variety of suppliers for mobile handsets to offer our customers mobile services. 
Software Licenses. We license software products, including email and security software, and content, such as news feeds, from several suppliers for our internet services. The agreements for these products typically require us to pay a fee for software licenses and/or a share of advertising revenue for content licenses. For our mobile network operations and our fixed-line telephony services, we license software products, such as voicemail, text messaging and caller ID, from a variety of suppliers. For these licenses we seek to enter into long-term contracts, which generally require us to pay based on usage of the services.
For our mobile services provided through MVNO arrangements, we are dependent on third-party wireless network providers. Each of our MVNO operations has an agreement with such a provider to carry the mobile communications traffic of our customers. We seek to enter into medium to long-term arrangements for these services. Any termination of these arrangements could significantly impact our MVNO operated mobile services.

Competition
All of our businesses operate in highly competitive and rapidly evolving markets. The speed of technological advancements is likely to continue to increase, giving customers more options for telecommunications services. Our customers want access to high quality telecommunication products that provide seamless connectivity and experience. Accordingly, our ability to offer converged services (video, internet, fixed telephony and mobile) is a key component of our strategy. In many of our markets, we compete with incumbent companies that provide converged mobile and fixed-line services, as well as companies that are established in one or more communication products. Consequently, our businesses face significant competition. In all markets, we seek to differentiate our offerings by focusing on delivering quality high-speed internet at competitive prices and providing excellent customer service. In this section, we begin with an overview on the competitive nature of the broadband internet, video and mobile and fixed-line telephony services in our markets, and then provide information on key competitors in our more material markets.
We believe that our deep-fiber access provides us with several competitive advantages. For instance, our cable networks enable concurrent delivery of internet access, together with real-time television and VoD content, without impairing our high-speed internet service. In addition, our cable infrastructure allows us to provide triple-play bundled services of broadband internet, television and fixed-line telephony services without relying on a third-party service provider within our footprint. Our business capabilities allow us to provide a comprehensive set of converged mobile and fixed-line services through both our own mobile network and third-party networks. Our capacity is designed to support peak consumer demand, and our networks have been resilient despite significantly increased demand during the COVID-19 pandemic. In serving the business market, many aspects of the network can be leveraged at very low incremental costs. 
Overall, we are experiencing increased convergence as customers look to receive all their media and communication services in a more cost-effective way. In our largest markets, our key competitors are: Proximus NV/SA (Proximus) (Belgium) and Swisscom (Switzerland). Also, as described below in the following sections, the key competitors for the VMO2 JV are BT and SKY, and for the VodafoneZiggo JV, it is Koninklijke KPN N.V. (KPN) and T-Mobile (currently owned by Deutsche Telekom). Each of these competitors have extensive resources allowing them to offer competitively priced converged services. As a result, our ability to offer high quality triple-play or quad-play bundles and fixed-mobile convergence bundles is one of our key strategies to attract and retain customers. We seek to distinguish ourselves through our multimedia gateway services, interactive video products (such as Replay TV and VoD), proprietary sports offerings, expanded content offers (for both in and out of the home) and our high-speed connectivity services backed by intelligent in-home WiFi solutions. 
Internet
Our businesses face competition in a rapidly evolving broadband marketplace from both incumbent and non-incumbent telecommunications companies, mobile operators and cable-based internet service providers, many of which have substantial resources. The internet services offered by these competitors include both fixed-line broadband internet via cable, digital subscriber lines (DSL) or FTTx and wireless broadband. These competitors have a range of product offerings with varying speeds and pricing, as well as interactive services, data and content services offered to households and businesses. With the demand for mobile internet services increasing, competition from wireless services using various advanced technologies is an important competitive factor. In several of our markets, competitors offer high-speed mobile data via LTE networks as well as next generation 5G wireless technology which is in the active roll-out phase. In this intense competitive environment, internet speed and pricing are the key criteria for customers. 
Our strategy is seamless speed leadership. Our focus is on increasing the maximum speed of our connections while providing a reliable customer experience and offering a variety of service tiers, prices, bundled products and a range of value-added services, including intelligent in-home connectivity solutions. We update our bundles and packages on an ongoing basis to meet the needs of our customers and to retain an attractive value for money ratio. Ultra-high download speeds of 1Gbps are available throughout our operational footprints in each of the U.K., Belgium and Switzerland, as well as over 70% of our operational footprint in the Netherlands, with the view towards availability throughout our full footprint in the Netherlands by the end of 2022. We use our competitively priced ultra-high-speed internet services to encourage customers to switch to our services from other providers. Our aim is to safeguard our high-end customer base and enable us to become more aggressive at the low- and medium-end of the internet market. By fully utilizing up to 1 Gbps technical capabilities of DOCSIS 3.1 technology on our cable systems, we can compete with any FTTx, DSL or LTE players today. 
Across Europe, our key competition in this product market is from the offering of broadband internet products using various FTTx and DSL-based technologies by the incumbent players and third parties. The introduction of cheaper and ever faster fixed-line broadband offerings by alternative network providers is further increasing the competitive pressure in this market. A notable emerging factor is an overbuild of our networks with FTTx technology by the incumbent players and other 
I-17


third parties. At the moment, we do not consider our networks to be critically overbuilt; however certain FTTx providers have announced plans to accelerate their FTTx rollout. We are confident that our hybrid fiber-coaxial networks can be upgraded to higher speeds, to match or exceed potential FTTx based products. Furthermore, in some instances FTTx upgrades or new build could provide an opportunity for Liberty Global or its joint venture entities to take wholesale access and expand our geographical coverage. For instance, the VMO2 JV has announced plans to upgrade its entire fixed network in the U.K. to full fiber-to-the-premise, costing marginally more than its previously planned DOCSIS 4 upgrade.
•Telenet. In the Flanders region of Belgium, Telenet is the leading provider of residential broadband internet services. Telenet’s primary competitor is Proximus. Proximus is a well-established competitor offering quad-play bundles. Proximus’ DSL and very high-speed DSL technology (VDSL) services provide download speeds up to 100 Mbps. Moreover, Proximus offers up to 1 Gbps speed via its fiber network that is available in selected cities and being actively deployed. Similar to its video services, Telenet faces competition in the provision of internet services from other providers who have wholesale access to Telenet’s cable network. Through such access, Orange Belgium currently offers its mobile subscribers a triple-play bundle including enhanced video, mobile and fixed broadband internet services. Furthermore, Orange Belgium has announced an acquisition of Voo, a telecom operator that owns cable networks in the Wallonia region of Belgium. This might indicate further intensification of market competition where Telenet is using its ultra-high-speed 1Gbps connectivity and innovative fixed-mobile converged packages called ONE and ONE(Up) to promote its services and retain its customer base. Furthermore, Telenet recently announced the intention to create a new, self-funded netco with utility company Fluvius that hopes to own the “data network of the future” in the Flanders region.
•Sunrise UPC. In Switzerland, Swisscom is the largest provider of broadband internet services, and is Sunrise UPC’s primary competitor. It is also continuing to expand its FTTx network and is rolling-out its G.fast technology. Swisscom offers download speeds ranging from 50 Mbps to up to 10 Gbps, depending on the region. Swisscom continues to expand its FTTx network to Switzerland households in our footprint, as well as in our partner network footprints. Salt, a predominantly mobile player, also competes in this arena, with a focus on fixed-mobile convergence through a combination of FTTx and fixed wireless access technologies offering 10 Gbps internet speeds. In this competitive market, Sunrise UPC recently launched a new “Sunrise We” fixed-mobile convergence portfolio, enabling customers to benefit from the ultra-high-speed connectivity that is available across all of Sunrise UPC’s customer premises and offers significant fixed and mobile cross-selling opportunities. For more information on the Sunrise Acquisition, see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
•Joint Ventures.
In the U.K., the VMO2 JV faces numerous competitors for broadband internet services, the largest of which is BT. BT is actively building out its FTTx network through its subsidiary, Openreach, to support its goal of covering 25 million homes by the end of 2026. In support of this mission, BT has launched a range of ultrafast consumer packages offering speeds of up to 900 Mbps. At the moment, we estimate the VMO2 JV’s fixed network to be 25% overbuilt by BT but it has had limited impact on the VMO2 JV’s headline indicators so far. As noted above, the VMO2 JV reached 1Gbps connectivity in all its approximately 15.6 million premises. Moreover, the VMO2 JV announced its intention to upgrade its fixed network to full fiber-to-the-premise by the end of 2028. This plan is expected to fuel connectivity innovation for consumers and businesses, create options to potentially pursue the broadband wholesale market in the U.K and to protect from growing FTTx competition. In addition, we currently see limited competition from mobile broadband developments, such as LTE and 5G mobile services and WiFi services.
The VodafoneZiggo JV’s primary competitor, KPN offers internet protocol television (IPTV) over its FTTx network and through broadband internet connections using DSL or VDSL or an enhancement to VDSL called “vectoring”. Where KPN has enhanced its VDSL system, it offers broadband internet with download speeds of up to 200 Mbps, and on its FTTx networks, it offers download speeds of up to 1 Gbps. Portions of the VodafoneZiggo JV’s network have been overbuilt by KPN’s and other providers’ FTTx networks. In 2021, KPN established a joint venture company called Glaspoort. Glaspoort will invest over one billion Euros in fiber roll-out over the next five years. The original scope of Glaspoort included approximately 685,000 households in medium-dense areas and about 225,000 business premises. Later in 2021, these plans were increased by approximately 170,000 households. KPN will continue to pursue its existing fiber roll-out plans of roughly 2.5 million additional households in the coming five years, with Glaspoort’s scope expected to accelerate KPN’s goal to reach approximately 80% FTTx coverage by 2026. We expect competitive pressure from the fiber overbuild to intensify in the coming periods. At the end of 2021, over 70% of the 
I-18


VodafoneZiggo JV’s 7.3 million households had access to ultra-fast 1Gbps connectivity to support our competitive edge and speed advantage.
Video Distribution
Our video services compete primarily with traditional FTA broadcast television services, DTH satellite service providers, OTT and broadcaster VoD providers, as well as other fixed-line and mobile telecommunications carriers and broadband providers offering a similar range of video services. Many of these competitors have a national footprint and offer features, pricing and video services individually and in bundles comparable to what we offer. In certain markets, we also compete with other cable providers who have overbuilt portions of our systems.
OTT video content providers utilizing our or our competitors' high-speed internet connections are also a significant competitive factor, as are other video service providers that overlap our service areas. The OTT video providers (such as HBO Now, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Disney+ and AppleTV+) offer VoD service for television series, movies and programming from broadcasters. Generally, the content libraries of such services are offered for a monthly fee. Typically these services are available on multiple devices in and out of the home. Moreover, broadcasters offer direct to customer content, including VoD, live and catch-up television via their own platforms (such as BBC iPlayer, Discovery and RTL). To retain our competitive position, we provide our subscribers with TV everywhere products and premium OTT video services through our online mobile apps, VoD and Replay TV services or through our arrangements with Netflix and Amazon, as well as YouTube and relevant local OTT VoD services. Our businesses also compete to varying degrees with other sources of information and entertainment, such as online entertainment, newspapers, magazines, books, live entertainment/concerts and sporting events. 
Our ability to attract and retain customers depends on our continued ability to acquire appealing content, provide easy to use services on acceptable terms and to deliver content on multiple devices inside and outside the home. Some competitors have obtained long-term exclusive contracts for certain programming, which limits the opportunities for other providers to offer such programs. Our operations have limited access to certain of such programming through select contracts with these companies, including Sky and BT in the U.K. and Ireland. Moreover, telecommunication providers increasingly offer access to OTT platforms through their systems. If exclusive content offerings increase through other providers, programming options could be a deciding factor for subscribers on selecting a video service. 
Similar to our technological advances in our video services (such as launches of Horizon 4, apps on third-party devices and all-IP TV box), our competitors are also improving their video platforms with next generation set-top boxes, TV everywhere products and other interactive services. In all of our markets, competitive video services are offered by both incumbent and non-incumbent telecommunications operators, whose strategies include video services over DSL, VDSL and FTTx networks and, in some cases, DTH and digital terrestrial television (DTT). The ability of incumbent operators to offer the triple-play of broadband internet, video and fixed-line telephony services and, in most countries, a quad-play with mobile services, is exerting competitive pressure on our operations, including the pricing and bundling of our video products. In order to gain video market share, the incumbent operators and alternative service providers in a number of our larger markets are pricing their DTT, IPTV or DTH video packages at a discount to the retail price of the comparable digital cable service.
We compete on value by offering advanced digital services with a premier user interface, such as cloud recording and DVR functionality, HD/4K, VoD, voice control, OTT aggregation, Replay TV and multiscreen services via a superior user interface. We also compete by offering attractive content packages, as well as bundled services, at reasonable prices. In each of the countries where we operate, we tailor our packages to include attractive channel offerings and offer recurring discounts for bundled services and loyalty contracts, as well as integrated billing for OTT services. In addition, from time to time, we modify our digital channel offerings to improve the quality of our programming. Where mobile voice and data are available, we focus on our converged service offerings at attractive prices. In our other operations, we use the triple-play bundle as a means of driving video, as well as other products where convenience and price can be leveraged across the portfolio of services. We also continue to enhance our Horizon 4 platform to meet our customers’ desire to view programming anytime and anywhere, such as new applications and expanding its availability in our markets. 
•Telenet. Telenet’s principal competitor is Proximus, the incumbent telecommunications operator, which has interactive digital television, replay television, VoD, OTT and HD service as part of its video offer, as well as mobile-only video propositions tailored to the needs of younger market segments. Proximus offers customers a wide range of both individual and bundled services at competitive prices. Also, Telenet and other Belgian cable operators must give alternative providers access to their cable networks. Orange Belgium N.V. (Orange Belgium) gained such access in 2016 and currently offers its mobile subscribers a triple play bundle, including mobile, enhanced video and broadband internet services. Telenet may face increased competition from other providers of video services who take advantage 
I-19


of the wholesale access and may be able to offer triple- and quad-play services. For more information on wholesale access, see Regulatory Matters—Belgium. 
In order to compete effectively against alternative providers, Telenet leverages its extensive cable network, the broad acceptance of its basic cable television services and Yelo Play and its additional features, such as HD and DVR functionality, VoD offerings, its Play Sports channel and original programming delivered via the Horizon 4 multimedia box. Telenet is able to offer international, national, regional and local content, including Dutch-language broadcasts, to its subscribers. It is also using mobile services to drive its other products through its converged offerings. In addition, during 2021, Telenet and DPG Media launched a new streaming platform called Streamz, which combines some of the best locally produced series and must-see international content from HBO, extensive kids’ content, films and documentaries. Streamz is available for a monthly fee. 
•Sunrise UPC. Our main competitor in Switzerland is Swisscom, the incumbent telecommunications operator, which provides IPTV services over DSL, VDSL and FTTx networks. Swisscom offers VoD services, DVR and replay functionality, HD channels and has exclusive rights to distribute certain sports programming. Swisscom launched an advanced set-top box in the market with voice control, Smart Home integration and content aggregation beyond video, such as music streaming and gaming services. Although its presence is limited, Salt focuses on value propositions by including TV within their bundles and providing access to OTT via Apple TV. In this saturated market, price competition and high promotional intensity are significant factors. To compete effectively in Switzerland, Sunrise UPC is promoting Horizon 4 (marketed as “UPC TV”) and related family of products together with Replay TV and VoD, giving subscribers the ability to personalize their programming and viewing preferences while delivering excellent user interface with voice control. Sunrise UPC has its own sports channel, My Sports and aggregates third-party apps (e.g. Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and YouTube). Moreover, in October 2021, Sunrise UPC expanded its video product offering to Yallo, its ancillary brand. This is an important step in moving Yallo to full telecommunications functionality, allowing Yallo customers to access over 270 channels (many in Full HD and Dolby Digital), Replay services and streaming apps such as Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon Prime which come pre-installed on the TV box. For more information on the Sunrise Acquisition, see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
•Joint Ventures. 
The VMO2 JV’s principal competitors for digital television services are Sky and FTA television providers. Other significant competitors are BT and TalkTalk Telecom Group plc (TalkTalk), each of which offer triple-play services, IPTV video services and multimedia home gateways. Sky owns the U.K. rights to various entertainment, sports and movie programming. Sky is both a principal competitor and an important supplier of content to us. Various Sky channels, including Sky Sports, are available over Sky’s satellite system and our cable networks, as well as via Sky’s apps and online players and other television platforms, and some of the channels are available on BT and TalkTalk platforms. The VMO2 JV distributes several basic and premium video channels supplied by Sky. BT is also both a principal competitor and an important supplier of content to us. BT owns premium BT Sport channels, providing a range of sports content, including football (soccer) from the English Premier League and exclusive rights to the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League. The BT Sport channels are available on our cable network as well as our competitors’ networks. The VMO2 JV is expanding its broadband network and actively promoting its 4K and HDR ready boxes running on its latest Horizon 4 platform (marketed as “Virgin TV360”) as well as it online streaming service, Virgin TV Go. Customers also have access to third-party apps such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and YouTube.
The VodafoneZiggo JV primarily competes with KPN with respect to video distribution, an incumbent telecommunications operator, which provides IPTV services over DSL, VDSL and FTTx networks. KPN offers many of the same interactive video service features as the VodafoneZiggo JV does including VoD services, DVR, replay functionality and HD channels. KPN also offers its customers bundling packages that include its video products, creating a highly competitive market for the VodafoneZiggo JV’s products and services.
Mobile and Telephony Services 
    In Belgium, as a mobile network operator (MNO), we are one of the larger mobile providers based on number of SIM cards. The same is true for the VodafoneZiggo JV in the Netherlands. We also substantially expanded our mobile business with the acquisition of Sunrise in Switzerland and through the joint venture with O2 in the U.K. In our other European markets, however, we currently have limited mobile presence. In the markets where we are an MNO, we continue to deploy additional bandwidth to deliver our wide range of services to our customers and expand our LTE and 5G services. Where we are a small 
I-20


mobile provider, we face significant competition from established mobile brands as well as ancillary, low-cost brands. Competition remains significant across each of our markets. We offer various calling plans, such as unlimited calling, national or international calling, unlimited off-peak calling and minute packages, including calls to fixed and mobile phones. In addition, we use converged bundles and benefits to cross-sell mobile to our existing fixed customers. Our ability to offer fixed-mobile convergence services is a key driver of growth.
    The market for fixed-line telephony services is saturated in almost all of our markets. Changes in market share are driven by the combination of price and quality of services provided and the inclusion of telephony services in bundled offerings. Our fixed-line telephony services compete against the incumbent telecommunications operators. In all of our markets, we also compete with other VoIP operators offering service across broadband lines. In addition, our businesses face competition from other cable telephony providers, FTTx-based providers or other indirect access providers. 
In each of our markets, we face competition with a dominant fixed-line telephony provider, most of which also have competitive mobile offers based on LTE or 5G services. In our largest markets, the key dominant telephony providers are Proximus (Belgium) and Swisscom (Switzerland). These telephony competitors are also the largest mobile operators in these markets based on number of SIM cards. These competitors include their mobile products in bundles with fixed-line services. Moreover, there is a fundamental shift in customer preference towards mobile. As a result, we expect fixed telephony users to decline in favor of mobile connectivity.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, our consolidated subsidiaries had an aggregate of approximately 11,200 full-time equivalent employees, including approximately 120 in the United States, 1,100 in the U.K., 900 in the Republic of Ireland, 3,450 in Belgium, 930 in the Netherlands, 3,120 in Switzerland, 1,320 in Poland, and 290 in Slovakia. With respect to our major non-consolidated joint ventures, the VodafoneZiggo JV employs approximately 6,360 people, and the VMO2 JV employs approximately 16,710 people. None of the above figures include contractors and temporary employees. 
A majority of our European employees are represented by workers councils. We strive to maintain a positive relationship with all of our employees, as well as the workers councils representing them where applicable. There have been no significant interruptions of our operations in recent years due to labor disputes. 
In challenging our employees to achieve their full potential, become purposeful leaders and to Grow With Us, we commit significant resources and make ongoing investments toward the development of our employees’ leadership skills. Our skills development offerings cover key talent communities - from graduates and apprentices, to people managers, emerging leaders and senior leaders. Such programs include our Finance, Technology, CyberSecurity and People graduate schemes that thrust new graduates into our fast-paced and dynamic business model, giving them immediate real-world experience along with structured support from the company, so that each graduate exits their program prepared to be a leader of tomorrow. Liberty Global invests significantly in its employees because it recognizes that when each employee is supported and given the opportunity to succeed, the company as a whole flourishes.
We are resolved to building a safe, accepting and inclusive culture in our workplace and have been actively involved in similar efforts in our local communities. A diverse and inclusive culture is critical to our performance, reputation and innovation, and it brings us closer to the communities in which we live and operate. In 2021, we built upon our redefined efforts toward Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I). In addition to appointing a new Chief DE&I Officer and further developing our DE&I Council, composed of our CEO and 19 executive representatives from around the company, we launched five Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) focusing on gender, race and ethnicity, multigenerational households, ability and neurodiversity and sexual orientation. The VMO2 JV and VodafoneZiggo JV, along with Sunrise UPC, also have their own ERGs to provide support to their local employees. We also conduct compulsory anti-bullying, anti-discrimination and anti-harassment training for all of our employees and engage in small-group, impactful conversations centering on discrimination and harassment in the workplace. Further, Liberty Global’s venture capital group has committed $10 million to investing in start-up companies, including through our partner, Avesta Capital, that make a positive impact on society. These companies, such as Blue Studios, Kiira Health, BoxPower, Harvest Thermal and Sunny Day Fund are specifically focused on socially conscious business practices such as tackling economic and social inequity, as well as climate change. 
Our compensation program is key to our company’s success and incentivizes our management team to execute our financial and operational goals. We concentrate on attracting, retaining and motivating talented executives who can be responsive to new and different opportunities for our company and thereby create value for our customers and shareholders. The primary goals of our executive compensation program are to: motivate our executives to maximize their contributions to 
I-21


the company’s success, attract and retain the best leaders for our business and align our executives’ interests with creating shareholder value.
At Liberty Global we are committed to the health and safety of our employees and visitors to our sites and we ensure compliance with all relevant national health and safety regulations. The continuing COVID-19 pandemic provides a powerful reminder of the critical role that connectivity plays in our lives. As an essential service provider to families, businesses, hospitals and schools, our COVID-19 response has been strong and well-received in our markets. We have prioritized the safety and well-being of our employees and customers while maintaining the highest-quality video, voice and broadband services, despite exceptional demands on our networks. For employees, we have embarked on a hybrid work-from-home/work-from-office pilot program while increasing health measures within our offices. We have made available a series of well-being resources based on a four-pronged strategy focused on the mental, physical, social and financial aspects of health and well-being. Included in this strategy, among other things, is access to group training sessions, private work-out facilities, bicycle reimbursement plans, in-office flu vaccinations, and private check-up visits. 
We measure employee engagement quarterly against external benchmarks defined by a leading human resources consultant. We perform in line with global industry benchmarks and exceed benchmarks set by high performing organizations in areas such as in inclusion, well-being, manager support and senior leadership communication. The high performing comparison group is comprised of organizations with strong financial performance and superior human resource practices, representing the gold standard for employee engagement. Survey results are owned by managers and executives, who are accountable for formulating action plans. In addition, we gather qualitative and quantitative insights with methods such as shorter-term pulse surveys and narrower focus groups. This approach informs decision making across key employee focus areas, including for example, well-being, work-from-home opportunities and skills development. 
Additional information on our workforce and our commitment to our employees is made available in Liberty Global’s Annual Corporate Responsibility Report, which we expect to be published on our website at the beginning of the third quarter of 2022.
Regulatory Matters 
General Overview
Video distribution, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile businesses are regulated in each of the countries in which we operate. The scope of regulation varies from country to country, although in some significant respects regulation in European markets is harmonized under the regulatory structure of the E.U.
Of the seven countries in our footprint, five are part of the E.U.: the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands (non-consolidated), Belgium, Slovakia and Poland. Our other operations are in the U.K. (non-consolidated) and Switzerland, both of which have separate jurisdictions but generally enact rules similar to that of the E.U. 
The U.K. formally left the E.U. on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as “Brexit”. On December 24, 2020, the U.K. and the E.U. reached the “Trade and Cooperation Agreement” referred to as the “E.U.-U.K. Agreement”. Principles on state aid are also contained in the E.U.-U.K. Agreement to prevent either side from granting unfair subsidies, and a dispute settlement mechanism is provided to ensure businesses from the E.U. and the U.K. compete on a level playing field. In relation to the telecommunications sector, the U.K. and the E.U. have agreed to maintain the existing levels of liberalization in their markets, including standard provisions on authorizations, access to and use of telecoms networks, interconnection, fair and transparent regulation and the allocation of scarce resources. The E.U.-U.K. Agreement contains measures to encourage cooperation and promote fair and transparent rates for international mobile roaming. However, the U.K. previously introduced a number of measures aimed at providing safeguards for consumers, which continue to apply. Such measures include limits on the amount that customers can be charged for using mobile data abroad before having to opt in if they wish to use more data and alert warnings as customers reach various milestones in data allowances included within their packages. Additionally, the Northern Irish Protocol regulates the relationship between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, ensuring that no hard border is placed between the two, as well as keeping Northern Ireland inside the E.U. single market. The Northern Irish Protocol, while not material to our or the VMO2 JV’s operations, affects the movement of consumer premises equipment and installation personnel between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. 
In Switzerland, most aspects of the distribution of radio and television are regulated under the Radio and television Act. In addition, the Competition Act, the Data Protection Act and the Act on the Surveillance of Post and Telecommunications (the Telecommunications Act) are potentially relevant to our business. 
I-22


Sector Regulations
The European Electronic Communications Code (the Code) is the primary source of regulation governing our E.U. operations. The Code came into effect on December 20, 2018 and is in the process of being transposed by the Member States and the U.K. into their respective national laws. On September 23, 2021, the European Commission warned a number of Member States for being late with the transposition, including Ireland, the Netherlands, Poland and Slovakia. The Member states in question were required to adopt and notify the relevant measures within two months - which we have not seen to date. The Commission may refer their cases to the Court of Justice of the European Union. The U.K. has largely transposed the Code into its national laws. Switzerland, while not part of the E.U., has a regulatory system that partially reflects the principles of the E.U. The Telecommunications Act in Switzerland regulates, in general, the transmission of information, including the transmission of radio and television signals. 
The Code primarily seeks to develop open markets for communication services within Europe. It harmonizes the rules within the E.U. for the establishment and operation of electronic communication networks, including cable television and traditional telephony networks, and the offer of electronic communication services, such as telephony (including OTT services), internet and, to some degree, television services. 
Set forth below are certain key provisions included in the Code that are most applicable to our operations.
•Significant Market Power. Specific obligations imposed by National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) in E.U. Member States apply only to service providers deemed to have Significant Market Power (SMP) in a relevant market. For purposes of the Code, a service provider has SMP where it enjoys a position of significant economic strength, affording it the power to behave independently of competitors, customers and consumers to an appreciable extent. 
If a service provider is found to have SMP in any particular market, the applicable NRA must impose certain conditions on that service provider. We have been found to have Significant Market Power in certain markets in which we operate and further findings of Significant Market Power are possible, which may negatively impact our business. However, across our footprint, we have noticed an increased tendency of NRAs towards deregulation, with only a small number of markets currently being subject to this type of regulation.
The U.K. has a similar system with the applicable NRA assessing markets on a forward-looking basis to determine SMP. In Switzerland, there is no such forward-looking system, rather a service provider can be regulated based on general competition law.
•Must-Carry Obligations. Member States may impose reasonable must-carry obligations on certain service providers under their jurisdiction. Such obligations must be based on clearly defined general interest objectives, be proportionate and transparent and be subject to periodic review. The U.K. and Switzerland have a regulatory system that reflects these principles. We are subject to must carry regulations in all markets in which we operate, and we do not expect the such obligations to be curtailed in the foreseeable future.
Net Neutrality, Roaming and Call Termination
In November 2015, the European Parliament adopted the regulation on the first E.U.-wide net neutrality regime. The regulation allows for specialized services, optimized for specific content and subjects service providers like Liberty Global to reasonable traffic management requirements. The U.K. transposed net neutrality into its national law following its exit from the E.U. The Telecommunications Act, in Switzerland introduced more transparent net neutrality regulation that allows for traffic management in very limited circumstances (e.g., to fight exceptional network congestion). Customers must be informed if traffic is treated unequally and about the quality of the internet service (for both fixed and mobile internet). 
The 2015 regulation mentioned above also prohibits retail roaming tariffs and sets wholesale roaming price caps. In 2019 the E.U. introduced caps on wholesale rates for intra-E.U. calls to bring these in line with the wholesale roaming caps. The Telecommunications Act in Switzerland implemented roaming obligations, including mandatory discounted roaming packages, per second or per kilobyte of roaming charges and capped fees for all roaming services. In relation to the U.K., E.U. operators are now free to raise wholesale charges for U.K. operators (and vice-versa) but may choose not to.
Call termination tariffs for SMP providers are set by NRAs, but for the E.U., the Code includes a system of single maximum E.U.-wide voice termination rates for fixed and mobile. In 2022, all fixed service providers will be subject to a maximum fixed termination rate of €0.07 per minute and by 2024 the single maximum rate for mobile termination will be €0.20 per minute. In the U.K., an SMP provider must provide termination on fair and reasonable terms, conditions and charges, which

must be no higher than BT’s regulated charges unless certain conditions are met. In all countries where we operate, we have been found to have SMP for call termination.
Broadcasting and Content Law
The Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMSD) governs the activities of broadcasters under E.U. law. The AVMSD is in the process of being transposed by the Member States into their respective national laws. On September 23, 2021, the European Commission warned a number of Member States for being late with the transposition, including Ireland and Slovakia. The Member States in question were required to adopt and notify the relevant measures within two months, which we have not seen to date. The Commission may refer their cases to the Court of Justice of the European Union. 
Generally, broadcasts originating in and intended for reception within an E.U. Member State must respect the laws of that Member State. Pursuant to the AVMSD, however, E.U. Member States must allow broadcast signals of broadcasters established in another E.U. Member State to be freely transmitted within their territory, so long as the broadcaster complies with the law of their home state. In addition, when we offer third-party VoD services on our network, it is the third-party provider, and not us as the distributor, that is regulated in respect of these services. The U.K. and Switzerland have regulatory systems that also reflect these principles.
The AVMSD established quotas, applicable to both linear and non-linear services, for the transmission of European-produced programming and programs made by European producers who are independent of broadcasters. Such obligations are applicable to our businesses in the E.U. The U.K. and Switzerland have regulatory systems that similarly reflect these principles. 
Member States are also allowed to require service providers to contribute financially to the production of European works, including requiring financial contributions from VoD providers established in other territories that targets audiences in their jurisdiction. Such obligations are applicable to (or are expected to become applicable to) certain of our businesses.
In addition, European Commission regulations mandate that commercial providers of online content services (including OTT service providers) enable subscribers who are temporarily present in any Member State to access and use online content services in substantially the same manner as in their Member State of residence. Our services comply with these portability requirements. 
In the U.K., the VMO2 JV is required to hold individual licenses under the Broadcasting Acts 1990 and 1996 for any television channels (including barker channels) that it owns or operates and to provide certain other services on its cable television platform, such as electronic program guides. These television licensable content service (TLCS) licenses are granted and administered by the U.K. Office of Communications (Ofcom). Under these licenses, each covered service must comply with a number of Ofcom codes, including the Broadcasting Code, and with all of Ofcom’s directions. Breach of any of the terms of a TLCS license may result in the imposition of fines and, potentially, license revocation.
As a provider of an on-demand program service (ODPS), the VMO2 JV must also comply with a number of statutory obligations in relation to “editorial content” and notify Ofcom of its intention to provide an ODPS. Failure to notify Ofcom or comply with the relevant statutory obligations may result in the imposition of fines or, ultimately, a prohibition on providing an ODPS.
Technological Regulation
The European Commission is increasingly imposing additional mandatory requirements regarding energy consumption of the telecommunications equipment we provide our customers. We have been working to lower power consumption of our set-top boxes. Legislation in this area may be adopted that could adversely affect the cost and/or the functionality of equipment we deploy to customers. 
Pursuant to an E.U. Regulation on standby power (the Standby Regulation), many devices are required to have either a low power standby mode or off mode, unless such mode is inappropriate for the intended use of the product. In particular, the Standby Regulation sets, among others, the maximum power consumption of networked consumer equipment while in the so-called “Networked Standby” mode. As a result, all of the devices we purchase and/or develop operate under the power management requirements of the Standby Regulation. 
Also, the E.U.’s Radio Equipment Directive regulates radio equipment held for sale. It sets essential requirements for safety and health, electromagnetic compatibility and the efficient use of the radio spectrum. This directive also provides the 
I-24


basis for further regulation governing some additional aspects, including technical features for the protection of privacy, personal data and fraud, interoperability, access to emergency services, and compliance regarding the combination of radio equipment and software. The European Commission recently adopted a delegated act under the Radio Equipment Directive to improve network resilience and better protect consumer’s privacy. The delegated act will enter into force during the first quarter of 2022 and will apply beginning on August 1, 2024.
Due to a Mutual Recognition Agreement established between the E.U. and Switzerland, the Standby Regulation and the Radio Equipment Directive also applies in Switzerland. Before Brexit, the U.K. implemented the Standby Regulation and the Radio Equipment Directive into national law.
Through the E.U.’s Radio Spectrum Policy Program, certain spectrum has been approved for mobile broadband use. The terms under which this spectrum becomes available varies among the European countries in which we operate, and certain uses of this spectrum may interfere with services carried on our cable networks. If this occurs, we may need to: (1) avoid using certain frequencies on our cable networks for certain of our services, (2) make some changes to our networks, or (3) change the equipment that we deploy. We are in ongoing discussions with relevant Member States and the European Commission to develop mitigation techniques to reduce some of this interference, but we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these discussions.
Privacy Regulation 
In May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) became effective in the E.U. The GDPR sets strict standards regarding the handling, use and retention of personal data. Organizations that fail to comply face stiff penalties. In addition, in January 2017, the European Commission published a proposal for a new e-Privacy regulation. Negotiations among E.U. Member States are still in process, and we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these negotiations. 
The GDPR applies to the European Economic Area (EEA), which includes the E.U. and a number of countries, not including the U.K. or Switzerland. When personal data is transferred outside the EEA, special safeguards stemming from the GDPR, such as the adoption of adequacy decisions and the use of standard contractual clauses (SCCs), are enforced to ensure that data is transferred in a protected manner. Adequacy decisions indicate which third countries have in place data protection laws sufficiently similar to those provided under the GDPR. Transfers to an “adequate” third country is compared to a transmission of data within the E.U. 
On June 28, 2021, the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision for the U.K., as the U.K.’s data protection system continues to be based on the same GDPR rules that were applicable when the U.K. was a Member State. However, the adequacy decision is subject to a so-called “sunset clause”, which establishes the automatic expiration of the decision after four years from its adoption. After that period, the adequacy findings may be renewed if the U.K. continues to ensure an adequate level of data protection. 
When a data transfer involves a third country that has not been granted an adequacy decision, our operations must use SCCs. On June 4, 2021, the European Commission issued an implementing decision on new SCCs, applicable as of September 27, 2021. Using standard contractual clauses does not automatically make an international data transfer GDPR compliant. Instead, the parties must perform “transfer impact assessments” in order to address any possible risks in the data transfer and take supplementary measures. The impact assessment takes into account maters such as the circumstances of the transfer, the nature of the parties, the personal data involved and the laws and practices of the country of destination.
A continued flow of personal data from the EEA to Switzerland is ensured by the Swiss Data Protection Act (DPA). The Swiss Parliament adopted a revised version of the DPA that provides more transparency regarding the processing of data and strengthens the individual’s information rights (e.g., if his/her data is processed in a foreign country.
Other European Regulations
In addition to the industry-specific regimes discussed above, our operating companies must comply with a range of both specific and general legislation concerning cybersecurity and consumer protection, among other matters.

With respect to cybersecurity, in 2016, the E.U. adopted a directive on security of network and information systems (NIS Directive), which provides legal measures to boost the overall level of cybersecurity in the E.U. Our operations in the E.U. do not fall under the NIS Directive, but a transposition of the Directive in Ireland and the Netherlands has effectively introduced the NIS Directive concepts into those jurisdictions. In December 2020, the European Commission presented a revised version 
I-25


of the legislation that seeks to expand the scope of the NIS Directive, adding new sectors, including telecommunication providers. If adopted, more of our operations may become subject to the security requirements of this second NIS Directive.
During 2020, across the E.U. and in the U.K., restrictions related to so-called “high risk vendors” (HRVs) in the telecommunications sector were announced. The E.U. published a “toolbox” for regulating 5G networks, which acknowledges the need for a risk assessment of 5G equipment suppliers and the need for adopting mitigating measures by E.U. governments. Some Member States are addressing security concerns by identifying individual HRVs in advance, whose equipment should be excluded or limited for all network operations in the country. The Swiss government is also considering new draft measures in the field of telecommunications security. 
In November 2021, the U.K. government introduced the Telecoms Security Act, which imposes a new security framework on telecommunication providers and give the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport new powers to direct telecommunication providers to remove HRVs from their networks. Similar legislation has also been adopted in the Netherlands and Belgium.
The Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act currently being discussed by the European Parliament do not, as currently contemplated, appear to impact our businesses. However, we cannot predict what the final legislation will say.
Our operating companies are also subject to both national and European level regulations on competition and on consumer protection, which are largely regulated under the Code. For example, while our operating companies may offer their services in bundled packages in European markets, they are sometimes not permitted to make a subscription to one service, such as cable television, conditional upon a subscription to another service, such as telephony. They may also face restrictions on the degree to which they may discount certain products included in the bundled packages.
Belgium
Telenet has been found to have SMP in the wholesale broadband market, obliging it to (1) provide third-party operators with access to the digital television platform (including basic digital video and analog video) and (2) make available to third-party operators a bitstream offer of broadband internet access including fixed voice as an option. The Belgian NRA has imposed monthly wholesale cable resale access prices. These rates are expected to evolve over time due to, among other reasons, broadband capacity usage.
The obligations on Telenet may strengthen its competitors by granting them resale access to Telenet’s network to offer competing products and services notwithstanding Telenet’s substantial historical financial outlays in developing the infrastructure. In addition, any resale access granted to competitors could (1) limit the bandwidth available to Telenet to provide new or expanded products and services to its customers, and (2) adversely impact Telenet’s ability to maintain or increase its revenue and cash flows. The extent of any such adverse impacts ultimately will be dependent on the degree to which competitors take advantage of the resale access of Telenet’s network, the rates that Telenet receives for such access and other competitive factors or market developments. 
Joint Venture Entities
United Kingdom
End of Contract Notifications and Annual Best Tariff Notifications. Specific obligations regarding end of contract and annual best tariff notifications are imposed by Ofcom on providers. These require the VMO2 JV to (i) alert customers who are approaching the end of a minimum contract term to the fact that their contract period is coming to an end and to set out the best new price that the VMO2 JV can offer them and (ii) once a year, alert customers who are out of contract to that fact and again confirm the best new price the VMO2 JV can offer them. In both cases, the VMO2 JV must also set out the price available to new customers for an equivalent service offering. These requirements have adversely impacted our and the VMO2 JV’s revenue since their implementation.
Broadband Expansion. The U.K. enacted the Telecommunications Infrastructure (Leasehold Property) Act in March 2021, pursuant to which, among other things, building regulations now require new housing developments to have Gbit capable access. This new legislation comes as a result of the U.K. government’s push to encourage greater investment in new digital infrastructure and deliver FTTH/Gbit capable networks to approximately 85% of U.K. premises by 2025.
I-26


The Netherlands
Similar to our other operations, the VodafoneZiggo JV is subject to must carry obligations, including a number of regional and local broadcasting channels, as well as public broadcasting channels. 
The Netherlands’ NRA, the Autoriteit Consument & Markt (ACM) is currently conducting a new market analysis of high-quality wholesale access. On November 18, 2021, the ACM submitted to the European Commission its intended decision to withdraw regulation of the high-quality business telecom services provided over KPN's network. If adopted, the decision will lead to a complete deregulation of the wholesale market in the Netherlands. A final decision of the ACM is expected in 2022.
