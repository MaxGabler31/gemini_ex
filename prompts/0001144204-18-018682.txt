Overview
 
We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing a pipeline of ophthalmology products utilizing our patented piezo-print technology to deliver micro-therapeutics topically to the eye. This micro-dosing technology has the potential to replace traditional macro-dosing applications (e.g. conventional eye droppers that deliver 30–50 µL) that routinely overdose or under-dose when used in the topical administration of ophthalmic therapeutics. We believe our micro-therapeutic product candidates may be able to achieve similar pharmacologic effects as traditional macro-dosing applications while reducing the adverse effects associated with these techniques. We have received written Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, feedback for our Phase III clinical trials for two of our lead programs: MicroProst, a novel micro-therapeutic latanoprost formulation for CACG, an indication with no FDA-approved drug treatments; and MicroStat, a fixed combination of micro-therapeutic phenylephrine-tropicamide formulation for mydriasis, also known as pupil dilation for use in eye exams. MicroTears, our over-the-counter, or OTC, product candidate for dry eye, will not require Phase III clinical trials, and we plan to proceed with registration activities.
 
All of our product candidates utilize our patented piezo-print micro-dosing technology to enable the topical delivery of ophthalmic micro-therapeutics. Micro-dosing has long been the goal for ophthalmic medications because the eye only holds 6–8 µL of fluid, yet traditional eye drops overdose the eye with 30–50 µL of fluid, which frequently leads to adverse side effects such as redness, irritation and pain, increased risk of certain cardiac and respiratory side effects, as well as inconveniences such as overflow down the cheek and into the nose through the naso-lacrimal duct or under-dosing in patients that lack motor control to properly use a conventional eyedropper and thus administer the drops outside the eye. We believe our easy-to-use piezo-print technology may enable patients to consistently deliver doses of 6–8 µL of ocular therapeutics, representing maximum eye capacity, and reduce ocular exposure to preservatives and pharmaceutical ingredients by over 75%.

We have completed two Phase II clinical trials, treating more than 110 subjects, with results published in peer-reviewed literature. Applying multiple front-of-the-eye (the area in front of the lens) formulations in subjects for mydriasis, our piezo-print technology delivered microliter precision at the volume of the eye’s natural tear film capacity of 6–8 µL, which reduced ocular and systemic drug and preservative exposure when compared to eye drops, resulting in comparable efficacy and fewer side effects. We believe that these clinical trials support our advancement into late stage clinical trials through the 505(b)(2) pathway. We intend to use this pathway for future clinical trials in new indications with significant unmet needs.
 
A key feature of our patented technology is the embedded electronic, smartphone enabled “e-health” system which we believe is the first-ever intelligent electronic delivery system for ophthalmic therapies. Our electronic functions are designed to enable patients and physicians to track when doses are administered to better monitor and improve patient compliance.
 
The following summarizes our product pipeline and expected milestones:
 

Product Candidate | Indication | Next Expected Milestones
-------------------+--------------------------------+-------------------------
MicroProst | Chronic Angle Closure Glaucoma | Phase III IND H2 2018 
MicroStat | Mydriasis (Pupil Dilation) | Phase III IND H2 2018 
MicroTears | Dry Eye | OTC Registration H1 2019
MicroPine | Myopia (Near Sightedness) | Phase III IND H1 2019 

 
In addition to MicroProst, MicroStat and MicroTears, we are developing an expanded pipeline of product candidates and are preparing them for late-stage clinical trials. The first pipeline opportunity is MicroPine, which is a micro-therapeutic formulation of atropine to target myopia (or near sightedness) progression. Clinical trials conducted to date, as well as a recent technology analysis and review by the American Academy of Ophthalmology, indicate Level 1 (highest) evidence of efficacy for the role of low dose atropine for myopia progression. To date, no therapy has been possible due to side effects associated with existing macro-dosed drop formulations in the pediatric population using atropine. We met with the FDA on December 15, 2017 to discuss our Phase III trial design for MicroPine. FDA feedback indicates that we can proceed to Phase III with a primary endpoint of reduction of myopia progression, enrolling children and adolescents with a three-year follow-up. We have begun development activities for MicroPine with a planned Phase III clinical trial expected to be initiated in 2019.
 
Our management team is a critical component to the execution of our overall strategy and our business model. We have assembled a team with significant experience in translational science, drug evaluation, clinical development, regulatory affairs and business development. Our management team is led by our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Tsontcho Ianchulev, who has over 15 years of experience in public health, life-science and medical technology covering the spectrum of biotech and med-tech. He is a prolific inventor, innovator, physician-executive and public health expert who has been at the core of developing medical products and technologies which have transformed the ophthalmic field and are impacting medical care for hundreds of thousands of patients every year. His intellectual property was a core asset to WaveTec’s (acquired by Alcon) technology for intraoperative aberrometry. While at Genentech, Inc., Dr. Ianchulev headed the ophthalmology research group and directed the development and the FDA approval of Lucentis, the most successful specialty biologic in the field of ophthalmology with more than $4 billion of annual sales in 2015. Most recently, he headed all clinical development of Transcend Medical’s (acquired by Alcon) micro-stent for glaucoma. Dr. Ianchulev’s clinical experience, combined with development and commercial work in both biopharmaceuticals and medical devices make him ideally suited to lead Eyenovia.
 
In addition to Dr. Ianchulev, the management team has other professionals with deep engineering, clinical trial, regulatory and commercial experience in ophthalmology. Our management team is supported by our Board of Directors, which has extensive professional experience in strategic development, executive, operational and financial leadership in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries, including several successful ophthalmology companies.

Strategy 
 
Our goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing novel therapies for front-of-the-eye conditions by utilizing our micro-therapeutic piezo-print technology. The key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are:
 
Establish a portfolio of first-in-class piezo-print micro-therapeutic products for front-of-the-eye treatments through the 505(b)(2) pathway with the FDA.   We are initially focused on developing technology utilizing therapeutic compounds already well-established in the topical treatment of ophthalmic indications. We believe the 505(b)(2) registration pathway, which reduces development risk compared to new molecular entity programs, will be available for our initial development pipeline. We believe our pipeline of patented micro-therapeutic product candidates will be highly differentiated by our improved tolerability and enhanced compliance profile and our late-stage development programs could lead to New Drug Application, or NDA, submissions in novel indications where the products can have unique dosing and therapeutic profiles. We believe that this could lead to favorable pricing and reimbursement, and a reduced risk of generic substitution.
 
Improve clinical outcomes and patient experiences while providing an improved tolerability profile with our micro-therapeutics.   We believe our piezo-print platform will allow for high precision targeted micro-dosing for front-of-the-eye treatments, while eliminating ophthalmic over-dosing and reducing ocular exposure to toxic preservatives and pharmacologic ingredients by over 75% compared to conventional eye drop delivery mechanisms. Our clinical trials have demonstrated equivalent biologic activity, improved side effect profile and enhanced patient experience of our micro-therapeutic approach as compared to conventional eye drops.
 
Leverage our electronic, smartphone-enabled “e-health” technology to introduce and develop patient-specific compliance monitoring program.   Our mobile e-health technology and smart cartridges are designed to track when a patient administers treatments, allowing physicians to track patient compliance accurately. We believe this may enhance patient compliance and improve compliance monitoring by empowering patients and physicians with access to dynamic, real-time monitoring and compliance data for a more intelligent, informed and personalized therapeutic paradigm.
 
Develop micro-therapeutic treatments for other ophthalmic diseases independently or in collaboration with third parties.   Our piezo-print technology is also suitable for new molecular entities. Leveraging our existing platform technology, we plan to continue developing other micro-therapeutic product candidates for front-of-the-eye diseases that can be administered using our piezo-print technology platform with mobile e-health technology and smart cartridges either independently or through strategic partnerships with third parties. We have entered into an exclusive agreement with Senju Pharmaceuticals, a leading ophthalmology company in Japan, for the Asian development and commercial rights of our therapies and technology.
 
Develop solutions for ophthalmic conditions with high unmet needs and no approved therapy.   We will target chronic ophthalmic conditions with a high unmet medical need. By leveraging our piezo-print micro-dosing technology, we aim to reach conditions where there are no approved therapies. For example, our MicroPine program which is a micro-formulation of atropine, is intended to slow myopia progression in the pediatric population. However, there are currently no therapies on the market due to side effects associated with traditional macro-dosing drop formulations.
 
Limitations of Conventional Front-of the-Eye Therapies 
 
Our micro-dosing platform technology aims to address the following issues associated with eye drop-based therapies.
 
Dosing, administration and waste of medication 
 
Multiple third party studies have confirmed the challenges with administering conventional eye drops including overdosing, poor compliance, imprecise dosing, variability in drop size, and patient difficulty in self-administering. One study in patients experienced in using eye drops undergoing treatment for glaucoma for at least 6 months documented that 9 out of 10 patients were unable to deliver topical treatment correctly at the end of the 6 month treatment. Patients on average administered almost twice the macro-dose with a range of one to eight drops (1.8+/-1.2), and 75% of patients risked bottle contamination or potential ocular trauma by having the eye dropper container touch their eyes. Another larger study in 139 patients demonstrated that the proportion of patients who were able to correctly deliver therapy on the eye was only 22%–30%. Other studies have demonstrated similarly that the vast majority of patients either overdose or do not administer correctly the required therapeutic to the eye, which leads to unnecessary waste of medication, a problem which is highlighted by recently introduced legislation in the U.S. Senate to address this specific concern.

Side effects associated with conventional macro-dose therapies 
 
Conventional front-of-the-eye therapies are administered using 100-year-old eye-dropper pipette approaches. Current eye drop therapies consistently overdose the eye with 30–50 µL of preservatives and pharmaceutical ingredients while the eye only holds 6–8 µL. Thus, traditional drops severely overdose the eye, which is associated with many ocular side effects including hyperemia, or increased blood flow to the eye, redness, discomfort, stinging, blurred vision, burning, itching, excessive tearing, eye pain, iris pigment changes, foreign body sensation, pigment discoloration, periorbital dermatitis and sunken eye. For some topical medications, there are also major cardiovascular side effects such as bradycardia and arrhythmia that are caused when medications are absorbed into the circulation system from overdosing — both through conjunctiva absorption and when drugs flow into the nose through the naso-lacrimal duct and are absorbed in the nose or swallowed. For example, phenylephrine can cause cardiovascular adverse reactions including an increase in blood pressure, syncope, myocardial infarction, tachycardia, arrhythmia and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Severe respiratory reactions and cardiac reactions, including death due to bronchospasm in patients with asthma, and rarely death in association with cardiac failure, have been reported following systemic or ophthalmic administration of timolol maleate.
 
Prostaglandins are a widely-used class of drugs for glaucoma. However, as shown in the chart below, they present a high risk of ocular irritation and adverse events. We believe micro-dosing will result in fewer adverse events due to less exposure to the drug and preservatives.
 

Frequencies of Adverse Events (Safety Population) 
---------------------------------------------------------
 | Latanoprost (n = 136) | | Bimatoprost (n = 137) | | Travoprost (n = 138) | 
 | n | | % | | No. of Events | n | % | | No. of Events | | n | % | No. of Events | | P Value
Patients with at least one adverse event | | 87 | | 64 | | 137 | | 104 | | 75.9 | | 200 | | 95 | | 68.8 | 159 | 0.098
Patients with ocular adverse events | | 73 | | 53.7 | | 110 | | 101 | | 73.7 | | 162 | | 89 | | 64.5 | 129 | 0.003
Patients with systemic adverse events | | 23 | | 16.9 | | 27 | | 25 | | 18.2 | | 38 | | 23 | | 16.7 | 30 | 0.933
Patients with adverse events related to study medications | | 70 | | 51.5 | | 90 | | 94 | | 68.6 | | 140 | | 81 | | 58.7 | 108 | 0.015

 
Potential for toxicity 
 
Many eye medications contain preservatives (e.g. benzalkonium chloride or BAC) which are toxic to the ocular surface. Cytotoxic assays have confirmed this and showed significant toxicity proportional to the concentration of BAC and its effects in causing ocular surface disease.
 
Another emerging problem with the prostaglandin-class of medications (e.g. latanoprost, bimatoprost, travoprost) has been the dose-related incidence of orbitopathy (or sunken orbits). The associations between prostaglandin analogue use and deepening of the upper lid sulci and between prostaglandin analogue use and loss of inferior periorbital fat were recently confirmed with a 230-fold increased risk of skin tissue shrinking around the eye.
 
Our Solution 
 
We believe that we are the only company with clinical stage technology for targeted micro-dosing of ophthalmic investigational therapies. Our solution is based on piezo-print technology, which is also used for pixel-sharp high-precision ink jet printing. It is miniaturized, optimized for and applied in ophthalmic delivery to achieve micro-dosing that is many times more precise than conventional eye droppers. Our targeted micro-dosing delivers doses of 6–8 µL in a targeted way, directly coating the corneal surface rather than the conjunctiva thus reducing collateral tissue exposure and focusing on the cornea where 80% of intraocular drug penetration occurs. We believe micro-therapeutic product candidates reduce greater than 75% of the drug exposure to reduce toxicity, resulting in potentially gentler and more tolerable treatments. Our micro-therapeutic approach also reduces waste associated with conventional macro-dose drops — a problem that has been highlighted by recently introduced legislation in the U.S. Senate to address this specific concern.

In the ophthalmology space, we believe that our micro-therapeutics will come with first-in-class smart sensing technology for mobile e-health applications and compliance monitoring, which will be standard with all of our smart cartridges. This technology has the potential to improve compliance and chronic disease management by tracking each time a patient administers treatment, empowering patients and physicians with access to dynamic, real time monitoring and compliance data for a more intelligent and personalized therapeutic paradigm. The FDA provided written feedback that our clinical programs will not be treated as a medical device or as a drug/device combination. All of our programs are treated as drug development programs because only the drug comes into contact with the eye. Consequently, we do not need a separate FDA approval for the piezo-print device or to comply with FDA regulations for medical devices.
 
Our micro-therapeutic solution has been tested in preclinical models and clinical trials and has been shown to provide many advantages over the current administrations.
 

CONVENTIONAL EYE DROPPER USING CENTURY-OLD PIPETTE DELIVERY × Overdoses the eye by more than 400% × Causes overdose-related ocular toxicity (drug / preservative / excipient exposure) • Hyperemia / red eye • Discomfort / stinging • Itching × 50–80% of eye drop applications miss the eye | EYENOVIA’S HIGH-PRECISION PIEZO-PRINT MICRODOSING ✓ Medication delivered directly to the cornea (primary site of ocular drug absorption) ✓ Gentle ocular surface microdroplet coating ✓ Less toxicity and drug/preservative exposure ✓ Fewer ocular side effects (redness, stinging) ✓ Lower systemic exposure 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Key advantages of our micro-therapeutic platform include:
 
Dose reduction:   Our micro-droplet delivery technology achieves precise volumetric control at the microliter level to deliver 6–8 µL, which is the physiologic capacity of the tear film compared to the dropper pipette macro-dose of 30–50 µL which results in overdosing, ocular toxicity and systemic leaching into the plasma.

Targeted dose instillation:   Our piezo-print technology allows for targeted delivery to the ocular surface and cornea, avoiding the conjunctival cul-de-sac. The micro-jet created by the piezo-electric vibrations is columnated and focused to provide accurate delivery to the corneal surface where the majority of ocular penetration occurs. Additionally, our technology includes an LED targeting mechanism to allow proper positioning and objective alignment.
 

Speed of delivery:   Similar to high-precision ink-jet printing that can deliver pixel-sharp ink printing, we use piezo-electric dispensation. Unlike a simple aerosolized mechanism, our patented piezo-printing technology achieves micro-droplet ejection control that creates a fast and targeted micro-jet delivery. We can deliver our micro-therapeutics to the ocular surface in less than 80 milliseconds beating the eye’s 100 millisecond blink reflex.
 


Smart electronics:   Our smart electronics and mobile e-health technology are designed to track when a patient administers treatment. This enables physicians to monitor patient compliance accurately. We believe this technology will improve compliance and chronic disease management by empowering patients and physicians with access to dynamic, real time monitoring and compliance data for a more intelligent and personalized therapeutic paradigm.
 
Clinical Trial Results 
 
We have a proven platform for the delivery of micro-therapeutics. Our preclinical and clinical studies suggest that a micro-therapeutic dose of medication delivers clinical activity comparable to that of a macro-dose delivery via traditional eye drops, but with the advantages of fewer ocular side effects and less systemic exposure. We can use our platform technology on either new molecular entities, to increase their chances of approval, or with existing molecular entities in order to improve their safety. We have chosen the latter path for our initial pipeline product candidate.

To date, we have conducted multiple preclinical studies and two Phase II clinical trials to validate our piezo-print micro-dose delivery platform. Our micro-dose approach was studied in preclinical studies to demonstrate pharmacodynamic equivalence of our targeted micro-therapeutic formulations and to assess whether micro-dosing can achieve comparable biologic activity with its significantly lower levels of drug and preservative exposure to the ocular tissues. Data from a canine model of glaucoma demonstrated more than 40% intraocular pressure, or IOP, lowering effect at micro-dose of 8–9 µL latanoprost. Another independent micro-dose study published in the Journal of Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science in 2014 further demonstrated that 3 µL micro-dose with timolol 0.5% can reduce systemic plasma levels of the drug by a factor of 17.


IOP Lowering Effect of Micro-Therapeutic Dose of Latanoprost in Canine Model 
 

We have completed two Phase II clinical trials to investigate the pharmacodynamic equivalence and clinical advantages of our micro-therapeutic approach. In these studies, we examined whether a micro-therapeutic dose of phenylephrine would dilate the eye as compared to a macro-dose with a traditional eye drop, as well as the side effect incidence of micro-dosing vs. drops. Results of the two Phase II micro-dose clinical trials suggest that our micro-dose piezo-print technology can deliver equivalent therapeutic activity as conventional eye drop macro-dosing while reducing the incidence of side effects by reducing by greater than 75% the patient’s exposure to preservatives and active pharmaceutical ingredients, which are the root cause of ocular surface toxicity, and topical and systemic adverse events associated with topical therapy.

The first clinical trial, which we refer to as the EYE102 Phase II clinical trial compared the mydriatic pharmacodynamic effect of our micro-dose (7 µL) Phenylephrine 10% versus standard dropper, which delivered 32 µL 10% phenylephrine (4 times our micro-dose of phenylephrine), versus an eye dropper that delivered 32 µL of phenylephrine 2.5% (same net amount of phenylephrine as our micro-dose). At 75 minute peak dilation, our micro-dose provided similar mydriatic activity at one quarter of the dose exposure of the dropper with 10% phenylephrine, and superior activity versus the equal dose exposure via 2.5% phenylephrine drops.
 
Pupil Diameter, Increase from Baseline, mm
 

Pupil diameter increase from baseline, at 45, 60, and 75 minutes post-administration of PE 2.5%, PE 10%, and EYN- each respectively administered on study Days 1, 7 and 14. Shown are mean±SEM for N=24 eyes of 12 subjects. Colored asterisk at t=75 min indicates significant difference versus comparator of asterisk color, in this case EYN vs PE 2.5% (p=0.009).
 
The study was also informative with regard to systemic drug exposure of topical treatment whereby the micro-dose product candidate demonstrated 35–40% lower plasma levels of the drug compared to same concentration macro-dose. There were also significantly fewer ocular adverse events, over macro-dosing.

In the EYE102 Phase II clinical trial, the same formulation micro-dose also suggested significant improvement in tolerability as compared to conventional eye drops.
 

OCULAR ADVERSE EVENTS BY TREATMENT
----------------------------------
Adverse Event Description | Eye Drop 10% | EYE102 (Micro- dose 10%)
Ocular blurriness | 1 | 0 
Ocular burning/stinging/irritation | 4 | 1 
Ocular dryness | 2 | 0 
Subtotal by Treatment Group | 7 | 1 

 
The other Phase II clinical trial (EYE 103 study) in 103 subjects investigated micro-therapeutics treatment with combination of phenylephrine and tropicamide compared to conventional eye dropper doses, the results of which were published in the peer-reviewed journal Therapeutic Delivery. In the study, micro-dosing produced equivalent dilation and 91% of participants preferred micro-dose versus the eyedropper; 6% preferred the eye dropper and 3% expressed no preference (p < 0.0001). General satisfaction scores were higher with the micro-dose versus eyedropper (9.8 ± 0.6 vs 5.8 ± 3.0). Regarding ocular discomfort, our micro-dose was nearly two times better than the eyedropper.
 

At the end of our Phase II clinical trial, we had a meeting with the FDA and have received guidance on the design and requirements for Phase III development programs for MicroProst in CACG and MicroStat in mydriasis as well as the requirements for MicroTears for OTC dry eye. Based on this guidance, we expect to initiate pivotal programs in the second half of 2018.
 
Our Product Candidates 
 
MicroProst 
 
MicroProst is our proprietary latanoprost prostaglandin micro-formulation product candidate being developed for a first-line indication therapy for CACG. Currently, there are no FDA-approved therapies for CACG, which accounts for 10% of all glaucoma in the U.S. and up to 50% of all glaucoma in China. If approved, MicroProst would be the first treatment approved for CACG.
Background of Chronic Angle Closure Glaucoma and Market Opportunity 
 
CACG is a well characterized and clinically diagnosed disease entity, as established by the American Academy of Ophthalmology Preferred Practice Patterns. Similar to the more prevalent open-angle glaucoma, it is characterized by increased IOP and optic neuropathy. Yet, its pathophysiology is underpinned by angle closure from peripheral anterior synechiae whereby the iris is occluding the drainage outflow to the trabecular meshwork in the angle. CACG is separate from acute angle-closure glaucoma which requires immediate intervention. There are more than 581,000 CACG patients in the U.S., as shown below. We conservatively estimate the addressable market at over $700 million in the U.S. alone.

Once angle-closure glaucoma develops, it is a condition that often requires chronic treatment. The mainstay of glaucoma treatment for both open and angle-closure glaucoma is IOP lowering with pharmacologic therapy. While IOP lowering pharmacotherapies have been FDA indicated and approved for IOP lowering in open-angle glaucoma, none have been specifically studied in FDA trials nor indicated for CACG, which is a less prevalent disease. Despite the unmet need and the fact that over 90% of CACG patients continue to require chronic lifelong IOP lowering therapy, physicians continue to use off-label treatments without the support of rigorous clinical trials and data. Therapeutic control is particularly important for CACG patients where it has been well established that optic nerve damage is more IOP-dependent than that of open-angle glaucoma and CACG patients progress two times more quickly than open-angle glaucoma patients.
 
There is strong clinical evidence from multiple studies as well as a more recent randomized controlled study published in the Archives of Ophthalmology that latanoprost and timolol cause significant IOP lowering in patients with CACG — 35% and 26% respectively. Even though there has been no FDA approved therapy, peer-reviewed and published clinical trials demonstrate robust therapeutic effect of latanoprost in CACG, which is highly informative for our forthcoming Phase III clinical trial. A randomized controlled study in 60 eyes published in the peer-reviewed journal, Archives of Ophthalmology, shows not only a high level of IOP lowering effect of 8.2 mmHg at 3 month but also superiority to active timolol control which only lowered IOP by 6.1 mmHg.

Mean | 23.4 ± 2.1 | 15.3 ± 1.8 | 8.2 ± 2.0 | 34.9 | 17.4 ± 1.7 | 6.1 ± 1.7 | 26.0 | <.01 

 
Additionally, 72% of patients taking latanoprost and 43% of patients taking timolol achieved more than 30% IOP lowering from baseline. Similarly, another randomized controlled study demonstrated an 8.8 mmHg IOP reduction with latanoprost and 5.7 mmHg reduction with timolol in patients with CACG. Data from these studies not only suggest the biologic therapeutic effect of IOP lowering in CACG but also highlight the undesirable associated safety profile of macro-dosing such as hyperemia and ocular discomfort which caused significant adverse events in more than 40% of patients. Based on these studies and the data from the open-angle glaucoma disease therapeutic paradigm, we believe MicroProst may demonstrate IOP lowering and an improved safety profile for CACG patients in our planned Phase III clinical trial.

Subsequent to the completion of our Phase II clinical trials, we met with the FDA to discuss our Phase III plans for MicroProst. The FDA outlined the necessary clinical trials for approval, and we are preparing to initiate a Phase III registration program, relying on the 505(b)(2) pathway, for a first-line therapeutic indication in CACG for MicroProst. If approved, MicroProst will be the first FDA-approved treatment for CACG. The targeted piezo-print technology will provide micro-dosing (6–8 µL) of prostaglandin latanoprost directly to the ocular surface of the cornea, which is the site of the highest intraocular penetration. We believe MicroProst will achieve similar clinical activity without the adverse effects seen with conventional drops, which overdose the eye with potentially harmful preservatives and API. This could provide additional opportunities for us to pursue follow-on expanded indications of MicroProst, such as for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma, where non-micro-therapeutic latanoprost is currently the primary therapeutic modality.
 
The MicroProst Phase III program will consist of two randomized controlled clinical trials in CACG with a 3-month primary end-point consisting of IOP reduction and follow-up for six months. We plan to commence the clinical trial in the second half of 2018, subject to a pre-IND meeting with the FDA in early 2018, and estimate 250 patients per clinical trial. If the primary objectives of our Phase III clinical trial are met, we plan to submit an NDA, for marketing approval of MicroProst for the treatment of CACG in the U.S. We have entered into a master licensing partnership for all of our micro-therapeutic programs, including our MicroProst program, with Senju Pharmaceuticals for Asia, including China, Japan and India.
 
MicroStat 
 
MicroStat is the potentially first-in-class fixed combination micro-formulation product candidate for mydriasis (eye dilation) intended to facilitate office-based eye examinations which serve over 80 million dilated retina eye exams performed each year in the U.S. MicroStat has been designed to achieve adequate pupil dilation while reducing unintended side-effects associated with conventional mydriatic agents.
 
Background of Mydriasis and Market Opportunity 
 
There are more than 80 million topical mydriatic applications performed every year as a required part of the comprehensive dilated eye exam and standard retina fundoscopy for diabetic retinopathy screening, macular degeneration evaluation, glaucoma optic disc evaluation and many other back-of-the-eye conditions. Most optometrist and ophthalmologist offices have multiple bottles of both phenylephrine and tropicamide and use each bottle on multiple patients, which carries a risk of contaminating patients’ eyes and spreading infections. The bottles are purchased directly from suppliers and are not subject to insurance reimbursement. Our combination therapy, if approved, will allow the purchase of one product for eye dilation, and our system does not come in direct contact with the eye, thus minimizing the risk of infection. We believe the addressable market is over $150 million in the U.S. alone.
 
Most dilated eye exams require that two separate topical pharmacologic agents/drops be administered sequentially (tropicamide and phenylephrine). All current mydriatic formulations use conventional macro-dose drop delivery (30–50 µL) which significantly overdoses the ocular surface whose physiologic capacity is only 6–8 µL. Studies demonstrate that standard macro-dosed pharmacologic dilation is associated with significant ocular discomfort and mild-moderate eye pain. On the standard visual analogue scale for pain, such discomfort can exceed the levels of pain associated with a flu vaccine subcutaneous injection. Additionally, there are systemic safety concerns with mydriatic macro-dosing for retinopathy of prematurity retinal screening and pediatric dilated eye exams. Studies comparing micro-dosed phenylephrine and cyclopentolate to traditional eyedrops (30–50 µL drop size) in premature babies and in full-term infants have shown equivalent pupil dilation with drop sizes ranging from 5–8 µL while reducing systemic levels by more than 50%.

With the millions of patients exposed to mydriatic pharmacologic agents every year, we are developing a micro-dose alternative whereby targeted piezo-print technology can be deployed to reduce ocular and systemic exposure by more than 75%. This potential improvement stems from lowering the dose from the 30–50 µL in standard drops to just 8 µL with MicroStat combined with targeted delivery to the ocular surface. We expect to achieve similar mydriatic activity as drops without the high incidence of unwanted side effects.
 

Pharmacologic mydriasis: dilated pupil after application
 
Phase III Clinical Development Program 
 
Based on our prior Phase II clinical trials and subsequent FDA feedback, we are proceeding towards the initiation of the Phase III mydriasis program for the potentially first-in-class fixed-combination, micro-formulation of phenylephrine 2.5% and tropicamide 1% (MicroStat). The MicroStat program will consist of two Phase III randomized controlled clinical trials to investigate pharmacologic dilation of our fixed combination micro-formulation versus drops of individual components (phenylephrine drops alone and tropicamide drops alone) with the primary endpoint of pupil change from baseline. We estimate 50 patients per clinical trial and are planning to commence the clinical trials in the second half of 2018. If the primary objectives of our Phase III program are met, we plan to submit an NDA to the FDA for marketing approval of MicroStat for pharmacologic mydriasis in the U.S. under the 505(b)(2) pathway. We have entered into a master licensing partnership for all of our micro-therapeutic programs, including our MicroStat program, with Senju Pharmaceuticals for Asia, including China, Japan and India.
 
MicroTears 
 
MicroTears is a differentiated micro-droplet ocular surface tear replenishment product candidate for the $2 billion-plus (200 million units sold annually) OTC artificial tear market. Our piezo-technology enables accurate delivery directly to the ocular surface, which we believe enhances its effectiveness. The lower volume of MicroTears will also lower the incidents of droplet overflow. While no FDA studies are required for registration of a monograph formulation, we expect to conduct multiple Phase IV post-marketing studies to demonstrate the benefits of MicroTears. We plan to complete formulation and manufacturing scale-up activities for expected introduction to market in mid-to-late 2019.
 
Background of Dry Eye Syndrome and Market Opportunity 
 
Dry eye syndrome, or DES, is a common ocular condition. It is a chronic, episodic, multifactorial disease affecting the tears and ocular surface that can result in tear film instability, inflammation, discomfort, visual disturbance and ocular surface damage. DES can have a significant impact on quality of life and can potentially cause long-term damage to the ocular surface. In addition, the vast majority of DES patients experience acute exacerbations of their symptoms, which are commonly referred to as flares, at various times throughout the year. These flares can be triggered by numerous factors, including exposure to allergens, pollution, wind and low humidity, intense visual concentration such as watching television and working at a computer, contact lens wear, smoking and sleep deprivation, which cause ocular surface inflammation and impact tear production and/or tear film stability.

13

Over 20 million people in the U.S. suffer from the symptoms of dry eye. Twenty-five percent of patients visiting ophthalmology clinics report dry eye symptoms. DES is a complex condition caused by a decreased tear production and/or increased tear evaporation. This can result in discomfort, visual disturbance, and tear film instability with potential damage to the ocular surface.
 
While many patients receive prescriptions for dry eye symptoms, the majority opt for OTC products. The artificial tears market is expected to exceed $2.0 billion in 2018, yet all artificial tears are delivered in single or multi-dose bottles that are not highly differentiated. We believe MicroTears will offer improved accuracy in delivering artificial tears to the eye, better ocular coating, and lower incidence of tears running down the patient’s face. We believe these factors will differentiate MicroTears from eye drop versions of artificial tears.
 
Additional Pipeline Assets 
 
In addition to the three late-stage development programs, we plan on leveraging our existing platform technology to continue developing other micro-therapeutic treatments for front-of-the-eye diseases that can be administered using our piezo-print technology.
 
We recently initiated the development of a micro-formulation of atropine for moderate to severe myopia (nearsightedness), an ocular disorder in which the optical power of the eye is too strong for the corresponding ocular anatomy. Myopia is the most common refractive error requiring correction seen in children. It is estimated that there are over 80 million children diagnosed with myopia worldwide and over 5 million in the U.S. While currently there are no FDA-approved therapies for myopia progression, there is growing evidence of the therapeutic activity of topical atropine, an anticholinergic agent use for dilation, as a treatment to slow progression. Despite activity, safety concerns such as pupil dilation, photosensitivity and accommodation difficulties associated with standard atropine 1% have tempered initial clinical adoption. While macro-dose atropine 1% is currently FDA-approved for pupil dilation in the U.S., its significant side effect profile has impeded clinical utility and adoption for myopia progression. If the primary objectives of our Phase III program are met, we plan to submit an NDA to the FDA for marketing approval of MicroPine to slow the progression of myopia under the 505(b)(2) pathway.
 
Our Technology 
 
The piezo-print device comes in two parts:
 

· | The base contains the electronic components which enable generation of control signals that ensure consistent, accurate columnated arrays of micro-droplets, as well as dose tracking via Bluetooth connectivity; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The disposable cartridge contains the drug formulation in a primary drug container, targeted dosing system and piezo-driven ejector nozzle, and comes in one-month doses.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
For administration of our product candidates, the patient receives both the base and the disposable cartridge. For refills, the patient receives only the disposable cartridge. Patients deliver their dose by attaching the cartridge to the base, pressing an activation button which loads a single drug dose, then, holding it between one and two inches from the eye while looking directly into an illuminated circle, pressing a second button to emit the micro-droplet delivered medication. The micro-droplets are emitted in a quickly repeating array, that in aggregate form a micro-jet. The delivery of the full dose occurs in less than 80 milliseconds, which beats the blink reflex of the eye and enables the medication to consistently coat the ocular surface while not flooding the eye’s tear capacity. The patient feels a wet sensation on the eye, but does not experience any pain, as demonstrated in studies to date. Several acute clinical trials have been performed to date that demonstrate its usability. As a precise and quick-delivered micro-dose, it does not drip down the face or drain down the naso-lacrimal duct thereby minimizing delivery of extra product or preservatives to the eye. The rechargeable base has intelligent power management and precision designed circuitry that maximizes battery life allowing for infrequent recharging, while always providing consistent dose delivery over the life of each cartridge.

Our system is partially based on piezo-driven printer technology, which is also used for high-precision ink jet printing. In ink jet printing, piezo technology enables ink to be sprayed with precision to form letters and numbers on paper. Our patented system takes aspects of piezo driven printer technology, and applies it to the delivery of therapeutics to the eye. Our technology has six issued U.S. patents.
 
Sales and Marketing 
 
In light of our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities. We have licensed commercialization rights in Asia to Senju Pharmaceuticals, and have retained global commercial rights for our product candidates in all other regions. As partial consideration, Senju Pharmaceuticals purchased $5 million of our Series A preferred stock in April 2015. Pursuant to the exclusive license agreement, Senju Pharmaceuticals also agreed to pay us royalties equal to 5% of the net sales (excluding manufacturing costs, rebates and other charges) for the licensed products sold by Senju Pharmaceutical on a semi-annual basis until the expiration of all patents or pending patent applications covering such licensed product, at which time the royalty rate will be reduced to 1%. The royalty payment will continue, on a country-by-country basis, until the latter of the 10th year of the first commercial sale of a licensed product in any country or the expiration of the licensed patents. Upon expiration of the exclusive license agreement, Senju Pharmaceuticals will own an exclusive, fully paid up, irrevocable and perpetual license. The exclusive license agreement may be terminated by either party for any material breach by the other party that is not cured within 90 days of receipt of written notice by the breaching party. If so terminated by Senju Pharmaceuticals, the license will survive the termination with no further payment obligations to us. If so terminated by us, the license will terminate and Senju Pharmaceuticals will transfer all rights to regulatory approvals to us, with no refund or recovery of any development costs. Senju Pharmaceuticals may also terminate the exclusive license agreement without cause upon 60 days’ written notice on a country-by-country basis, in which event Senju Pharmaceuticals will transfer all rights to regulatory approvals pertaining to any licensed product to us.
 
If our product candidates receive marketing approval, we would plan to commercialize them in the United States through a combination of distributors and our own specialty sales force. We would expect to work with distribution companies or through other marketing arrangements in the EU and other regions outside the United States. We believe that the U.S. commercial organization will consist of approximately 100–125 sales and marketing professionals calling on ophthalmologists and optometrists. We would expect to make hires and sign distribution agreements for commercialization following NDA approval of any of our product candidates. Our management team and directors, which would lead the commercialization planning of our lead product candidates, have substantial experience in the commercialization of ophthalmic therapeutics.

Manufacturing
 
We currently rely on a combination of internal manufacturing capacity and third-party manufacturers to produce the product candidates for our clinical trials. We manage such production with all our vendors on a purchase order basis. Relationships with vendors of critical components are governed by applicable master service and supply agreements. We do not currently have long-term agreements with these manufacturers or any other third-party suppliers. We intend to procure quantities on a purchase order basis for our clinical and initial commercial production. If any of our existing third-party suppliers should become unavailable to us for any reason, we believe that there are a number of potential replacements, although we might experience a delay in our ability to obtain alternately sourced quantities of materials or services. We also do not have any current contractual relationships for the manufacture of commercial supplies of our product candidates if they are approved. With respect to commercial production of our product candidates in the future, we plan to outsource production of the majority of the product candidates if they are approved for marketing by the applicable regulatory authorities.
Competition 
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technologies, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 
Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and specialty pharmaceutical and generic or biosimilar drug companies. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial and human resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller and other early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient enrollment for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring products, product candidates or other technologies that we may target to in-license or acquire in pursuit of our updated business plan.
 
For the MicroProst program, there are currently no FDA-approved therapies for chronic angle closure glaucoma and we are not aware of any in ongoing FDA registration studies. Physicians currently use off-label IOP lowering medications that are FDA-approved for a different disease entity, namely open-angle glaucoma.
 
For MicroStat, we are not aware of any micro-therapeutics nor of any existing phenylephrine-tropicamide topical fixed combination even in standard macro-dose. There are competitive macro-dose drop formulations of individual therapeutics such as phenylephrine and tropicamide for mydriasis by companies such as Akorn, Alcon and others.
 
For MicroPine, we are not aware of any FDA-approved therapies to slow the progression of myopia.
 
For MicroTears, there is a $2 billion market of multiple competitive artificial tear products with an aggregate of 200 million units sold annually, but none that we are aware of with targeted, ocular surface coating micro-droplet delivery. We believe the simplicity and convenience of our MicroTears system, which can be administered without tilting the head and with minimal risk of inconveniences such as dripping down the patient’s cheek, will differentiate our product from other artificial tears.
 
Intellectual Property 
 
Our success may depend on our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce our proprietary rights related to our products and other technologies. We must also operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others while preventing others from infringing our proprietary rights. We will seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications. We may also rely on trade secrets and know-how for some proprietary methods, methods of manufacture, and systems and devices. We continue innovating our technologies, and will file appropriate U.S. and foreign patent applications for our future innovations.

Patents 
 
As of January 9, 2018, we owned five U.S. issued utility patents, one issued design patent, and nine pending U.S. patent applications, as well as twenty-five issued and allowed foreign patents and fifty-six pending foreign patent applications.
 
Exemplary patent coverage within the portfolio includes issued and pending patent applications disclosing and claiming the following devices and methods:
 

· | A piezoelectric device configured to generate an ejected stream of droplets is the subject of one patent family. The device ejects droplets having an average ejected droplet diameter greater than 20 microns and an average initial droplet ejecting velocity between 0.5 m/s and 10 m/s. Furthermore, the stream of droplets is generated with low entrained airflow so that at least 75% of the mass is deposited on the eye. U.S. patent(s) for these devices are expected to expire in 2031.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A method of delivering a medicament or solution to an eye with a piezo-ejector device is the subject of another patent family. The method involves delivering an average droplet size of 20 microns to 100 microns in diameter with an average initial droplet ejecting velocity between 1 m/s and 10 m/s to the eye. About 85% to 100% of the ejected mass of droplets is deposited on the eye. U.S. patent(s) for these methods are expected to expire in 2031.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A device having a piezo-ejector that generates a directed stream of droplets through specially shaped openings in the piezo-ejector is the subject of still another patent family. The openings provide laminar flow through the openings. Laminar flow is provided by shaping the openings with a gradual slope change so that an external entry radius has a circular shape which reduces airflow while providing laminar flow through the openings. U.S. patent(s) related to these devices are expected to expire in 2033.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A piezo-electric ejector device having a microcontroller which auto-tunes the ejector mechanism is the subject of a yet another patent family. The device generates at least one cycle in a range of drive signal frequencies and obtains time-energy product feedback from a decay signal emitted by the actuator. U.S. patent(s) related to these devices are expected to expire in 2033.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A method of monitoring the treatment of ophthalmic subjects by capturing images of the eye is the subject of another patent family. Images of the eye are taken which are sufficient to obtain information about the diagnosis or health of the eye. The data is stored and analyzed to monitor treatment. U.S. patent(s) related to this method are expected to expire in 2031.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A fluid ejector having a fluid loading plate in parallel arrangement with an ejector mechanism is the subject of patent family patented in Europe. The fluid loading plate forms a capillary separation with the ejector mechanism to generate capillary fluid flow therebetween. The fluid loading plate is also attached to the reservoir (at a fluid reservoir interface) and to the ejector mechanism (at an ejector mechanism interface) and may have one or more fluid channels from the fluid reservoir interface to the ejector mechanism interface. The ejector produces a stream of droplets having a droplet diameter greater than 15 microns with the stream having low entrained airflow so that the pressure of the stream will be substantially imperceptible.

The expiry of any patent depends upon the legal term for patents in that particular country. In the U.S., the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the U.S., a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, in examining and granting a patent. A patent term may also be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent or application.
 
The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date of a U.S. patent as partial compensation for the length of time the drug is under regulatory review while the patent is in force.
 

17
--

 

A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. We cannot provide any assurance that any patent term extension with respect to any U.S. patent will be obtained and, if obtained, the duration of such extension. Similar patent term extension/reduction provisions are available in the European Union and other jurisdictions. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we will apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering our products to the extent available under the applicable law, depending upon the length of any such clinical trials for any product and other factors. The expiration dates referred to above are without regard to potential patent term extension or other market exclusivity that may be available to us. However, we cannot provide any assurances that any such patent term extension of a foreign patent will be obtained and, if obtained, the duration of such extension.
 
In Asia, we have been granted a patent in each of China, Japan and South Korea, that describes a piezoelectric device configured to generate an ejected stream of droplets with a particular droplet diameter and ejection velocity. We also have two additional patents granted in China, four additional patents granted in Japan, and two patents granted in Singapore, all related to aspects of the piezoelectric device and methods of using the device.
 
Proprietary Technology 
 
In addition to patents, we may rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect our technology. We will protect our proprietary technology and processes in the appropriate manner to maintain their secrecy including confidentiality agreements when dealing with third parties. We will also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. We shall also require invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, and contractors.
Government Regulation and Product Approvals 
 
Government authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the U.S. and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 
Review and Approval of Drugs in the U.S. 
 
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drug products under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. The failure to comply with applicable requirements under the FDCA and other applicable laws at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, voluntary product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities.
 
An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the U.S. must typically undertake the following:
 

· | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


18
--


· | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


· | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, and post-approval studies required by the FDA.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies 
 
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the purity and stability of the manufactured drug substance or active pharmaceutical ingredient and the formulated drug or drug product, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the safety and activity of the drug for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 
The IND and IRB Processes 
 
An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved drug to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer an investigational drug to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any new drug that is not the subject of an approved NDA. In support of a request for an IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. This waiting period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine whether human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30-day period, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin.
 
Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that clinical trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a specific protocol or part of a protocol is not allowed to proceed, while other protocols may do so. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed.

A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When the foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with FDA certain regulatory requirements in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Specifically, such studies must be conducted in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee, or IEC, and informed consent from subjects. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies.
 
In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct a continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 
Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a clinical trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the study. Suspension or termination of development during any phase of clinical trials can occur if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Other reasons for suspension or termination may be made by us based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
 
Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website.
 
Human Clinical Trials in Support of an NDA 
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated.
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
 

· | Phase I. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or, in certain indications such as cancer, patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase II. The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase III. The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.

Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical trials might not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.
 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies often complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 
Submission of an NDA to the FDA 
 
Assuming successful completion of required clinical testing and other requirements, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to an application user fee, which for federal fiscal year 2018 is $2,421,495 for an application requiring clinical data. The sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to an annual prescription drug program fee, which for fiscal year 2018 is $304,162. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for drugs with orphan designation and a waiver for certain small businesses.
 
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA within 60 days of its receipt and informs the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA’s receipt of the submission to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Most such applications are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date of filing, and most applications for “priority review” products are meant to be reviewed within six months of filing. For applications of drug products that are not new molecular entities, FDA aims to conduct standard reviews within 10 months of receipt of the NDA and priority reviews within 6 months of receipt of the NDA. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.
 
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including drug component manufacturing (such as active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing, and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.

In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS before approval or post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product.
 
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 
The FDA’s Decision on an NDA 
 
On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 
If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 
Post-Approval Requirements 
 
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval.
 
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.

Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 

· | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
 
Section 505(b)(2) NDAs 
 
NDAs for most new drug products are based on two full clinical trials which must contain substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the proposed new product. These applications are submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. The FDA is, however, authorized to approve an alternative type of NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. This type of application allows the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s previous findings of safety and efficacy for a similar product, or published literature. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) applies to NDAs for a drug for which the investigations made to show whether or not the drug is safe for use and effective in use and relied upon by the applicant for approval of the application “were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted.”
 
Thus, Section 505(b)(2) authorizes the FDA to approve an NDA based on safety and effectiveness data that were not developed by the applicant. NDAs filed under Section 505(b)(2) may provide an alternate and potentially more expeditious pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. If the Section 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, the applicant may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical studies or clinical trials of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new drug candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
 
Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs 
 
In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference-listed drug, or RLD.

23
--

 

Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if “the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug...”
 
Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is “therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD in its publication Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, also referred to as the Orange Book. Clinicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA’s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing clinicians or patient.
 
Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA might not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. For the purposes of this provision, a new chemical entity, or NCE, is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval.
 
The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. Three-year exclusivity would be available for a drug product that contains a previously approved active moiety, provided the statutory requirement for a new clinical investigation is satisfied. Unlike five-year NCE exclusivity, an award of three-year exclusivity does not block the FDA from accepting ANDAs seeking approval for generic versions of the drug as of the date of approval of the original drug product. The FDA typically makes decisions about awards of data exclusivity shortly before a product is approved.
 
Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay 
 
Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would.
 
Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:
 

· | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


· | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------


· | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


24
--

 

A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired (other than method of use patents involving indications for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval).
 
If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 
To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. As a result, approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
 
Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity 
 
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, in 2012, sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time.
 
The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in FDASIA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation.
 
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the U.S. and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application.

Patent Term Restoration and Extension 
 
A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA. We cannot provide any assurance that any patent term extension with respect to any U.S. patent will be obtained and, if obtained, the duration of such extension, in connection with any of our product candidates.
The 21st Century Cures Act 
 
On December 13, 2016, President Obama signed the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, into law. The Cures Act is designed to modernize and personalize healthcare, spur innovation and research, and streamline the discovery and development of new therapies through increased federal funding of particular programs. It authorizes increased funding for the FDA to spend on innovation projects. The new law also amends the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize and expand funding for the NIH. The Act establishes the NIH Innovation Fund to pay for the cost of development and implementation of a strategic plan, early stage investigators and research. It also charges NIH with leading and coordinating expanded pediatric research. Further, the Cures Act directs the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to expand surveillance of neurological diseases.
 
With amendments to the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, Title III of the Cures Act seeks to accelerate the discovery, development, and delivery of new medicines and medical technologies. To that end, and among other provisions, the Cures Act reauthorizes the existing priority review voucher program for certain drugs intended to treat rare pediatric diseases until 2020; creates a new priority review voucher program for drug applications determined to be material national security threat medical countermeasure applications; revises the FDCA to streamline review of combination product applications; requires FDA to evaluate the potential use of “real world evidence” to help support approval of new indications for approved drugs; provides a new “limited population” approval pathway for antibiotic and antifungal drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections; and authorizes FDA to designate a drug as a “regenerative advanced therapy,” thereby making it eligible for certain expedited review and approval designations.
 
Review and Approval of Drug Products in the European Union 
 
In order to market any product outside of the U.S., a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, the company would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 
Procedures Governing Approval of Drug Products in the European Union 
 
Pursuant to the European Clinical Trials Directive, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of a European Union member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. Clinical trial application must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by the European Clinical Trials Directive and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents.

26

To obtain marketing approval of a product under European Union regulatory systems, an applicant must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all European Union member states. The centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional.
 
Under the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP, established at the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a product. The CHMP is also responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days.
 
The decentralized procedure is available to applicants who wish to market a product in various European Union member states where such product has not received marketing approval in any European Union member states before. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one member state designated by the applicant, known as the reference member state. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application based on identical dossiers and related materials, including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labeling and package leaflet, to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment report and drafts of the related materials within 210 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report and related materials, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials.
 
If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points are subject to a dispute resolution mechanism and may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
 
Within this framework, manufacturers may seek approval of hybrid medicinal products under Article 10(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. Hybrid applications rely, in part, on information and data from a reference product and new data from appropriate preclinical tests and clinical trials. Such applications are necessary when the proposed product does not meet the strict definition of a generic medicinal product, or bioavailability studies cannot be used to demonstrate bioequivalence, or there are changes in the active substance(s), therapeutic indications, strength, pharmaceutical form or route of administration of the generic product compared to the reference medicinal product. In such cases the results of tests and clinical trials must be consistent with the data content standards required in the Annex to the Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended by Directive 2003/63/EC.
 
Hybrid medicinal product applications have automatic access to the centralized procedure when the reference product was authorized for marketing via that procedure. Where the reference product was authorized via the decentralized procedure, a hybrid application may be accepted for consideration under the centralized procedure if the applicant shows that the medicinal product constitutes a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or the granting of a community authorization for the medicinal product is in the interest of patients at the community level.
 
Clinical Trial Approval in the European Union 
 
Requirements for the conduct of clinical trials in the European Union including Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, are set forth in the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and the GCP Directive 2005/28/EC. Pursuant to Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC, as amended, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union has been implemented through national legislation of the E.U. member states. Under this system, approval must be obtained from the competent national authority of each E.U. member state in which a study is planned to be conducted. To this end, a CTA is submitted, which must be supported by an investigational medicinal product dossier, or IMPD, and further supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC and other applicable guidance documents. Furthermore, a clinical trial may only be started after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion on the clinical trial application in that country.

27

In April 2014, the E.U. passed the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014, which will replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. To ensure that the rules for clinical trials are identical throughout the European Union, the new E.U. clinical trials legislation was passed as a regulation that is directly applicable in all E.U. member states. All clinical trials performed in the European Union are required to be conducted in accordance with the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC until the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 becomes applicable. According to the current plans of EMA, the new Clinical Trials Regulation will become applicable in 2019. The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC will, however, still apply three years from the date of entry into application of the Clinical Trials Regulation to (i) clinical trials applications submitted before the entry into application and (ii) clinical trials applications submitted within one year after the entry into application if the sponsor opts for old system.
 
The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trial in the European Union. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the E.U. portal; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures that will spare sponsors from submitting broadly identical information separately to various bodies and different member states; a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts (Part I is assessed jointly by all member states concerned, and Part II is assessed separately by each member state concerned); strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial applications; and the involvement of the ethics committees in the assessment procedure in accordance with the national law of the member state concerned but within the overall timelines defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation.
 
Periods of Authorization and Renewals 
 
Marketing authorization is valid for five years in principle and the marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. To this end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the drug on the European Union market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing member state within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause).
 
Data and Market Exclusivity in the European Union 
 
In the European Union, new chemical entities qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity and the sponsor is able to gain the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the product if such company can complete a full MAA with a complete database of pharmaceutical test, preclinical tests and clinical trials and obtain marketing approval of its product.

Regulatory Requirements after Marketing Authorization 
 
As in the U.S., both marketing authorization holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA and the competent authorities of the individual EU Member States both before and after grant of the manufacturing and marketing authorizations. The holder of an EU marketing authorization for a medicinal product must, for example, comply with EU pharmacovigilance legislation and its related regulations and guidelines which entail many requirements for conducting pharmacovigilance, or the assessment and monitoring of the safety of medicinal products. The manufacturing process for medicinal products in the European Union is also highly regulated and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations. Manufacturing requires a manufacturing authorization, and the manufacturing authorization holder must comply with various requirements set out in the applicable EU laws, including compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients.
 
In the European Union, the advertising and promotion of approved products are subject to EU Member States’ laws governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with clinicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. In addition, other legislation adopted by individual EU Member States may apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products. These laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, as approved by the competent authorities. Promotion of a medicinal product that does not comply with the SmPC is considered to constitute off-label promotion, which is prohibited in the European Union.
 
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Sales of products will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the U.S. such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, such products. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.
 
In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates might not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. Additionally, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Third-party reimbursement might not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development.
 
The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 
Outside the U.S., ensuring adequate coverage and payment for our product candidates will face challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our product candidates or products to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts.

In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products might not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements.
 
Healthcare Law and Regulation 
 
Healthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted regulatory approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain our business and/or financial arrangements. Such restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:

· | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willingly executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, which also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or the Affordable Care Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value to clinicians and teaching hospitals and clinician ownership and investment interests; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to clinicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.

Healthcare Reform 
 
A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been several federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the U.S.
 
In March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for products under government healthcare programs. Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to our potential drug candidates are:
 

· | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic products, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of “average manufacturer price,” or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices and extending rebate liability to prescriptions for individuals enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide a 50% point-of-sale-discount off the negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, which has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs. However, the IPAB implementation has been not been clearly defined. The ACA provided that under certain circumstances, IPAB recommendations will become law unless Congress enacts legislation that will achieve the same or greater Medicare cost savings; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation from 2011 to 2019.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the U.S. since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.

With the new Administration and Congress, there may be additional legislative changes, including potentially repeal and replacement of certain provisions of the ACA. It remains to be seen, however, whether new legislation will be enacted and, if so, precisely what any new legislation will provide and what impact it will have on the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. It is possible that any repeal and replacement initiatives, if enacted into law, could ultimately result in fewer individuals having health insurance coverage or in individuals having insurance coverage with less generous benefits. While the timing and scope of any potential future legislation to repeal and replace ACA provisions is highly uncertain in many respects, it is also possible that some of the ACA provisions that generally are not favorable for the research-based pharmaceutical industry could also be repealed along with ACA coverage expansion provisions.
