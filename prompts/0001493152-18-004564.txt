Item 1. Business
Company Overview 
 
Utilizing managements long history in general contracting, coupled with our subject matter expertise and intellectual property (“IP”) knowledge of solar panels and other leading edge technologies, Sun Pacific Holding (“the Company”) is focused on building a “Next Generation” green energy company. The Company offers competitively priced “Next Generation” solar panel and lighting products by working closely with design, engineering, integration and installation firms in order to deliver turnkey solar and other energy efficient solutions. We provide solar bus stops, solar trashcans and “street kiosks” that utilize our unique advertising offerings that provide State and local municipalities with costs efficient solutions. We provide general, electrical, and plumbing contracting services to a range of both public and commercials customers in support of our goals of expanding our green energy market reach. In conjunction with these general contracting services and as part of our effort to expand our green energy marketplace, we have recently started the process to develop and build out a Waste to Energy plant in the State of Rhode Island. A facility that has the ability to handle medical waste that we believe may provide the Company with a model that we can replicate in other jurisdictions across the United States of America.
 
Our green energy solutions can be customized to meet most enterprise and/or government mandated regulations and advanced system requirements. Our portfolio of products and services allow our clients to select a solution that enables them to establish a viable standard product offering that focuses on the goals of the client’s entire organization.
 
Currently, the Company has five (5) subsidiary holdings. Sun Pacific Power Corp which was the initial company that specialized in solar, electrical and general construction, Bella Electric, LLC that in conjunction with the Company operates our electrical contracting work. Bella Electric, LLC is a Pennsylvania limited liability company. The Company also formed Sun Pacific Security Corp., a New Jersey corporation. Currently the Company has not begun operations in the security sector, but is reviewing plans to provide residential and commercial security solutions, including installation and monitoring. The Company also formed National Mechanical Group Corp, a New Jersey corporation focused on plumbing operations in the New Jersey and Pennsylvania areas. The Company also formed Street Smart Outdoor Corp, a Wyoming corporation that acts as a holding company for the Company’s state specific operations in unique advertising through solar bus stops, solar trashcans and “street kiosks.”
 
Strategic Vision
 
Our objective is to grow our business profitably as a premier green energy-based provider of both product and services to the public and private sectors. We are working to deploy our strategy in building upon our general and other contracting expertise in conjunction with our intellectual property and subject matter expertise in green energy that will allow us to grow a group of profitable business lines in solar, waste to energy, efficient lighting, and other unique energy related areas.
 
Recent advances in a multitude of different yet converging technologies have significantly improved the ability to integrate energy efficient products and solutions into infrastructure related projects. These technological advances decrease the requirements needed to jointly operate a multitude of differing assets, devices, and tools that create new ways to integrate evolving new technologies. This technological change and convergence in energy efficient devices, integrated communications among devices, and societal needs to more effectively and environmentally friendly handle the removal of waste, presents a significant opportunity for us in providing and supporting simple to complex integrated solutions.
 
Our current challenge is reaching critical mass in our solar shelter business, expanding into other green energy related projects, which all requires acquiring sufficient amounts of investment capital. We are currently engaging with new sources of capital in the form of both debt and or equity that will either finance and or partner with us in building and expanding our capabilities. Upon achieving additional financial support, our strategies to grow our business include expanding our bid and proposal capabilities and activities, building our management infrastructure, and further developing new technological green energy solutions.
 
Competition
 
Our competitive market is made up of a variety of small to large company’s depending upon the area that we are competing within. In the Contracting marketplace they range from a large number of small to large organizations, while in the solar and advertising shelter marketplace it is made up of a smaller amount of direct competitors including JC DeCaoux, Lamar, Clear Chanel, Signal Outdoor, and various others. While the Contractor marketplace we believe is not subject to rapid technological change driven in part by periodic introductions of new technologies we believe the Shelter marketplace and the new areas in Waste to Energy and other green energy marketplace may be subject to more technological change. Given this we believe that the major competitive factors in our marketplace are distinctive technical competencies, governmental certifications and approvals to operate within this space, successful past contract performance, price of services, reputation for quality, and key management personnel with domain expertise.

Marketing and Sales
 
We currently engage in a limited amount of marketing activities related to request for proposals for projects related to government contracts and or other contracting activities with commercial and private entities. We are developing a variety of new marketing activities designed to broaden our market awareness of our products, services and solutions, that may include e-mail and direct mail campaigns, co-marketing strategies designed to leverage developing strategic relationships, website marketing, topical webcasts, public relations campaigns, speaking engagements and forums and industry analyst visibility initiatives. We plan to participate in and sponsor conferences that cater to our target market and demonstrate and promote our products, services and solutions at trade shows targeted to green energy companies and executives. We also plan to publish white papers relating to green energy projects and develop customer reference programs, such as customer case studies, in an effort to promote better awareness of industry issues and demonstrate that our solutions can address many of the benefits of our solutions.
 
Our marketing strategy is to build our brand and increase market awareness of our products, services, and solutions in our target markets and to generate qualified sales leads that will allow us to successfully build strong relationships with key decision makers involved in the sales process.
 
Clients
 
We derive a significant amount of our revenues from contracts funded by state governments and large organizations that we provide contracting services for which we act in capacity as the prime contractor, or as a subcontractor. Our client base is located predominantly in the North East region of the U.S. Historically, we have derived, and may continue to derive in the future, a significant percentage of our total revenues from a relatively small number of contracts. Due to the nature of our business and the relative size of certain contracts, which are entered into in the ordinary course of business, the loss of any single significant customer would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In future periods, we will continue to focus on diversifying our revenue by increasing the number of commercial customer contracts.
Intellectual Property
 
Our intellectual property rights are important to our business. We believe we will come to rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, service mark, trade secret and other rights in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology, processes and other intellectual property. We will protect our intellectual property rights in a number of ways including entering into confidentiality and other written agreements with our employees, customers, consultants and partners in an attempt to control access to and distribution of our documentation and other proprietary technology and other information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, third parties may, in an unauthorized manner, attempt to use, copy or otherwise obtain and market or distribute our intellectual property rights or technology.
 
U.S. patent filings are intended to provide the holder with a right to exclude others from making, using, selling or importing in the United States the inventions covered by the claims of granted patents. Our patents, including our pending patents, if granted, may be contested, circumvented or invalidated. Moreover, the rights that may be granted in those issued and pending patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing those patents. Therefore, the exact benefits of our issued patents and, if issued, our pending patents and the other steps that we have taken to protect our intellectual property cannot be predicted with certainty.
 
Currently, our intellectual property consists of the application for a patent filed by Sun Pacific Power Corp., our wholly owned subsidiary, for a frame-less encapsulated photo-voltaic solar panel construction and method and apparatus for making the same, filed on March 14, 2018.

Seasonality
 
Our business is not seasonal. However, our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter, due to revenues earned on contracts, the commencement and completion of contracts during any particular quarter; as well as the schedule of government agencies awarding contracts, the term of each contract that we have been awarded and general economic conditions. Because a portion of our expenses, such as personnel and facilities costs, are fixed in the short term, successful contract performance and variation in the volume of activity as well as in the number of contracts commenced or completed during any quarter may cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 13 full-time employees. We periodically engage additional consultants and employ temporary or full time employees as needed. Potential employees possessing the unique qualifications required are readily available for both part-time and full-time employment. The primary method of soliciting personnel is through recruiting resources directly utilizing all known sources including electronic databases, public forums, and personal networks of friends and former co-workers.
 
We believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to offer market competitive compensation packages to attract and retain highly skilled, highly motivated and disciplined managerial, technical, sales and support personnel. We generally do not have employment contracts with our employees, but we do selectively maintain employment agreements with key employees. In addition, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements are in place with many of our customer, employees and consultants and such agreements are included our policies and procedures. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
