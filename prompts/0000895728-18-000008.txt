ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Enbridge is a North American energy infrastructure company with strategic business platforms that include an extensive network of crude oil, liquids and natural gas pipelines, regulated natural gas distribution utilities and renewable power generation assets. We deliver an average of 2.8 million barrels of crude oil each day through our Mainline and Express Pipeline, and account for approximately 65% of United States-bound Canadian crude oil exports. We also move approximately 20% of all natural gas consumed in the United States, serving key supply basins and demand markets. Our regulated utilities serve approximately 3.7 million retail customers in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick. We also have interests in more than 2,500 megawatts (MW) of net renewable power generation capacity in North America and Europe. We have ranked on the Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations index for the past eight years. Our common shares trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol ENB. We were incorporated on April 13, 1970 under the Companies Ordinance of the Northwest Territories and were continued under the Canada Business Corporations Act on December 15, 1987.
On February 27, 2017, we announced the closing of the combination of Enbridge and Spectra Energy Corp. (Spectra Energy) through a stock-for-stock merger transaction (the Merger Transaction).
Spectra Energy, now wholly-owned by Enbridge, is one of North America’s leading natural gas delivery companies owning and operating a large, diversified and complementary portfolio of gas transmission, midstream gathering and processing and distribution assets. Spectra Energy also owns and operates a crude oil pipeline system that connects Canadian and United States producers to refineries in the United States Rocky Mountain and Midwest regions. The combination with Spectra Energy has created the largest energy infrastructure company in North America with an extensive portfolio of energy assets that are well positioned to serve key supply basins and end use markets and multiple business platforms through which to drive future growth. 
A more detailed description of each of the businesses and underlying assets acquired through the Merger Transaction is provided below under Business Segments.
CORPORATE VISION AND STRATEGY
VISION
Our vision is to be the leading energy delivery company in North America. In pursuing this vision, we play a critical role in enabling the economic well-being and quality of life of North Americans, who depend on access to plentiful energy. We transport, distribute and generate energy, and our primary purpose is to deliver the energy North Americans need, in the safest, most reliable and most efficient way possible.
Among our peers, we strive to be the leader, which means not only leadership in value creation for shareholders, but also leadership with respect to worker and public safety and environmental protection associated with our energy delivery infrastructure, as well as in customer service, community investment and employee satisfaction.
STRATEGY
Today, our business is balanced between oil and natural gas. The Merger Transaction combined Spectra Energy’s natural gas transmission franchise, with our liquids pipeline business. Further, the Merger Transaction doubled the size of our utility business and now delivers energy to more than 3.7 million customers. This footprint provides us with scale and diversity to compete, to grow and to provide the energy people need and want.

Our 2018-2020 Strategic Plan (the Strategic Plan) sets a course for us for the next three years. Our focus, as set out in our Strategic Plan, is on what we do best - growing our pipeline and utility assets, and selling or monetizing assets that do not fit this model. Our core assets have highly predictable cash flows, align with our low risk value proposition and are expected to create a large set of organic growth opportunities through which to expand and extend our existing assets. With a significant amount of growth capital already secured through 2020, project execution, cost management and maintaining our financial strength and flexibility remain critical to our long-term success.
To achieve our objectives, we are focused on delivering on the strategic priorities outlined below.
Commitment to Safety and Operational Reliability
Safety and operational reliability remain the foundation for the Strategic Plan. The commitment to safety and operational reliability means achieving and maintaining industry leadership in safety (process, public and personal) and ensuring the reliability and integrity of the systems we operate in order to generate, transport and deliver energy and to protect the environment.
Maximize Value of Core Businesses
We are re-positioning our asset mix to a pure regulated pipeline and utility business model focusing on our core businesses: liquids pipelines and terminals; gas transmission and storage; and natural gas distribution. Our core assets have similar characteristics:

• | Strategic positioning - between key supply basins with large, growing demand markets;


• | Strong commercial underpinnings - long-term contracts, established customers, strong risk-adjusted returns; and


• | Organic growth opportunities - the ability to create value by extending, expanding, repurposing, reconfiguring and replacing assets already in the ground.

By focusing on our core businesses and a regulated pipeline and utility model, we believe we will continue to deliver on the low-risk, reliable value proposition that has served our shareholders well over the years.
Complete Integration and Transformation
In 2017 we made substantial progress on the integration of Spectra Energy including operations and support functions, policies, management systems and establishment of a new, streamlined and lower cost organizational structure soon after close of the transaction. Simultaneous capture of cost savings due to combination synergies remain on track and slightly ahead of plan. Execution of planned synergies in 2018 and integration activities relating to information systems and other capabilities will continue. Prior to and in conjunction with this integration, given the increasingly competitive nature of our business, we established a target of top quartile cost performance. To achieve this, in conjunction with the integration we launched several projects to transform various processes, organizational capabilities and information systems infrastructure to improve how we do business and continuously drive cost efficiencies. Integration, these transformation projects, and our focus on cost leadership represent key priorities through the planning horizon.
Execute Capital Program
Our objective is to safely deliver projects on time and on budget and at the lowest practical cost while maintaining the highest standards for safety, quality, customer satisfaction and environmental and regulatory compliance. Project execution is integral to our near-term financial performance and balance sheet strength, but also to positioning the business for the long-term. Over the next three years, we plan to spend $22 billion on previously secured organic growth opportunities within our core businesses. Our secured capital program includes projects such as the Line 3 Replacement Program (L3R Program), NEXUS, Valley Crossing and the Hohe See Offshore Wind Project.
8

Through our major projects group, we continue to build upon and enhance the key elements of our project management processes, including: employee and contractor safety; long-term supply chain agreements; quality design, materials and construction; extensive regulatory and public consultation; robust cost, schedule and risk controls; and efficient transition of projects to operating units. Ensuring our project execution costs remain competitive in any market environment is a priority.
Strengthen Financial Position
The maintenance of financial strength is crucial to our growth strategy. Our financing strategies are designed to ensure we have sufficient financial flexibility to meet our capital requirements. To support this objective, we develop financing plans and strategies to diversify our funding sources and maintain substantial standby bank credit capacity and access to capital markets in both Canada and the United States. For further discussion on our financing strategies, refer to Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.
Our funding plan is designed to sustain strong investment grade credit ratings, which are key to cost-effectively funding future growth. We have already begun taking actions to accelerate planned deleveraging and balance sheet strengthening, including the issuance of approximately $2 billion of new common equity and $500 million in preferred equity financing in late 2017. Over the remainder of the current planning horizon (2018-2020) we plan to continue to strengthen the balance sheet while building out the balance of our secured growth program. We plan to accomplish this through issuing additional hybrid securities, issuance of common equity through our Dividend Reinvestment Program and the sale or monetization of non-core assets. 
Consistent with our risk management policy, we have implemented a comprehensive long-term economic hedging program to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange and commodity price on our earnings and cash flow. This economic hedging program together with ongoing management of credit exposures to customers, suppliers and counterparties helps reinforce our reliable business model, which is one of the key tenets of our investor value proposition. For further details, refer to Part II. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
We continually assess ways to generate value for shareholders, including reviewing opportunities that may lead to acquisitions, dispositions or other strategic transactions, some of which may be material. Opportunities are screened, analyzed and assessed using strict operating, strategic and financial criteria with the objective of ensuring effective deployment of capital and enduring financial strength and stability.
Secure the Longer-Term Future
A key strategic priority is the development and enhancement of strategic growth platforms from which to secure our long-term future. We expect to benefit from a diversified set of strategic growth platforms, including liquids and gas pipelines, an attractive portfolio of regulated natural gas distribution utilities and a growing offshore renewable power generation business. The strength of the combined assets and geographic footprint will generate highly transparent and predictable cash flows underpinned by high quality commercial constructs that align closely with our investor value proposition and significant ongoing organic growth potential.
MAINTAIN THE FOUNDATION
Uphold Enbridge Values
We adhere to a strong set of core values that govern how we conduct our business and pursue strategic priorities, as articulated in our value statement: “Enbridge employees demonstrate integrity, safety and respect in support of our communities, the environment and each other”. Employees are expected to uphold these values in their interactions with each other, customers, suppliers, landowners, community members and all others with whom we deal and ensure our business decisions are consistent with these values. Employees and contractors are required, on an annual basis, to certify their compliance with our Statement on Business Conduct.

Maintain Our License to Operate
Earning and sustaining the trust of our stakeholders is critical to our ability to execute on our growth plans and ensure that our business strategy, as well as our corporate policies and management systems, are continuously informed by the social and environmental context surrounding our projects and operations. A key priority is to establish and maintain constructive relationships with local stakeholders over the life-cycle of our assets. The linear nature of our energy infrastructure puts us in contact with a large number of diverse communities, landowners and regulatory bodies across North America. Because Indigenous communities have distinct rights, we have dedicated resources focused on Indigenous consultation and inclusion. Early identification of local concerns enables us to respond quickly and take a proactive approach to problem solving. Early engagement also enables us to provide expanded opportunities for socio-economic participation through employment, training, and procurement, as well as through the development of joint initiatives on safety, environmental and cultural protection. More broadly, our goal is to build awareness and balanced dialogue on the role and value of the energy we deliver to our society and economy. We communicate with different stakeholders, decision makers, customers and other interested groups - including investors, employees and the public - about the access we provide to safe, reliable, affordable energy. 
We provide annual progress updates related to the above initiatives in our annual CSR Report which can be found at http://csr.enbridge.com. Unless otherwise specifically stated, none of the information contained on, or connected to, the Enbridge website is incorporated by reference in, or otherwise part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Attract, Retain and Develop Highly Capable People
Investing in the attraction, retention and development of employees and future leaders is fundamental to executing our growth strategy and creating sustainability for future success. We focus on enhancing the capability of our people to maximize the potential of our organization and undertake various activities such as offering accelerated leadership development programs, enhancing career opportunities and building change management capabilities throughout the enterprise so that projects and initiatives achieve intended benefits. Furthermore, we strive to maintain industry competitive compensation and retention programs that provide both short-term and long-term performance incentives to our employees.
BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Our activities are carried out through five business segments: Liquids Pipelines; Gas Transmission and Midstream; Gas Distribution; Green Power and Transmission; and Energy Services, as discussed below.
10

LIQUIDS PIPELINES
Liquids Pipelines consists of common carrier and contract pipelines that transport crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGL) and refined products and terminals in Canada and the United States, including the Canadian Mainline, Lakehead Pipeline System (Lakehead System), Regional Oil Sands System, Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent, Southern Lights Pipeline, Express-Platte System, Bakken System and other feeder pipelines.
11

MAINLINE SYSTEM
The mainline system is comprised of the Canadian Mainline and the Lakehead System. The Canadian Mainline is a common carrier pipeline system which transports various grades of oil and other liquid hydrocarbons within western Canada and from western Canada to the Canada/United States border near Gretna, Manitoba and Neche, North Dakota and from the United States/Canada border near Port Huron, Michigan and Sarnia, Ontario to eastern Canada and the northeastern United States. The Canadian Mainline includes six adjacent pipelines, with a combined operating capacity of approximately 2.85 million barrels per day (bpd) that connect with the Lakehead System at the Canada/United States border, as well as five pipelines that deliver crude oil and refined products into eastern Canada and the northeastern United States. It also includes certain related pipelines and infrastructure, including decommissioned and deactivated pipelines. We have operated, and frequently expanded, the Canadian Mainline since 1949. Effective September 1, 2015, the closing date of the Canadian Restructuring Plan (as defined below), we transferred the Canadian Mainline to the Fund Group (comprising Enbridge Income Fund (the Fund), Enbridge Commercial Trust, Enbridge Income Partners LP (EIPLP) and the subsidiaries
of EIPLP) - refer to Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Canadian Restructuring Plan. The Lakehead System is the portion of the mainline system in the United States that continues to be managed by us through our subsidiaries, Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P. (EEP) and Enbridge Energy, Limited Partnership. It is an interstate common carrier pipeline system regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and is the primary transporter of crude oil and liquid petroleum from Western Canada to the United States. 
Competitive Toll Settlement
The Competitive Toll Settlement (CTS) is the current framework governing tolls paid for products shipped on the Canadian Mainline, with the exception of Lines 8 and 9 which are tolled on a separate basis. The 10-year settlement was negotiated by representatives of Enbridge, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers and shippers on the Canadian Mainline. It was approved by the National Energy Board (NEB) on June 24, 2011 and took effect on July 1, 2011. The CTS provides for a Canadian Local Toll (CLT) for deliveries within western Canada, which is based on the 2011 Incentive Tolling Settlement toll, as well as an International Joint Tariff (IJT) for crude oil shipments originating in western Canada on the Canadian Mainline and delivered into the United States, via the Lakehead System, and into eastern Canada. These tolls are denominated in United States dollars. The IJT is designed to provide shippers on the mainline system with a stable and competitive long-term toll, thereby preserving and enhancing throughput on both the Canadian Mainline and the Lakehead System. The CLT and the IJT were both established at the time of implementation of the CTS and are adjusted annually, on July 1 of each year, at a rate equal to 75% of the Canada Gross Domestic Product at Market Price Index published by Statistics Canada. Two years prior to the end of the term of the CTS, we and the shippers will establish a group for the purposes of negotiating a new settlement to replace the CTS once it expires.
Although the CTS has a 10-year term, it does not require shippers to commit to certain volumes. Shippers nominate volumes on a monthly basis and we allocate capacity to maximize the efficiency of the Canadian Mainline.
Local tolls for service on the Lakehead System are not affected by the CTS and continue to be established pursuant to the Lakehead System’s existing toll agreements, as described below. Under the terms of the IJT agreement between us and EEP, the Canadian Mainline’s share of the IJT relating to pipeline transportation of a batch from any western Canada receipt point to the United States border is equal to the IJT applicable to that batch’s United States delivery point less the Lakehead System’s local toll to that delivery point. This amount is referred to as the Canadian Mainline IJT Residual Benchmark Toll and is denominated in United States dollars.
12

Lakehead System Local Tolls
Transportation rates are governed by the FERC for deliveries from the Canada/United States border near Neche, North Dakota and from Clearbrook, Minnesota to certain principal delivery points. The Lakehead System periodically adjusts these transportation rates as allowed under the FERC’s index methodology and tariff agreements, the main components of which are base rates and Facilities Surcharge Mechanism. Base rates, the base portion of the transportation rates for the Lakehead System, are subject to an annual adjustment which cannot exceed established ceiling rates as approved by the FERC. The Facilities Surcharge Mechanism allows the Lakehead System to recover costs associated with certain shipper-requested projects through an incremental surcharge in addition to the existing base rates, and is subject to annual adjustment on April 1.
REGIONAL OIL SANDS SYSTEM 
The Regional Oil Sands System includes four intra-Alberta long haul pipelines, the Athabasca Pipeline, Waupisoo Pipeline, Woodland Pipeline and the recently completed Wood Buffalo Extension/Athabasca Twin pipeline system as well as two large terminals: the Athabasca Terminal located north of Fort McMurray, Alberta and the Cheecham Terminal, located south of Fort McMurray. The Regional Oil Sands System also includes numerous laterals and related facilities which provide access for oil sands production to the system, and a long-haul intra-Alberta pipeline that transports diluent from the Edmonton, Alberta region into the oil sands producing regions located north and south of Fort McMurray, Alberta. The Regional Oil Sands System currently serves twelve producing oil sands projects.
The Athabasca Pipeline is a 540-kilometer (335-mile) synthetic and heavy oil pipeline. Built in 1999, it links the Athabasca oil sands in the Fort McMurray region to the major Alberta crude oil pipeline hub at Hardisty, Alberta. The Athabasca Pipeline’s capacity is 570,000 bpd, depending on crude slate. We have long-term take-or-pay and non take-or-pay agreements with multiple shippers on the Athabasca Pipeline. Revenues are recorded based on the contract terms negotiated with the major shippers, rather than the cash tolls collected.
In 2017, we completed the twinning of the Athabasca Pipeline and the Wood Buffalo Extension, which were key components of our Regional Oil Sands Optimization Project. The Athabasca Pipeline Twin, completed in January 2017, twinned the southern section of the Athabasca Pipeline with a 36-inch diameter pipeline from Kirby Lake, Alberta to the major Alberta pipeline hub at Hardisty, Alberta. The initial capacity of the Athabasca Pipeline Twin is 450,000 bpd and it can be further expanded in the future to 800,000 bpd through additional pumping horsepower. In December 2017, the Wood Buffalo Extension, a 36-inch diameter pipeline between Cheecham, Alberta and Kirby Lake, Alberta, went into service. The integrated Wood Buffalo Extension and Athabasca Pipeline Twin transports diluted bitumen from multiple oil sands producers.
The Waupisoo Pipeline is a 380-kilometer (236-mile) synthetic and heavy oil pipeline that entered service in 2008 and provides access to the Edmonton market for oil sands producers. The Waupisoo Pipeline originates at the Cheecham Terminal and terminates at the major Alberta pipeline hub at Edmonton. The pipeline has a capacity of 550,000 bpd, depending on the crude slate. We have long-term take-or-pay agreements with multiple shippers on the Waupisoo Pipeline who have collectively contracted for 80% to 90% of the capacity, subject to the timing of when shippers’ commitments commence and expire.
The Woodland Pipeline is a 50/50 joint venture between us and Imperial Oil Resources Ventures Limited and ExxonMobil Canada Properties that was constructed in two phases. The first phase, completed in 2013, consists of a 140-kilometer (87-mile) 36-inch diameter pipeline from the Kearl oil sands mine to the Cheecham Terminal, and service on our existing Waupisoo Pipeline from Cheecham to the Edmonton area. The second phase extended the Woodland Pipeline south from our Cheecham Terminal to our Edmonton Terminal. Completed in 2014, the extension involved the construction of a 385-kilometer (239-mile) 36-inch diameter pipeline adding 379,000 bpd of capacity to the Regional Oil Sands System. The Woodland Pipeline is anchored by long-term commitments.
13

The Norlite Pipeline System (Norlite) was placed into service in May 2017, offering a new diluent supply alternative to meet the needs of multiple producers in the Athabasca oil sands region. Norlite is a 24-inch-diameter pipeline, originating at Enbridge’s Stonefell Terminal, in Strathcona County near Edmonton, Alberta and terminating at Enbridge’s Fort McMurray South facility, near Fort McMurray, Alberta, with a transfer line to Suncor's East Tank Farm. The pipeline has a capacity of approximately 218,000 bpd of diluent, with the potential to be further expanded to approximately 465,000 bpd of capacity with the addition of pump stations. Under an agreement with Keyera Corp. (Keyera), Norlite has the right to access certain existing capacity on Keyera’s pipelines between Edmonton, Alberta and Stonefell, Alberta and, in exchange, Keyera has elected to participate in the new pipeline infrastructure project as a 30% non-operating owner. Norlite is anchored by long-term throughput commitments from a number of oil sands producers.
GULF COAST AND MID-CONTINENT
Gulf Coast includes Seaway and Flanagan South Pipeline (Flanagan South), Spearhead Pipeline, as well as the Mid-Continent System comprised of Cushing Terminal and the recently sold Ozark Pipeline that is managed by us through our subsidiary, EEP.
Seaway Pipeline
In 2011, we acquired a 50% interest in the 1,078-kilometer (670-mile) Seaway Crude Pipeline System (Seaway Pipeline), including the 805-kilometer (500-mile), 30-inch diameter long-haul system between Cushing, Oklahoma and Freeport, Texas, as well as the Texas City Terminal and Distribution System which serve refineries in the Houston and Texas City areas. Seaway Pipeline also includes 8.8 million barrels of crude oil storage tank capacity on the Texas Gulf Coast. 
The flow direction of Seaway Pipeline was reversed in 2012, enabling it to transport crude from the oversupplied hub in Cushing, Oklahoma to the Gulf Coast. Further pump station additions and modifications were completed early 2013, increasing capacity available to shippers from an initial 150,000 bpd to up to approximately 400,000 bpd, depending on the crude slate. In late 2014, a second line, the Seaway Pipeline Twin, was placed into service to more than double the existing capacity to 850,000 bpd. Seaway Pipeline also includes a 161-kilometer (100-mile) pipeline from the Enterprise Crude Houston crude oil terminal in Houston, Texas to the Port Arthur/Beaumont, Texas refining center. 
Flanagan South Pipeline
Flanagan South is a 950-kilometer (590-mile), 36-inch diameter interstate crude oil pipeline that originates at our terminal at Flanagan, Illinois and terminates in Cushing, Oklahoma. Flanagan South and associated pumping stations were completed in the fourth quarter of 2014. Flanagan South has an initial design capacity of approximately 600,000 bpd.
Spearhead Pipeline
Spearhead Pipeline is a long-haul pipeline that delivers crude oil from Flanagan, Illinois, a delivery point on the Lakehead System to Cushing, Oklahoma. The Spearhead pipeline was originally placed into service in 2006 and has an initial capacity of 193,300 bpd.
Mid-Continent System 
The Mid-Continent System is comprised of the storage terminals at Cushing, Oklahoma and the recently sold Ozark Pipeline. The storage terminals consist of over 80 individual storage tanks ranging in size from 78,000 to 570,000 barrels. Total storage shell capacity of Cushing Terminal is approximately 20 million barrels. A portion of the storage facilities are used for operational purposes, while the remainder is contracted to various crude oil market participants for their term storage requirements. Contract fees include fixed monthly storage fees, throughput fees for receiving and delivering crude to and from connecting pipelines and terminals, and blending fees. 
14

In December 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell the Ozark Pipeline to a subsidiary of MPLX LP for cash proceeds of approximately $294 million (US$220 million), including $13 million (US$10 million) in reimbursable costs for additional capital spent by us up to the closing date of the transaction. Sale of the Ozark Pipeline system closed on March 1, 2017.
SOUTHERN LIGHTS PIPELINE
Southern Lights Pipeline is a fully-contracted single stream pipeline that ships diluent from the Manhattan Terminal near Chicago, Illinois to three western Canadian delivery facilities, located at the Edmonton and Hardisty terminals in Alberta and the Kerrobert terminal in Saskatchewan. This 180,000 bpd 16/18/20-inch diameter pipeline was placed into service in 2010. Both the Canadian portion of Southern Lights Pipeline (Southern Lights Canada) and the United States portion of Southern Lights Pipeline (Southern Lights US) receive tariff revenues under long-term contracts with committed shippers. Tariffs provide for recovery of all operating and debt financing costs plus a return on equity (ROE) of 10%. Southern Lights Pipeline has assigned 10% of the capacity (18,000 bpd) for shippers to ship uncommitted volumes.
As part of the Canadian Restructuring Plan, effective September 1, 2015, we transferred all Class B units of Southern Lights Canada to the Fund Group. Following the closing of the Transaction, the Fund Group holds all the ownership, economic interests and voting rights, direct and indirect, in Southern Lights Canada. We continue to indirectly own all of the Class B Units of Southern Lights US.
EXPRESS-PLATTE SYSTEM
The Express-Platte system is comprised of both the Express pipeline and the Platte pipeline, and crude oil storage of approximately 5.6 million barrels. It is an approximate 2,736-kilometer (1,700-mile) crude oil transportation system, which begins in Hardisty, Alberta, and terminates in Wood River, Illinois. The Express pipeline carries crude oil to United States refining markets in the Rockies area, including Montana, Wyoming, Colorado and Utah. The Platte pipeline, which interconnects with the Express pipeline in Casper, Wyoming, transports crude oil predominantly from the Bakken shale and western Canada to refineries in the Midwest. Express pipeline capacity is typically committed under long-term take-or-pay contracts with shippers. A small portion of Express pipeline capacity and all of the Platte pipeline capacity is used by uncommitted shippers who pay only for the pipeline capacity they actually use in a given month.
BAKKEN SYSTEM
Our Bakken assets consist of the North Dakota System and the Bakken Pipeline System. The North Dakota System is a joint operation that includes a Canadian entity and a United States entity. The United States portion of the North Dakota System is comprised of a crude oil gathering and interstate pipeline transportation system servicing the Williston Basin in North Dakota and Montana, which includes the Bakken and Three Forks formation. The gathering pipelines collect crude oil from nearly 80 different receipt facilities located throughout western North Dakota and eastern Montana, with delivery to Clearbrook for service on the Lakehead system or a variety of interconnecting pipeline and rail export facilities. The United States interstate portion of the system extends from Berthold, North Dakota to the International Boundary near North Portal, North Dakota, and connects to the Canadian entity at the border to bring the crude oil into Cromer, Manitoba.
Tariffs on the United States portion of the North Dakota System are governed by FERC and include a local tariff. The Canadian portion is categorized as a Group 2 pipeline, and as such its tolls are regulated by the NEB on a complaint basis. Tolls are based on long-term take-or-pay agreements with anchor shippers.
In February 2017, we closed a transaction to acquire a 49% equity interest in the holding company that owns 75% of the Bakken Pipeline System from an affiliate of Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. and Sunoco Logistics Partners, L.P. The Bakken Pipeline System connects the prolific Bakken formation in North Dakota to markets in eastern PADD II and the United States Gulf Coast, providing customers with access to premium markets at a competitive cost. The Bakken Pipeline System consists of the Dakota Access 
15

Pipeline and the Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipeline projects. The Dakota Access Pipeline consists of 1,886-kilometers (1,172-miles) of 30-inch pipe from the Bakken/Three Forks production area in North Dakota to Patoka, Illinois. Initial capacity is in excess of 470,000 bpd of crude oil with the potential to be expanded to 570,000 bpd. The Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipeline consists of 100-kilometers (62-miles) of new 30-inch diameter pipe, 1,104-kilometers (686-miles) of converted 30-inch diameter pipe, and 64-kilometers (40-miles) of converted 24-inch diameter pipe from Patoka, Illinois to Nederland, Texas. The Bakken Pipeline System is anchored by long-term throughput commitments from a number of producers.
FEEDER PIPELINES AND OTHER
Feeder Pipelines and Other includes a number of liquids storage assets and pipeline systems in Canada and the United States. 
Key assets included in Feeder Pipelines and Other are the Hardisty Contract Terminal and Hardisty Storage Caverns located near Hardisty, Alberta, a key crude oil pipeline hub in western Canada and Southern Access Extension (SAX) pipeline which originates out of Flanagan, Illinois and delivers to Patoka, Illinois. On July 1, 2014, Marathon executed an agreement with Enbridge to become an owner (35%) in SAX forming the Illinois Extension Pipeline Company (IEPC). Enbridge has 65% ownership in IEPC. SAX was placed into service December 2015 with the majority of its capacity commercially secured under long-term take-or-pay contracts with shippers.
Feeder Pipelines and Other also includes Patoka Storage, the Toledo pipeline system and the NW System. Patoka Storage is comprised of 4 storage tanks with 480,000 barrels of shell capacity located in Patoka, Illinois. The Toledo pipeline system connects with the Lakehead System and delivers to Ohio and Michigan. The majority of Toledo pipeline’s capacity is commercially secured under long-term take-or-pay contracts with shippers. The NW System transports crude oil from Norman Wells in the Northwest Territories to Zama, Alberta. NW System has a cost of service rate structure based on established terms with shippers.
Feeder Pipelines and Other includes contributions from assets which were divested during 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016, including investments in Olympic Pipeline Company (Olympic), Eddystone Rail and the South Prairie Region assets.
On October 19, 2017, we sold all assets related to our Eddystone rail facility to our partner Canopy in exchange for their 25% share of the joint venture valued at $5 million. These assets primarily included the unit-train unloading facility and related local pipeline infrastructure near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania that delivered Bakken and other light sweet crude oil to Philadelphia area refineries.
On July 31, 2017, we completed the sale of our 85% interest in Olympic, the largest refined products pipeline in the State of Washington, to an unrelated party for $0.2 billion.
On December 1, 2016, EIPLP completed the sale of the South Prairie Region assets to an unrelated party for cash proceeds of $1.08 billion. The South Prairie Region assets transport crude oil and NGL from producing fields and facilities in southeastern Saskatchewan and southwestern Manitoba to Cromer, Manitoba where products enter the mainline system to be transported to the United States or eastern Canada.
COMPETITION
Competition may result in a reduction in demand for our services, fewer project opportunities or assumption of risk that results in weaker or more volatile financial performance than expected. Competition among existing pipelines is based primarily on the cost of transportation, access to supply, the quality and reliability of service, contract carrier alternatives and proximity to markets.

Other competing carriers available to ship western Canadian liquid hydrocarbons to markets in Canada, the United States and internationally represent competition to our liquids pipelines network. Competition 
16

also arises from proposed pipelines that seek to access markets currently served by our liquids pipelines, such as proposed projects to the Gulf Coast and from proposed projects enhancing infrastructure in the Alberta regional oil sands market. The Mid-Continent and Bakken systems also face competition from existing competing pipelines, proposed future pipelines and existing and alternative gathering facilities. Competition for storage facilities in the United States includes large integrated oil companies and other midstream energy partnerships. Additionally, volatile crude price differentials and insufficient pipeline capacity on either our or other competitor pipelines can make transportation of crude oil by rail competitive, particularly to markets not currently serviced by pipelines.

We believe that our liquids pipelines continue to provide attractive options to producers in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) and North Dakota due to our competitive tolls and flexibility through our multiple delivery and storage points. Our current complement of growth projects to expand market access and to enhance capacity on our pipeline system combined with our commitment to project execution is expected to further provide shippers reliable and long-term competitive solutions for oil transportation. Our existing right-of-way for the mainline system also provides a competitive advantage as it can be difficult and costly to obtain rights of way for new pipelines traversing new areas. We also employ long-term agreements with shippers, which also mitigate competition risk by ensuring consistent supply to our liquids pipelines network.
SUPPLY AND DEMAND
We have an established and successful history of being the largest transporter of crude oil to the United States, the world’s largest market. While United States’ demand for Canadian crude oil production will support the use of our infrastructure for the foreseeable future, North American and global crude oil supply and demand fundamentals are shifting, and we have a role to play in this transition by developing long-term transportation options that enable the efficient flow of crude oil from supply regions to end-user markets.
The downturn in crude oil prices which began in 2014 has impacted our liquids pipelines’ customers, who responded by reducing their exploration and development spending for 2016 and 2017 in higher cost basins. However, the international market for crude oil has continued to see an increase in production from the North American shale oil producing basins and increased production from specific Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude price has been strengthening from US$30 per barrel at the beginning of 2016 as the market has fought to re-balance supply and demand. Prices began to recover in response to cuts in OPEC and non-OPEC production and have continued to recover through 2017. The WTI crude prices averaged US$51 per barrel for 2017 and ended the year above US$60 per barrel.
Notwithstanding the current price environment, our mainline system has thus far continued to be highly utilized and in fact, mainline throughput as measured at the Canada/United States border at Gretna, Manitoba saw record throughput of 2.7 million bpd in December 2017. The mainline system continues to be subject to apportionment of heavy crude oil, as nominated volumes currently exceed capacity on portions of the system. The impact of a low crude oil price environment on the financial performance of our liquids pipelines business is expected to be relatively modest given the commercial arrangements which underpin many of the pipelines that make up our liquids system and provide a significant measure of protection against volume fluctuations. In addition, our mainline system is well positioned to continue to provide safe and efficient transportation which will enable western Canadian and Bakken production to reach attractive markets in the United States and eastern Canada at a competitive cost relative to other alternatives. The fundamentals of oil sands production and low crude oil prices have caused some sponsors to reconsider the timing of their upstream oil sands development projects. However, recently updated forecasts continue to reflect long-term supply growth from the WCSB, although the projected pace of growth is slower than previous forecasts as companies continue to assess the viability of certain capital investments in the current price environment and with the ongoing uncertainty related to timing and completion of competing pipeline systems.

Over the long term, global energy consumption is expected to continue to grow, with the growth in crude oil demand primarily driven by emerging economies in regions outside the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), mainly India and China. While OECD countries, including Canada, the United States and western European nations, will experience population growth, the emphasis placed on energy efficiency, conservation and a shift to lower carbon fuels, such as natural gas and renewables, is expected to reduce crude oil demand over the long term. Accordingly, there is a strategic opportunity for North American producers to grow production to displace foreign imports and participate in the growing global demand outside North America.
In terms of supply, long-term global crude oil production is expected to continue to grow through 2035, with growth in supply primarily contributed by North America, Brazil and OPEC. The expected growth in North America is largely driven by production from the oil sands and the continued development of tight oil plays including the Permian, Bakken and Eagle Ford formations. Growth in supply from OPEC is primarily a result of a shift in OPEC’s strategy from ‘balancing supply’ to ‘competing for market share’ in Asia and Europe. However, political uncertainty in certain oil producing countries, including Venezuela, Libya, Nigeria and Iraq, increases risk in those regions’ supply growth forecasts and makes North America one of the most secure supply sources of crude oil. As witnessed throughout 2016 and 2017, North American supply growth can be influenced by macro-economic factors that drive down the global crude prices. Over the longer term, North American production from tight oil plays, including the Bakken, is expected to grow as technology continues to improve well productivity and efficiencies. The WCSB, in Canada, is viewed as one of the world’s largest and most secure supply sources of crude oil. However, the pace of growth in North America and level of investment in the WCSB could be tempered in future years by a number of factors including a sustained period of low crude oil prices and corresponding production decisions by OPEC, increasing environmental regulation, and prolonged approval processes for new pipelines with access to tide-water for export.
In recent years, the combination of relatively flat domestic demand, growing supply and long-lead time to build pipeline infrastructure led to a fundamental change in the North American crude oil landscape. The inability to move increasing inland supply to tide-water markets resulted in a divergence between WTI and world pricing, resulting in lower netbacks for North American producers than could otherwise be achieved if selling into global markets. The impact of price differentials has been even more pronounced for western Canadian producers as insufficient pipeline infrastructure resulted in a further discounting of Alberta crude against WTI. With a number of market access initiatives completed by the industry in recent years, including those introduced by us, the crude oil price differentials significantly narrowed in 2015, and resulted in higher netbacks for producers. The capacity from these initiatives was for the most part exhausted by the end of 2017 from growth in the Oil Sands and has resulted in crude differentials widening once more. Canadian pipeline export capacity is expected to remain essentially full, resulting in incremental production utilizing non-pipeline transportation services until such time as pipeline capacity is made available. As the supply in North America continues to grow, the growth and flexibility of pipeline infrastructure will need to keep pace with the sensitive demand and supply balance. Over the longer term, we believe pipelines will continue to be the most cost-effective means of transportation in markets where the differential between North American and global oil prices remain narrow. Utilization of rail to transport crude is expected to be substantially limited to those markets not readily accessible by pipelines.
Our role in helping to address the evolving supply and demand fundamentals and alleviating price discounts for producers and supply costs to refiners is to provide expanded pipeline capacity and sustainable connectivity to alternative markets. As discussed in Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Growth Projects - Commercially Secured Projects, in 2017, we continue to execute our growth projects plan in furtherance of this objective.

Enbridge Offshore Pipelines is comprised of 11 active natural gas gathering and transmission pipelines and two active oil pipelines, including the Heidelberg Oil Pipeline that was placed in service in January 2016. These pipelines are located in four major corridors in the Gulf of Mexico, extending to deepwater developments, and include almost 2,100-kilometers (1,300-miles) of underwater pipe and onshore facilities with total capacity of approximately 6.5 bcf/d.
COMPETITION
Our natural gas transmission and storage businesses compete with similar facilities that serve our supply and market areas in the transmission and storage of natural gas. The flow pattern of natural gas is changing across North America due to emerging supply sources and evolving demand centers, which creates a highly competitive market to secure new growth opportunities. The principal elements of competition are location, rates, terms of service, flexibility and reliability of service.
The natural gas transported in our business competes with other forms of energy available to our customers and end-users, including electricity, coal, propane, fuel oils, and renewable energy. Factors that influence the demand for natural gas include price changes, the availability of natural gas and other 
22

forms of energy, levels of business activity, long-term economic conditions, conservation, legislation, governmental regulations, the ability to convert to alternative fuels, weather and other factors.
Competition in our business exists in all of the markets we serve. Competitors include interstate and intrastate pipelines or their affiliates and other midstream businesses that transport, gather, treat, process and market natural gas or NGLs. Because pipelines are generally the most efficient mode of transportation for natural gas over land, the most significant competitors of our natural gas pipelines are other pipeline companies. Pipelines typically compete with each other based on location, capacity, reputation, price and reliability.
SUPPLY AND DEMAND 
Global energy demand is expected to increase approximately 30 percent by 2040, according to the International Energy Agency, driven primarily by economic growth in non-OECD countries. Natural gas will play an important role in meeting this energy demand as gas consumption is anticipated to grow by nearly 50 percent during this period as one of the world’s fastest growing energy sources, second only to renewables. Globally, most natural gas demand will stem from the need for greater power generation capacity, as natural gas is a cleaner alternative to coal, which currently has the largest market share for power generation. 
Within North America, United States natural gas demand growth is expected to be driven by the next wave of gas-intensive petrochemical facilities which are now starting to enter service, along with power generation, an increase in the volume of LNG exports and additional pipeline exports to Mexico. Within Canada, natural gas demand growth is expected to be largely tied to oil sands development and growth in gas-fired power generation. Canadian gas demand growth will be accelerated with implementation of proposed government regulations to replace coal fired power, designed to meet emissions targets.
North American supply from tight formations continues to create a demand and supply imbalance for natural gas and some NGL products. North American gas supply continues to be significantly impacted by development in the northeastern United States, primarily the prolific Marcellus and Utica shales in Appalachia. The abundance of supply from these shale plays continues to alter natural gas flow patterns in North America, as this region has largely displaced flows from the Gulf Coast and WCSB that historically supplied eastern markets. Similar pressures are also being felt in the Midwest United States and southern markets.
Beyond growing Appalachian production, natural gas supply growth has been largely tied to crude oil and NGL production. In the Permian Basin, for example, rapid expansion of crude oil drilling activity has increased associated gas supplies from the region by approximately 2.0 bcf/d over the past two years and growth is forecasted to continue for the next decade. Similarly, WCSB natural gas production growth has been primarily attributable to production of NGLs, which provide strong producer netbacks. However, growing local demand from gas-fired power generation and continued oil sands development should stabilize WCSB natural gas economics, even as regional exports face steeper competition in Eastern Canada and the Midwest United States.
The continued increase in North American gas production and the resulting surplus supply has limited gas price advances, which remained largely within range throughout 2017. In response to low prices, producers have introduced new technologies and more efficient drilling and completion techniques to maximize production and improve break-even economics on new wells. While domestic gas demand and growing North American gas exports provide support for future prices, abundant low cost supplies are likely to continue to limit high prices through the next decade. 
Growth in global demand for natural gas will necessitate growing LNG trade to facilitate the movement of gas supply from producing regions to consuming regions. North America and the USGC in particular are positioned to benefit from this trend as low-cost tight gas production from the Permian, Eagle Ford and Appalachia continues to enable growing LNG exports. The United States exported approximately 3.0 bcf/
23

d of natural gas from the United States Gulf Coast at the end of 2017 with export capacity of approximately 9.0 bcf/d scheduled to be in service by 2020. While the short term outlook for LNG fundamentals points to a continued global oversupply, as the market absorbs the large volumes of new supply coming online, forecasts indicate demand will exceed projected LNG supply in the early 2020s as growing markets seek to diversify supply sources. In addition to LNG export facilities under construction, the United States remains well positioned to serve this next round of global trade expansion. Canada is well positioned to provide LNG export facilities, although these facilities are not likely to be in service in the near term.
NGL production growth is increasingly linked to growing associated gas volumes related to the development of tight oil plays such as the Permian. NGLs that can be extracted from liquids-rich gas streams include ethane, propane, butane and natural gasoline, which are used in a variety of industrial, commercial and other applications. Robust gas production has created regional supply imbalances for some NGL products and weakened the economics of NGL extraction, although these imbalances modestly improved over 2017 as crude prices have rebounded and NGL export capacity has expanded. Over the longer term, the growth in NGL demand is expected to be robust, driven largely by incremental ethane demand and exports. Ethane is the key feedstock to the United States Gulf Coast petrochemical industry, which is among the world’s lowest-cost ethylene producing regions and is currently undergoing significant expansion. As this new infrastructure is completed, ethane prices and resulting extraction margins are expected to improve, reducing the amount of ethane retained in the gas stream. 
In addition to ethane, the outlook for abundant propane supplies has prompted the development and expansion of export facilities for liquefied petroleum gas. Over a few short years, the United States has become the world’s largest liquefied petroleum gas exporter, which has helped to reduce the inventory overhang and provide support for propane prices.
In Canada, the WCSB is well situated to capitalize on the evolving NGL fundamentals over the longer term as the Montney and Duvernay shale plays contain significant liquids-rich resources at highly competitive extraction costs. In response to growing regional NGL supply, several propane export solutions are being developed to move WCSB NGLs from Western Canada to global markets. 
Longer term, NGL fundamentals indicate a positive outlook for demand growth and would be further supported with a continued recovery in crude oil prices. Consequently, the crude-to-gas price ratio is expected to remain well above energy conversion value levels and continue to be supportive of NGL extraction over the longer term.
In response to these evolving natural gas and NGL fundamentals, we believe we are well positioned to provide value-added solutions to producers. We are responding to the need for regional infrastructure with additional investment in Canadian and United States gas pipeline and midstream facilities.

GAS DISTRIBUTION
Gas Distribution consists of our natural gas utility operations, the core of which are Enbridge Gas Distribution Inc. (EGD) and Union Gas Limited (Union Gas), which serve residential, commercial and industrial customers, primarily located throughout Ontario. This business segment also includes natural gas distribution activities in Quebec and New Brunswick and our investment in Noverco Inc (Noverco).
On November 2, 2017, EGD and Union Gas filed an application with the Ontario Energy Board (OEB) to amalgamate the two utilities. If approved as filed, the application will provide a 10 year framework for the utilities to identify and leverage best practices and implement integrated solutions. A decision is expected in the second half of 2018.
ENBRIDGE GAS DISTRIBUTION
EGD is a rate‑regulated natural gas distribution utility serving approximately 2.2 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in its franchise areas of central and eastern Ontario. In addition, EGD currently serves areas in northern New York State through St. Lawrence Gas Company Inc. (St. Lawrence Gas). In August 2017, EGD entered into an agreement to sell the issued and outstanding shares of St. Lawrence Gas. The transaction is expected to close in 2018, subject to regulatory approval and certain pre-closing conditions.
EGD also owns and operates regulated and unregulated natural gas storage facilities in Ontario. The utility business is conducted under statutes and municipal bylaws which grant the right to operate in the areas served. The utility operations of EGD and St. Lawrence Gas are regulated by the OEB and by the New York State Public Service Commission, respectively. 
As at December 31, 2017, EGD owned and operated a network of approximately 39,000-kilometers (24,233-miles) of mains for the transportation and distribution of natural gas, as well as the service pipes to transfer natural gas from mains to meters on customers' premises.
There are four principal interrelated aspects of the natural gas distribution business in which EGD is directly involved: Distribution Service, Gas Supply, Transportation and Storage.
25

Distribution Service
EGD's principal source of revenue arises from distribution of natural gas to customers. The services provided to residential, commercial and industrial heating customers are primarily on a general service basis (without a specific fixed term or fixed price contract). The services provided to larger commercial and industrial customers are usually on an annual contract basis under firm or interruptible service contracts.
Gas Supply
To acquire the necessary volume of natural gas to serve its customers, EGD maintains a diversified natural gas supply portfolio. EGD's system supply natural gas contracts have pricing structures responsive to supply and demand conditions in the North American natural gas market. The prices in these contracts may be indexed to Alberta, Chicago or New York based prices.
Transportation
EGD relies on its long-term contracts with Union Gas, an affiliated company under common control, for transportation of natural gas from the Dawn Hub (Dawn), the largest integrated underground storage facility in Canada and one of the largest in North America, located in south-western Ontario, to EGD’s major market in the Greater Toronto Area. These contracts effectively provide EGD with access to United States sourced natural gas at Dawn. These contracts also provide transportation for natural gas received at Dawn via Vector as well as natural gas stored at EGD’s and Union’s storage pools in the Sarnia, Ontario area to the market area.
Storage
EGD’s business is highly seasonal as daily market demand for natural gas fluctuates with changes in weather, with peak consumption occurring in the winter months. Utilization of storage facilities permits EGD to take delivery of natural gas on favorable terms during off‑peak summer periods for subsequent use during the winter heating season. This practice permits EGD to minimize the annual cost of transportation of natural gas from its supply basins, assists in reducing its overall cost of natural gas supply and adds a measure of security in the event of any short-term interruption of transportation of natural gas to EGD's franchise area. 
EGD's principal storage facilities are located in south-western Ontario, near Dawn, and have a total working capacity of approximately 10.5 billion cubic feet (Bcf). Approximately 8.5 Bcf of the total working capacity is available to EGD for utility operations. EGD also has a storage contract with Union Gas for 2.0 Bcf of storage capacity.
UNION GAS
Union Gas is a rate‑regulated natural gas distribution utility now serving approximately 1.5 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in its franchise areas of northern, southwestern and eastern Ontario. 
Union Gas' regulated and unregulated storage and transmission business offers storage and transmission services to customers at Dawn. It offers customers an important link in the movement of natural gas from western Canada and United States supply basins to markets in central Canada and the northeastern United States. The utility business is conducted under statutes and municipal by‑laws which grant the right to operate in the areas served. The utility operations of Union Gas are regulated by the OEB.
As at December 31, 2017, Union Gas owned and operated a network of approximately 66,000-kilometers (41,010-miles) of mains for the transportation and distribution of natural gas, as well as the service pipes to transfer natural gas from mains to meters on customers' premises.
Similar to EGD, there are four principal interrelated aspects of the natural gas distribution business in which Union Gas is directly involved: Distribution Service, Gas Supply, Transportation and Storage.
26

Distribution Service
Similar to EGD, Union Gas’ principal source of revenue arises from distribution of natural gas to customers. The services provided to residential, small commercial and industrial heating customers are primarily on a general service basis (without a specific fixed term or fixed price contract). The services provided to larger commercial and industrial customers underpinned by firm or interruptible service contracts.
Gas Supply
To acquire the necessary volume of natural gas to serve its customers, Union Gas maintains a diversified natural gas supply portfolio. Union Gas' system supply natural gas contracts have pricing structures responsive to supply and demand conditions in the North American natural gas market. The prices in these contracts may be indexed to Alberta, Michigan and Chicago based prices.
Transportation 
Union Gas’ transmission system consists of approximately 4,900-kilometers (3,045-miles) of high-pressure pipeline and five mainline compressor stations. Key pipeline interconnects in Canada and the United States enabled Union Gas to deliver approximately 774 Bcf of gas through Union Gas’ transmission system in 2017. Union Gas’ transmission system also links an extensive network of underground storage pools at Dawn to major Canadian and United States markets. There are multiple pipelines providing access to Dawn. Customers can purchase both firm and interruptible transportation services on the Union Gas system. As the supply of natural gas in areas close to Ontario continues to grow, there is an increased demand to access these diverse supplies at Dawn and transport them along the Dawn-Parkway pipeline system to markets in Ontario, eastern Canada and the northeastern United States. To secure the continued reliable delivery of natural gas and to serve a growing demand for natural gas, Union Gas has invested $1.5 billion between 2015 and 2017 to expand the Dawn-Parkway natural gas transmission system. This has increased the takeaway capacity from Dawn to approximately 20 percent or from 6.3 bcf/d in 2014 to more than 7.5 bcf/d in 2017. A substantial amount of Union Gas’ transportation revenue is generated by fixed annual demand charges, with the average length of a long-term contract being approximately 11 years, with the longest remaining contract term being 15 years. 
Storage
Union Gas’ underground natural gas storage facilities have a working capacity of approximately 165 Bcf in 25 underground facilities located in depleted gas fields. Union Gas’ storage pools give customers access to all Dawn storage capacity and deliverability. Dawn's configuration provides flexibility for injections, withdrawals and cycling. Customers can purchase both firm and interruptible storage services at Dawn. Dawn offers customers a wide range of market choices and options with easy access to upstream and downstream markets. During 2017, Dawn provided storage, balancing, gas loans, transport, exchange and peaking services to over 140 counterparties.
A substantial amount of Union Gas’ storage revenue is generated by fixed annual demand charges, with the average length of a long-term contract being approximately five years, with the longest remaining contract term being 19 years.
NOVERCO
We own an equity interest in Noverco through ownership of 38.9% of its common shares and an investment in preferred shares. Noverco is a holding company that owns approximately 71% of Energir LP, formerly known as Gaz Metro Limited Partnership, a natural gas distribution company operating in the province of Quebec with interests in subsidiary companies operating gas transmission, gas distribution and power distribution businesses in the Province of Quebec and the State of Vermont. Noverco also holds, directly and indirectly, an investment in our Common Shares.
27

OTHER GAS DISTRIBUTION AND STORAGE
Other Gas Distribution and Storage includes natural gas distribution utility operations in the Provinces of New Brunswick and Quebec.
Enbridge Gas New Brunswick Inc. operates the natural gas distribution franchise in the Province of New Brunswick, has approximately 11,800 customers and is regulated by the New Brunswick Energy and Utilities Board (EUB).
Gazifere is one of two distributors in Quebec serving more than 40,000 residential, commercial, institutional and industrial customers. Gazifere is regulated by the Quebec Regie de l’energie.
28

GREEN POWER & TRANSMISSION
Green Power and Transmission consists of our investments in renewable energy assets and transmission facilities. Renewable energy assets consist of wind, solar, geothermal and waste heat recovery facilities and are located in Canada primarily in the provinces of Alberta, Ontario and Quebec and in the United States primarily in Colorado, Texas, Indiana and West Virginia. We also have assets under development located in Europe.
29

Green Power and Transmission includes approximately 2,500 MW of net operating renewable and alternative energy sources. Of this amount, approximately 930 MW of net power generating capacity comes from wind farms located in the provinces of Alberta, Ontario and Quebec and approximately 1,040 MW of net power generating capacity comes from wind farms located in the states of Colorado, Texas, Indiana and West Virginia, including the 249 MW Chapman Ranch Wind Project (Chapman Ranch) in Texas, which was placed into service in late October 2017. The vast majority of the power produced from these wind farms is sold under long-term power purchase agreements. We also have three solar facilities located in Ontario and a solar facility located in Nevada, with 100 MW and 50 MW, respectively, of net power generating capacity. Also included in Green Power and Transmission is the Montana-Alberta Tie-Line, our first power transmission asset, a 300 MW transmission line from Great Falls, Montana to Lethbridge, Alberta.
In June 2017, we announced an additional 112 MW of investment in the partnership that holds the 610 MW Hohe See Offshore Wind Project in Germany, where we have an effective 50% interest. Earlier in 2016, we announced the acquisition of Chapman Ranch, as well as the acquisition of a 50% interest in a French offshore wind development company, Éolien Maritime France SAS. Chapman Ranch was subsequently placed into service in late October 2017. In late 2015, we announced acquisitions of the 103-MW New Creek Wind Project in West Virginia and a 24.9% interest in the 400 MW Rampion Offshore Wind Project in the United Kingdom. Including these acquisitions, we have invested over $5 billion in renewable power generation and transmission since 2002.
Competition
Our Green Power and Transmission assets operate in the North American and European power markets, which are subject to competition and the supply and demand balance for power in the provinces and states in which they operate. The renewable energy market sector includes large utilities and small independent power producers, which are expected to aggressively compete with us for project development opportunities.
Supply and Demand
The power generation and transmission network in North America is expected to undergo significant growth over the next 20 years. On the demand side, North American economic growth over the longer term is expected to drive growing electricity demand, although continued efficiency gains are expected to make the economy less energy-intensive and temper demand growth. On the supply side, impending legislation in Canada is expected to accelerate the retirement of aging coal-fired generation plants, resulting in a requirement for significant new generation capacity. While coal and nuclear facilities will continue to be core components of power generation in North America, gas-fired and renewable energy facilities, including biomass, hydro, solar and wind, are expected to be the preferred sources to replace coal-fired generation due to their lower carbon intensities.

North American wind and solar resources fundamentals remain strong. In the United States, there is over 85 gigawatts (GW) of installed wind power capacity and in Canada over 12 GW of installed wind power capacity. Solar resources in southwestern states such as Arizona, California and Nevada are considered to be some of the best in the world for large-scale solar plants and the United States currently has over 35 GW of installed solar photovoltaic capacity. In late 2015, the United States passed legislation extending the availability of certain Federal tax incentives which have supported the profitability of wind and solar projects. However, expanding renewable energy infrastructure in North America is not without challenges. Growing renewable generation capacity is expected to necessitate substantial capital investment to upgrade existing transmission systems or, in many cases, build new transmission lines, as these high quality wind and solar resources are often found in regions that are not in close proximity to markets. In the near-term, uncertainty over the availability of tax or other government incentives in various jurisdictions, the ability to secure long-term power purchase agreements through government or investor-owned power authorities and low market prices of electricity may hinder the pace of future new renewable capacity development. However, continued improvement in technology and manufacturing capacity in the past few years has reduced capital costs associated with renewable energy infrastructure and has also 
30

improved yield factors of power generation assets. These positive developments are expected to render renewable energy more competitive and support ongoing investment over the long term.

In Europe, the future outlook for renewable energy, especially from offshore wind in countries with long coastlines and densely populated areas, is very positive. According to the European Wind Energy Association, by 2030, wind energy capacity in Europe is expected to be 320 GW, including 66 GW of offshore capacity. There is also wide public support for carbon reduction targets and broader adoption of renewable generation across all governmental levels. Furthermore, governments in Europe are seeking to rationalize the contribution of nuclear power to the overall energy mix, which has resulted in an increased focus on alternative sources such as large scale offshore wind.
ENERGY SERVICES
The Energy Services businesses in Canada and the United States undertake physical commodity marketing activity and logistical services, oversee refinery supply services and manage our volume commitments on various pipeline systems.
Energy Services provides energy supply and marketing services to North American refiners, producers and other customers. Crude oil and NGL marketing services are provided by Tidal Energy Marketing Inc. (Tidal). We transact at many North American market hubs and provides our customers with various services, including transportation, storage, supply management, hedging programs and product exchanges. Tidal is primarily a physical barrel marketing company focused on capturing value from quality, time and location differentials when opportunities arise. To execute these strategies, Energy Services may lease storage or rail cars, as well as hold nomination or contractual rights on both third party and Enbridge-owned pipelines and storage facilities. Tidal also provides natural gas and power marketing services, including marketing natural gas to optimize commitments on certain natural gas pipelines. Additionally, Tidal provides natural gas supply, transportation, balancing and storage for third parties, leveraging its natural gas marketing expertise and access to transportation capacity.
Competition
Energy Services earnings are generated from arbitrage opportunities which, by their nature, can be replicated by other competitors. An increase in market participants entering into similar arbitrage transactions could have an impact on our earnings. Our efforts to mitigate competition risk includes diversification of our marketing business by trading at the majority of major hubs in North America and establishing long-term relationships with clients.
ELIMINATIONS AND OTHER
Eliminations and Other includes operating and administrative costs and foreign exchange costs which are not allocated to business segments. Eliminations and Other also includes new business development activities and general corporate investments.
INSURANCE
Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in our industry. Our assets may experience physical damage as a result of an accident or natural disaster. These hazards can also cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, and suspension of operations. We maintain a comprehensive insurance program for us, our subsidiaries and our affiliates. This program includes insurance coverage in types and amounts and with terms and conditions that are generally consistent with coverage customary for our industry.
Although we believe our current coverage is adequate for our purposes, we have in the past had occurrences that led to losses exceeding our then-applicable coverage limits, and there is no assurance 
31

that the same may not happen in the future. In the unlikely event that multiple insurable incidents which in aggregate exceed coverage limits occur within the same insurance period, the total insurance coverage will be allocated among our entities on an equitable basis based on an insurance allocation agreement among us and our subsidiaries.
OPERATIONAL AND ECONOMIC REGULATION
LIQUIDS PIPELINES
Operational Regulation
Operational regulation risks relate to compliance with applicable operational rules and regulations mandated by governments or applicable regulatory authorities, breaches of which could result in fines, penalties, operating restrictions and an overall increase in operating and compliance costs. 
Regulatory scrutiny over the integrity of liquids pipeline assets has the potential to increase operating costs or limit future projects. Potential regulatory changes could have an impact on our future earnings and the cost related to the construction of new projects. We believe operational regulation risk is mitigated by active monitoring and consulting on potential regulatory requirement changes with the respective regulators or through industry associations. We also develop robust response plans to regulatory changes or enforcement actions. While we believe the safe and reliable operation of our assets and adherence to existing regulations is the best approach to managing operational regulatory risk, the potential remains for regulators to make unilateral decisions that could have a financial impact on us. 
In the United States, our interstate pipeline operations are subject to pipeline safety laws and regulations administered by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT). These laws and regulations require us to comply with a significant set of requirements for the design, construction, maintenance and operation of our interstate pipelines. These laws and regulations, among other things, include requirements to monitor and maintain the integrity of our pipelines. The regulations determine the pressures at which our pipelines can operate.
PHMSA is designing an Integrity Verification Process intended to create standards to verify maximum allowable operating pressure, and to improve and expand integrity management processes. Additionally, PHMSA will establish standards for storage facilities. There remains uncertainty as to how these standards will be implemented, but it is expected that the changes will impose additional costs on new pipeline projects as well as on existing operations. In this climate of increasingly stringent regulation, pipeline failures or failures to comply with applicable regulations could result in reduction of allowable operating pressures as authorized by PHMSA, which would reduce available capacity on our pipelines. Should any of these risks materialize, it may have an adverse effect on our operations, earnings, financial condition and cash flows.
In Canada, our pipeline operations are subject to pipeline safety regulations overseen by the NEB or provincial regulators. Applicable legislation and regulation require us to comply with a significant set of requirements for the design, construction, maintenance and operation of our pipelines. Among other obligations, this regulatory framework imposes requirements to monitor and maintain the integrity of our pipelines. 
As in the United States, several legislative changes addressing pipeline safety in Canada have recently come into force. The changes evidence an increased focus on the implementation of management systems to address key areas such as emergency management, integrity management, safety, security and environmental protection. Other legislative changes have created authority for the NEB to impose administrative monetary penalties for non-compliance with the regulatory regime it administers, as well as to impose financial requirements for future abandonment and major pipeline releases. 
32

We are also subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of our present and future operations, including air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid waste and hazardous waste. These laws and regulations generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. 
In particular, in the United States, compliance with major Clean Air Act regulatory programs is likely to cause us to incur significant capital expenditures to obtain permits, evaluate off-site impacts of our operations, install pollution control equipment, and otherwise assure compliance. Some states in which we operate are implementing new emissions limits to comply with 2008 ozone standards regulated under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. In 2015, the ozone standards were lowered even further from 75 parts per billion (ppb) to 70 ppb, which may require states to implement additional emissions regulations. The precise nature of these compliance obligations at each of our facilities has not been finally determined and may depend in part on future regulatory changes. In addition, compliance with new and emerging environmental regulatory programs is likely to significantly increase our operating costs compared to historical levels.
In the United States, climate change action is evolving at state, regional and federal levels. The Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA in 2007 established that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were pollutants subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act. Pursuant to federal regulations, we are currently subject to an obligation to report our GHG emissions at our largest emitting facilities, but are not generally subject to limits on emissions of GHGs, (except to the extent that some GHGs consist of volatile organic compounds and nitrous oxides that are subject to emission limits). In addition, a number of provinces and states have joined regional GHG initiatives, and a number are developing their own programs that would mandate reductions in GHG emissions. Public interest groups and regulatory agencies are increasingly focusing on the emission of methane associated with natural gas development and transmission as a source of GHG emissions. However, as the key details of future GHG restrictions and compliance mechanisms remain undefined, the likely future effects on our business are highly uncertain. 
For its part, Canada has reaffirmed its strong preference for a harmonized approach with that of the United States. While federal GHG related regulatory design details remain forthcoming, provincial authorities have been actively pursuing related initiatives.
Failure to comply with environmental regulations may result in the imposition of fines, penalties and injunctive measures affecting our operating assets. In addition, changes in environmental laws and regulations or the enactment of new environmental laws or regulations could result in a material increase in our cost of compliance with such laws and regulations. We may not be able to obtain or maintain all required environmental regulatory approvals for our operating assets or development projects. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, if we fail to obtain or comply with them, or if environmental laws or regulations change or are administered in a more stringent manner, the operations of facilities or the development of new facilities could be prevented, delayed or become subject to additional costs. We expect that costs we incur to comply with environmental regulations in the future will have a significant effect on our earnings and cash flows. 
Due to the speculative outlook regarding any United States federal and state policies, we cannot estimate the potential effect of proposed GHG policies on our future consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. However, such legislation or regulation could materially increase our operating costs, require material capital expenditures or create additional permitting, which could delay proposed construction projects. 
Economic Regulation
Our liquids pipelines also face economic regulatory risk. Broadly defined, economic regulation risk is the risk that governments or regulatory agencies change or reject proposed or existing commercial arrangements including permits and regulatory approvals for new projects. The Canadian Mainline, Lakehead System and other liquids pipelines are subject to the actions of various regulators, including the 
33

NEB and FERC, with respect to the tariffs and tolls of those operations. The changing or rejecting of commercial arrangements, including decisions by regulators on the applicable tariff structure or changes in interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulators, could have an adverse effect on our revenues and earnings. Delays in regulatory approvals on projects such as our L3R Program, could result in cost escalations and construction delays, which also negatively impact our operations. 
We believe that economic regulatory risk is reduced through the negotiation of long-term agreements with shippers that govern the majority of our liquids pipeline assets. We also involve our legal and regulatory teams in the review of new projects to ensure compliance with applicable regulations as well as in the establishment of tariffs and tolls on new and existing pipelines. However, despite our efforts to mitigate economic regulation risk, there remains a risk that a regulator could overturn long-term agreements that we have entered into with shippers or deny the approval and permits for new projects. 
GAS TRANSMISSION & MIDSTREAM
Operational Regulation
The span of regulatory risks that apply to the Liquids Pipeline business as described above under Liquids Pipelines also applies to the Gas Transmission and Midstream business. Additionally, most of our United States gas transmission operations are regulated by the FERC. The FERC regulates natural gas transmission in United States interstate commerce including the establishment of rates for services. The FERC also regulates the construction of United States interstate natural gas pipelines and storage facilities, including the extension, enlargement and abandonment of facilities. In addition, certain operations are subject to oversight by state regulatory commissions. To the extent that the natural gas intrastate pipelines that transport or store natural gas in interstate commerce provide services under Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, they are subject to FERC regulations. The FERC may propose and implement new rules and regulations affecting interstate natural gas transmission and storage companies, which remain subject to the FERC’s jurisdiction. These initiatives may also affect certain transmission of gas by intrastate pipelines.
Our SEP and DCP Midstream operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the Environmental Protection Agency and various other federal, state and local environmental agencies. Our United States interstate natural gas pipelines and certain of DCP Midstream’s gathering and transmission pipelines are also subject to the regulations of the DOT concerning pipeline safety.
The intrastate natural gas and NGL pipelines owned by us and DCP Midstream are subject to state regulation. The natural gas gathering and processing activities of DCP Midstream are not subject to FERC regulation.
Our Canadian operations are governed by various federal and provincial agencies with respect to pipeline safety, including the NEB and the Transportation Safety Board, the British Columbia Oil and Gas Commission, the Alberta Energy Regulator and the Ontario Technical Standards and Safety Authority.
Our Canadian natural gas transmission and distribution operations and approximately two-thirds of the storage operations in Canada are subject to regulation by the NEB or the provincial agencies in Canada, such as the OEB. These agencies have jurisdiction similar to the FERC for regulating rates, the terms and conditions of service, the construction of additional facilities and acquisitions. Our British Columbia Pipeline and British Columbia Field Services business in western Canada is regulated by the NEB pursuant to a framework for light-handed regulation under which the NEB acts on a complaints-basis for rates associated with that business. Similarly, the rates charged by our Canadian Gas Transmission and Midstream operations for gathering and processing services in western Canada are regulated on a complaints-basis by applicable provincial regulators.
34

GAS DISTRIBUTION
Economic Regulation
Our gas distribution utility operations are regulated by the OEB and the EUB among others. Regulators’ future actions may differ from current expectations, or future legislative changes may impact the regulatory environments in which we operate. To the extent that the regulators’ future actions are different from current expectations, the timing and amount of recovery or refund of amounts recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, or that would have been recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position in absence of the effects of regulation, could be different from the amounts that are eventually recovered or refunded.
We seek to mitigate economic regulation risk. We retain dedicated professional staff and maintain strong relationships with customers, intervenors and regulators. The terms of rate negotiations are reviewed by our legal, regulatory and finance teams.
Enbridge Gas Distribution
Distribution rates are set under a five-year customized incentive rate plan (IR Plan) approved in 2014 and provide a level of stability by having a long-term agreement with the OEB which allows us to recover our expected capital investments under the agreement, as well as an opportunity to earn above the OEB allowed ROE. Under the customized IR Plan, we are permitted to recover, with OEB approval, certain costs that were beyond management control, but that were necessary for the maintenance of our services. The customized IR Plan also includes a mechanism to reassess the customized IR Plan and return to cost of service if there are significant and unanticipated developments that threaten the sustainability of the customized IR Plan.
Union Gas
Distribution rates, beginning in 2014, are set under a five-year incentive regulation framework using price cap methodology. The price cap framework establishes new rates at the beginning of each year through the use of a pricing formula rather than through the examination of revenue and cost forecasts. The framework allows for annual inflationary rate increases, offset by a productivity factor, as well as rate increases or decreases in the small volume customer classes where use declines or increases, and certain adjustments to base rates. Further, it allows for the continued pass-through of gas commodity, upstream transportation and demand side management costs, the additional pass-through of costs associated with major capital investments and certain fuel variances, an allowance for unexpected cost changes that are outside of management’s control, and equal sharing of tax changes between Union Gas and customers, and finally an opportunity to earn above the OEB allowed ROE.
Environmental Regulation
Our workers, operations and facilities are subject to municipal, provincial and federal legislation which regulate the protection of the environment and the health and safety of workers. For the environment, primarily this includes the regulation of discharges to air, land and water; the management and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and contaminated soil and groundwater; and the assessment of contaminated sites.
The operation of our gas distribution system and gas facilities comes with risk of incidents, abnormal operating conditions or other unplanned events that could result in spills or emissions to the environment that could exceed permitted levels. These events could result in injuries to workers or the public, fines, penalties, adverse impacts to the environment in which we operate within, and/or property damage. We could also incur future liability for environmental (soil and groundwater) contamination associated with past and present site activities.
In addition to the operation of the gas distribution system, we also operate unregulated operations including small oil and brine production and storage facilities in southwestern Ontario. Environmental risk associated with these facilities is the possibility of spills, releases or leaks. In the event of an incident (spill), remediation of the affected area would be required. There would also be potential for fines, orders 
35

or charges under environmental legislation, and potential third-party liability claims by affected land owners.
The gas distribution system and our other operations must maintain a number of environmental approvals and permits from governmental authorities to operate. As a result, these facilities and the distribution network are subject to periodic inspection. An Annual Written Summary Report is submitted to the Ontario Ministry of Environment and Climate Change (MOECC) to demonstrate we are in good standing in relation to its Environmental Compliance Approvals. Failure to maintain regulatory compliance could result in operational interruptions, fines, penalties, and/or orders for additional pollution control technology or environmental remediation, etc. As environmental requirements and regulations become more stringent, the cost to maintain compliance and the time required to obtain approvals has consistently increased.
Ontario commenced a cap and trade system on January 1, 2017. Under the cap and trade regulation, EGD and Union Gas (together, the Utilities) are required to purchase emission allowances or credits for most of our customers’ use of natural gas as well as for emissions from our own operations. This process is complex and requires ongoing monitoring of the carbon market and related climate change and carbon policies not only in Ontario but also in other newly linked jurisdictions as at January 1, 2018 - namely California and Quebec. This linkage which has been enabled in Ontario with various GHG reporting and cap and trade regulation amendments over the course of 2017 will create a larger and more liquid market for carbon allowances and credits, which may help to keep compliance costs for our customers down. However, non-compliance or unexpected policy changes may cause significant changes to the cost of maintaining compliance and needs to be closely monitored to ensure impacts are understood.
As required by the OEB Cap and Trade Framework, the Utilities each submitted 2017 Compliance Plans, which subsequently received supportive endorsement and approval of cost recovery in 2017 rates. The Utilities are in the process of defending their individually filed 2018 Compliance Plans. The OEB approved use of the 2017 final rate for recovery of 2018 cap and trade compliance costs until determined otherwise. Further, the OEB Cap and Trade Framework identifies that the Utilities are expected to file 2019/2020 Compliance Plans as well as an Annual Report summarizing 2017 results by August 1, 2018. The Compliance Plans detail how the Utilities will meet their respective carbon compliance obligations through carbon allowance and/or offset procurement as well as through customer and facility abatement projects that may be deemed cost effective. By creating prudent and thoughtful plans and executing with excellence, the Utilities can best mitigate the risk of cost disallowance. 
As with previous years, in 2017 the Utilities each reported GHG emissions to the Ontario MOECC, Environment and Climate Change Canada, and a number of voluntary reporting programs. Emissions from Ontario combustion sources were verified in detail by a third party accredited verifier with no material discrepancies found. Additionally, operational emissions from venting, fugitive and natural gas distribution emissions were reported to the MOECC for the first time in 2017 in accordance with O. Reg. 143/16 - Quantification, Reporting, and Verification of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Regulation standard quantification methods ON. 350 and ON. 400, respectively. The Utilities continue to monitor developments and attend stakeholder consultations in Ontario.
The Utilities utilize emissions data management processes and systems to help with the data capture and mandatory and voluntary reporting needs. Quantification methodologies and emission factors will continually be updated in the system as required. Each Utility publicly reports its GHG emissions and has developed internal procedures for more frequent monthly Cap and Trade related GHG reporting. Collectively, the Utilities continue to work with industry associations to refine quantification methodologies and emissions factors, as well as best management practices to minimize emissions. The Utilities plans to reduce emissions in 2018 are outlined in the Facility Abatement Plan within their respective Compliance Plans.
36

EMPLOYEES
We had approximately 12,700 employees as at December 31, 2017, including approximately 8,500 employees in Canada. Approximately 1,800 of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements governing their employment with us. Approximately 48% of those employees are covered under agreements that either have expired or will expire by December 31, 2018. We are currently going through the process of collective bargaining in respect to the expired or expiring contracts. We have mature working relationships with our labor unions and the parties have traditionally committed themselves to the achievement of renewal agreements without a work stoppage.
