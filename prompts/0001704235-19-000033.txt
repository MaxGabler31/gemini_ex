Overview 
Quintana Energy Services Inc. (either individually or together with its subsidiaries, as the context requires, the “Company,” “QES,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated on April 13, 2017. Our accounting predecessor, Quintana Energy Services LP (“QES LP” and “Predecessor”), was formed as a Delaware partnership on November 3, 2014. In connection with our initial public offering (the “IPO”) which closed on February 13, 2018, the existing investors in QES LP and QES Holdco LLC contributed all of their direct and indirect equity interests to QES in exchange for shares of common stock in QES, and we became the holding company for the reorganized QES LP and its subsidiaries. 
We are a growth-oriented provider of diversified oilfield services to leading onshore oil and natural gas E&P companies operating in conventional and unconventional plays in all of the active major basins throughout the United States. We classify the services we provide into four reportable segments: (1) Directional Drilling, (2) Pressure Pumping, (3) Pressure Control and (4) Wireline. Our Directional Drilling segment enables efficient drilling and guidance of the horizontal section of a wellbore using our technologically-advanced fleet of downhole motors and 115 MWD kits. Our Pressure Pumping segment includes hydraulic fracturing, cementing and acidizing services, and such services are supported by a high-quality pressure pumping fleet of approximately 267,500 HHP as of December 31, 2018. Our primary pressure pumping focus is on large hydraulic fracturing jobs. Our Pressure Control segment provides various forms of well control, completions and workover applications through our 24 coiled tubing units (10 of which are Large Diameter units), 36 rig-assisted snubbing units and ancillary equipment. As of December 31, 2018, our wireline services included 41 wireline units providing a full range of pump-down services in support of unconventional completions, and cased-hole wireline services enabling reservoir characterization. 
Our operations are diversified by our broad customer base and expansive geographical reach. We currently operate throughout all active major onshore oil and gas basins in the United States and we served approximately 1,100 customers as of December 31, 2018. We have cultivated and maintain strong relationships with our E&P company customers, including leading companies such as EOG Resources, Parsley Energy, Matador Resources, Pioneer Natural Resources, Seneca Energy, Triumph Energy Partners and XTO Energy.
Our core businesses depend on our customers’ willingness to make expenditures to produce, develop and explore for oil and natural gas in the United States. Industry conditions are influenced by numerous factors, such as the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, domestic and worldwide economic conditions, political stability in oil producing countries, merger and divestiture activity among oil and gas producers and changes in oil and natural gas prices. The volatility of the oil and natural gas industry and the consequent impact on E&P activity could adversely impact the level of drilling, completion and workover activity by some of our customers. This volatility affects the demand for our services and the price of our services. 
We derive a majority of our revenues from services supporting oil and natural gas operations. As oil and natural gas prices fluctuate significantly, demand for our services correspondingly changes as our customers must balance expenditures for drilling and completion services against their available cash flows. Because our services are required to support drilling and completions activities, we are also subject to changes in spending by our customers as oil and natural gas prices fluctuate. 
During the fourth quarter of 2018, the price of crude oil fell approximately 38.6%, with WTI closing at $45.15 per barrel on December 28, 2018. This precipitous decline in crude oil prices had a moderate negative impact on our fourth quarter 2018 consolidated results of operations. We expect further customer-driven activity declines in early 2019 as customers reassess their budgets and plans in light of lower commodity prices. If the current pricing environment for crude oil does not improve, or declines further, our customers may be required to further reduce their capital expenditures, causing additional declines in the demand for, and prices of, our products and services, which would adversely affect our future results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Despite the recent decline in oil prices, demand for our services has improved since May 2016. From the second quarter of 2016 through the fourth quarter of 2018, our Directional Drilling segment increased the number of days we provided services to rigs and earned revenues during the period, including days that standby revenues were earned (“rig days”) by 311.4%, while day rates have improved from the lows we experienced during the second quarter of 2016. We reactivated our second and third pressure pumping hydraulic fracturing fleets in February and October 2017, and placed our fourth hydraulic fracturing fleet into service during June 2018. Utilization of our Pressure Control assets has also continued to improve since the second quarter of 2016.
Since 2016, we have worked to optimize our cost structure and increase efficiency to better serve our customers. As part of these cost control initiatives, we closed unprofitable locations serving non-key regions, renegotiated supplier contracts and certain equipment leases to improve profitability and reduced general and administrative expenses. To improve operational efficiencies, we streamlined our internal processes and further improved customer focus.

Our Services 
We classify the services we provide into four reportable segments: (1) Directional Drilling, (2) Pressure Pumping, (3) Pressure Control and (4) Wireline. We describe each of these segments below. 
Directional Drilling
Our Directional Drilling segment is comprised of directional drilling services, downhole navigational and rental tools businesses and support services, including well planning and site supervision, which assists customers in the drilling and placement of complex directional and horizontal wellbores. This segment utilizes its fleet of in-house positive pulse MWD navigational tools, mud motors and ancillary downhole tools, as well as EM navigational systems. The demand for these services tends to be influenced primarily by customer drilling-related activity levels. We provide directional drilling and associated services to E&P companies in many of the most active areas of onshore oil and natural gas development in the United States, including the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford Shale, Mid-Continent region (including the SCOOP/STACK), Marcellus/Utica Shale and DJ/Powder River Basin.
Our Directional Drilling segment provides the highly technical and essential services of guiding horizontal and directional drilling operations for E&P companies. We offer premium drilling services including directional drilling, horizontal drilling, under balanced drilling, MWD and logging tools. Our package also offers various technologies, including our positive pulse MWD navigational tool asset fleet, Q-Series Mud Motors and ancillary downhole tools, as well as EM navigational systems. We also provide a suite of integrated and related services, including rotational gamma, pressure-while-drilling, continuous inclination and continuous azimuth. 
Although we do not typically enter into long-term contracts for our services in this segment, we have long standing relationships with our customers in this segment and believe they will continue to utilize our services. As of the quarter ended December 31, 2018, 90.2% of our directional drilling activity is tied to “follow-me rigs,” which involve non-contractual, generally recurring services as our Directional Drilling team members follow a drilling rig from well-to-well or pad-to-pad for multiple wells or pads, and in some cases, multiple years. With increasing use of pad drilling and reactivation of rigs, through 2018 we have increased the number of “follow me rigs” from approximately 32 in January of 2016 to 74 as of the month ended December 31, 2018. We intend to continue to re-deploy additional MWD kits into 2019, as market conditions warrant.
Our Directional Drilling segment accounted for approximately 31.9%, 33.2% and 35.8% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Pressure Pumping
Our Pressure Pumping segment provides hydraulic fracturing stimulation services, cementing services and acidizing services. The majority of the revenues generated in this segment are derived from pressure pumping services focused on fracturing, cementing and acidizing services in the Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountains regions. These pressure pumping and stimulation services are primarily used in the completion, production and maintenance of oil and gas wells. Customers for this segment include major E&P operators as well as independent oil and gas producers. Our personnel have extensive technical expertise and customer relationships, which we believe enables us to maintain and further expand our presence in these regions. Additionally, we believe these regions will continue to benefit from E&P companies’ increasing design of more complex wells, with higher service intensity that increases demand for our services. 
We focus on providing services for larger hydraulic fracturing jobs, but have the capability to provide a customized range of hydraulic fracturing services to meet the particular needs of our customers. We believe our technical capabilities, depth of talent and operational flexibility allow us to accommodate the increasing requirements of our customers’ hydraulic fracturing jobs and such strengths provide us with access to a large number of customers. In addition, many of these jobs require logistically intensive service and mobility capabilities for which we are well suited as a result of our basin-specific experience. We believe such operational flexibility allows us to be responsive to our customers’ needs, increasing the utilization of our assets and strengthening our existing customer relationships.
As of December 31, 2018, our Pressure Pumping fleet had a capacity of 267,500 HHP, of which 241,500 HHP was dedicated to hydraulic fracturing, 14,500 HHP was dedicated to cementing and 11,500 HHP was dedicated to acidizing and other. As of December 31, 2018, we had 214,600 total hydraulic fracturing HHP deployed in the Mid-Continent region. Of our total deployed HHP dedicated to hydraulic fracturing, approximately 92% is dedicated to unconventional hydraulic fracturing services in the Mid-Continent, approximately 7% is dedicated to hydraulic fracturing services in the Rockies, and approximately 1% is dedicated to vertical fracturing services. We have successfully grown our Pressure Pumping segment through organic growth and acquisitions. From January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2018, we increased from 15,500 HHP to 267,500 HHP. 
In addition, we have multi-year proppant supply contracts for approximately 143,000 average annual tons through 2020. We also have 13,250 tons of flat sand storage in Enid, Oklahoma in our facility located on the BNSF Railway, which provides access to the materials needed to ensure consistently reliable operations. Our Pressure Pumping segment accounted for approximately 35.4%, 35.0% and 21.5% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Pressure Control
Our Pressure Control segment supplies a wide variety of equipment, services and expertise in support of completion and workover operations throughout the United States. Its capabilities include coiled tubing, snubbing, fluid pumping, nitrogen, well control and other pressure control related services. Our pressure control equipment is tailored to the unconventional resources market with the ability to operate under high pressures without having to delay or cease production during completion or workover operations. Our pressure control services help E&P companies minimize the risk of such damage during completion activities. We provide our pressure control services primarily in the Mid-Continent region (including the SCOOP/STACK), Eagle Ford Shale, Permian Basin, Marcellus/Utica Shale, DJ/Powder River Basin, Haynesville Shale, Fayetteville Shale and Williston Basins (including the Bakken Shale).
Our coiled tubing units are used in the provision of unconventional completion services or in support of well-servicing and workover applications. Our rig-assisted snubbing units are used in conjunction with a workover rig to insert or remove downhole tools or in support of other well services while maintaining pressure in the well, or in support of unconventional completions. Our nitrogen pumping units provide a non-combustible environment downhole and are used in support of other pressure control or well-servicing applications. We also offer highly-technical and specialized well control services, which are typically required in response to emergencies at the well, requiring a variety of solutions including freezing, hot tapping and gate valve drilling services, as well as critical well control and containment operations. Our team is comprised of oilfield services veterans with extensive domestic and international experience in well control operations dating back to the 1980s. 
As of December 31, 2018, we provided our services through our fleet of 24 coiled tubing units (10 of which are Large Diameter units, allowing us to service extended reach laterals), 36 rig-assisted snubbing units and 24 nitrogen pumping units. We accepted delivery of two new larger diameter coil units during the month of December 2018. One of the new Large Diameter units was deployed immediately.
Our Pressure Control segment accounted for approximately 20.3%, 20.5% and 24.9% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Wireline
Our Wireline segment provides new well wireline conveyed tight-shale reservoir perforating services across many of the major U.S. shale basins and also offers a range of services such as cased-hole investigation and production logging services, conventional wireline and tubing conveyed perforating services, mechanical services and pipe recovery services. These services are offered in both new well completions and for remedial work. The majority of the revenues generated in our Wireline segment are derived from the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford Shale, Mid-Continent region (including the SCOOP/STACK), Haynesville Shale and East Texas Basin as well as in industrial and petrochemical facilities. Our Wireline segment principally works in connection with hydraulic fracturing services in the form of pump-down services for setting plugs between hydraulic fracturing stages, as well as with the deployment of perforation equipment in connection with “plug-and-perf” operations. 
As of December 31, 2018, we operated 41 wireline units of which 21 are suited for unconventional activity, and operated from seven facilities throughout the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford Shale, Mid-Continent, South Texas and Gulf Coast regions. Of the 21 wireline units suited for unconventional activity, 10 units are crewed and the remaining 11 are available to deploy as conditions warrant. We offer our wireline services in most markets in which we provide pressure pumping services. From January 2017 to December 31, 2018, we completed approximately 19,195 stages in the United States with an overall run efficiency of approximately 97.9%. 
Our Wireline segment accounted for approximately 12.4%, 11.4% and 17.8% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Geographic Areas of Operation 
Our Directional Drilling segment operates in the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford Shale, Mid-Continent region (including the SCOOP/STACK), Marcellus/Utica Shale and DJ/Powder River Basin. Our Pressure Pumping segment has historically operated in the Mid-Continent region (including the SCOOP/STACK) where we have a leading market position, as well as the Rocky Mountain region (including the Williston Basin). Our Pressure Control segment operates in the Mid-Continent region (including the SCOOP/STACK), Eagle Ford Shale, Permian Basin, Marcellus/Utica Shale, DJ/Powder River Basin, Haynesville Shale, Fayetteville Shale and Williston Basin (including the Bakken Shale), providing access across the continental United States. Lastly, our Wireline segment provides services throughout the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford Shale, Mid-Continent region (including the SCOOP/STACK), Gulf Coast region and East Texas/Haynesville Shale. These expansive operating areas provide us with access to a number of nearby unconventional crude oil and natural gas basins, both with existing customers expanding their production footprint and third parties acquiring new acreage. Our proximity to existing and prospective customer activities allows us to anticipate or respond quickly to such customers’ needs and efficiently deploy our assets.

We believe that our strategic geographic positioning will benefit us as activity increases in our core operating areas. Our broad geographic footprint provides us with exposure to the ongoing recovery in drilling and completion activity and will allow us to opportunistically pursue new business in basins with the most active drilling environments. 
Seasonality 
Our operations are located in different regions of the United States. Some of these areas are adversely affected by seasonal weather conditions, primarily in the winter and spring. During periods of heavy snow, ice or rain, we may be unable to move our equipment between locations, thereby reducing our ability to provide services and generate revenues. The exploration activities of our customers may also be affected during such periods of adverse weather conditions. Weather conditions also affect the demand for, and prices of, oil and natural gas and, as a result, demand for our services. 
Marketing and Customers 
We operate in a highly competitive industry. Our competition includes many large and small oilfield service companies. As such, we price our services and products to remain competitive in the markets in which we operate, adjusting our rates to reflect current market conditions as necessary. We examine the rate of utilization of our equipment as a measure of our ability to compete in the current market environment. 
We have also established over time a diverse and balanced mix of customers, including large, midsize and small E&P companies. We served approximately 1,100 customers in 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2018, EOG Resources represented approximately 11.9% of the Company’s consolidated revenues. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, no customer individually accounted for more than 10.3% of our consolidated revenues. The loss of a material customer could have an adverse effect on our business until the equipment is redeployed at similar utilization and pricing levels. 
Competition 
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. To be successful, a company must provide services and products that meet the specific needs of oil and natural gas E&P companies and drilling services contractors at competitive prices. We provide our services and products across the United States and we compete against different companies in each service and product line we offer. Our competition includes many large and small oilfield service companies, including some of the largest integrated oilfield services companies. 
Our major competitors in Directional Drilling include Schlumberger, Baker Hughes, Halliburton, Phoenix Technology Services, ProDirectional, Scientific Drilling International, LEAM Drilling Systems and Nabors Industries. Our major competitors for Pressure Pumping, Pressure Control and Wireline include Halliburton, Schlumberger, RPC, C&J Energy Services, Keane Group, Basic Energy Services, Nine Energy Services, Superior Energy Services, Key Energy Services, Forbes Energy Services, STEP Energy Services and KLX.
We believe that the principal competitive factors in the market areas that we serve are quality of service and products, reputation for safety and technical proficiency, availability and price. While we must be competitive in our pricing, we believe our customers select our services and products based on the local leadership and basin-expertise that our field management and operating personnel use to deliver quality services and products. 
Suppliers 
We have dedicated supply chain teams that manage sourcing and logistics to ensure flexibility and continuity of our supply chain in a cost effective manner across our geographic areas of operation. We have fostered long-term relationships with numerous industry leading suppliers of proppant, chemicals, coil tubing and select directional drilling, pressure pumping, pressure control and wireline equipment. In addition, we have multi-year proppant supply contracts for approximately 143,000 average annual tons through 2020. 
We purchase a wide variety of raw materials, parts and components that are manufactured and supplied for our operations. We are not dependent on any single source of supply for those parts, supplies or materials. To date, we have generally been able to obtain the equipment, parts and supplies necessary to support our operations on a timely basis. While we believe that we will be able to make satisfactory alternative arrangements in the event of any interruption in the supply of these materials and/or products by one of our suppliers, we may not always be able to do so. In addition, certain materials for which we do not currently have long-term supply agreements could experience shortages and significant price increases in the future. As a result, we may be unable to mitigate any future supply shortages and our results of operations, prospects and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
Intellectual Property 
We have pending applications and registered trademarks for various names under which our entities conduct business or provide products or services. Except for the foregoing, we do not own or license any patents, trademarks or other intellectual property that we believe to be material to the success of our business. In addition, we rely to a great extent on the technical expertise and know-how of our personnel to maintain our competitive position, and we take commercially reasonable measures to protect trade secrets and other confidential and/or proprietary information relating to the technologies we develop.

Risk Management and Insurance 
Our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the oilfield services industry, such as accidents, blowouts, explosions, fires and spills and releases that can cause: 

• | personal injury or loss of life;


• | damage or destruction of property, equipment, natural resources and the environment; and


• | suspension of operations.

In addition, claims for loss of oil and natural gas production and damage to formations can occur in the oilfield services industry. If a serious accident were to occur at a location where our equipment and services are being used, it could result in us being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims. 
Because our business involves the transportation of heavy equipment and materials, we may also experience traffic accidents which may result in spills, property damage and personal injury. 
Despite our efforts to maintain safety standards, we from time to time have suffered accidents in the past and anticipate that we could experience accidents in the future. In addition to the property damage, personal injury and other losses from these accidents, the frequency and severity of these incidents affect our operating costs and insurability and our relationships with customers, employees, regulatory agencies and other parties. 
Any significant increase in the frequency or severity of these incidents, or the general level of compensation awards, could adversely affect the cost of, or our ability to obtain, workers’ compensation and other forms of insurance, and could have other material adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations. 
Although we maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary in the industry, we are not fully insured against all risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs relative to perceived risk. Further, insurance rates have in the past been subject to wide fluctuation and changes in coverage could result in less coverage, increases in cost or higher deductibles and retentions. Liabilities for which we are not insured, or which exceed the policy limits of our applicable insurance, could have a material adverse effect on us. 
Employees 
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 1,500 full time employees and our overall personnel count increased approximately 13.3% from the year ended December 31, 2017. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by any collective bargaining agreements. We also hire independent contractors and consultants as needed. 
Safety and Remediation Program 
In the oilfield services industry, an important competitive factor in establishing and maintaining long term E&P customer relationships is having an experienced and skilled workforce. Recently, many of our large customers have placed an emphasis not only on pricing, but also on safety records and quality management systems of contractors. We believe these factors will gain further importance in the future. We have dedicated safety personnel and training facilities for each of our four segments. We have committed resources toward employee safety and quality management training programs. Our field employees are required to complete both technical and safety training programs. 
As part of our safety procedures, we also have the capability to shut down our pressure pumping and fracturing operations both at the lines and in our data van. In addition, we maintain spill kits on location for containment of pollutants that may be spilled in the process of providing our hydraulic fracturing services. The spill kits are generally comprised of pads and booms for absorption and containment of spills, as well as soda ash for neutralizing acid. Fire extinguishers are also in place on job sites at each pump. 
We have used third-party contractors to provide remediation and spill response services when necessary to address spills that travel beyond our containment capabilities. Historically, these prior spills have not had a material adverse effect on our hydraulic fracturing services. To the extent our hydraulic fracturing or other oilfield services operations result in a future spill or release, we will engage the services of a remediation company or an alternative company, as necessary, to assist us with clean-up and remediation. 
Government Regulations and Environmental, Health and Safety Matters 
We operate under the jurisdiction of a number of regulatory bodies that regulate worker safety standards, the handling of hazardous materials, the storage and transportation of explosives, the protection of human health and the environment and standards of operation. Regulations concerning equipment certification create an ongoing need for regular maintenance that is incorporated into our daily operating procedures. Moreover, the oil and natural gas industry is subject to environmental regulation pursuant to local, state and federal legislation and regulatory initiatives. 
8

Transportation Matters 
In connection with our transportation and relocation of our oilfield service equipment and shipment of hydraulic fracturing sand, we operate trucks and other heavy equipment. As such, we operate as a commercial motor carrier in providing certain of our services and therefore are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) and analogous state agencies. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers, governing activities such as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations and regulatory safety, driver licensing and insurance requirements, financial reporting and review of certain mergers, consolidations and acquisitions and hazardous materials labeling, placarding and marking. There are additional regulations specifically related to the trucking industry, including testing and specification of equipment and product handling requirements. In addition, our trucking operations are subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may increase our costs by requiring changes in operating practices or by changing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing truckload services. Some of these possible changes include increasingly stringent environmental regulations, changes in the hours of service regulations which govern the amount of time a driver may drive or work in any specific period, onboard electronic logging device (“ELD”) requirements or limits on vehicle weight and size. 
Interstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the DOT. To a large degree, intrastate motor carrier operations are subject to state safety regulations that mirror federal regulations but may be more stringent. Such matters as weight and dimension of equipment are also subject to federal and state regulations. 
Finally, from time to time, various legislative proposals are introduced, including proposals to increase federal, state or local taxes, including taxes on motor fuels, which may increase our costs or adversely impact the recruitment of contracted drivers. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any increase in such taxes applicable to us would be enacted. 
Environmental Matters and Regulation 
General. Our operations and the operations of our oil and natural gas E&P customers are subject to stringent federal, tribal, regional, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Numerous federal, state and local governmental agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and analogous state agencies have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, often requiring difficult and costly actions. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before conducting regulated activities, restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that may be released into the environment, limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, ecologically sensitive and other protected areas, require action to prevent or remediate pollution from current or former operations, result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations, require that additional pollution controls be installed and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations or relating to our owned or operated facilities. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial or corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures; the occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting or performance of projects; and the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of our operations in a particular area. 
The trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may adversely affect the environment, and thus any new laws and regulations, amendment of existing laws and regulations, reinterpretation of legal requirements or increased governmental enforcement that result in more stringent and costly completion activities, or waste handling, storage transport, disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. We may be unable to pass on such increased compliance costs to our customers. Moreover, accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of our operations, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for personal injury to persons and damage to properties or natural resources. Historically, our environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. Additionally, our customers may also incur increased costs or delays, restrictions or cancellations in permitting or operating activities as a result of more stringent environmental laws and regulations, which may result in a curtailment of exploration, development or production activities that would reduce the demand for our services. 
The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental laws, as amended from time to time, to which our business is subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position. 
Waste Handling. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), and comparable state statutes, regulate the generation, treatment, storage, transportation, disposal and clean-up of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes. Pursuant to rules issued by the EPA, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more requirements, which may be more stringent. In the course of our operations, we generate some amounts of ordinary industrial wastes that may be regulated as hazardous wastes. Additionally, drilling fluids, produced waters and most of the other wastes 
9

associated with the exploration, development and production of oil or natural gas, if properly handled, are currently exempt from regulation as hazardous waste under RCRA and, instead, are regulated under RCRA’s less stringent non-hazardous waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws. However, it is possible that certain oil and natural gas drilling and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. For example, in response to a consent decree issued by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in 2016, the EPA is required to propose no later than March 15, 2019, a rulemaking for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations that could result in oil and natural gas wastes being regulated as hazardous wastes, or sign a determination that revision of the regulations is unnecessary. If the EPA proposes a rulemaking for revised oil and natural gas waste regulations, the consent decree requires that the EPA take final action following notice and comment rulemaking no later than July 15, 2021. A loss of the RCRA exclusion for drilling fluids, produced waters and related wastes could result in an increase in our, as well as the oil and natural gas E&P industry’s, costs to manage and dispose of generated wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on the industry as well as on our business. 
Remediation of Hazardous Substances. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the “Superfund” law, and comparable state statutes impose liability, without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. Such classes of persons include the current and past owners or operators of sites where a hazardous substance was released, and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several, strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property or natural resources damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. We currently own, lease or operate upon numerous properties and facilities that for many years have been used for industrial activities, including oil and natural gas-related operations. Hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons may have been released on or under the properties owned, leased or operated upon by us, or on or under other locations where such substances have been taken for recycling or disposal. In addition, some of these properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners whose treatment and disposal or release of hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons, were not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes and remediate contaminated property (including groundwater contamination), including instances where the prior owner or operator caused the contamination, or perform remedial activities to prevent future contamination. 
Handling and Exposure to Radioactive Materials. In the course of our operations, some of our equipment may be exposed to naturally occurring radioactive materials (“NORM”) associated with oil and natural gas deposits and, accordingly may result in the generation of wastes and other materials containing NORM. Any NORM exhibiting levels of naturally occurring radiation in excess of established state standards are subject to special handling and disposal requirements, and any storage vessels, piping and work area affected by NORM may be subject to remediation or restoration requirements. Because certain of the properties presently or previously owned, operated or occupied by us may have been used for oil and natural gas production operations, it is possible that we may incur costs or liabilities associated with NORM. 
In addition, some of our operations utilize equipment that contains sealed, low-grade radioactive sources. Our activities involving the use of radioactive materials are regulated by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (“NRC”) and also by state regulatory agencies under agreement with the NRC. Standards implemented by these regulatory agencies require us to obtain licenses or other approvals for the use of such radioactive materials. These regulatory agencies have adopted regulations implementing and enforcing these laws, for which compliance is often costly and difficult. 
Water Discharges and Discharges into Belowground Formations. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”) and analogous state laws, impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and hazardous substances, into state waters and waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan requirements imposed under the Clean Water Act require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. The Clean Water Act also prohibits the discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, unless authorized by permit. The Clean Water Act and analogous state laws also may impose substantial civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance including spills and other non-authorized discharges. In 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps”) published a final rule outlining their position on the federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States, including wetlands, but legal challenges to this rule followed. Beginning in the first quarter of 2017, the EPA and the Corps agreed to reconsider the 2015 rule and, thereafter, the agencies have (i) published a proposed rule in 2017 to rescind the 2015 rule and recodify the regulatory text that governed waters of the United States prior to promulgation of the 2015 rule, (ii) published a final rule in February 2018 adding a February 6, 2020 applicable date to the 2015 rule, and (iii) published a proposed rule in December 2018 re-defining the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction over waters of the United States for which the agencies will seek public comment. The 2015 and February 2018 final rules are being 
10

challenged by various factions in federal district court and implementation of the 2015 rule has been enjoined in twenty-eight states pending resolution of the various federal district court challenges. As a result of these legal developments, future implementation of the 2015 rule is uncertain at this time. Any expansion of the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction in areas where we or our oil and natural gas E&P customers operate could impose additional permitting obligations on us and our customers. 
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) amends the Clean Water Act and sets minimum standards for prevention, containment and cleanup of oil spills. The OPA applies to vessels, offshore facilities and onshore facilities, including E&P facilities that may affect waters of the United States. Under OPA, responsible parties including owners and operators of onshore facilities may be held strictly liable for oil cleanup costs and natural resource damages as well as a variety of public and private damages that may result from oil spills. The OPA also requires owners or operators of certain onshore facilities to prepare Facility Response Plans for responding to a worst case discharge of oil into waters of the United States. 
Our oil and natural gas E&P customers dispose of flowback and produced water or certain other oilfield fluids gathered from oil and natural gas producing operations in accordance with permits issued by government authorities overseeing such disposal activities. While these permits are issued pursuant to existing laws and regulations, these legal requirements are subject to change based on concerns of the public or governmental authorities regarding such disposal activities. One such concern relates to recent seismic events near underground disposal wells used for the disposal by injection of flowback and produced water or certain other oilfield fluids resulting from oil and natural gas activities. Developing research suggests that the link between seismic activity and wastewater disposal may vary by region, and that only a very small fraction of the tens of thousands of injection wells have been suspected to be, or may have been, the likely cause of induced seismicity. In 2016, the United States Geological Survey identified six states with the most significant hazards from induced seismicity, including Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico and Arkansas. In response to concerns regarding induced seismicity, regulators in some states have imposed, or are considering imposing, additional requirements in the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. For example, Texas and Oklahoma have issued rules for wastewater disposal wells that imposed certain permitting restrictions, operating restrictions and/or reporting requirements on disposal wells in proximity to faults. States may, from time to time, develop and implement plans directing certain wells where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend disposal well operations. In Oklahoma, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission’s (“OCC”) Oil and Gas Conservation Division and the Oklahoma Geological Survey released well completion seismicity guidance in late 2016, which requires operators to take certain prescriptive actions, including an operator’s planned mitigation practices, following certain unusual seismic activity within 1.25 miles of hydraulic fracturing operations. In recent years, including during 2018, the OCC’s Oil and Gas Conservation Division has issued orders limiting future increases in the volume of oil and natural gas wastewater injected belowground into the Arbuckle formation in an effort to reduce the number of earthquakes in the state. Another consequence of seismic events may be lawsuits alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. 
These developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection wells by our customers to dispose of flowback and produced water and certain other oilfield fluids. Increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity also could lead to greater opposition to, and litigation concerning, oil and natural gas activities utilizing injection wells for waste disposal. Any one or more of these developments may result in our customers having to limit disposal well volumes, disposal rates or locations, or require our customers or third party disposal well operators that are used to dispose of customer wastewater to shut down disposal wells, which developments could adversely affect our customers’ business and result in a corresponding decrease in the need for our services, which would could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
Air Emissions. Certain of our operations also result in emissions of regulated air pollutants. The federal Clean Air Act (the “CAA”) and analogous state laws require permits for certain facilities that have the potential to emit substances into the atmosphere that could adversely affect environmental quality. These laws and their implementing regulations also impose generally applicable limitations on air emissions and require adherence to maintenance, work practice, reporting and record keeping, and other requirements. Failure to obtain a permit or to comply with permit or other regulatory requirements could result in the imposition of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties. In addition, we or our oil and natural gas E&P customers could be required to shut down or retrofit existing equipment, leading to additional expenses and operational delays. 
Many of these regulatory requirements, including new source performance standards (“NSPS”) and Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards are expected to be made more stringent over time as a result of stricter ambient air quality standards and other air quality protection goals adopted by the EPA. Compliance with these or other new regulations could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of our equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase our capital expenditures and operating costs, which could adversely impact on our business. For example, in 2015, the EPA lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQs”), for ground-level ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion for both the eight-hour primary and secondary standards. In 2017 and 2018, the EPA issued area designations with respect to ground-level ozone as either “attainment/unclassifiable,” unclassifiable” or “non-attainment.” Additionally, in November 2018, the EPA issued final requirements that apply to state, local, and tribal air agencies for implementing the 2015 NAAQS for ground-level ozone. States are also expected to implement requirements as a result of this NAAQs final rule, which could result in stricter 
11

permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. Compliance with these and other air pollution control and permitting requirements has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects and increase costs for us and our customers. Moreover, our business could be materially affected if our E&P customers’ operations are significantly affected by these or other similar requirements. These requirements could increase the cost of doing business for us and our customers and reduce the demand for the oil and natural gas our customers produce, and thus have an adverse effect on the demand for our services. 
Climate Change. The U.S. Congress and the EPA, in addition to some state and regional efforts, have in recent years considered legislation or regulations to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”). These efforts have included consideration of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG reporting and tracking programs and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources. In the absence of federal GHG-limiting legislations, the EPA has determined that GHG emissions present a danger to public health and the environment and has adopted regulations that, among other things, restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA and may require the installation of “best available control technology” to limit emissions of GHGs from any new or significantly modified facilities that we may seek to construct in the future if they would otherwise emit large volumes of GHGs together with other criteria pollutants. Also, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission and storage facilities in the United States. In 2015, the EPA amended and expanded the GHG reporting requirements to all segments of the oil and natural gas industry, including gathering and boosting stations as well as completions and workovers from hydraulically fractured oil wells. 
The EPA has also taken steps to limit methane emissions, a GHG, from certain new modified or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector through the adoption of a final rule in 2016 establishing Subpart OOOOa standards for methane emissions. However, in 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to stay certain portions of these Subpart OOOOa standards for two years but the rule was not finalized. Rather, in February 2018, the EPA finalized amendments to certain requirements of the 2016 final rule, and in September 2018 the EPA proposed additional amendments, including rescission of certain requirements and revisions to other requirements, such as fugitive emission monitoring frequency. Furthermore, in late 2016, the federal Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) published a final rule to reduce methane emissions by regulating venting, flaring and leaks from oil and natural gas production activities on onshore federal and Native American lands. However, in September 2018, the BLM published a final rule that rescinds most of the new requirements of the 2016 final rule and codifies the BLM’s prior approach to venting and flaring but the rule rescinding the 2016 final rule has been challenged in federal court and remains pending. In the event that the EPA’s 2016 or the BLM’s 2016 rules should remain or be placed in effect, or should any other new methane emission standards be imposed on the oil and natural gas sector, such requirements could result in increased costs to our or our oil and natural gas E&P customers’ operations as well as result in restrictions, delays or cancellations in such operations, which costs, restrictions, delays or cancellations could adversely affect our business.
Internationally, in April 2016, the United States joined other countries in entering into a United Nations-sponsored non-binding agreement negotiated in Paris, France (“Paris Agreement”) for nations to limit their GHG emissions through individually determined reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. However, in August 2017, the U.S. State Department informed the United Nations of the intent of the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, which provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016. The United States’ adherence to the exit process and/or the terms on which the United States may reenter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time. Substantial limitations on GHG emissions could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas our E&P customers produce and lower the value of their reserves, which developments could reduce demand for our services and have a corresponding material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Moreover, recent activism directed at shifting investments away from companies with energy-related assets could result in limitations or restrictions on certain sources of funding for the energy sector
Endangered Species. The federal Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) and analogous state laws regulate activities that could have an adverse effect on threatened and endangered species or their habitats. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act (“MBTA”). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (“FWS”) may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal and private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or oil and gas development. If harm to species or damages to habitat occur, government entities or, at times, private parties may act to prevent oil and gas exploration or development activities or seek damages for harm to species, habitat or natural resources resulting from drilling or construction or releases of oil, wastes, hazardous substances or other regulated materials, and, in some cases, may seek criminal penalties. Permanent restrictions imposed to protect these species or their habitat could delay, restrict or prohibit drilling in certain areas by our oil and natural gas E&P customers, which could reduce demand for our services. 
In addition, as a result of one or more settlements entered into by the FWS, the agency is required to consider listing numerous species as endangered or threatened under the ESA pursuant to specific time lines. The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where our oil and natural gas customers operate could cause certain of our customers to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on their E&P activities that could have an adverse effect on our ability to provide products and services to those customers.

Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing 
We perform hydraulic fracturing services for our oil and natural gas E&P customers. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand or other proppant and chemical additives under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. 
Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions or similar agencies, but the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority and performed investigations over aspects of the process. For example, the EPA has asserted regulatory authority pursuant to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) program over hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel and issued guidance covering such activities as well as published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. Additionally, the EPA issued final CAA regulations in 2012 and in 2016 governing performance standards, including standards for the capture of emissions of methane and volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”) released during hydraulic fracturing. The EPA also published an effluent limit guideline final rule in 2016 prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plant. The BLM published a final rule in 2015 that established new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands but the BLM rescinded the 2015 rule in late 2017; however, litigation challenging the BLM’s decision to rescind the 2015 rule is pending in federal district court. Also, in late 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances. 
Additionally, various state and local governments have implemented, or are considering, increased regulatory oversight of hydraulic fracturing through additional permit requirements, operational restrictions, disclosure requirements, well construction and temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing in certain areas. For example, Texas, Colorado and North Dakota, among others, have adopted regulations that impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure, disposal and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. States could also elect to prohibit high volume hydraulic fracturing altogether, following the approach taken by the State of New York. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. Moreover, non-governmental organizations may seek to restrict hydraulic fracturing, as has been the case in Colorado in recent years, when certain interest groups therein have unsuccessfully pursued ballot initiatives in recent general election cycles that, had they been successful, would have revised the state constitution or state statutes in a manner that would have made exploration and production activities in the state more difficult or costly in the future including, for example, by increasing mandatory setback distances of oil and natural gas operations, including hydraulic fracturing, from specific occupied structures and/or certain environmentally sensitive or recreational areas. If new federal, state or local laws, regulations or ballot initiatives that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such legal requirements could result in delays, eliminate certain drilling and injection activities and make it more difficult or costly to perform hydraulic fracturing. Any such regulations limiting or prohibiting hydraulic fracturing could result in decreased oil and natural gas E&P activities and, therefore, adversely affect demand for our services and our business. Such laws or regulations could also materially increase our costs of compliance and doing business. 
Historically, our hydraulic fracturing compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future. It is possible, however, that substantial costs for compliance or penalties for non-compliance may be incurred in the future. Moreover, it is possible that other developments, such as the adoption of stricter environmental laws, regulations, ballot initiatives and enforcement policies, could result in additional costs or liabilities that we cannot currently quantify. 
Other Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry 
The oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal, state and local authorities. Legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden. Also, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations that are binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Although changes to the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry could affect the demand for our services, we would not expect to be affected any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than other companies in the industry with similar operations. 
Drilling. Our customers’ operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local level. These types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. The state and some counties and municipalities in which our customers are located also regulate one or more of the following: 

• | the location of wells;

13


• | the method of drilling and casing wells;


• | the timing of construction or drilling activities, including seasonal wildlife closures;


• | the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled; and


• | notice to, and consultation with, surface owners and other third parties.

State Regulation. States regulate the drilling for oil and natural gas, including imposing severance taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits. States also regulate the method of developing new fields, the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of oil and natural gas resources. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation, but we cannot assure you that they will not do so in the future. The oil and natural gas industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws. Some of those laws relate to resource conservation and equal employment opportunity. We do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect on us. To the extent that such regulations result in the curtailment of our customers’ operations or production, we may incur decreased demand for our services, which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
Storage and Handling of Explosive Materials. 
Our operations involve the handling of explosive materials for our wireline services provided to our oil and natural gas E&P customers. Despite our use of specialized facilities to store explosive materials and intensive employee training programs, the handling of explosive materials could result in incidents that temporarily shut down or otherwise disrupt our or our customers’ operations or could cause restrictions, delays or cancellations in the delivery of our services. It is possible that an explosion could result in death or significant injuries to employees and other persons. Material property damage to us, our customers and other third parties could also occur. Any explosive incident could expose us to adverse publicity or liability for damages, including environmental natural resource damages, or cause production restrictions, delays or cancellations, any of which developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
Occupational Safety and Health Matters 
We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act which is administered and enforced by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, commonly referred to as OSHA, and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with the OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances. OSHA continues to evaluate worker safety and to propose new regulations, such as but not limited to, the proposed new rule regarding respirable silica sand. Although it is not possible to estimate the financial and compliance impact of the proposed respirable silica sand rule or any other proposed rule, the imposition of more stringent requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

NOTE 1 - Nature of Operations, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies
Organization and Nature of Operations
Quintana Energy Services Inc. (either individually or together with its subsidiaries, as the context requires, the “Company,” “QES,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated on April 13, 2017. Our accounting predecessor, Quintana Energy Services LP (“QES LP” and “Predecessor”), was formed as a Delaware partnership on November 3, 2014. In connection with our initial public offering (the “IPO”) which closed on February 13, 2018, the existing investors in QES LP and QES Holdco LLC contributed all of their direct and indirect equity interests to QES in exchange for shares of common stock in QES, and we became the holding company for the reorganized QES LP and its subsidiaries.
We are a growth-oriented provider of diversified oilfield services to leading onshore oil and natural gas exploration and production (“E&P”) companies operating in both conventional and unconventional plays in all of the active major basins throughout the United States. The Company operates through four reporting segments which are Directional Drilling, Pressure Pumping, Pressure Control and Wireline.
Initial Public Offering
As of December 31, 2017, our Predecessor had approximately 417,441,074 common units outstanding and 227,885,579 warrants to purchase common units outstanding. Immediately prior to the IPO on February 13, 2018, the warrants were net settled for 223,394,762 common units, and immediately thereafter our Predecessor and affiliated entities were reorganized through mergers and related transactions and 20,235,193 shares of our common stock were issued to the holders of equity in our Predecessor at a ratio of 1 share of our common stock for 31.669363 common units of our Predecessor (with elimination of fractional shares) (the “Merger Transactions”). On February 13, 2018, immediately after the Merger Transactions, but prior to our IPO, our Predecessor’s Former Term Loan (as defined below) was extinguished and in partial consideration therefore 3,363,208 shares were issued to our Predecessor’s Former Term Loan lenders based on the price to the public of our IPO (representing 1 share of common stock for each $10.00 in Former Term Loan obligations converted) (together with the “Merger Transactions”, the “Reorganization Transactions”).
The gross proceeds of the IPO to the Company, at the public offering price of $10.00 per share, were $92.6 million, which resulted in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $87.0 million, after deducting $5.6 million of underwriting discounts and commissions associated with the shares sold by the Company, excluding approximately $5.3 million in offering expenses payable by the Company. Taking together the Reorganization Transactions and the issuance of 9,259,259 shares of our common stock to the public in our IPO, as of February 13, 2018, we had 32,857,660 shares outstanding immediately following our IPO. Subsequent to our IPO, we issued 139,921 shares in connection with the vesting of awards under our Predecessor’s 2015 LTIP Plan on February 22, 2018, and 260,529 shares of our common stock were issued on March 8, 2018 in consideration of vesting of awards under our Predecessor’s 2017 LTIP which we assumed. In connection with both awards, certain shares were withheld to satisfy tax obligations of the holder of the award, which shares are currently treasury shares totaling 136,585 shares of common stock. Also in connection with the consummation of the IPO, on March 9, 2018, the underwriters exercised their overallotment option to purchase an additional 372,824 shares of common stock of QES, which resulted in additional net proceeds of approximately $3.5 million (the “Option Exercise”), net of underwriter’s discounts and commission of $0.1 million. Upon the completion of the Reorganization Transactions, the IPO and the Option Exercise, QES had 33,630,934 shares of common stock outstanding.
The net proceeds received from the IPO and a $13.0 million drawdown on the New ABL Facility (described below) were used to fully repay the Company’s revolving credit facility balance of $81.1 million and repay $12.6 million of the Company’s $40.0 million, 10% Former Term Loan due 2020, as described in “Note 6 - Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations.” The remaining proceeds from the IPO were used for general corporate purposes.
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The consolidated financial accounts include all QES accounts and all of our subsidiaries where we exercise control. All inter-company transactions and account balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.

QUINTANA ENERGY SERVICES INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year financial statements to conform to the current period financial statement presentation.
Segment Reporting 
The Company’s reportable segments are: (1) Pressure Pumping, (2) Directional Drilling, (3) Pressure Control, and (4) Wireline. 
The Company routinely evaluates whether its separate operating and reportable segments continue to reflect the way its Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) evaluates the business. The determination is based on the following factors: (1) how the Company’s CODM is currently managing each operating segment as a separate business and evaluating the performance of each segment and making resource allocation decisions distinctly and expects to do so for the foreseeable future, and (2) whether discrete financial information for each operating segment is available. The Company considers its Chief Executive Officer to be its CODM.
The current structure in place continues to reflect the financial information and reports used by the Company’s management, specifically its CODM, to make decisions regarding the Company’s business, including resource allocations and performance assessments. See “Note 12 - Segment Information” for further discussion regarding the Company’s reportable segments. 
Use of Estimates 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 
Revenue Recognition 
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This ASU amended the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition and requires companies to recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. QES adopted this ASU on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Prior to the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), on January 1, 2018, the revenue was recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement existed, services are performed, the sales price was fixed or determinable and collectability was reasonably assured. 
 QES recognizes revenue upon the transfer of control of promised products or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for these products or services. The vast majority of our services and product offerings are short-term in nature, generally between 30 to 60 days. Services are sold without warranty and QES generates revenue from multiple sources within its four operating segments outlined as follows:
Pressure Pumping revenue. Through its Pressure Pumping segment, the Company provides completion and production services based upon a purchase order, contract or on a spot market basis. Services are provided based on the price book and bid on a stage rate (for hydraulic fracturing services) or job basis (for cementing and acidizing services), contracted or hourly basis, and revenue is recognized when the stage or job is completed. Jobs for these services are typically short-term in nature and range from a few hours to multiple days. Revenue is recognized upon the completion of each day’s work (or job, if longer than a day) based upon a completed field ticket, which includes the charges for the services performed, mobilization of the equipment to the location and the personnel involved in such services or mobilization. Additional revenue is generated through labor charges and reimbursable consumable supplies that are incidental to the service being performed. Labor charges and the use of consumable supplies are included on completed field tickets. 
Directional Drilling revenue. Through its directional drilling segment, the Company provides directional drilling services on a day rate or hourly basis, and recognizes the revenue as the services are provided. QES recognizes mobilization revenue and costs for day-work over the days of actual drilling. Included in revenue are proceeds from customers for the cost of oilfield downhole tools and other equipment that are involuntarily damaged or lost-in-hole. 
Pressure Control revenue. Through its Pressure Control segment, the Company provides a range of coiled tubing, snubbing, well control and other well completion and production-related services, including nitrogen and fluid pumping services, on both a contract and spot market basis. Jobs for these services are typically short-term in nature and range from a few hours to multiple days. Revenue is recognized upon completion of each day’s work based upon a completed field ticket. The field ticket includes charges for the services performed and any related consumables (such as friction reducers and nitrogen materials) used during the course 
62

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

of the services, which are reported as product sales. The field ticket may also include charges for the mobilization and set-up of equipment, the personnel on the job, any additional equipment used on the job, and other miscellaneous consumables. 
Wireline revenue. Through its Wireline segment, the Company provides cased-hole production logging, casing evaluation logging, through tubing and casing perforating, pressure control, pipe recovery, plug setting, dump-bailing, and other complementary services, on a spot market basis or subject to a negotiated pricing agreement. Jobs for these services are typically short-term in nature, lasting anywhere from a few hours to a few weeks. The Company typically charges the customer for these services on a per job basis at agreed-upon spot market rates. Revenue is normally recognized based on a field ticket issued upon the completion of the job. However, for large stage jobs that starts in one period and finishes in another, revenue is recognized on the stages completed for which a field ticket is issued. 
The timing of revenue recognition may differ from contract billing or payment schedules, resulting in revenues that have been earned but not billed (“unbilled revenue”) or amounts that have been collected, but not earned. 
Typical Contractual Arrangements
The Company typically provides the services based upon a combination of a Master Service Agreement (“MSA”) or its General Terms & Conditions (T&Cs”) and a purchase order or other similar forms of work requests that primarily operate on a spot market basis for a defined work scope on a particular well or well pad. Services are provided based on a price book and bid on a day rate, stage rate or job basis. QES may also charge for the mobilization and set-up of equipment and for materials and consumables used in the services. Contracts generally are short-term in nature, ranging from a few hours to multiple weeks. Contracts typically do not stipulate substantive early termination penalties for either party. As such, the Company determined that its contracts are day to day, even though parties typically do not terminate the contract early during the normal course of business. In cases where the customer terminates the contract early, the Company has an enforceable right to payment for services performed to date. Under day rate contracts, we generally receive a contractual day rate for each day we are performing services. The contractual day rate may vary based on the status of the operations and generally includes a full operating rate and a standby rate. Other fees may be stipulated in the contract related to mobilization and setup of equipment and reimbursements for consumables and cost of tools and equipment, that are involuntarily damaged or lost-in-hole.
Performance Obligations and Transaction Price
Customers generally contract with us to provide an integrated service of personnel and equipment for directional drilling, pressure pumping, pressure control or wireline services. The Company is seen by the operator as the overseer of its services and is compensated to provide an entire suite for its scope of services. QES determined that each service contract contains a single performance obligation, which is each day’s service. In addition, each day’s service is within the scope of the series guidance as both criteria of series guidance are met: 1) each distinct increment of service (i.e. days available to supervise or number of stages determined at contract inception) that the Company agrees to transfer represents a performance obligation that meets the criteria for recognizing revenue over time, and 2) the Company would use the same method for measuring progress toward satisfaction of the performance obligation for each distinct increment of service in the series. Therefore, the Company has determined that each service contract contains one single performance obligation, which is the series of each distinct stage or day’s service.
The transaction price for the Company’s service contracts is based on the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive for providing the services over the specified term and includes both fixed amounts and unconstrained variable amounts. In addition, the contract term may impact the determination and allocation of the transaction price and recognition of revenue. As the Company’s contracts do not stipulate substantive termination penalties, the contract is treated as day to day. Typically, the only fixed or known consideration at contract inception is initial mobilization and demobilization (where it is contractually guaranteed). In cases where the demobilization fee is not fixed, the Company estimates the variable consideration using the expected value method and includes this in the transaction price to the extent it is not constrained. Variable consideration is generally constrained if it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. As the contracts are not enforceable, the contract price should not include any estimation for the day rate or stage rate charges.
Recognition of Revenue
Directional drilling, pressure pumping, pressure control and wireline services are consumed as the services are performed and generally enhances the customer or operators well site. Work performed on a well site does not create an asset with an alternative use to the contractor since the well/asset being worked on is owned by the customer. Therefore, the Company’s measure of progress for our contracts are hours available to provide the services over the contracted duration. This unit of measure is representative of an output method as described in ASC 606.
63

QUINTANA ENERGY SERVICES INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The following chart details the types of fees found in a typical service contract and the related recognition method under ASC 606:

Fee type | Revenue Recognition 
Day rate | Revenue is recognized based on the day rates earned as it relates to the level of service provided for each day throughout the contract. 
Initial mobilization | Revenue is estimated at contract inception and included in the transaction price to be recognized ratably over contract term. 
Demobilization | Unconstrained demobilization revenue is estimated at contract inception, included in the transaction price, and recognized ratably over the contract term.
Reimbursement | Recognized (gross of costs incurred) at the amount billed to the customer. 

Disaggregation of Revenue
The Company discloses a reconciliation of the disaggregated revenue with the reported results in "Note 12 - Segment Information." 
Future Performance Obligations and Financing Arrangements
As our contracts are day to day and short-term in nature, the Company determined that it does not have material future performance obligations or financing arrangements under its service contracts. Payments are typically due within 30 days after the services are rendered. The timing between the recognition of revenue and receipt of payment is not significant.
No contract assets or liabilities were recognized related to contracts with our customers.
The Company has also exercised the following practical expedients and accounting policy elections provided by ASC 606 for all its service contracts.

1) | QES occasionally pays commissions to its sales staff for successfully obtaining a contract. The commission payment is incremental costs of obtaining a contract and should be capitalized and amortized over the contract period. However, ASC 340-40-25-4 provides a practical expedient, which states that “an entity may recognize the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that the entity otherwise would have recognized is one year or less.” Management has elected to use this practical expedient as most of the Company’s service contracts are less than a month. Accordingly, the Company expenses the commission expense as incurred.


2) | In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12 that allows an entity to make an accounting policy election to exclude from the transaction price certain types of taxes collected from a customer (i.e. present revenue net of these taxes), including sales, use, value-added and some excise taxes.

Cash and Cash Equivalents 
For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, and certificates of deposits. QES considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. 
The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents in various financial institutions, which at times may exceed federally insured amounts. Management believes that this risk is not significant. 
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
QES grants credit to qualified customers, which potentially subjects the Company to credit risk resulting from, among other factors, adverse changes in the industry in which the Company operates and the financial condition of its customers. Estimated losses on accounts receivable are provided through an allowance for doubtful accounts. The level of allowance is determined by specifically evaluating customers deemed to be an elevated credit risk, as well as a general analysis of the overall aging of our accounts. As the financial condition of any party changes, circumstances develop or additional information becomes available, adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $1.8 million and $0.8 million, respectively. Bad debt expense of $1.1 million, $0.3 million and $0.1 million was included in selling, general and administration expenses on the consolidated statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Activity in our allowance for doubtful accounts during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 is set forth in the table below (in thousands of dollars):

 (1) Accounts receivable balances written off during the period, net of recoveries.
Unbilled Receivables 
Unbilled receivables are the amounts of recoverable revenue that have been earned and not billed at the balance sheet date. Unbilled receivables relate principally to revenue that is billed in the month after services are performed. These items are expected to be collected in the normal course of business. 
Inventories 
Inventories consisting primarily of cement mix, sand, fuel, chemicals, proppants, and downhole tool spare parts are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The average cost method is used for inventory held by all segments. 
Property, Plant, and Equipment 
Property, plant, and equipment (“PP&E”) are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred while the cost of additions and improvements that substantially extend the useful life and/or the functionality of a particular asset are capitalized. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets retired or otherwise disposed of are eliminated from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are recognized in operations in the period of disposal. 
PP&E are evaluated on an annual basis to identify events or changes in circumstances (“triggering events”) that indicate that the carrying value of certain PP&E may not be recoverable. PP&E are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event. An impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount of PP&E is not recoverable. The determination of recoverability is made based upon the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows of assets grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets with such cash flows to be realized over the estimated remaining useful life of the primary asset within the asset group. If the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows for a given asset group is less than the carrying amount of the related assets, an impairment loss is determined by comparing the estimated fair value with the carrying value of the related assets. The impairment loss is then allocated across the asset group’s major classifications. 
Based on management’s assessment and consideration of the current business environment, the financial performance of the business, and the current outlook, it was determined there has been no impairment the current period. As such, no impairment of PP&E was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. The company reported an impairment of PP&E of approximately $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Goodwill and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets 
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, goodwill is not amortized since it has an indefinite life. Instead, the Company's Goodwill balance, if any, it is tested at least annually for impairment; impairment losses, if any, are recorded in the statement of operations as part of income from operations. The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis as of September 30, or when events or changes in circumstances, referred to as triggering events, indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable and that a potential impairment exists. The quantitative impairment test for goodwill requires a two-step approach, which is performed at a reporting unit level. Step one of the test identifies potential impairments by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount. Step two, which is performed if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, calculates the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill and the implied fair value of that goodwill. 
65

QUINTANA ENERGY SERVICES INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company uses the income and market approach to estimate the fair value of its reporting units. The income approach is based on a discounted cash flow model, which utilizes present values of estimated cash flows to estimate fair value. The future cash flows are projected based on estimates of projected revenue growth, fleet and rig count, utilization, gross profit rates, SG&A rates, working capital fluctuations and capital expenditures. Management’s anticipated business outlook, which has been impacted by the sustained decline in commodity prices, falling Company stock prices, and negative cash flows, is taken into consideration. The future cash flows are discounted using a market-participant risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. These assumptions are derived from unobservable Level 3 inputs, as described below, and reflect management’s judgments and assumptions. 
The market approach is based upon selected public companies operating within the same industry as the reporting unit. Based on this set of comparable competitor data, enterprise value-to-earnings multiples are derived and applied to the estimated earnings of the reporting unit to determine an estimated fair value. Earnings estimates are derived from unobservable inputs that require significant estimates, judgments and assumptions as described in the income approach. 
Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. When events or changes in circumstances (a triggering event) indicate that the asset may have a net book value in excess of their recoverable value, the Company performs a recoverability test on its definite-lived intangible assets by comparing the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the use of the asset to the carrying amount of the asset. If the estimated undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment does not exist, and a loss will not be recognized. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, the asset is deemed to not be recoverable, and the amount of impairment must be determined by fair valuing the asset. 
Deferred Financing Costs 
Costs incurred to obtain financing are capitalized and amortized over the term of the loan using the effective interest method. These costs are classified within interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations. 
Income Taxes 
The asset and liability method is used in accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. If applicable, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized. The Company’s policy is to account for interest and penalties with respect to income taxes as operating expenses. 
On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law legislation informally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”). The Act represents major tax reform legislation that, among other provisions, reduces the U.S. corporate tax rate. 
Comprehensive Income (loss) 
Any comprehensive income (loss) and its components are displayed in our financial statements. When they arise, we classify items of comprehensive income by their nature in the financial statements and display the accumulated balance and other comprehensive income in members’ equity. Comprehensive income equals net income for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A hierarchy has been established for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, and are developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of QES. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect QES’ assumptions of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances. The financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of the inputs. 

Level 1 | Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

66

QUINTANA ENERGY SERVICES INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


Level 2 | Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities that are observable for the asset or liability; or


Level 3 | Unobservable pricing inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources, such as discounted cash flow models or valuations.

Stock-based compensation 
The Company records compensation relating to stock-based compensation transactions and includes such costs in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. The cost is measured at the grant date and based on the calculated fair value of the award. See “Note 13 - Stock-Based Compensation” for additional information related to stock-based compensation.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Adopted in 2018
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-9, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard that supersedes most existing industry-specific guidance. ASC 606 creates a framework by which an entity allocates the transaction price to separate performance obligations and recognizes revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied. Under the new standard, entities are required to use judgment and make estimates, including identifying performance obligations in a contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation and determining when an entity satisfies its performance obligations. The standard allows for either “full retrospective” adoption, meaning that the standard is applied to all of the periods presented with a cumulative catch-up in the earliest period presented, or “modified retrospective” adoption, meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements with a cumulative catch-up in the current period. In July and December 2016, the FASB issued various additional authoritative guidance for the new revenue recognition standard. The accounting standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and did not have a material impact on the Company’s 2018 first quarter interim condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Company adopted ASC 606, effective January 1, 2018, utilizing the modified retrospective method of adoption. 
In January 2017, FASB issued ASU No. 2017-1, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business. The amendments provide a more robust framework to use in determining when a set of assets and activities constitutes a business. The new standard was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2018. The standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s interim condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows as it did not have any business combinations transactions.
In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-9, Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting, which clarifies what constitutes a modification of a stock-based payment award. The new standard was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2018. The standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s interim condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows because there has been no modification to our equity-based payment awards.
In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments providing new guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments including debt extinguishment costs, debt prepayment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments, contingent consideration payments, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims and life insurance policies and distributions received from equity method investees in the statement of cash flows. This update is required to be applied using the retrospective transition method to each period presented unless it is impracticable to be applied retrospectively. In such situation, this guidance is to be applied prospectively. The new standard was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2018, which did not impact 2017 results, but resulted in a $1.3 million prepayment premium cost being reported under financing activities relating to the debt extinguishment of the Company’s $40.0 million term loan at the closing of the IPO.
Accounting Standards not yet adopted
In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This ASU is intended to simplify aspects of stock-based compensation issued to non-employees by making the guidance consistent with the accounting for employee stock-based compensation. The guidance is effective for the Company for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2020. While the exact impact of this standard is not known, the guidance is not

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, as non-employee stock compensation is nominal relative to the Company's total expenses as of December 31, 2018. 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-2, Leases, to provide guidance for the accounting for leasing transactions. The standard requires the lessee to recognize a lease liability along with a right-of-use asset for all leases with a term longer than one year. A lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset to not recognize the lease liability and related right-of-use asset for leases with a term of one year or less. The provisions of this standard also apply to situations where the Company is the lessor. The requirements in this update are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company adopted this new guidance effective January 1, 2019. ASC 842 requires a modified retrospective approach to each lease that existed at the date of initial application as well as leases entered into after that date. The Company has elected to report all leases at the beginning of the period of adoption and not restate its comparative periods. Based on the Company’s lease portfolio, the Company anticipates recognizing a right-of-use asset and a related lease liability of approximately $33.0 million on its balance sheet, with an immaterial impact on the Company’s consolidated statement of operations compared to the previous lease accounting guidance.
Practical Expedients Adopted with Topic 842
The Company has elected to adopt the following practical expedients upon the transition date to Topic 842 on January 1, 2019:

• | Transitional practical expedients package: An entity may elect to apply the listed practical expedients as a package to all the leases that commenced before the effective date. The practical expedients are:


◦ | The entity need not reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contains leases;


◦ | The entity need not reassess the lease classification for expired or existing contracts;


◦ | The entity need not reassess initial direct costs for any existing leases.


• | Use of portfolio approach: An entity can apply this guidance to a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics if the entity reasonably expects that the application of the lease model to the portfolio would not differ materially from the application of the lease model to the individual leases in that portfolio. This approach can also be applied to other aspects of the leases guidance for which lessees/lessors need to make judgments and estimates, such as determining the discount rate and determining and reassessing the lease term.


• | Lease and non-lease components: As a practical expedient, a lessor may combine lease and non-lease components where the revenue recognition pattern is the same and where the lease component, when accounted for separately, would be considered an operating lease.

NOTE 2 - Inventories
Inventories consisted of the following (in thousands of dollars):

NOTE 3 - Property, Plant and Equipment 
Depreciation of assets is computed using the straight-line method over the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the respective assets or the lease term, if shorter. Depreciation expense and capital lease amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $44.9 million, $43.3 million and $76.3 million, respectively. A substantial portion of the Company’s tools are designed for specific applications in oil and gas exploration. Changes in industry drilling processes or technology could impact the estimated useful lives of the Company’s equipment. Gains recorded for assets lost in hole for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $5.4 million, $7.9 million and $4.1 million, respectively. Gain/(loss) related to the sale of PP&E for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $2.4 million, $2.6 million and ($5.4) million, respectively. 
Major classifications of PP&E and their respective useful lives were as follows (in thousands of dollars):

Long-Term Debt
Former Revolving Credit Facility
The Company had a revolving credit facility (“the Former Revolving Credit Facility”), which had a maximum borrowing facility of $110.0 million that was scheduled to mature on September 19, 2018. All obligations under the credit agreement for the Former Revolving Credit Facility were collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the Company. The Revolving Credit Facility’s credit agreement contained customary restrictive covenants that required the Company not to exceed or fall below two key ratios, a maximum loan to value ratio of 70% and a minimum liquidity of $7.5 million. In connection with the closing of the IPO on February 13, 2018, we fully repaid and terminated the Former Revolving Credit Facility. No early termination fees were incurred by the Company in connection with the termination of the Former Revolving Credit Facility. A loss on extinguishment of $0.3 million relating to unamortized deferred costs was recognized in interest expense, during the first quarter of 2018.
Former Term Loan
The Company also had a four-year, $40.0 million term loan agreement with a lending group, which included Geveran Investments Limited, Archer Holdco LLC and Robertson QES Investment LLC, an affiliate of Quintana Capital Group, L.P., that was scheduled to mature on December 19, 2020. The Former Term Loan agreement contained customary restrictive covenants that required the

QUINTANA ENERGY SERVICES INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Company not to exceed or fall below two key ratios, a maximum loan to value ratio of 77% and a minimum liquidity of $6.8 million. The interest rate on the unpaid principal was 10.0% interest per annum and accrued on a daily basis. At the end of each quarter all accrued and unpaid interest was paid in kind by capitalizing and adding to the outstanding principal balance. In connection with the closing of the IPO on February 13, 2018, the Former Term Loan was settled in full by cash and common shares in the Company. In connection with the settlement of the Former Term Loan, a prepayment fee of 3%, or approximately $1.3 million was paid. The prepayment fee is recorded as a loss on extinguishment and included within interest expense. The Company also recognized within interest expense $5.4 million of unamortized discount expense and $1.7 million of unamortized deferred financing cost in interest expense, during the first quarter of 2018.
New ABL Facility
In connection with the closing of the IPO on February 13, 2018, we entered into a new asset-based revolving credit agreement (the “New ABL Facility”) with each lender party thereto and Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent and collateral agent. The New ABL Facility replaced the Former Revolving Credit Facility, which was terminated in conjunction with the effectiveness of the New ABL Facility. The New ABL Facility provides for a $100.0 million revolving credit facility subject to a borrowing base. Upon closing of the New ABL Facility, the borrowing capacity was $77.6 million and $13.0 million was immediately drawn. The loan interest rate on the borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2018, was 5.3% and $29.5 million was outstanding and recorded as long term debt under the New ABL Facility as of December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2018, we had $13.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and $60.2 million available to draw on the New ABL Facility, which resulted in a total liquidity position of $74.0 million.
The New ABL Facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants, including financial reporting requirements and limitations on indebtedness, liens, mergers, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions, sales of assets, dividends and other restricted payments, investments (including acquisitions) and transactions with affiliates. Certain affirmative covenants, including certain reporting requirements and requirements to establish cash dominion accounts with the administrative agent, are triggered by failing to maintain availability under the New ABL Facility at or above specified thresholds or by the existence of an event of default under the New ABL Facility. The New ABL Facility provides for some exemptions to its negative covenants allowing the Company to make certain restricted payments and investments; subject to maintaining availability under the New ABL Facility at or above a specified threshold and the absence of a default.
The New ABL Facility contains a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0 that is triggered when availability under the New ABL Facility falls below a specified threshold and is tested until availability exceeds a separate specified threshold for 30 consecutive days.
The New ABL Facility contains events of default customary for facilities of this nature, including, but not limited, to: (i) events of default resulting from the Borrowers’ failure or the failure of any credit party to comply with covenants (including the above-referenced financial covenant during periods in which the financial covenant is tested); (ii) the occurrence of a change of control; (iii) the institution of insolvency or similar proceedings against the Borrowers or any credit party; and (iv) the occurrence of a default under any other material indebtedness the Borrowers or any guarantor may have. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default, subject to the terms and conditions of the New ABL Facility, the lenders will be able to declare any outstanding principal balance of our New ABL Facility, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable and exercise other remedies, including remedies against the collateral, as more particularly specified in the New ABL Facility. As of December 31, 2018 the Company was in compliance with debt covenants.
Capital Lease Obligations 
The Company has long-term lease agreements for a manufacturing and office facility for the operations of its Pressure Control segment in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and Elk City, Oklahoma. Each lease is accounted for as a capital lease. The lease for the facility in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma commenced in December 2006, creating a lease obligation of $3.3 million as of March 2007. The lease is payable monthly in amounts ranging from $28,000 to $31,000 over the lease term. The lease for the facility in Elk City, Oklahoma commenced in April 2007, creating a lease obligation of $2.9 million as of May 2008. The lease is payable monthly in amounts ranging from $25,000 to $27,000 over the lease term. 
The Company leases certain machinery and equipment, and service equipment under capital leases that were entered into during the year and expire in 2020. The capital lease obligation for the assets have a lease term of 36 months and an interest rate of 5.5%.

We are also authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, which may be issued in series with terms and conditions determined by our Board of Directors. All common units and warrants for common units have been converted to shares of common stock. No shares of preferred stock have been issued. 
NOTE 8 - Income Taxes
Quintana Energy Services LP was originally organized as a limited partnership and treated as a flow-through entity for federal and most state income tax purposes. As such, taxable income and any related tax credits were passed through to its members and included in their respective tax returns. As a result of the IPO and related Organizational Transactions, Quintana Energy Services, Inc. was formed as a corporation to hold all of the operational assets of Quintana Energy Services Inc. Due to the fact that Quintana Energy Services, Inc. is a taxable entity, the Company established a provision for deferred income taxes as of February 8, 2018. Accordingly, a provision for federal and state corporate income taxes has been made only for the operations of Quintana Energy Services, Inc. from February 8, 2018 through December 31, 2018 in the accompanying consolidated and combined financial statements.
As the Company does not operate internationally, income from continuing operations is sourced exclusively from the United States.
The provision for income taxes consisted of the following (in thousands of dollars):

On December 22, 2017, the US enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“US Tax Reform”), a comprehensive U.S. tax reform package that, effective January 1, 2018, among other things, lowered the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and moved the country toward a territorial tax system. Under ASC 740 “Income Taxes,” companies are required to recognize the effects of changes in tax laws and tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period in which the new legislation is enacted. As a result, all deferred tax assets and liabilities were appropriately measured at the effective rate. Our 2018 provision for income taxes includes the new provisions of US Tax Reform as enacted on January 1, 2018, based on authoritative and proposed guidance, issued by the Internal Revenue Service.
Deferred income taxes are provided to reflect the future tax consequences or benefits of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements using enacted tax rates. Deferred tax assets and liabilities were classified in the consolidated balance sheet as follows (in thousands of dollars):

Net deferred tax liability | $ | (130 | ) | | $ | (185 | ) | | $ | (135 | )

As of December 31, 2018, the Company had total U.S. federal tax net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of $93.5 million and state NOL carryforwards of $472.9 million. Of these amounts, for U.S. federal purposes, $77.9 million related to the Company’s current year federal tax loss, and the remaining $15.6 million was generated prior to the IPO transaction. In regard to the state NOL carryforwards, $472.3 million is related to the Company’s current year state tax losses and less than $0.6 million is related to periods prior to the IPO. As a result of the US Tax Reform enacted in January 2018, federal net operating losses generated after December 31, 2017 can be carried forward indefinitely. As such, the Company’s federal carryforwards of $15.6 million will begin to expire in 2029 and the remaining carryforwards have no expiration. The Company’s state NOL carryforwards will begin to expire in 2019.

ASC 740, "Income Taxes", requires the Company to reduce its deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. As a result of the Company’s evaluation of both the positive and negative evidence, the Company determined it does not believe it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will be utilized in the foreseeable future and has recorded a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance as of December 31, 2018 fully offsets the impact of the initial benefit recorded related to the formation of Quintana Energy Services, Inc. This initial deferred impact was recorded as an adjustment to equity due to a transaction between entities under common control. 
Changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets were as follows (in thousands of dollars):

There were no unrecognized tax positions or unrecognized tax benefits nor any accrued interest or penalties associated with unrecognized tax positions during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. The Company believes it has appropriate support for the income tax positions taken and to be taken on the Company's tax returns and its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter. The Company's tax returns are open to audit under the statute of limitations for the years ended December 31, 2015 through February 8, 2018 for federal tax purposes and for the years ended December 31, 2015 through December 31, 2017 for state tax purposes.

NOTE 10 - Business Concentration 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited because the Company performs credit evaluations, sets credit limits, and monitors the payment patterns of its customers. Cash balances on deposits with financial institutions, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company regularly monitors the institutions’ financial condition. 
The majority of the Company’s business is conducted with large, midsized, small, and independent oil and gas operators and exploration and production (“E&P”) companies. The Company evaluates the financial strength of customers and provide allowances for probable credit losses when deemed necessary. The market for the Company’s services is the oil and gas industry in the United States. This market has historically experienced significant volatility. 
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 one customer revenue represented 11.9% and 10.3% respectively, of the Company’s consolidated revenue. There were no customers whose revenue exceeded 10.0% of consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. 
As of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, one customer had a balance due that represented 10.7%, 18.3% and 11.2% respectively, of the Company’s consolidated accounts receivable.

Environmental Regulations & Liabilities
The Company is subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that establish standards and requirements for the protection of the environment. The Company continues to monitor the status of these laws and regulations. However, the Company cannot predict the future impact of such standards and requirements on its business, which are subject to change and can have retroactive effectiveness.
Currently, the Company has not been fined, cited or notified of any environmental violations or liabilities that would have a material adverse effect upon its consolidated financial position, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. However, management does recognize that by the very nature of its business, material costs could be incurred in the near term to maintain compliance. The amount of such future expenditures is not determinable due to several factors, including the unknown magnitude of possible regulation or liabilities, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions which may be required, the determination of the Company’s liability in proportion to other responsible parties and the extent to which such expenditures are recoverable from insurance or indemnification.
Litigation
The Company is a defendant or otherwise involved in a number of lawsuits in the ordinary course of business. Estimates of the range of liability related to pending litigation are made when the Company believes the amount and range of loss can be estimated and records its best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable. When a liability is probable, and there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range, the minimum estimated liability related to the lawsuits or claims is recorded. As additional information becomes available, the potential liability related to pending litigation and claims is assessed and the estimate is revised. Due to uncertainties related to the resolution of lawsuits and claims, the ultimate outcome may differ from estimates. The Company’s ultimate exposure with respect to pending lawsuits and claims is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
A class action has been filed against one of the Company’s subsidiaries alleging violations of state based wage and hour laws and the Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”) relating to non-payment of overtime pay. The Company believes its pay practices comply with the FLSA. The case is working its way through the various stages of the legal process, however, management believes the Company’s exposure is not material.
The Company is not aware of any other matters that may have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations.
NOTE 12 - Segment Information
QES currently has four reportable segments: Directional Drilling, Pressure Pumping, Pressure Control and Wireline. These segments have been selected based on the Company’s CODM assessment of resource allocation and performance. The Company considers its Chief Executive Officer to be its CODM. The CODM evaluates the performance of our segments based on revenue and income measures, which include non-GAAP measures.
Directional Drilling
Our Directional Drilling segment is comprised of directional drilling services, downhole navigational and rental tools businesses and support services, including well planning and site supervision, which assists customers in the drilling and placement of complex directional and horizontal wellbores. This segment utilizes its fleet of in-house positive pulse measurement-while-drilling navigational tools, mud motors and ancillary downhole tools, as well as electromagnetic navigational systems. The demand for these services tends to be influenced primarily by customer drilling-related activity levels. We provide directional drilling and associated services to E&P companies in many of the most active areas of onshore oil and natural gas development in the United States, including the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford Shale, Mid-Continent region (including the SCOOP/STACK), Marcellus/Utica Shale and DJ/Powder River Basin.
Pressure Pumping
Our Pressure Pumping segment provides hydraulic fracturing stimulation services, cementing services and acidizing services. The majority of the revenues generated in this segment are derived from pressure pumping services focused on fracturing, cementing and acidizing services in the Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountains regions. These pressure pumping and stimulation services are primarily used in the completion, production and maintenance of oil and gas wells. Customers for this segment include major E&P operators as well as independent oil and gas producers.

Pressure Control
Our Pressure Control segment supplies a wide variety of equipment, services and expertise in support of completion and workover operations throughout the United States. Its capabilities include coiled tubing, snubbing, fluid pumping, nitrogen, well control and other pressure control related services. Our Pressure Control equipment is tailored to the unconventional resources market with the ability to operate under high pressures without having to delay or cease production during completion operations. We provide our pressure control services primarily in the Mid-Continent region (including the SCOOP/STACK), Eagle Ford Shale, Permian Basin, Marcellus/Utica Shale, DJ/Powder River Basin, Haynesville Shale, Fayetteville Shale and Williston Basins (including the Bakken Shale).
Wireline
Our Wireline segment provides new well wireline conveyed tight-shale reservoir perforating services across many of the major U.S. shale basins and also offers a range of services such as cased-hole investigation and production logging services, conventional wireline and tubing conveyed perforating services, mechanical services and pipe recovery services. These services are offered in both new well completions and for remedial work. The majority of the revenues generated in our Wireline segment are derived from the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford Shale, Mid-Continent region (including the SCOOP/STACK), Haynesville Shale and East Texas Basin as well as in industrial and petrochemical facilities.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA
The Company views Adjusted EBITDA as an important indicator of segment performance. The Company defines Segment Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, net (gain) loss on disposition of assets - excluding (gain) loss of lost in hole assets, stock based compensation, transaction expenses, rebranding expenses, settlement expenses, severance expenses and equipment stand-up expense. The CODM uses Segment Adjusted EBITDA as the primary measure of segment operating performance.

NOTE 13 - Stock-Based Compensation
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had three types of stock-based compensation under the Company's 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan (i) restricted stock awards ("RSA") issued to directors (ii) restricted stock units (“RSU”) issued to executive officers and other key employees and (iii) performance stock units (“PSU”), which are RSUs with performance requirements, issued to executive officers and other senior management. Stock-based compensation issued prior to the Company’s IPO was subject to a dual component, one of which was the consummation of a specified transaction, which included a public offering. As the public offering occurred on February 7, 2018, there was no stock-based compensation expense recognized in periods prior to the IPO.
The following table summarizes stock-based compensation costs for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands of dollars):

i. | Restricted Stock Awards

In March 2018, the Company's Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved the issuance of RSAs to the Company's non-executive directors. During the second quarter 2018, we granted 57,145 RSAs, which had a grant date fair value of $8.75 per share. The stock awards fully vest on the anniversary date of the Company’s IPO. RSAs were not granted in the first, third or fourth quarter of 2018.

For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized $0.4 million and zero of non-cash stock compensation expense into earnings, respectively, which is presented within selling, general and administration expense in the consolidated statement of operations. 
As of December 31, 2018, the total unamortized compensation costs related to the non-executive RSAs was $0.1 million, which the Company expects to recognize over the remaining vesting period of 0.1 years.
ii.Restricted Stock Units
During the second quarter 2018, executive officers and key employees were granted a total of 476,042 RSUs under the 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan. These RSUs vest ratably over a three-year service condition with one-third vesting on each anniversary of the Company’s IPO provided that the employee remains employed by the Company at the applicable vesting date. RSUs were not granted in the first, third or fourth quarter of 2018.
The Company recognized these RSUs at fair value based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. The compensation expense associated with these RSUs will be amortized into income on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. 
Total RSU non-cash stock based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, was $16.3 million and zero, which is presented within selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 total unamortized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock units were $16.9 million and $28.9 million, respectively.
A summary of the status and changes during the year ended December 31, 2018 of the Company’s shares of non-vested RSUs is as follows:

 | Number of Shares(in thousands) | | Grant Date FairValue per Share | | Weighted AverageRemaining Life(in years)

Outstanding at December 31, 2018 | 1,551 | | | 15.74 | | 2.36

iii.Performance Stock Units
During the second quarter 2018, executive officers and senior management were granted a total of 425,083 PSUs under the 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The PSUs are subject to both a performance and time vesting requirement. The PSUs require the achievement of a certain performance as measured on December 31, 2018, based on (i) the Company’s performance with respect to relative total stockholder return and (ii) the Company’s performance with respect to absolute total stockholder return. Any PSUs that have not been earned at the end of a performance period are forfeited. Should the grantee satisfy the service requirement applicable to such earned performance share unit, vesting shall occur in equal installments on the first three anniversaries of the Company’s IPO.
The Company recognized these PSUs at the fair value determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The compensation expense associated with these PSUs will be amortized into income on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. For the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized $1.2 million and zero of non-cash stock compensation expense into
