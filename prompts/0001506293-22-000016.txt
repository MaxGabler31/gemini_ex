Item 1. Business
Overview
Our mission is to bring everyone the inspiration to create a life they love.
Pinterest is where over 400 million people around the world go to get inspiration to live their best lives. They come to discover and bring to life ideas for their daily activities like cooking dinner or deciding what to wear; for major commitments like remodeling a house or training for a marathon; for ongoing passions like gardening or fashion; and for milestone events like planning a wedding or a dream vacation.
Our users (who we call Pinners) often don’t have the words to describe what they want, but they know it when they see it. Images and video can communicate concepts that are impossible to describe with words. On Pinterest, people discover inspiring and personalized visual content, which we call Pins. Pins are created when Pinners, creators and businesses make new content for or save existing web content to our platform. Pins are saved and organized into collections, which we call boards and sections. Browsing and saving visual ideas on our service helps Pinners imagine what their future could look like, which propels them from inspiration to action.
Pinterest is the productivity tool for planning your dreams. Dreaming and productivity may seem like polar opposites, but on Pinterest, inspiration enables action and dreams become reality. Visualizing the future helps bring it to life. In this way, Pinterest is unique. Most consumer internet companies are either tools (search, ecommerce) or media (newsfeeds, video, social networks). Pinterest is not a pure media channel; it is a media-rich utility.
Pinterest is also unique because we've designed it to be an inspiring platform, that we foster through our policies and product development -- for example, Pinterest has banned political and weight loss ads, developed inclusive beauty search functionality and launched compassionate search for Pinners seeking mental health support. This work is foundational to our mission because we believe people are less likely to imagine their future and bring it to life when they feel self-conscious, excluded, or unhappy. It also creates value for businesses and brands on the platform (including our advertising partners), who have the opportunity to showcase their products and services in an inspiring environment that we believe is conducive to building an emotional connection with consumers.
Our Platform
When people use Pinterest, they interact with several surfaces, each of which offer distinct functionalities and experiences. Pinners often move between these surfaces multiple times in a single session.
Home Feed
When people open the Pinterest mobile application or navigate to www.pinterest.com, they are by default in their Home Feed, where they can discover Pins relevant to their tastes and interests in a scrolling format. We have several types of Pins on our platform, including:
•Standard Pins: Static images that link to content from around the web highlighting products, recipes, style and home inspiration, DIY, and more.
•Video Pins: Short videos from businesses that link to content from around the web on topics like cooking, beauty and DIY projects.
•Product Pins: Product Pins feature items from our catalog inventory that can be purchased and include metadata on prices and stock availability as well as links to the product page of a retailer’s website.
•Idea Pins: Idea Pins are multi-pages of videos, images, text and lists that are natively created on Pinterest. This format enables creators to show how to bring ideas to life (e.g. how to cook a meal or design a room).
Pinners can choose between two different Home Feed experiences: Browse or Watch. The “Browse” tab is Pinterest’s traditional inspiration feed (consisting of a two column grid featuring a variety of Standard, Video, Product and Idea Pins), while the “Watch” tab is an immersive feed of full-screen, auto-playing Idea Pins.
Both Browse and Watch are powered by machine learning recommendations that dynamically reflect the taste and interests of each Pinner. Pinners using these tabs will also see Pins from the people, topics and boards they choose to follow. 
Search and Shop
On the Search surface, Pinners can find Pins, boards, creators and brands by typing a query in the search bar. Pinners can choose to view their search results on an Explore tab or a Shop tab. Explore results include relevant Pins personalized for the Pinner’s individual taste, while Shop results include relevant Product Pins that are shoppable and link to a retailer’s product page. Pinners who use search typically want to see many relevant possibilities that are personalized for their individual taste and interests rather than one perfect answer. The Explore and Shop tabs include search guides that help narrow results (e.g., a search for “summer outfits” yields search guides titled “beachy,” “monochromatic,” and “vintage”). 
Searches on Pinterest also happen when a Pinner taps on a Pin on any surface to learn more about an idea or image, and a feed of visually similar Pins is served beneath the tapped image. These related Pins help Pinners springboard off a point of inspiration to explore deeper into an interest or narrow in on the perfect product. Pinners also visually search within images by using our Lens tool to select specific objects inside an inspiring scene e.g., a lamp in a living room scene or a pair of shoes in a street fashion scene. This action automatically triggers a new search that yields related Pins that are visually similar to the specific object and that may be shoppable. This experience is powered by years of investments in computer vision (that can identify objects and attributes within scenes) as well as by our growing catalog of shoppable inventory.
Create
Users can publish content on Pinterest by making Idea Pins. Pinners can also respond to creator's content with a take - an Idea Pin generated in response to an original Idea Pin. Our publishing tools encourage the development of content that features long-lasting, actionable ideas rather than stories designed for ephemeral entertainment. Idea Pins give creators all the elements they need to tell their story, from in-app video recording to made-for-doing publishing features like instructions and ingredient templates. Idea Pins show up in many places on Pinterest - featured prominently in home feed, in the search, on creator profiles and more. Features like Try on and product tagging are also enabled in Idea Pins, making the content even more actionable and shoppable.
Our Advertising Products
Pinterest reaches over 400 million monthly active users, a significant majority of which are women. We believe the value of Pinterest’s audience to advertisers is driven not merely by the number of Pinners on our platform or their demographics, but also by when and why they use Pinterest. People use Pinterest in ways that, when taken together, can make it uniquely valuable to advertisers.
First, Pinners often come to the platform with an intent to purchase goods or services. Getting inspiration for your home, your style or your travel typically means that you are actively looking for products and services to buy. Commercial content from brands, retailers and advertisers is central to Pinterest. This means that relevant ads don’t compete with native content on Pinterest; instead, they are content. Second, we believe that in-market consumers on Pinterest tend to be early in their journey toward a purchase and don’t yet know what they want to purchase. Accordingly, we believe that they are open to discovering new products and brands on Pinterest rather than merely navigating to brands they already know, as is common on traditional search engines and e-commerce platforms. 
We offer both brand and performance ads, with performance representing approximately two-thirds of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. Brand revenue is billed when an advertiser optimizes an ad campaign around “brand” objectives like impressions or video views. Performance revenue is billed when an advertiser optimizes an ad campaign around “performance” objectives like clicks or conversion events.
Because Pinners travel down the entire purchasing funnel on Pinterest, our ad product suite is used by different advertisers to meet different objectives, including awareness, consideration and sales. Many advertisers use multiple ad objectives simultaneously to achieve their goals on the platform.
Awareness Objective.
Pinterest ads appear in the home feed and on search results pages. They echo the visual style of organic Pins and are fully integrated into the design. A Pinner sees ads as he scrolls through her home feed and search results, looking for inspiration and ideas.
Consideration and Sales Objectives.
When a Pinner clicks on an ad, he sees an intermediate screen that gives him a closer view of the ad creative as well as the option to save the ad to a board. He will also be able to swipe up or click to see the advertiser’s online presence, where he can pursue deeper consideration (by exploring available products and services or signing-up for memberships) and potentially transact.
Ad Formats
•Standard ad: A static image used to showcase content in a simple vertical image format.
•Video ad: Used by advertisers to capture attention and tell a story with a visually engaging format. We currently offer three video ad formats: standard video, performance video and max width video.
•Shopping ad: Similar to a standard ad, used to reach people when they are deciding what to buy. Shopping ads are exclusive to advertisers who upload their product catalog to Pinterest. 
•Carousel ad: Multiple static or video in one carousel, used by advertisers to showcase more than one image or video at a time.
•Collection ad: Used by advertisers to display products in action with a hybrid format that mixes lifestyle imagery and video with featured products.
•Idea ad: An Idea ad is an Idea Pin that has been created and promoted by a business. Idea ads can be used in conjunction with a paid partnership tag from a creator the brand has partnered with. These features are currently in beta.
Our Advertising System
Ad Auction
All advertisers on Pinterest buy ads through an auction-based system. Our ad auction allows us to serve ads to Pinners at relevant moments while optimizing business outcomes for advertisers. Today, our advertisers can optimize their campaigns around four different types of user activity depending on their objectives: impressions ("CPM"), video views ("CPV"), clicks ("CPC"), and conversion events ("oCPM"), such as checkout or add-to-cart.
Our auction system selects the best ad for each available ad impression, based on the likelihood of a desired action occurring and how much that action is worth to advertisers. The likelihood of the action occurring depends on a variety of factors, such as ad relevance and creative quality.
Ad Relevance
Because ads are content on Pinterest, ad relevance is powered by the same principles that drive organic recommendations. 
Advertisers can also target their ads to specific demographics (locations, languages, gender, age), device types, audiences (such as existing customers or Pinners who recently engaged with their content) and interests or keywords. Additionally, they can choose whether they want ads to show in Pinners’ search surfaces, home feed or both.
We are building ad products that will allow advertisers to target ads based on a particular consumer’s known aesthetic preferences and style. Eventually we expect to be able to leverage this Pinterest taste graph to match ad creative to a Pinner’s individual taste and interests.
Measurement
Measuring the effectiveness of digital spend is a high priority for our advertisers. Our measurement solutions are aligned to help advertisers recognize the value of an investment on our platform across a variety of objectives. We enable our advertisers to meet their awareness, consideration and conversion objectives with a number of first-party 
tools to measure campaign effectiveness. We also have leading third-party measurement partners to validate Pinterest’s performance and measure advertiser results.
Sales and Marketing
Our Go-to-Market Approach
The Pinterest platform enables a diverse group of advertisers to achieve a wide range of objectives. We serve these advertisers in customized ways depending on their size, sophistication and objectives. We initially built our business with large consumer packaged goods ("CPG") and retail advertisers in the United States. While this group of advertisers continues to be a significant driver of our business, we are increasingly focused on building products and tools to serve mid-sized and small advertisers across a wide range of verticals. This means improving the efficiency of our ads marketplace, using more automation to optimize for advertiser value, and more effectively measuring the unique value of advertising on Pinterest. We are also focused on expanding our international advertiser base.
Marketing
To date, we have been able to grow our global user base with relatively low marketing costs given the strength of our global brand, the utility of our service and unpaid traffic from search engines. We are also continuing to explore paid marketing efforts, including brand marketing for awareness and comprehension, as well as marketing campaigns focused on user and advertiser acquisition.
Our Technology Innovation
We believe we have one of the largest image-rich data sets ever assembled. This lets us analyze trends, understand intent and predict consumer behavior. And, we are just scratching the surface of what is possible. Looking ahead, we are excited about new technical challenges, including fine-grained image recognition, object-to-object visual search and large-scale visual search infrastructure.
Our Competition
We primarily compete with consumer internet companies that are either tools (search, ecommerce) or media (newsfeeds, video, social networks). We compete with companies that are larger and more established such as Amazon, Facebook (including Instagram), Google (including YouTube), Snap, TikTok and Twitter. Many of these companies have significantly greater financial and human resources. We also face competition from smaller companies in one or more high-value verticals, including Allrecipes, Houzz and Tastemade, that offer users engaging content and commerce opportunities through similar technology or products to ours. We remain focused on emerging competition as well. We face competition across almost every aspect of our business, particularly users and engagement, creators, advertising and talent.
Users and Engagement
We compete to attract, engage and retain users and their time and attention. Because our products and those of our competitors are typically free, we compete based on our brand, product experience, quality, utility and ease of use of our products. For more information on users and engagement trends, see section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Creators
We compete with other platforms to attract, retain and grow our base of creators. We are building tools to help creators publish the most visually inspiring, actionable content and developing reward programs to help them build an audience and a business on Pinterest. However, there are other internet companies that are larger or have been investing in the creator ecosystem through large reward programs, product innovation, and video infrastructure.
Advertising
We compete for advertising revenue across a variety of formats. We believe our ability to compete effectively depends on the effectiveness of our service in reaching users early in the decision-making process, amplifying advertisers’ messages and delivering compelling returns on investment. This is driven by a number of factors, including our reach, relevance and engagement, as well as our brand and advertising products, delivery and measurement capabilities and other offerings. For more information on trends relating to advertising revenue and growth, see section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Talent
We compete to attract and retain highly talented individuals, particularly people with expertise in computer vision, artificial intelligence and machine learning. We believe we compete for these potential employees by providing a work environment that offers the opportunity to work on challenging, cutting-edge and inspirational products. For more information, see “Talent Management and Development” below.
Intellectual Property
Our success is tied in part to our ability to protect our intellectual property and key technological innovations. We rely on a combination of federal, state and common-law rights in the United States and rights under the laws of other countries, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, domain names and other intellectual property rights to help protect our brand and proprietary technologies. In addition, we generally enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with other third parties, in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our confidential information and proprietary technology and to preserve our rights thereto.
As of December 31, 2021, we had over 360 issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States and foreign countries relating to aspects of our actual or contemplated operations and technologies. We also had over 580 registered trademarks and trademark applications in the United States and foreign countries, including our “Pinterest” name and related logos. 
We are also dependent on third-party content, technology and intellectual property in connection with our business.
We are presently involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits, and expect to continue to face allegations from third parties, including our competitors and “non-practicing entities,” that we have infringed or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights.
For additional information on risks relating to intellectual property, please see the sections titled “Risk Factors” and “—Legal Proceedings.”
Government Regulation
We are subject to many U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business, including laws and regulations that involve data privacy and data protection, intellectual property (including copyright and patent laws), content regulation, rights of publicity, advertising, marketing, health and safety, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, taxation, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and corruption, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions or securities law compliance. Our business may also be affected by the adoption of any new or existing laws or regulations or changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the internet, or that significantly restrict or impose conditions on our ability to collect, store, augment, analyze, use and share data or increase consumer notice or consent requirements before a company can utilize cookies or other tracking technologies or that increase the liability of content platforms like us. Many relevant laws and regulations are still evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created or amended in a manner that could harm our business, and new laws and regulations may be enacted, including in connection with the restriction or prohibition of certain content or business activities. For example, EU member states are in the process of implementing the EU Copyright Directive, which may impose significant new burdens on content platforms like us.
We rely on a variety of statutory and common-law frameworks and defenses relevant to the content available on our service, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”), the Communications Decency Act (“CDA”) and the fair-use doctrine in the United States, and the Electronic Commerce Directive in the European Union. In addition, various countries around the world have adopted and pending legislations, including the forthcoming Digital Services Act in the European Union, that may impose additional obligations or liability on us associated with content uploaded by users to our platform. 
We receive, process, store, use and share data, some of which contains personal information. We are therefore subject to U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding data privacy and the collection, storage, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other data from users, employees or business partners, including the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). These laws expand the rights of individuals to control how their personal data is processed, collected, used and shared, creates new regulatory and operational requirements for processing personal 
data, increases requirements for security and confidentiality and provides for significant penalties for non-compliance. There are also a number of legislative proposals recently enacted or pending before the U.S. Congress, various state legislatures and foreign governments concerning content regulation and data protection that could affect us. These and other laws and regulations that may be enacted, or new interpretation of existing laws and regulations, may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs in order to comply.
Government authorities outside the United States may also seek to restrict access to or block our service, prohibit or block the hosting of certain content available through our service or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility or usability of our service in that country for a period of time or even indefinitely. For example, access to our service has been or is currently restricted in whole or in part in China, India, Kazakhstan and Turkey. In addition, some countries have enacted laws that allow websites to be blocked for hosting certain types of content or may require websites to remove certain restricted content.
For additional information, see the sections titled “Risk Factors” and “—Legal Proceedings.”
Seasonality 
We have historically experienced seasonality in user growth, engagement and monetization on our platform. Historically, we have had lower engagement in the second calendar quarter and industry advertising spend tends to be strongest in the fourth quarter. We did not experience typical seasonal trends in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We do not know when we will return to our typical seasonal trends in the future.
Talent Management and Development
In order to fulfill our mission of bringing everyone the inspiration to create a life they love, we strive to attract and retain top talent. To attract and retain great talent, we strive to create opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by competitive compensation, benefits and health and wellness programs, and by programs that build connections between our employees and their communities. As of December 31, 2021, we had 3,225 full-time employees. 
Inclusion and Diversity
We strive to create an inclusive and diverse workplace where employees are empowered to bring their whole, authentic selves to work every day. We seek for and respect diverse perspectives which can only help us create a more inclusive and diverse product.
We seek inclusion and diversity at the highest level in our organization. Our board of directors includes directors from various backgrounds, industries, skills and experience. Our board of nine directors, which is comprised of seven independent directors, three women and is racially diverse. Our leadership team includes leaders with diverse skills, experience, racial backgrounds and genders. 
Annually, we’ve published a diversity report since 2015 which we make publicly available on our website. We believe it is important to hold ourselves accountable to creating a diverse workforce. Our diversity report currently includes our annual hiring goals and how we performed against the goals and our workforce demographic data.
We have also created employee resource groups that are aligned around dimensions of diversity, such as gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation or other shared attributes, which we believe help build community and enable opportunities for development.
In June 2020, subsequent to concerns raised by current and former employees, our board of directors established a Special Committee of the board of directors to independently review Pinterest’s workplace culture and develop recommendations to further support an inclusive, fair, and respectful workplace. In December 2020, we began implementing the recommendations of the Special Committee. Amongst other initiatives, we launched an ombuds program intended to give every employee the opportunity to engage confidentially with neutral, trained professionals for independent support resolving conflicts in the workplace.
Employee health, safety and benefits
The success of our business is fundamentally tied to the well-being of our people. We are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of flexible and convenient health and wellness programs that support their physical and mental health by providing tools and 
resources to help them improve or maintain their health. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations. This includes currently having the vast majority of our employees work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work.
We provide robust compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to salaries, these programs (which vary by country/region) include equity awards, a 401(k) Plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, flexible paid time off, family leave, family care resources, flexible work schedules, employee assistance programs and charitable donation matching, among many others. We continue to review and update our compensation and benefits. For example, we recently enhanced our family leave benefits for birthing and adoptive parents effective January 1, 2022 and increased our 401(k) matching limits. 
Learning and development
We help our employees create a career that is inspiring, impactful and ultimately time well spent. We have programs for open and ongoing conversation towards career growth goals both long term and short term. We also have workshops dedicated to learning new skills and developing an employee’s career. We set aside a dedicated personal learning and development budget for every employee.
