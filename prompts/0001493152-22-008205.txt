ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 
We are a late-stage biotechnology company focused on the clinical development and commercialization of angiogenic gene therapy biotherapeutics for strategic niche markets primarily for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Our technology platform is designed to biologically activate the human body’s innate angiogenic healing process to stimulate the growth of microvascular networks for patients with ischemic cardiovascular, cerebral, and other medical conditions and diseases, as well as for advanced tissue engineering applications.
 
Our lead product candidate Generx [Ad5FGF-4] is an angiogenic gene therapy product candidate designed for medical revascularization for the potential treatment of patients with myocardial ischemia and refractory angina due to advanced coronary artery disease. Generx has been cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for a Phase 3 clinical study—the AFFIRM study. We have been working to secure the funding necessary to conduct that clinical trial and, if successful, commercialize Generx for marketing and sale in the U.S.
 
The Generx product candidate has been under clinical development for over a decade. Our management and consulting team have been responsible for the development of Generx from the initial scientific discoveries by researchers at the University of California, San Diego, through the first in-man U.S.-based clinical studies and late-stage clinical studies, the acquisition of the Generx development program by Schering AG following the successful completion of a five-year strategic partnership, and the re-acquisition of the Generx development program by Gene Biotherapeutics after Schering AG was acquired by Bayer Healthcare. Generx represents one of only a few cardiovascular DNA-based therapeutic product candidates to successfully advance into late-stage, U.S. Phase 3 clinical study.
 
History
 
We were incorporated in Delaware in 2003. In 2006, we changed our name to Cardium Therapeutics Inc. In 2013, we changed the Company’s name to Taxus Cardium Pharmaceuticals Group Inc. to reflect a broadened business plan to include small molecule drugs and medical devices. Based on the refocus of the Company on the clinical development of DNA-based angiogenic therapeutics in 2018, we changed the name of the Company to Gene Biotherapeutics Inc.

During the period covered by this report, our operations have been conducted principally through operating subsidiaries including the following:
 

● | Angionetics, Inc., an 85% owned subsidiary focused on the late-stage clinical development and commercialization of Generx, an angiogenic gene therapy product candidate designed for medical revascularization for the potential treatment of patients with myocardial ischemia and refractory angina due to advanced coronary artery disease: 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Activation Therapeutics, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary focused on the development and commercialization of Excellagen®, a patented U.S. FDA-cleared wound conforming matrix for advanced wound care. 

 
We entered 2020 in a cash constrained position. At that time, our principal operating goal was to secure the capital necessary to advance the clinical development and commercialization of Generx. In April 2020, we transferred our residual rights in Excellagen to Shanxi Taxus Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd. (“Shanxi”) in exchange for the release of any rights or claims in ownership interest in Gene Biotherapeutics. In connection with this transaction, Shanxi agreed to apply its previously funded $600,000 common stock subscription payment as cash consideration in exchange for the Excellagen ownership rights. Shanxi also released any future rights or claims against us.
 
On April 10, 2020, our Angionetics, Inc. subsidiary entered into a Distribution and License Agreement with Shanxi (as amended, the “Shanxi License Agreement”), granting Shanxi certain license rights with respect to our Generx product candidate. The distribution and license rights commence only after we obtain U.S. FDA approval for marketing and sale of Generx in the United States. The license rights include (a) a non-exclusive right to manufacture Generx products in China, and (b) an exclusive right to market and sell Generx products in Singapore, Macau, Hong Kong, Taiwan, any other municipality other than mainland China where Chinese (Mandarin or Cantonese) is the common language, the Russian Federation, and the Commonwealth of Independent States (the “CIS”). The Shanxi License Agreement provides for a progress royalty ranging from 5% up to 10% based on annual net sales up to and including $50 million at 5%; 6% for sales ranging greater than $50 million to $200 million; 8% for sales greater than $200 million to $450 million and at 10% for any sales greater than $450 million of the Generx product sold by Shanxi in the licensed territory.
 
In May 2020, we entered into a Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement with Nostrum Pharmaceuticals, LLC (“Nostrum”), selling Nostrum 1,700,000 shares of our newly authorized Series B Convertible Preferred Stock in exchange for $1,700,000. Each share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of Common Stock at a conversion ratio of 0.0113. Consequently the 1,700,000 shares are convertible into an aggregate of 150,442,478 shares of Common Stock In addition, Nostrum entered into an agreement with Sabby Healthcare Master Fund Ltd. (“Sabby”), the sole holder of our outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, under which Nostrum purchased 220 shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock from Sabby, which is convertible into 19,469,026 shares of Common Stock. Nostrum also agreed to purchase up to 570 additional Series A Convertible Preferred Stock from Sabby, within one year following the effective date of the transaction. Since May 2020 through April 30, 2021, that includes a subsequent reporting period, Sabby had fully converted its 570 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, into 50,442,491shares of our Common Stock that has increased our outstanding Common Stock to 64,931,888 shares as of December 31, 2021.
 
Subsequently, during the 2021 calendar year, Nostrum made additional capital contributions to the Company totaling $371,080, which are convertible into 32,838,938 shares of Common Stock. After giving effect for issuance of these of the issuance these shares into Common Stock and the conversion of the Series A and Series B Convertible Preferred Stocks, Nostrum would beneficially own 202,750,442 shares of the Common Stock, representing 75.7% of the Company, and other shares of issued and outstanding Common Stock totals 64,931,888, representing 24.3% of the total outstanding shares of Common Stock, as of March 15, 2022.
 
Nostrum is the parent company of Nostrum Laboratories, Inc., a privately held pharmaceutical company engaged in the formulation and commercialization of specialty pharmaceutical products and controlled release, orally administered, branded and generic drug products. We have used the proceeds from the sale of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock to fund working capital requirements in preparation for conducting the U.S. FDA-approved Phase 3 clinical trial for our Generx product candidate, and a portion of these proceeds will be used to satisfy SEC quarterly and annual filing requirements. We believe that Nostrum’s assets and experience in the formulation and commercialization of pharmaceutical products will facilitate the administration and completion of the Phase 3 clinical trial for Generx on a cost-effective basis.
 
In March 2021, after the period covered by this report, the Company entered into an agreement with FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies (“FDB”) to manufacture the Generx [Ad5FGF-4] angiogenic gene therapy product candidate for Phase 3 clinical evaluation for the treatment of refractory angina due to late-stage coronary artery disease. Manufacturing operations will be conducted at FDB’s facilities in College Station, Texas where FDB will perform technology transfer and process development activities for Phase 3 clinical and commercial-scale GMP manufacturing of Generx. The required funding for the Fuji agreement is approximately $3.8 million. At present, we do not have the requisite financial resources to initiate FDB’s manufacturing of Generx [Ad5FGF-4] necessary to the conduct of the planned FDA-cleared Phase 3 clinical study. We are currently evaluating alternative financing arrangements, but there are no agreements in place for such financing at this time. As a result, we are unable to provide a start date for the initiation of the planned FDA-cleared Phase 3 AFFIRM clinical study.

The Generx [Ad5FGF-4] Product Candidate
 
Our lead product candidate, Generx, is a first in class, single dose, angiogenic gene therapy product candidate that is designed to improve blood flow and to increase the supply of oxygenated blood in patients with refractory angina and myocardial ischemia due to advanced coronary artery disease. Generx has been designed to improve cardiac perfusion by promoting the formation of functional coronary collateral blood vessels within the heart through enlargement of existing arterioles (arteriogenesis) and formation on new capillary vessels (angiogenesis). This process, termed “medical revascularization,” represents a fundamentally new mechanism of action that involves the stimulation of the formation of new biological structures in the heart, as opposed to currently available pharmacologic therapies, which only address the symptoms of angina, or mechanical revascularization through surgical procedures involving stents or coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
Medical Revascularization for Refractory Angina
 

The Ad5FGF-4 product candidate requires three key elements: (1) a myocardial delivery vector, (2) a therapeutic transgene, and (3) a method of gene delivery. Generx is biologically engineered using an E1-region deleted, replication deficient adenovirus serotype 5 vector to deliver the 621 base pair gene encoding human fibroblast growth factor-4 (FGF-4) under the control of a modified cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. Adenovirus is one of the most well-characterized and widely used gene therapy vectors in preclinical and human clinical studies and has cGMP (defined below) manufacturing and testing standards established by the U.S. FDA. The Generx FGF-4 transgene has been engineered to include a signal peptide, which enables effective secretion from cells that express the protein (such as cardiac myocytes). Our preclinical studies have shown that therapeutic efficacy is significantly increased by the presence of such a signal sequence in the growth factor DNA construct. [Gao et al., Human Gene Therapy 2005; 16:1058-64]. The CMV promoter can drive high levels of transgene protein expression in transfected cells for up to 3 weeks. This short-term expression is ideal for tissue regeneration clinical applications requiring generation of new biological structures, including promotion of new vessel growth in the heart.
 
The transfected heart cells then express and release FGF-4 protein, which we believe promotes the growth of new blood vessels and increased blood flow to ischemic heart tissue. The evidence shows that FGF-4 expressed by Ad5FGF-4 has the capacity to enlarge pre-existing collateral arterioles (arteriogenesis) and to form new capillary vessels (angiogenesis) when driven by cardiac hemodynamic-impairment and ischemic stimuli. In a pig model of myocardial ischemia, adenovirus mediated FGF gene therapy promoted increased regional myocardial blood flow, as measured by contrast echocardiography, that correlated with an increase in capillary number, determined by histologic assessment. Stimulation of angiogenesis by Ad5FGF-4 has also been demonstrated in an in vitro assay that recapitulates all phases of the in vivo angiogenesis process and provides a functional bioassay for Ad5FGF-4. This assay demonstrates a synergistic interaction between FGF-4 expressed by Ad5FGF-4, and endogenous vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the promotion of neo-vessel formation, with evidence that FGF-4 controls angiogenesis upstream of VEGF. FGF-4 appears to be a key angiogenic regulatory protein that stimulates the release and action of other angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factors (PDGF), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), to orchestrate and promote the growth of a functional collateral network in ischemic cardiac tissue.

Generx is administered to patients during a simple one-hour angiogram-like procedure by an interventional cardiologist using a standard cardiac balloon catheter, with no special training or new medical devices required. Generx is distributed into the microvascular pathways of the heart and transfects cardiac cells by binding to cell surface coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptors (CAR). A central finding from the Generx clinical development program is that cardiac ischemia drives Generx transfection into heart cells and possibly other cells, and that regional cardiac ischemia is an essential precursor to support the growth of collateral blood vessels for treatment response to Generx angiogenic gene therapy. Company-sponsored in vivo pre-clinical research conducted at Emory University demonstrated that intracoronary Ad5-based gene delivery under conditions of transient ischemia, and following pre-treatment with nitroglycerin, significantly enhances transgene expression in the heart by over two orders of magnitude (>800x), as compared to prior intracoronary delivery methods. We believe that the significant improvements in gene transfer are likely due to ischemia-driven up-regulation of the cardiac CAR receptors and improved transit through dilated gap junctions due to enhanced cell permeability that is believed to be activated using nitroglycerin.
 
The Generx regulatory dossier represents one of the most extensive and advanced DNA-based clinical data platforms ever compiled. In multiple prior clinical studies, the Generx product candidate appears safe and well-tolerated, and has generated preliminary findings of efficacy in men and women, in measures of cardiac perfusion, exercise capacity, and angina status. Specifically, Generx has been evaluated as a treatment for patients with refractory angina in four prior FDA-cleared, multi-center, randomized and placebo-controlled clinical studies (AGENT 1-4, Phase 1/2 to Phase 2b/3) and one small international study (ASPIRE). These studies combined enrolled over 680 patients at over 100 medical centers in the U.S. and Western Europe and have generated over 2,500 patient years of safety data. Generx has now been cleared by the FDA for a Phase 3 clinical study to further evaluate safety and definitive efficacy. The Phase 3 study will include study sites in the United States and Eastern Europe, and in Japan with an appropriate Japanese strategic partner.
 
Addressable Refractory Angina Market
 
Generx is expected to initially target patients with refractory angina—chronic and disabling angina that: (1) are no longer responsive to small molecule anti-anginal drug therapy, (2) would not expect to benefit from mechanical revascularization procedures, including stents and coronary artery bypass graft surgery; or (3) continue to experience refractory angina following a mechanical revascularization procedure. Compared to the general population, patients with refractory angina report higher rates of depression, loss of vitality, diminished physical function and overall health, and an overall reduced quality of life. Over 70% of patients with refractory angina can expect to live approximately nine years from the time of diagnosis. We estimate that there are up to 1.2 million patients in the U.S. with refractory angina, representing up to a $6.0 billion addressable market opportunity, and up to $20.0 billion worldwide. Based on the number of newly diagnosed patients with refractory angina each year in the U.S., the number of patients newly treated with mechanical revascularizations, who continue to experience persistent uncontrolled refractory angina following bypass surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention, and the number of non-actionable diagnostic angiograms, the Company believes that each year in the U.S. there are an estimated 760,000 new patients who could potentially benefit from a one-time administration of Generx [Ad5FGF-4] medical revascularization product candidate.

Proposed Generx Treatment Algorithm for Patients with Refractory Angina
 

Consistent with Positioning in FDA-Cleared U.S. Phase 3 Clinical Trial
 

(1) | Range 0.6M – 1.8M [mean 1.2M] McGillion et al., Canadian J Cardiology 28:S20-S41 (2012) other figures, Benjamin et al., Circulation, American Heart Association, Statistics 2017. 
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Given the widespread use of lipid-lowering drugs in the general population in the U.S., and increasingly worldwide, we now see more patients reporting angina with little or no evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease based on angiographic diagnostics. In the past 10 years, the number of ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction patients has fallen by 50%, bypass surgery is down 40%, and the use of stents has been reduced by 30%. We believe that this trend away from mechanical revascularization will potentially increase the opportunity for Generx medical revascularization.
 
The most recently FDA approved anti-anginal drug with a novel mechanism of action is Ranexa® (ranolazine). It was FDA approved in 2006 as a treatment for chronic angina as a metabolic modulator designed to reduce the heart’s oxygen demand. Following FDA approval, Ranexa was acquired by Gilead Sciences for $1.4 billion in 2009. Ranexa is prescribed to be taken twice daily, generally as a 1000 mg oral tablet, and ranolazine is now available in generic form.
 
To support our go to market strategy, we conducted a survey of U.S. interventional cardiologists to gauge their experience-based assessment of the prevalence of refractory angina patients, and their openness to integrate the use of the Generx angiogenic gene therapy product candidate, upon FDA approval, into their clinical practice. The survey confirmed that all survey responders see patients with long-term refractory angina, and all were strongly positive and without reservation about adoption of Generx. All cardiologists surveyed felt there is a current need for Generx to treat refractory angina and they would consider using Generx in their daily practice if approved by the FDA.
 
In prior clinical studies, a single intracoronary administration of the Generx [Ad5FGF-4] gene construct has demonstrated the capacity to enhance cardiac perfusion (blood flow) in the presence of profound myocardial ischemia through the growth of microvascular capillaries in regions distal to epicardial arterial stenosis in the three major arteries of the heart (the LAD, LCX and RCA). As shown in the following table, the Generx product candidate for medical revascularization therapy generated statistically significant improvements in cardiac perfusion (measured using SPECT as a reduction in reversible perfusion defect) as compared to placebo controls in both the U.S-based Phase 2 clinical study (AGENT-2), and a small confirmatory international study (ASPIRE), and the observed improvements were similar in magnitude to those reported following mechanical revascularization.

Generx Clinical Studies and FDA Developments
 
The Generx FDA regulatory dossier represents one of the most extensive and advanced DNA-based clinical data platforms ever compiled. Generx has been evaluated as a treatment for patients with refractory angina in four prior FDA-cleared, multi-center, randomized and placebo-controlled clinical studies (AGENT 1-4, Phase 1/2 to Phase 2b/3) and one small international study (ASPIRE). The four AGENT studies combined enrolled over 650 patients at over 100 medical centers in the U.S. and Western Europe and have generated over 2,500 patient years of safety data.
 
In these multiple prior clinical studies, the Generx product candidate appeared safe and well-tolerated, and has generated preliminary findings of efficacy in men and women, in measures of cardiac perfusion, cardiac performance, and angina status, including: (1) significant improvement in exercise duration by Exercise Treadmill Testing; (2) significant improvement in cardiac perfusion as assessed by SPECT imaging, with observed improvements comparable in magnitude to those seen with coronary artery bypass surgery and angioplasty with the use of stents; (3) significant and durable improvement in physical exertion capacity, as assessed by functional classification of angina out to 12 months post-treatment; (4) improvement in angina status, as assessed by documented reduction in angina episodes and nitroglycerin usage; and (5) significant reduction in incidence of worsening angina.
 
A central finding from the Generx AGENT clinical development program is that cardiac ischemia drives Generx transfection into heart cells, and that regional cardiac ischemia is an essential precursor to support the growth of collateral blood vessels for treatment response to Generx angiogenic gene therapy. Company-sponsored in vivo pre-clinical research conducted at Emory University demonstrated that intracoronary Ad5-based gene delivery under conditions of transient ischemia, and following pre-treatment with nitroglycerin, significantly enhances transgene expression in the heart by over two orders of magnitude (>800x), as compared to prior intracoronary delivery methods. We believe that the significant improvements in gene transfer are likely due to ischemia-driven up-regulation of the cardiac Coxsackievirus-Adenovirus Receptor (CAR) and improved transit through dilated gap junctions due to enhanced cell permeability that is believed to be activated using nitroglycerin.
 
Based on these pre-clinical findings, Generx was evaluated in a small international pilot study involving the use of a new balloon catheter-based delivery technique, and a higher Generx dose level, to induce transient ischemia during Generx delivery, and to potentially reduce variability and enhance efficacy responses by leveraging pre-conditioning cardiac physiology and our enhanced understanding of cell surface receptor-mediated uptake. Generx was administered under conditions of transient ischemia, achieved by balloon inflation, and following pre-treatment with nitroglycerin. This clinical study of 11 patients with refractory angina confirmed the preliminary efficacy (as evaluated by improvement in cardiac perfusion based on SPECT imaging) and safety (based on troponin measures to detect any heart muscle damage) of transient ischemia during Generx administration, together with the use of a higher single dose level of Generx. Based on positive findings from this study, the new catheter delivery techniques and higher dose level have been integrated into the U.S.-based Phase 3 AFFIRM clinical study protocol.

In September 2016, the FDA cleared the Generx AFFIRM Phase 3 clinical study protocol. The primary endpoint in the AFFIRM study is the change from baseline to month 6 in Exercise Tolerance Test (“ETT”) duration, with exercise duration limited by angina. FDA clearance of the AFFIRM protocol was based on over 2,500 patient years of accumulated safety data, a study design based on findings from a detailed meta-analysis of patient data from prior clinical studies that characterized male and female patient responders (including ETT data for approximately 600 patients and 3,000 treadmill tests), and demonstration in a small international study that balloon catheter-based delivery of Generx at an increased dose level, and under conditions of transient ischemia to improve gene transfection, is safe (based on measurement of serum troponin levels, an indicator of damage to heart muscle).
 
On February 3, 2017, the FDA granted the Phase 3 AFFIRM clinical study Fast Track designation. By granting Fast Track designation to the Generx Phase 3 clinical development program, FDA acknowledges that there remains unmet medical need for patients with refractory angina. The limited available therapies for patients with refractory angina primarily address the symptoms of refractory angina by reducing myocardial oxygen demand or transiently increasing blood flow to the ischemic myocardium and require prolonged use or numerous rounds of therapy. Furthermore, available therapies have modest and heterogenous response rates. Generx is unique in its angiogenic biological mechanism of action and disease-modifying potential.
 
In July 2020, we submitted a protocol amendment to FDA, refining some of the patient inclusion criteria and clarifying ETT stopping criteria for enrolled patients. In addition, an adaptive trial design was incorporated to allow for interim analysis and re-estimation of sample size required to achieve the primary efficacy endpoint of statistically significant improvement in ETT with Generx compared to Placebo at 6 months. Based on further statistical analysis of historical ETT data, the target sample size was reduced from 320 patients, without an interim analysis, to 160 patients with an interim analysis after 80 patients have been enrolled. The adaptive design allows for an increase in sample size up to 226 total patients if needed to reach statistical significance.
 
On a global basis, over 650 patients have been enrolled in four FDA-cleared clinical studies of Generx at over 100 medical centers in the U.S., Western Europe, and Asia, 455 of whom received a one-time intracoronary administration of Generx. Based on these studies, and other pre-clinical and further international clinical evaluations, our Generx product candidate appears to be safe and well-tolerated and has generated preliminary efficacy findings in men and women, based on multiple efficacy measures within patient subset groups. Long-term safety follow-up has generated over 2,500 patient years of safety data. With the successful completion of the planned AFFIRM Phase 3 clinical study, the Generx clinical research will have evaluated over 800 patients in clinical study protocols. Based on our FDA Fast-Track designation, and our established manufacturing processes, we believe that we would be in a position to initiate the submission to the FDA of a rolling Biologics License Application (“BLA”).
 
FDA Registration Pathway
 
For registration purposes, the FDA has classified our Generx product candidate to be an “anti-anginal” medication as a treatment for patients who have been diagnosed with stable exertional angina due to coronary artery disease and who are no longer responsive to current pharmaceutical therapy and mechanical interventional therapy. FDA approval of anti-anginal drugs and biologicals requires statistically significant efficacy improvements in exercise capacity as measured by ETT compared to a placebo control group. Developing a new and innovative anti-anginal is a challenging process and FDA approvals have been few and far between. In the past-50 years only one anti-anginal with a new mechanism of action has been approved and registered for marketing and sale in the U.S.
 
In 2006, following a 22-year clinical and commercial development process, the FDA approved Ranexa (ranolazine), a small molecule drug in tablet form that is taken twice daily with a new mechanism of action described as metabolic modulation, to reduce the heart’s oxygen demand. Based on the Ranexa package insert, the CARISA clinical study showed that Ranexa was safe and well tolerated by refractory angina patients and that patients treated with Ranexa showed an improvement in the primary efficacy endpoint ETT of +24 seconds (+28%) compared to the placebo control over the 12- week study period. Based on our retrospective subset analysis of data from the Generx AGENT-3 clinical study, and the FDA-cleared Ad5FGF-4 Phase 3 AFFIRM clinical study design, the Generx product candidate offers the potential to meet or exceed the ETT efficacy data reported in the Ranexa CARISA clinical study. As a result, we plan to submit a BLA following successful completion of the Phase 3 AFFIRM study.

Generx Competitive Advantage
 
We believe that the most significant factors in the field of new drugs and biologics are safety and efficacy as well as relative cost, and ease of administration as compared to other products, product candidates or approaches that may be useful for treating a particular disease condition. While there continues to be significant interest in the potential commercial development of autologous cell therapies for the treatment of myocardial ischemia, these complex and burdensome systems require harvesting and ex-vivo preparation of donor cells, offer poor economics for scalability and profitability, have an uncertain mechanism of action, and lack any strong and convincing thesis to explain cardiac cell targeting. In contrast, our FDA-cleared Ad5FGF-4 manufacturing process offers significant gross margin opportunities, scalable campaign manufacturing, generates ready to use product, has a well-researched and clinically supported mechanism of action, and receptor-based, cardiac cell targeting. We believe that our Generx product candidate competes favorably against the current standard of care in each of these areas:

● | Safety. The FDA-cleared Phase 3 AFFIRM study is preceded in the U.S. by four completed and one early discontinued study. On a global basis, over 650 patients have been enrolled in FDA-approved studies, 455 of whom received a one-time intracoronary administration of Generx, which has consistently been found to be safe and well-tolerated (based on over 2,500 patient years of safety data). Efficient uptake in the heart following intracoronary administration of Generx has been demonstrated in preclinical studies (~98% first pass extraction) and clinical studies (~90% first pass extraction). Administration of Ad5FGF-4 after stent implantation in a preclinical model of atherosclerosis and hypercholesterolemia found no evidence of increased neointima formation (restenosis) with both bare metal and drug-eluting stents. Fever is an expected side effect of adenoviral gene therapy and has been observed in ~8% of patients receiving Ad5FGF-4, occurring within the first few days after study product administration and resolving with no treatment or with antipyretic medication. No other adverse events have been associated with intracoronary administration Ad5FGF-4. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Effectiveness. A central finding from the Generx AGENT clinical development program is that cardiac ischemia drives Generx transfection into heart cells, and that regional cardiac ischemia is an essential precursor to support the growth of collateral blood vessels for treatment response to Generx angiogenic gene therapy. Our delivery strategy is to distribute Ad5FGF-4 throughout the microvascular circulation of the heart under conditions of transient ischemia to enhance uptake, with the angiogenic response being selective to ischemic zones. An angiogenic response to Generx has been demonstrated in preclinical studies, in which increased regional myocardial blood flow was identified by contrast echocardiography and correlated with increased vessel number, determined histologically. In clinical studies SPECT imaging has demonstrated cardiac perfusion improvements approximately up to 75% of the perfusion levels achieved from classic mechanical revascularization. The clinical response is observed in patients within four to eight weeks following administration, and it is anticipated that once formed, new vessels will persist as long as there is blood flow through the vessel. 
● | Cost-Effective Manufacture. We have established and validated the Generx cGMP (defined below) manufacturing process, which is not expected to require significant additional capital investment or major process modifications for commercial manufacture. Product stability enables manufacture in large, cost-effective batch sizes. Based on our established manufacturing process, we are in a position to competitively price our Generx product candidate in alignment with cardiac stents. 
● | Fits within Current Medical Practice. Generx therapy is designed to easily fit within the current practice of medicine, as a ready-to-use, one-time treatment, administered by interventional cardiologists during an approximately one-hour, out-patient, angiogram-like procedure. There are approximately 1.0 million angiogram procedures performed in the U.S. each year. Through our extensive clinical efforts, we have established appropriate dose levels, enhanced delivery techniques and simplified product administration. With regulatory approval, Generx could be the first FDA-approved gene therapy for an otherwise healthy population that would be universally affordable within healthcare medical reimbursement programs and for private pay environments.

Additional Medical Indications
 
Following our planned initial registration for refractory angina there are other potential ischemia-related cardiovascular and cerebral therapeutic opportunities that we may consider advancing forward with based on our angiogenic technology platform using varying dose levels and differing routes of administration.
Potential Pipeline of Generx (Ad5FGF-4) Medical Indications
 

Cardiac Syndrome X. A meta-analysis study [Vermeltfoort et al., Clinical Research in Cardiology. 2010; 99:475-81] reported that approximately 20% of patients who have a coronary angiography due to ongoing angina do not have obvious large vessel disease, a condition generally referred to as Cardiac Syndrome X (“CSX”). Patients with CSX are presumed to have coronary disease that is diffuse and/or affects smaller vessels within the heart. CSX is therefore sometimes referred to as “microvascular angina”. CSX cannot be addressed using traditional surgical approaches such CABG or PCI. We believe patients with CSX may potentially benefit from Generx microvascular angiogenic gene therapy, and plan to conduct a U.S.-based safety and efficacy study under the current FDA-approved IND. There are approximately 200,000 patients in the U.S. with CSX, 65% of whom are women.
 
Congestive Heart Failure. Congestive Heart Failure is a clinical syndrome that occurs when the heart is unable to pump sufficiently to maintain blood flow to meet the body’s needs. Common causes of heart failure include coronary artery disease, heart attack, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, excess alcohol use, infection, and cardiomyopathy of an unknown cause. In prior clinical studies of Generx in patients with myocardial ischemia and refractory angina, approximately 50% of enrolled patients were also diagnosed with mild congestive heart failure. The rationale supporting the application of angiogenic therapy for heart failure is based on the fact that mild and/or intermittent ischemia in the sub-endocardium (inner wall) can and often does occur in congestive heart failure with almost all primary causes. In a preclinical model of heart failure due to chronic sub-endocardial ischemia, a single administration of Generx resulted in significant improvement in cardiac function [McKirnan et al., Cardiac Vascular Regeneration. 2000; 1:11-21]. These preclinical findings support the potential use of Generx [Ad5FGF-4] angiogenic gene therapy as a non-surgical treatment option for heart failure. We are evaluating a Phase 2 clinical study of Generx angiogenic therapy for the treatment of patients with certain forms of congestive heart failure.

Moyamoya Disease & Cerebral Ischemia. Moyamoya disease (“MMD”) is a chronic occlusive, cerebrovascular disease that is characterized by progressive stenosis at the terminal portion of the internal carotid artery and an abnormal network of collateral vessels at the base of the brain. Pursuant to the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, MMD is an orphan indication, with <1 case per 100,000 in the U.S. The prevalence of MMD is much higher in East Asian countries than in Western countries. The highest prevalence of MMD is found in Japan at 3.16 per 100,000. Currently, there is no known medical treatment capable of reversing or stabilizing progression of MMD. Surgical revascularization such as extracranial-intracranial bypass is the preferred procedure for MMD patients with the main goal of preventing further ischemic injury by increasing collateral blood flow to hypo-perfused areas of the cortex. Collateral vessels are seen to sprout from bypassed vessels, thus providing increased blood flow to ischemic regions of the brain. We believe that Generx may potentially offer a new and simpler medical revascularization approach to the treatment of MMD, with a view toward further clinical development of angiogenic gene therapeutics for patients with a broader range of cerebral ischemic conditions, including vascular dementia. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that adenovectors can transfect cells in the brain, and we are investigating potential routes of administration to MMD patients that include, (1) adjunctive application of Ad5FGF-4 during burr hole surgery to augment collateralization, and (2) infusion into the carotid artery, to target ischemic regions and stimulate collateral vessel formation.
 
Angiogenic Research Initiative for COVID-19.
 
Early research has provided evidence of respiratory, neurological, and cardiac abnormalities in patients who have had severe COVID-19 immunological response requiring acute care (including protracted hospitalization and the need for mechanical ventilation). For patients who have survived and seek to return to normal life, several continuing residual adverse medical conditions appear to persist.
 
While the scientific literature remains uncertain, it has been suggested that mechanisms by which COVID-19 could lead to cardiovascular morbidity include direct myocardial injury as a result of inflammatory cascade or cytokine release, acute coronary syndrome from acute inflammation-triggered destabilization of atheroma, microvascular damage due to disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombosis, direct entry of SARS-CoV-2 into myocardial cells via ACE2 receptors, and hypoxemia combined with metabolic demands of acute illness leading to myocardial injury akin to a myocardial infarction.
 
Based on these preliminary insights, Gene Biotherapeutics’ research is focused on the design of an observational clinical study to evaluate if COVID-19 may exacerbate microvascular damage and perfusion impairment in patients with pre-existing coronary artery disease and cardiac reversible perfusion defects (“RPD”) prior to COVID-19 infection. We are proposing to assess the damage using SPECT (Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography) imaging to evaluate changes in RPD as a result of COVID-19 infection. Demonstration of worsening perfusion due to COVID-19 would be supportive of the potential to evaluate the therapeutic benefit of the Generx [Ad5FGF-4] product candidate angiogenic gene therapy in this patient population.
 
Commercialization Business Strategy
 
We are committed to applying our first-mover scientific and clinical development leadership position in the field of angiogenic gene therapy for the treatment of patients with a variety of cardiovascular conditions which are related by insufficient cardiac perfusion and other potential ischemia-related cerebral therapeutic opportunities as well as advanced tissue engineering applications. The core elements of our commercial strategy include:

● | Advance our FDA-cleared Generx [Ad5FGF-4] AFFIRM Phase 3 clinical study and commercial development for the treatment of patients with refractory angina due to advanced coronary artery disease and secure FDA registration to market and sell Generx in the U.S.; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Following U.S. registration for refractory angina, initiate the registration process to market and sell Generx in China, the Russian Federation, and the CIS with our current strategic partners, and consider registration in other prioritized regional markets; 
● | Following FDA approval, we would also plan to (1) enter a strategic agreement(s) to market and sell Generx in other countries worldwide, or (2) undertake a terminal value transaction covering the sale of Generx to an established strategic player which has established worldwide marketing, sales, and distribution capabilities;

● | Expand the initial labeling of Generx by initiating a Phase 2 clinical study to support the use of Generx for patients with CSX, which is characterized by symptomatic angina in the absence of large coronary artery obstruction, and for certain forms of congestive heart failure; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Advance our pre-clinical research which is focused on applying our Ad5FGF-4 technology platform as a potential treatment for patients with MMD, an orphan medical condition characterized by restricted blood flow, and collateral blood vessel dysfunction in certain regions of the brain, with a view toward further clinical development of angiogenic gene therapeutics for patients with a broader range of cerebral ischemic conditions, including vascular dementia; 
● | Establish a Generx patient registry and conduct additional clinical studies to evaluate the safety and clinical efficacy of repeat dosing of Generx in patients as their coronary artery disease advances causing additional perfusion defects; and 
● | Initiate additional studies to assess the potential long-term prognostic benefits of refractory angina patients receiving angiogenic therapy through medical revascularization. 

Government Regulation
 
Gene therapy biologics are subject to extensive regulation in the United States under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. In addition, biologics are also regulated under the Public Health Service Act. Both statutes and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, distribution, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising and other promotional practices involving biologics or new drugs. FDA approval or other clearances must be obtained before clinical testing, and before manufacturing and marketing of biologics and drugs. Obtaining FDA approval has historically been a costly and time-consuming process. Different regulatory regimes are applicable in other major markets.
 
Any product candidate we develop will require regulatory approvals on a country-by-country basis before human trials and additional regulatory approvals before marketing. Currently, each human study protocol is reviewed by the FDA and, in some instances, the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”), on a case-by-case basis. For biologics, we must sponsor and file an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application with the FDA and be responsible for initiating and overseeing human clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy and, for a biologic product, the potency, which are necessary to obtain FDA approval of any such products. For any new drug applications, we will be required to select qualified investigators (usually physicians within medical institutions) to supervise the administration of the products, and we will be required to ensure that the clinical trials are conducted and monitored in accordance with FDA regulations and the general investigational plan and protocols contained in the IND application. The FDA receives reports on the progress of each phase of testing, and it may require the modification, suspension, or termination of trials if an unwarranted risk is present to patients. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. The IND application process can thus result in substantial delay and expense.
 
Our Generx product candidate is a gene therapy product, which is a relatively new category of therapeutics. The FDA and the NIH have published guidance documents with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy protocols. However, there is generally less information available for us to estimate the length of any trial period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the trials to establish the safety, efficacy, and potency of human gene therapy products, or that the data generated in these studies will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval. Ethical, social, and legal concerns about gene therapy could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the processes we or our suppliers may use. Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed interest in further regulating biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims that our products are unsafe or pose a hazard could prevent us from commercializing any such products.
 
After the completion of trials of a new drug or biologic product, we will have to secure FDA marketing approval. The New Drug Application (“NDA”) or BLA must include results of product development, laboratory, animal and human studies, and manufacturing information. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the NDA or BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. In the past, NDAs and BLAs submitted to the FDA have taken, on average, one to two years to receive approval after submission of all test data. If questions arise during the FDA review process, the approval process can take more than two years.
 

-15-
----

 

Notwithstanding the submission of all relevant data, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and may require additional studies. In addition, the FDA may condition marketing approval on the conduct of specific post-marketing studies to further evaluate safety and effectiveness. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of pharmaceutical products continues after approval, particularly with respect to compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMPs”), reporting of adverse effects, advertising, promotion, and marketing. Discovery of previously unknown problems or failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market, as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions.
 
In addition to FDA approval for the commercialization of our product candidates, our business is subject to state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical, and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations.
 
To the extent that we conduct operations outside the United States, any such operations would be similarly regulated by various agencies and entities in the countries in which we operate. The regulations of these countries may conflict with those in the United States and may vary from country to country. In markets outside the United States, we may be required to obtain approvals, licenses, or certifications from a country’s ministry of health or comparable agency before we begin operations or the marketing of products in that country. Approvals or licenses may be conditioned or unavailable for certain products. These regulations may limit our ability to enter certain markets outside the United States.
 
Competition
 
The pharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive. Our product candidates will compete with existing drugs, therapies, biotherapies, stem cell therapies, medical devices, or procedures and with others under development. There are many pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies, public and private universities and research organizations actively engaged in research and development of products for the treatment of cardiovascular and related diseases.
 
Our Generx product candidate is a first in class, single-dose, disease altering therapeutic specifically targeted for the cardiac micro-vasculature, that is designed to stimulate and augment the formation of new biologic structures in the heart to increase the level of micro-vascularity and enhance cardiac perfusion, and improve cardiac performance, as measured by exercise tolerance and the occurrence and severity of myocardial ischemia-driven angina. Current pharmacologic therapies for patients with refractory angina are limited to anti-anginal medications to relieve angina chest pain, which are dosed daily or episodically and carry physiologic side effects, and surgical and percutaneous interventions, such as stents or by-pass surgery, to address large vessel coronary artery disease.
 
While there continues to be significant interest in the potential commercial development of autologous cell therapies for the treatment of myocardial ischemia, these complex and burdensome systems require harvesting and ex-vivo preparation of donor cells, offer poor economics for scalability and profitability, have an uncertain mechanism of action, and lack any strong and convincing thesis to explain cardiac cell targeting. In contrast, our FDA-cleared Ad5FGF-4 manufacturing process offers significant gross margin opportunities, scalable campaign manufacturing, generates ready to use product, has a well-researched and clinically supported mechanism of action, and receptor-based, cardiac cell targeting
 
We are aware of products currently under development by competitors targeting the same or similar cardiovascular and vascular diseases as our Generx product candidate. These include small molecule drugs and biological treatments using forms of genes and stem cells.

● | Ranexa® (ranolazine; Gilead Sciences, Inc.) is a small molecule drug first approved by the FDA in 2006 for the treatment of chronic angina in patients who have not responded to other anti-anginal drugs (long-acting nitrates, calcium channel blockers and beta blockers). In 2008, the FDA approved Ranexa for first line anti-anginal use. Ranexa is taken twice daily, and FDA approval was based on clinical trial findings that both angina attacks per week and nitroglycerin tablet usage per week were reduced by 33% (from 3 to 2 for both). These studies also report that the response in women only was only about 30% of that seen in men. The mechanism of action of Ranexa’s antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranexa is prescribed to be taken twice daily, generally as a 1000 mg oral tablet. Ranolazine is now available in generic form.

● | The Neovasc Reducer™ (“Reducer”) is a stainless steel, hourglass-shaped medical device that is implanted into the coronary sinus using a procedure similar to that used for stent implantation. It is designed to create a focal narrowing in the coronary sinus, resulting in increased back pressure and redistribution of blood into ischemic myocardium. In 2015, results from a Phase 2 study (the “COSIRA” study; N=104) were published, reporting that significantly more patients in the treatment group, as compared to control, had an improvement in CCS class and quality of life at 6 months, but no significant improvement in exercise time. In December 2018, Neovasc announced publication of 12-year follow-up data from 7 patients demonstrating sustained improvement of angina class compared with baseline status. The Reducer is currently available only in the European Union, receiving CE mark designation in 2011. In October 2018, Neovasc announced that the Reducer™ was granted Breakthrough Device designation by the U.S. FDA, and in December 2019, Neovasc announced submission to FDA of a Premarket Approval application (PMA) for the treatment of refractory angina. On October 27, 2020, an 18 member FDA Advisory Committee reviewed the PMA submission, voting 17 to 1 “against” on the issue of a reasonable assurance of effectiveness, voting 14 to 4 “in favor” that the Reducer is safe when used as intended, and voting 13 to 3 “against” (2 abstained) on whether the relative benefits outweighed the relative risks. In September 2021, Neoavsc announced FDA approval of the COSIRA-II clinical study protocol, a randomized, sham-controlled trial investigating the safety and effectiveness of the Reducer for patients suffering from refractory angina (N=~380). The primary endpoint of the trial is change in exercise tolerance testing time via a modified Bruce protocol between baseline and six-month follow-up. Neovasc also announced anticipated enrollment of the first patient into the study in late 2021.
● | Caladrius Biosciences is developing an autologous CD34+ stem cell product candidate for refractory angina (“CLBS14”). Caladrius acquired an exclusive worldwide license to data and regulatory filings for the late stage CD34+ cell therapy program from Shire plc in March 2018. CD34+ therapy is thought to work by increasing microvascular blood flow in the heart muscle via the development and formation of new blood vessels. Cells are collected from patients after drug-induced mobilization, followed by isolation, concentration, and formulation prior to intramyocardial injection guided by mapping catheter (NOGA). CLBS14 has been studied in Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials that reveal significant improvements in exercise capacity and angina frequency. According to public records, initiation of a Phase 3 confirmatory trial is postponed pending access to sufficient capital to complete the study uninterrupted. 
 | In May 2020, Caladrius announced positive results from a 20-patient Phase 2 proof of concept study with CD34+ cell therapy (CLBS16) in patients with CSX. Data showed statistically significant improvement in coronary flow reserve correlating with symptom relief after a single intracoronary injection of CLBS16. 
● | XyloCor Therapeutics is developing an adenovirus-based gene therapy encoding a hybrid gene for human vascular endothelial growth factor (“XC001”) for patients with refractory angina. XC001 is designed to relieve angina by promoting angiogenesis. In July 2020, XyloCor announced dosing of the first patients in the initial Phase 1/2 open label, single arm dose-escalation clinical study (the “EXACT Trial”; N=44). XC001 is administered by a surgeon via transthoracic epicardial injection, requiring overnight hospitalization. In July 2021, Xylocor announced completion of the Phase 1 dose-escalation component of the EXACT Trial, and commencement of the Phase 2 component at the highest dose level tested in Phase 1. The primary study endpoint is safety, with secondary endpoints including change in exercise tolerance testing time and change in CCS class between baseline and six-month follow-up. 
● | BioCardia Inc. is developing the CardiAmp™ Cell Therapy System, which provides an autologous bone marrow-derived stem cell therapy for the treatment of chronic myocardial ischemia. In July 2020, BioCardia announced activation of a Phase 3 clinical trial studying percutaneously injected cells for the treatment of no option chronic myocardial ischemia with refractory angina. In October 2021, BioCardia announced the treatment of the first patient in the Phase 3 trial. The CardiAMP Cell Therapy Chronic Myocardial Ischemia Trial is expected to enroll up to 343 patients. The primary endpoint will evaluate improvement in exercise tolerance at six months following the study procedure.

Manufacturing Strategy
 
We will rely on contract manufacturing for the Generx product candidate. Based on the FDA clearance of the Generx Phase 3 clinical study protocol, all significant cGMP manufacturing factors have been resolved for our Generx product candidate in preparation for a commercial launch. The cGMP Generx manufacturing processes have been validated and are scalable.
 
We have been actively advancing our Generx product candidate’s engineering and process technology in preparation for commercialization. The adenovector Ad5FGF-4 is propagated in suspension cultures of fully characterized HEK 293 cells using serum-free/animal product-free growth medium, and aseptically purified using a combination of chromatography and filtration methods. The final product is vialed at a defined viral particle (vp) concentration and stored at -70°C. Clinical doses are expressed in total number of viral particles. We have established validated test methods and product specifications to ensure that each batch of Generx meets rigorous quality control standards. These quality control test methods include a cell-based vessel formation bioactivity assay that measures and confirms the pro-angiogenic potency of each newly manufactured batch of Generx.
 
Generx’s long-term product stability (at the current storage temperature of -70°C) makes it possible to manufacture Generx in large, cost-effective batch sizes. Based on the current Generx validated cGMP manufacturing processes, we believe that the manufacture of Generx can be scaled to large batch quantities (up to approximately 2.0 million doses annually) without the need for significant additional capital investment or major process technology engineering. This flexibility will allow the manufacture of Generx at a highly economical direct cost, which could yield gross margins that would be approximately equivalent to a classic small molecule drug model. This would represent a significant commercial advantage in the market and could be orders of magnitude lower than the expected high cost associated with the manufacture of complex donor-based autologous cell therapies, that are currently under development by other biotechnology companies for cardiovascular applications.
 
In March 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies (“FDB”) to manufacture the Generx [Ad5FGF-4] angiogenic gene therapy product candidate for Phase 3 clinical evaluation for the treatment of refractory angina due to late-stage coronary artery disease. Manufacturing operations will be conducted at FDB’s facilities in College Station, Texas where FDB will perform technology transfer and process development activities for Phase 3 clinical and commercial-scale GMP manufacturing of Generx. The required funding for the Fuji agreement is approximately $3.8 million. At present, we do not have the requisite financial resources to initiate FDB’s manufacturing of Generx [Ad5FGF-4] necessary to the conduct of the planned FDA-cleared Phase 3 clinical study. We are currently evaluating alternative financing arrangements, but there are no agreements in place for such financing at this time. As a result, we are unable to provide a start date for the initiation of the planned FDA-cleared Phase 3 AFFIRM clinical study.
 
Marketing and Sales
 
Our product candidates, such as Generx, must undergo clinical trials before any marketing and sales can begin. If we should obtain marketing approvals, we do not currently have the financial resources and internal capabilities to market and sell Generx. In conjunction with regulatory approval, we may develop a direct and highly focused internal marketing and sales force for the Generx product candidates, or establish strategic partnerships and alliances with pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device and cardiac diagnostic companies for the marketing and sale of Generx in the United States. Outside the U.S., we expect to rely on strategic partnerships and distributors for marketing and sales of Generx product candidates. However, our marketing and sales strategies may vary by product, medical indication and the size of the addressable market.

The Shanxi License Agreement provides for a royalty ranging from 5% up to 10% based on the level of annual net sales of the Generx product sold by Shanxi in the licensed territory.
 
On April 10, 2020, our Activation Therapeutics, Inc. subsidiary entered into a License and Patent Assignment Agreement with Shanxi (the “Shanxi Assignment Agreement”) pursuant to which we transferred of all of our residual rights and assets related to our Excellagen product to Shanxi. Under the terms of the Shanxi Assignment Agreement, we transferred all our license rights to manufacture, use, market and sell Excellagen to Shanxi in Greater China, the Russian Federation, and the CIS. We also assigned to Shanxi a Chinese patent that we received on Excellagen. In connection with the license, Shanxi agreed to apply previously funded $600,000 subscription payment to the license fee, and Shanxi released any future rights or claims against us. As a result, we have divested all its interest in Excellagen, other than the right to receive 10% royalty on worldwide net sales of Excellagen totaling up to $3,350,000, excluding China, Russia, and countries in the CIS.

Nostrum Pharmaceutical, LLC. In May 2020, we entered into a Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement with Nostrum selling 1,700,000 shares of our newly authorized Series B Convertible Preferred Stock in exchange for $1,700,000. The shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock are convertible into an aggregate of 150,442,478 shares of Common Stock. In addition, Nostrum entered into an agreement with the holder of our outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, under which Nostrum purchased 220 shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, convertible into an aggregate of 19,469,026 shares of Common Stock and agreed to purchase up to 570 additional Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. Since May 2020 through April 30, 2021, that includes a subsequent reporting period, Sabby had fully converted its 570 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, into 50,442,491shares of our Common Stock that has increased our outstanding Common Stock to 64,931,888 shares as of December 31, 2021.
 
Subsequently, during the 2021 calendar year, Nostrum made additional capital contributions to the Company totaling $371,080, which are convertible into 32,838,938 shares of Common Stock. After giving effect for issuance of these of the issuance these shares into Common Stock and the conversion of the Series A and Series B Convertible Preferred Stocks, Nostrum would beneficially own 202,750,442 shares of the Common Stock, representing 75.7% of the Company, and other shares of issued and outstanding Common Stock totals 64,931,888, representing 24.3% of the total outstanding shares of Common Stock, as of March 15, 2022.
 
 Nostrum is the parent company for Nostrum Pharmaceuticals, LLC a privately held pharmaceutical company engaged in the formulation and commercialization of specialty pharmaceutical products and controlled release, orally administered, branded and generic drug products. We believe that Nostrum’s assets and experience in the formulation and commercialization of pharmaceutical products will facilitate the administration and completion of the AFFIRM Phase 3 clinical trial on a cost-effective basis. However, we do not have any formal commercialization agreements in place with Nostrum currently.
 
Intellectual Property and Licensing-
 
We generally seek to protect our intellectual property through a combination of patents and trade secrets. We originally licensed certain assets and technology from Schering AG Group (now part of Bayer AG) relating to (a) methods of gene therapy for the treatment of cardiovascular disease (including methods for the delivery of genes to the heart or vasculature and the use of angiogenic and/or non-angiogenic genes for the potential treatment of diseases of the heart or vasculature); (b) therapeutic genes that include fibroblast growth factors (including FGF-4); insulin-like growth factors (including IGF-I); and potentially other related biologics; and (c) other technology and know-how, including manufacturing and formulation technology, as well as data relating to the clinical development of Generx and corresponding FDA regulatory matters. Under this agreement, we may be required to pay Schering AG a $10 million milestone payment upon the first commercial sale of each product. We also may be obligated to pay royalties equal to: (i) 5% on net sales following a first commercial sale of an FGF-4 based product such as Generx in the United States, Europe, or Japan, or (ii) 4% on net sales of other products developed based on technology transferred by Schering AG following a first commercial sale in the United States, Europe, or Japan, and (iii) a royalty of 2.5% (for FGF-4 based technology) or 2% (for other products) in territories where the product would not infringe the patent rights which were licensed by Schering AG.
 
In connection with the Schering portfolio, we acquired the rights to certain patents owned by the University of California related to the use of the catheter as part of the Generx treatment and New York University which held a patent on the FGF-4 gene. However, the underlying patents have subsequently expired. Accordingly, we do not own or have rights to any specific patent projection with respect to the Generx product candidate. Our principal intellectual property rights with respect to Generx are trade secrets that we have developed over the past decade.
 
In June 2016 we entered into a Distribution and License Agreement with an affiliate of Huapont whereby we granted the Huapont affiliate an exclusive license to clinically develop, manufacture, market and sell the Generx angiogenic gene therapy product candidate in mainland China. In April 2020 we entered into a similar agreement with Shanxi to manufacture Generx in mainland China and to sell Generx in Greater China, the Russian Federation, and the CIS. The licenses are effective only upon FDA approval of Generx in the U.S. For additional terms of the licenses, see “Business—Commercialization Relationships.”
 
In July 2018, we sold our Excellagen product to Olaregen for cash proceeds of $650,000, which has been recognized in the statement of operations as a gain on sale of assets and intellectual property. Under the terms of that arrangement, we transferred all assets and rights to the product retaining the rights to China, the Russian Federation, and the CIS. We are also entitled to royalty payments of 10% of all Olaregen’s worldwide sales of Excellagen, if any, up to an aggregate of $3,350,000. In April 2020, we transferred our residual rights in Excellagen, covering China, the Russian Federation, and the CIS to Shanxi. We no longer have any ownership interest or rights in Excellagen, other than the royalty arrangement with Olaregen.
