Item 1. Business. 
Introduction
 Canopy Growth is a world-leading cannabis consumer packaged goods (“CPG”) company which produces, distributes, and sells a diverse range of cannabis, hemp, and CPG products. Cannabis products are principally sold for recreational and medical purposes under a portfolio of distinct brands in Canada pursuant to the Cannabis Act, SC 2018, c 16 (the “Cannabis Act”), and globally pursuant to applicable international and Canadian legislation, regulations, and permits. Canopy Growth is also active in the cannabis accessory, hemp-derived CBD, skin care and wellness, and sports performance beverage categories. Our core operations are in Canada, the United States, and Germany. 
 
We intend to maintain a leading position in the cannabis and related industries, as well as expand the reach of our products in our core markets. From product and process innovation to market execution and everything in between, we are driven by a passion for leadership, a commitment to drive the industry forward, and above all else, providing our consumers the best possible experiences based on our vision of unleashing the power of cannabis to improve lives.
 Using a consumer-driven approach, and supported by industry-leading R&D, we provide a portfolio of differentiated products that offer unique experiences and effects to our consumers. We believe that this will establish a dominant business in our core markets, with the potential to generate a significant and sustained return on invested capital over the long-term. Our distinct cannabis brands include Tweed, 7ACRES, DOJA, Vert, Deep Space, and Ace Valley in the recreational channel, with Spectrum Therapeutics, as our medical brand, and Martha Stewart, Quatreau, and whisl as part of our collection of health and wellness hemp-derived CBD products. Our curated cannabis product formats include dried flower, oil, softgel capsules, edibles, vapes and beverages as well as a wide range of cannabis accessories. In addition, our consumer products brands which include Storz & Bickel GmbH (“Storz & Bickel”), This Works Products Ltd. (“This Works”), and BioSteel Sports Nutrition Inc. (“BioSteel”) provide complementary and innovative product offerings. 
 
As a responsible corporate citizen, we maintain initiatives designed to help patients and consumers safely, effectively and responsibly use cannabis in addition to advancing community engagement and social justice initiatives aimed at undoing the harms of prohibition. Our initiatives have included activities such as a partnership with National Expungement Works, the only organization of its kind in the United States that provides locale-specific record-clearing services, including wrap-around services, to those who have been adversely impacted by the enforcement of the justice system for cannabis-related incidents, and a three-way partnership with the University of British Columbia and British Columbia Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions to create the Canopy Growth Professorship of Cannabis Science in response to the need for novel substance use interventions in the overdose crisis. 
 Canopy Growth was incorporated pursuant to the provisions of the Canada Business Corporations Act on August 5, 2009 under the name LW Capital Pool Inc. The Company changed its name to Tweed Marijuana Inc. on March 26, 2014, and later to Canopy Growth Corporation on September 17, 2015. Prior to completing our qualifying transaction on April 3, 2014, Canopy Growth was a “capital pool company” under Policy 2.4 of the TSX Venture Exchange (“TSXV”) Corporate Finance Manual. As a capital pool company, Canopy Growth had no assets other than cash and did not carry on any operations. On July 26, 2016, Canopy Growth graduated from the TSXV to the Toronto Stock Exchange (the “TSX”). On February 1, 2017, the trading symbol for our common shares on the TSX was changed to “WEED”. On May 24, 2018, our common shares commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) with the trading symbol “CGC.” On the close of business on November 13, 2020, our common shares ceased trading on the NYSE and on November 16, 2020, our common shares commenced trading on The NASDAQ Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”) at market open with the trading symbol “CGC”. 
Our principal executive offices are located at 1 Hershey Drive, Smiths Falls, Ontario, K7A 0A8. We conduct our business both through our wholly-owned subsidiaries as well as through a variety of joint ventures and other entities.
 
Business Segments
 The Company reports its financial results for the following two operating segments, which are also its reportable segments:
 
 
(1) | Global cannabis, which encompasses the production, distribution and sale of a diverse range of cannabis and cannabinoid-based consumer products in Canada and internationally pursuant to applicable international and domestic legislation, regulations and permits; and
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Other consumer products, which encompasses the production, distribution and sale of consumer products by Storz & Bickel, This Works, BioSteel, and other ancillary revenue sources.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In the fourth quarter of the year ended March 31, 2022, the Company changed the composition of its reporting units within the global cannabis segment as a result of (i) the completion of the C3 Divestiture (defined below); and (ii) a strategic shift in the Company’s KeyLeaf Life Sciences (“KeyLeaf”) business to focus on non-cannabis extraction activities. There were no changes to the reporting units included in the Company’s other consumer products segment in the year ended March 31, 2022.

Strategy
 Our vision is to unleash the power of cannabis to improve lives. We will achieve this by harnessing the power of the plant, building a best-in-class CPG company, and fostering a purpose-driven atmosphere. Our approach involves operating with integrity, intention and values, with a business focus on insights, innovation and brands. To achieve this, we are dedicated to: 

• | Becoming a relentlessly consumer-centric organization by continuing to build world-class consumer insights and analytic capability, coupled with focused, leading-edge R&D and innovation to produce a differentiated product portfolio that will delight consumers. We intend to bring these products to our consumers through best-in-class sales execution.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Focusing on markets and product categories with the highest and most tangible profit opportunities in the near term. Core markets are Canada, the United States and Germany, with industry focus on recreational and medical channels. Further, in the United States, in addition to our hemp-derived CBD product offerings, we are also focused on building a robust U.S. THC ecosystem in preparation for entry into the market when federally permissible.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Driving quality in all aspects of our operation to be positioned to deliver the right product, at the right time and at the right price from the right facility.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continuing to lead the industry and set industry standards. This includes initiating the next phase of the cannabis industry evolution and shaping how the industry evolves. We continue to give back to neighbours and communities through ongoing initiatives such as our partnerships with record-clearing and expungement organizations in Canada and the United States that provide record-clearing and ancillary services to those who have been disproportionately impacted by the enforcement of the justice system for cannabis-related incidents.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Capturing future opportunities in emerging markets and categories outside the core, where we deploy an asset-light approach that leverages local and/or regional suppliers for raw materials in jurisdictions and at times that are appropriate.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CBI Group Investments
 
In November 2017, June 2018, November 2018 and May 2020, we completed certain transactions with the CBI Group, whereby the CBI Group invested CDN$245 million, CDN$200 million, CDN$5.079 billion and CDN$245 million, respectively (the “CBI Group Investments”).  As part of certain governance rights granted to the CBI Group in connection with certain of the CBI Group Investments, the CBI Group is entitled to, and has nominated, four directors to our board and has partnered with us as CBI’s exclusive global cannabis partner. The CBI Group Investments provided Canopy Growth with significant funding needed to build scale in countries pursuing federally permissible medical cannabis programs, while establishing the foundation needed to supply new recreational markets as cannabis becomes legal in markets around the world. See “The CBI Group Investments” below for more information on the CBI Group Investments and related agreements. 
Credit Facility
 On March 18, 2021, Canopy Growth and its direct, wholly owned subsidiary 11065220 Canada, Inc. (together with Canopy Growth, the “Borrowers”) entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with the lenders party thereto (the “Lenders”) and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as administrative agent and collateral agent for the Lenders. The Credit Agreement provides for a five-year senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of US$750 million (the “Credit Facility”). Canopy Growth also has the ability to obtain up to an additional US$500 million of incremental senior secured debt pursuant to the Credit Agreement. The obligations of the Borrowers under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by material Canadian and U.S. subsidiaries of Canopy Growth. The Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the assets, including material real property, of the Borrowers and each of the guarantors. The Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties, and affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant requiring minimum liquidity of US$200 million at the end of each fiscal quarter. The gross proceeds, net of fees and expenses, will be used by Canopy Growth for working capital and general corporate purposes, including without limitation, growth investments, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and strategic initiatives. Please refer to “Part 1 – Business Overview - Recent Developments” under Item 7 of this Annual Report for more information on the Credit Agreement.
Supreme Acquisition 
 On June 22, 2021, Canopy Growth and The Supreme Cannabis Company, Inc. (“Supreme Cannabis”) completed an arrangement (the “Supreme Arrangement”) pursuant to which we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding common shares of Supreme Cannabis (the “Supreme Shares”). Supreme Cannabis is a producer of recreational, wholesale and medical cannabis products, with a diversified portfolio of distinct cannabis companies, products and brands. The Supreme Arrangement added premium brands to our portfolio, namely Supreme Cannabis’ premium brands 7ACRES and 7ACRES Craft Collective, which complement our current consumer offering and strengthen our brand portfolio. Supreme Cannabis’ Blissco and Truverra brands also added breadth to our market presence in both the recreational and medical markets. Lastly, Supreme Cannabis’ hybrid-greenhouse cultivation facility at Kincardine, Ontario has a demonstrated capability of consistently producing premium flower from sought-after strains at low cost with significant potential for scaling.

Canada 
 
Recreational and Medical Cannabis Markets
 
We have aligned our infrastructure to match market growth projections and we are focused on leveraging our capabilities and scale to achieve profitability in the medium term. Our strategy in Canada includes: 

• | Continuing the launch of our portfolio of innovative, consumer-centric, premium-focused recreational cannabis products, specifically: inhalable cannabis (whole and pre-rolled flower, vape & concentrates), ingestible cannabis (e.g. edible formats like gummies and beverages), and cannabis extracts (predominantly oils and softgels) across Canada.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strengthening our connection with our consumers by offering brands and products that delight, and driving consumer loyalty. We continue to leverage consumer insights, our intellectual property and product innovation capability, and our cultivation and manufacturing infrastructure to consistently develop the highest-quality products at each price segment. Our goal is to educate consumers and normalize the use of cannabis on a variety of occasions, build brand awareness and recognition, and establish direct connections with our consumers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increasing our medical cannabis network and solidifying our position as a trusted leader in the Canadian medical cannabis market by offering a wide range of cannabis products across a variety of brands, formats and strains that serve the needs of medical patients through Spectrum Therapeutics, our medical cannabis brand, distributed through an e-commerce shop.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Retail Store Strategy 
 
The Cannabis Act provides provincial, territorial and municipal governments in Canada with the authority to prescribe regulations regarding retail and distribution of recreational cannabis. As such, the distribution model for recreational cannabis is prescribed by provincial and territorial regulations and differs in each jurisdiction. Some provinces have government-run retailers, while others have government-licensed retailers, and some have a combination of the two. All of our recreational sales are conducted according to the applicable provincial and territorial legislation and through applicable local agencies. We continue to monitor the developing legislation to identify opportunities for our brands. 
 
As of May 26, 2022, we have over 90 cannabis retail stores operating under the Tweed or Tokyo Smoke banner, of which 33 are corporate-owned stores and the balance are independently operated by our strategic partners pursuant to certain strategic partnership agreements. Tweed has 20 corporate-owned brick and mortar locations selling cannabis across Alberta, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador and Saskatchewan and has a branded e-commerce presence in Manitoba, Nunavut and Saskatchewan. Tokyo Smoke operates 13 corporate-owned retail cannabis stores in Alberta and Manitoba and an e-commerce platform in Manitoba. Please refer to “Risk Factors” under Item 1A and “Part 1 – Business Overview—Update on COVID-19” under Item 7 of this Annual Report for further discussion.
 
In Ontario, we have entered into multi-year master strategic partnership agreements to enable our development partners to expand our Tokyo Smoke and Tweed branded retail footprints. Our strategic partners currently operate over 60 retail stores across the province. 
 
European Medical Cannabis Market 
 
Our primary strategy in the European medical cannabis market is to increase access to our medical cannabis products for medical customers in countries where it is federally permissible to do so, and to position ourselves as a trusted market leader in those countries. 
 
Our Spectrum Therapeutics medical brand is a global leader in medical cannabis. Spectrum Therapeutics produces and distributes a diverse portfolio of medical cannabis products to healthcare practitioners and medical customers in Canada, and in several other countries where it is federally permissible to do so. Through our Spectrum Therapeutics brand, our strategy encompasses our medical channel in Germany, Poland, and the Czech Republic. 
 
On December 15, 2021, we entered into an agreement to divest all of our interest in C3 Cannabinoid Compound Company GmbH (“C3”) to a European pharmaceutical company headquartered in Germany (the “C3 Divestiture”). C3 develops and manufactures cannabinoid-based pharmaceutical products, including dronabinol, for distribution in Germany and certain other European countries. The C3 Divestiture was completed on January 31, 2022. As a result of the C3 Divestiture, we expect to avoid future operational complexities associated with C³ and significantly reduce short-term capital investment requirements related to C3.
 
Australian Cannabis Market 
 
We continue to develop the Australian market by focusing on an asset-light model which emphasizes use of third-party licenses. Through our global Spectrum Therapeutics brand, our consumer product brands such as BioSteel and This Works, our Storz & Bickel line of medically approved vaporizers, our strategy encompasses continuing the medical sales that began in Australia in May 2019 and supporting Australian patients through imports that are compliant with local regulations providing Australian prescribers with the option of cannabis products including oils, soft gels and flower.

Commercialization Activities in the United States
 
The key elements of our U.S. commercialization strategy include: 
  
• | In June 2019, we implemented a plan of arrangement (the “Original Acreage Arrangement”) pursuant to an arrangement agreement dated April 18, 2019, as amended on May 15, 2019, with Acreage (the “Acreage Arrangement Agreement”), a leading United States multi-state cannabis operator. In September 2020, following receipt of all required approvals, we entered into a second amendment to the Acreage Arrangement Agreement (the “Acreage Amending Agreement”) and implemented an amended and restated plan of arrangement (the “Acreage Amended Arrangement”). Pursuant to the the Acreage Amended Arrangement, following the occurrence or waiver (at our discretion) of changes in U.S. federal law to permit the general cultivation, distribution, and possession of marijuana or to remove the regulation of such activities from the federal laws of the United States and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set out in the Acreage Arrangement Agreement (as modified by the Acreage Amending Agreement), we (i) agreed to acquire approximately 70% of the issued and outstanding shares of Acreage, and (ii) obtained the right to acquire the other approximately 30% of the issued and outstanding shares of Acreage. The acquisition of Acreage, if completed, will provide an immediate pathway into cannabis markets in the United States; in the interim, Canopy Growth and Acreage will continue to operate as independent companies until completion of the Acreage Amended Arrangement. See “—U.S. Regulatory Framework—The Acreage Arrangement.”

Developing Intellectual Property and Innovative New Products
 
We have long believed that a significant opportunity exists to expand our total addressable market and create new consumer segments by developing innovative new recreational products that include cannabis and cannabinoids as ingredients catered to consumer need-states, such as sleep and relaxation, and consumption occasions. We have been continuously focused on conducting R&D of intellectual property related to: 

• | Innovation and new product development, including our portfolio of innovative second phase of recreational cannabis products, specifically, ingestible cannabis, cannabis extracts and cannabis topical products (“Cannabis 2.0”) that have been or will be rolled-out across Canada and other markets where it is federally permissible.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Creating novel applications for CBD. With the acquisition of BioSteel and This Works, we have added a platform that can be leveraged for infusing CBD, in the case of BioSteel, in sports nutrition and hydration beverages, and, in the case of This Works, in beauty, wellness, and sleep products, all in accordance with applicable state laws. BioSteel presently has a range of CBD-infused sports nutrition products in certain U.S. states, available through shopcanopy.com and other third-party retailers. This Works has also launched sleep, stress and skincare line extensions infused with CBD through its “deep sleep”, “stress check”, “morning expert” and “my wrinkles” product franchises. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Creating evidence-based, protectable product formulations and driving these products through robust clinical and consumer studies towards the creation of new cannabis-based products, cannabis formulations and dose delivery systems.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our intellectual property portfolio includes 195 issued patents and 233 patent applications as of May 26, 2022, covering plant genetics, post-growth processing (e.g. extraction, isolation and purification), equipment, synthetic chemistry (e.g. new chemical entities and synthetic pathways), formulations, human and animal health, edibles, packaging and vape devices. 
 
Our Products
Cannabis Products
 We produce and sell various cannabis products, including dried cannabis flower, extracts and concentrates,  beverages, gummies, and vapes in Canada and other locations where federally permissible. Our cannabis products are sold both in the direct-to-patient markets for medicinal use, as well as in the recreational market following the enactment of the Cannabis Act and the amendments thereto which provided for the legalization and regulation of Cannabis 2.0 products such as beverages, gummies, and vapes. Our cannabis products are sold under a variety of brand names described under “Brand Portfolio” below and are intended to position us as a leader in both the medical and recreational markets.
 
Our cannabis products include:

• | Cannabis-infused beverages, which are being produced in our licensed beverage facility in Smiths Falls, Ontario. Through our extensive R&D efforts, we have developed a process that distills whole flower cannabis into a clear liquid that we refer to as “Distilled Cannabis,” which is used as an active ingredient in our THC and CBD infused beverages. We offer our beverages in a variety of flavours and sizes under the Tweed, Quatreau, Ace Valley and Deep Space brands. We believe that cannabis-infused beverages that offer sophisticated taste and dose control with a rapid onset and shorter duration can be tailored to meet specific outcomes across a variety of consumption occasions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cannabis-infused gummies, which are produced in our factory in Smiths Falls, Ontario as well as through various contract manufacturers.

Recent reports on vape safety in North America underscore the importance of Canadian federal regulation for vape pen devices. Our vape cartridges are tested to the FDA standard for leachability to ensure the reduction of heavy metal poisoning and contaminants leaching into the extract. Our vape products are produced using UL 8139 Certified Safe Manufacturing standards, meaning that each 
 9

component of our hardware has been certified by Underwriters Laboratories (“UL”), or undergoing the review process with certification expected in advance of product on-sale dates. UL 8139 evaluates the safety of the integrated systems of a vape device and safety features and mechanisms that protect the user from harm when using the device. UL also has a standard for battery cells in isolation known as UL 1642. All of our battery cells are certified UL 1642. Further, our vapes are tamper-resistant and adhere to Health Canada’s regulations. We are continually reviewing and testing all inputs to ensure the highest quality and reliability of cannabinoids, terpenes, and tamper-resistance features.
Hemp-Derived CBD Human Products
 Our branded, hemp-derived CBD  products that have been brought to market in certain U.S. states where not prohibited under state law include: (i) our Martha Stewart line of hemp-derived CBD isolate products, including confections, oils, and softgels launched in September 2020, (ii) our Quatreau line of hemp-derived CBD isolate sparkling water launched in March 2021, (iii) First +  Free line of hemp-derived CBD optimized spectrum products, (iv) BioSteel’s line of “CBD for Sport” nutrition products; and (v) This Works’ range of clinically-proven and 98% natural skincare boosters expertly blended with 1% pure hemp-derived CBD isolate, available for purchase at shopcanopy.com.
 Developed as a result of our investments in technology and testing, these CBD products were created by extracting and isolating derivatives from the hemp plant to produce consistent CBD formulations that are packaged in easy-to-use formats. Our Martha Stewart, Quatreau, First + Free, and BioSteel hemp-derived CBD products are manufactured in the United States, contain 99% pure CBD isolate and less than 0.3% THC.  This Works’ Boosters CBD is extracted from high purity CBD isolate and is tested at three stages throughout our product development process, which ensures the product is pure, legal and highly effective. We are committed to selling high quality, tested and reliable products, and ensuring we make no claims unless clinically validated. This means selling our products only in U.S. states where we believe such sales are permissible under state law in order to ensure compliance with state consumer protection mandates and following the most stringent state laws regarding the sale of CBD.
 Hemp-Derived Broad Spectrum CBD Pet Products
 Our branded, hemp-derived broad spectrum CBD pet products that have been brought to market in certain U.S. states where not prohibited under state law include: (i) our Martha Stewart line of hemp-derived broad spectrum CBD dog chews launched in January 2021, and (ii) our SurityPro line of hemp-derived broad spectrum CBD dog chews launched in January 2021.
 
As the leader in pet CBD research and science, Canopy Growth has conducted many studies into the safety and effects of cannabinoids in dogs and cats. Our studies demonstrate that the products are well-tolerated and can safely be used towards achieving positive health effects. To address the various needs in dogs, Canopy Growth has developed the Martha Stewart and SurityPro product lines. These products are made in the U.S., backed by science, and endorsed by the industry’s leading authority on non-pharmaceutical animal health products, the National Animal Supplement Council (“NASC”).  We follow all NASC guidelines – which require independent lab testing to confirm CBD concentration and ensure products comply with quality standards, including testing of pesticide, solvent, microbe, and heavy metal levels, as these can be detrimental to a pet's health.  
 
Devices and Delivery Technology
 In addition to the vape pens and cartridge products that we offer in the legal cannabis market in Canada, through Storz & Bickel we manufacture and sell medical herbal vaporizer devices. Storz & Bickel has developed a factory that is certified internationally for the production of medical devices, and exports medically approved vaporizers and other similar devices to over 100 markets around the world. In May 2019, Health Canada issued a medical device license for Storz & Bickel’s “Volcano Medic 2,” an advanced vaporizer device for medical use. In May 2021, Storz & Bickel received the medical device license for their Mighty+ Medic, a battery powered vaporizer for medical use.  This license permits distribution of the Volcano Medic 2 and Mighty+ Medic to medical institutions, clinics, and patients in Canada, including distribution through Spectrum Therapeutics in Australia and Germany.

Our Operations
 Canadian Operations
 Recreational
 In fiscal 2022, we added a hybrid greenhouse cultivation and manufacturing facility in Kincardine, Ontario through the acquisition of Supreme Cannabis. This facility is purpose built for premium quality cannabis flower cultivation at low-cost. The facility also has packaging and manufacturing conversion capabilities that are planned to be moved to our Smiths Falls manufacturing site in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The Kincardine facility has now become one of our premiere cultivation spaces and a focal point of our premiumization strategy. As a result, we made the decision to close our Niagara-on-the-Lake greenhouse in December 2021.
 Through our in-house manufacturing capabilities of recreational cannabis products, we can process bulk cannabis flower, whether internally or externally sourced, into high quality cannabis flower products as well as a full spectrum of Cannabis 2.0 products produced from our internal extraction capacity. Such extracted cannabis oil is either turned into distillate or isolate which in turn feeds our manufacturing process for existing products as well as our innovation pipeline. We are confident that our production and manufacturing capabilities and know-how are sufficient to meet the diverse needs of our recreational and medical cannabis consumers in Canada.
 Our innovation pipeline continues to focus on insights driven, consumer focused products that in some cases represent net new offerings and line extensions to product formats already in the market.
 As the Canadian cannabis market matures, we expect to see opportunities to outsource manufacturing.  Excess capacity at other cannabis producers and processors presents Canopy Growth with an opportunity to accelerate speed to market, avoid capital investments until a critical sales volume is achieved, and provides us with surge capacity during peak periods.  All of this resulting in a more streamlined, agile, and cost-effective supply chain.

Medical
 Direct-to-Patient: Under the Cannabis Act, license holders are able to distribute medical cannabis through the mail to registered customers. Through the Spectrum Therapeutics website, customers who have successfully registered with Tweed in accordance with the Cannabis Act are able to purchase products online and have them shipped directly to the address indicated on their registration document. 
 Access: We have developed several programs to improve access to medical cannabis for authorized patients. First, we provide an income-tested Compassionate Pricing Program whereby eligible low-income patients may obtain a 20% discount off regular prices of medical cannabis. We also have multiple offerings for veterans of the Canadian Armed Forces, including: a group of customer care agents dedicated to assisting veterans with registration, ordering and insurance coverage; pre-approval and direct billing of Veterans Affairs Canada (“VAC”) to ensure uninterrupted access to medication; full coverage (through VAC) of all products offered in our online Spectrum Therapeutics medical shop, which means that veterans do not have to pay out of pocket for any product; special offers on our Storz & Bickel devices. We also provide support through our customer care team to help patients identify if their medication is covered under the growing number of private health plans that have a medical cannabis component.
 Health Care Professional Engagement: A key focus for the medical business continues to be a multifaceted approach to reach doctors, nurse practitioners, and other key health care providers through direct and indirect outreach. We have established a presence at certain major medical conferences to share our proprietary research to further the understanding of how our products can be used to help improve quality of life for patients. We are committed to collaborating with the medical community to create and execute the highest quality medical education programs with broad appeal on topics like chronic pain control, opioid sparing, dosing and administration and integration of medical cannabis into clinical practice; and engaged regional, national, and international key opinion leaders through scientific webinars aimed at peer-to-peer education. By leveraging our investment in real world studies and other clinical trials, we continue to strengthen our relationships with many of the leading names in cannabinoid science and medical cannabis, which includes recruitment for our Global Chronic Pain Patient Registry that began in Canada in late 2020. 
 In our effort to promote brand recognition without advertising our products directly to the public, we work closely with patient educators of specialty medical cannabis clinics and continue to hold community events (to the extent allowable within the regulatory environment), in order to build relationships and visibility for our brands.
 Global Operations
 
In recent years, the actions of governments around the world have signaled a significant change in attitudes towards cannabis and have either formally legalized medical cannabis access or established government efforts to explore the legalization of medical cannabis access. Therefore, opportunities continue to exist for Canopy Growth to operate in jurisdictions where governments have established, or are actively moving towards, a legal framework. To support Canopy Growth’s continued push toward profitability, operations across global incubator markets have been rationalized and realigned to support an asset-light model in those markets that are at an early stage of licensing cannabis-based products. Market entry will focus on supporting immediate revenue and establishing Canopy Growth in these markets as a leader in promoting a wellness focused lifestyle.
Europe 
 
Our Spectrum Therapeutics medical brand continues to service the medical market in Europe with operations in Germany, UK, Poland and the Czech Republic. Our European medical cannabis business operates in accordance with the specific regulatory framework in place in the relevant jurisdictions including supplying Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”) compliant pharmaceutical products. Further, the corporate offices and production facility of Storz & Bickel are located in Tuttlingen, Germany. 
United States 
 
We will only conduct business activities related to growing or processing cannabis in jurisdictions when it is federally permissible to do so. Canopy Growth is not considered a U.S. Marijuana Issuer (as defined in the Canadian Securities Administrators Staff Notice 51-352 – Issuers with U.S. Marijuana-Related Activities (the “Staff Notice”)) nor do we have material ancillary involvement in the U.S. cannabis industry in accordance with the Staff Notice. While we have several arrangements with U.S.-based companies that may themselves participate in the U.S. cannabis market, these relationships do not violate the federal laws of the United States respecting cannabis and in no manner involve Canopy Growth in any activities in the United States respecting cannabis. Where a non-controlled affiliate has expressed an intent to enter the U.S. cannabis market, we have taken steps to insulate ourselves from all economic and voting interests until such time as there are changes to the federal laws of the United States related to cannabis related activities. See “—U.S. Regulatory Framework—The Acreage Arrangement” and “Other United States Holdings” for further discussion.
 
We have continued to expand our presence in the U.S. with licenses for hemp manufacturing in Modesto, California. In October 2020, we entered into a hemp operating agreement with the City of Modesto to operate an industrial hemp manufacturing facility.

United Kingdom
 
In May 2019, we acquired This Works, an England-based company offering a range of natural skincare and sleep solution products.  In addition, in October 2019, Spectrum Therapeutics received the necessary government licenses to store and distribute medical cannabis products in the United Kingdom, reducing prescription delivery times and allowing the importation of medical cannabis from our European and global networks. 
Australia
 
Early in fiscal 2018, we launched our Australian operations and Spectrum Therapeutics began selling medical cannabis to doctors prescribing its products. Spectrum Therapeutics continues to support Australian medical customers through imports.
 
Additionally, we have registered and listed the Storz & Bickel medical devices on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, as well as the Web Assisted Notification of Devices database in New Zealand. Canopy Growth has also received a tax exception in Australia for the successful classification of a Storz & Bickel medical device.
 
Government Contracts
 
In Canada, we sell cannabis and cannabis products to cannabis control authorities in all of the provinces and territories in Canada (other than Saskatchewan), where each such cannabis control authority is the sole wholesale distributor and in certain provinces, the sole retailer, of cannabis and cannabis products in the relevant province. We sell these products to the various cannabis control authorities under supply agreements that are subject to terms that allow for renegotiation of sale prices and termination at the election of the applicable cannabis control authority. In particular, the cannabis control authorities may in the future choose to stop purchasing our products, may change the prices at which they purchase our products, may return our products to us and, in certain circumstances, may cancel purchase orders at any time including after products have been shipped. For the year ended March 31, 2022, we had approximately CDN$201.7 million in sales to cannabis control authorities and no single one accounted for at least 10% of our net consolidated revenue. 
Research and Development Activities and Intellectual Property
 
Intellectual Property 
 
In addition to our medical and recreational brands as detailed above, the proprietary nature of, and protection for, our products, technologies and processes are a key aspect to our business. We rely on a combination of patents (utility and design), trademarks, copyrights and know-how to establish and protect our intellectual property. Our intellectual property portfolio includes 195 issued patents and 233 patent applications as of May 26, 2022 covering plant genetics, post-growth processing (e.g. extraction, isolation and purification), equipment, synthetic chemistry (e.g. new chemical entities and synthetic pathways), formulations, human and animal health, edibles, packaging and vape devices. We have established and will continue to build proprietary positions in all key aspects of our business. We invest heavily in our intellectual property and consider it to be one of the pillars of our value. The duration of the protection afforded by our registered intellectual property varies by the nature of the registration, but we manage renewals and notices on an on-going basis to ensure that our intellectual property is protected to the full extent possible under applicable law. 
Clinical Trials
 We conduct clinical research across several of our product segments in order to further develop and enhance our technical capacity and expertise. 
 Our human R&D division acts as a cannabis research incubator, focusing on developing and researching cannabis formulations and dose delivery systems. This division includes elements of product design and ingredient selection, formulation, safety, and efficacy testing for the support and development of standardized cannabis formulations and dose delivery systems across a range of products. Our R&D division is focused on furthering the science of cannabinoids, building upon our robust portfolio of intellectual property and providing evidence by way of clinical trials on what conditions cannabis can treat and what symptoms cannabis can improve. Studies focused on applications of our cannabis formulations include randomized placebo-controlled trials and observational studies of cannabinoid-based formulations for (i) reducing biological and psychological fear reactions to a laboratory-based breathing challenge known to elicit fear, (ii) improving recovery from delayed onset muscle soreness, (iii) improving sleep, (iv) affecting biomarkers of bone turnover in postmenopausal women, and (v) reducing musculoskeletal discomfort. Other studies include Phase 1 clinical trials of the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of understudied cannabinoids (e.g. cannabigerol). A large ongoing study of Spectrum Therapeutics product prescription patterns, use, effects, impact on concomitant medication use, and safety will provide valuable information about how Spectrum Therapeutics products are being used by pain patients in Canada and will help refine product offerings for maximal therapeutic benefits. Other ongoing studies include several third-party investigator-initiated trials of cannabinoid-based therapies and products.

Product Safety and Pharmacovigilance
 In the interest of patient safety and good pharmacovigilance practices, we have implemented a unique global pharmacovigilance and product safety program to capture, document and evaluate adverse events reported from the worldwide use of our medical cannabis products and our various Canadian recreational cannabis brands, including Tweed, Tokyo Smoke, DOJA and our CBD product lines such as First + Free and Martha Stewart CBD, as well as products sold by our operating subsidiaries BioSteel, This Works and Storz & Bickel.
 Pharmacovigilance, also known as drug safety, is the science and activities relating to the detection, assessment, understanding and prevention of adverse effects or any other drug-related problems. Our product safety team works to ensure that new products are developed with consumer safety in mind.
 The global pharmacovigilance program ensures that all employees are trained on how to identify and report adverse events. Data collected from various sources (including, but not limited to, spontaneous reporting, clinical trials, literature and health authorities’ databases) are processed and analyzed in a centralized global safety database by our pharmacovigilance team, in compliance with global and local regulatory requirements.  
 Collected data is then used to perform signal detection activities (routinely, monthly and quarterly) and prepare periodic aggregate safety reports to evaluate the benefit-risk profile of our products.
 Government Regulation 
 Canadian Regulatory Framework
 On October 17, 2018, the Cannabis Regulations under the Cannabis Act came into force (the “Cannabis Regulations”). The Cannabis Regulations set out the following classes of licenses that authorized activities in relation to cannabis:
  
• | a license for cultivation;
--+---------------------------


• | a license for processing;
--+--------------------------


• | a license for analytical testing;
--+----------------------------------


• | a license for sale for medical purposes;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | a license for research; and
--+----------------------------


• | a cannabis drug license.
--+-------------------------

 Prior to October 17, 2018, cannabis was governed by the Controlled Drug and Substances Act (Canada) (“CDSA”). Under the CDSA, the Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations (“ACMPR”) set out a framework to provide individuals with access to cannabis for medical purposes and was the governing legislation in respect of the production, sale and distribution of medical cannabis and related oil extracts in Canada. Although the ACMPR were repealed, the regulatory framework applicable to cannabis for medical purposes was substantially reproduced within the Cannabis Act with minimal changes.
 Pursuant to the transitional provisions outlined in the Cannabis Act, we transitioned all licenses held under the ACMPR regulatory framework to the new Cannabis Act; therefore, all licenses remain active due to the regulatory change that occurred on October 17, 2018.
 At the end of each term of their respective licenses, a license holder must submit an application for renewal to Health Canada containing information prescribed by the Cannabis Act.
 The Cannabis Act legalized recreational cannabis use nationwide in Canada. It creates a legal framework for controlling the production, distribution, sale and possession of cannabis across Canada for both medical and recreational purposes. Subject to provincial or territorial restrictions, adults who are 18 years of age or older are legally able to:

• | possess up to 30 grams of legal cannabis, dried or equivalent in non-dried form in public;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | share up to 30 grams of legal cannabis, dried or equivalent in non-dried form with other adults;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | buy dried or fresh cannabis and cannabis oil from a provincially licensed retailer;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | grow, from licensed seed or seedlings, up to four cannabis plants per residence for personal use; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | make cannabis products, such as food and drinks, at home as long as organic solvents are not used to create concentrated products.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In the initial stage of the regulated recreational cannabis market, products available for sale were the same as those permitted in the medical cannabis market (dried flowers, oils and softgels and dried cannabis products). On October 17, 2019, the second phase of recreational cannabis products, specifically, edible cannabis products, cannabis extracts, and cannabis topical products, were legalized pursuant to certain amendments to the regulations under the Cannabis Act.  Edible cannabis products, cannabis extracts, and cannabis topical products, which are now available for sale, are subject to additional regulatory requirements that include supplemental marketing and advertising rules, further restrictions on labelling and packaging, rules relating to ingredients of edible cannabis products and cannabis extracts, limits on THC content, and added production facility requirements.
 15

Further, the current regime for medical cannabis will continue to allow access to cannabis to people who have the authorization of their healthcare provider.
 Under the Cannabis Act, license holders are only able to distribute medical cannabis through the mail to registered customers.  The Cannabis Act also provides provincial and municipal governments with the authority to prescribe regulations regarding retail and distribution of recreational cannabis, as well as the ability to alter some of the existing baseline requirements, such as increasing the minimum age for purchase and consumption. As the distribution and sale of cannabis for recreational purposes is regulated under the individual authority of each provincial and territorial government, regulatory regimes vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In each of the provinces and territories, except for Saskatchewan, a provincial distributor is responsible for purchasing cannabis from producers and selling products to its regulated retail distribution channels. 
 The Cannabis Act mandates that three years following its coming into force, the Minister will cause a review of the legislation and its administration and operation, including a review of the impact of the legislation on public health, on the health and consumption habits of young persons, the impact of cannabis on Indigenous persons and communities, and the impact of the cultivation of cannabis plants in a dwelling-house.  No later than 18 months after the review begins, the Minister must cause a report on the review, including any finding or recommendations, to be laid before each House of Parliament. 
 In addition, in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Quebec and Yukon, the provincial body is solely responsible for online sales. However, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many retail cannabis stores across the country have been operating under COVID restrictions which vary province to province and range from reduced in store capacity to mandated curbside pick up, click and collect or delivery only, including all of our corporate-owned stores in Newfoundland and Labrador, Manitoba, Alberta, and Saskatchewan. Please refer to “Risk Factors” under Item 1A and “Part 1 – Business Overview—Update on COVID-19” under Item 7 of this Annual Report for further discussion.
 With respect to retail sales of cannabis, other than online sales, the provincial and territorial regulations in Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, Quebec and New Brunswick allow only for government-run cannabis stores, while the provincial and territorial regulations in Ontario, Alberta, Newfoundland and Labrador, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Yukon, Saskatchewan and Manitoba leave the retail sale of cannabis, other than online sales, to the private sector. In British Columbia, provincial and territorial regulations allow for a hybrid model in which both public and private stores can operate. 
 The Cannabis Act also includes several measures to help prevent youth from accessing cannabis, including both age restrictions and restrictions on the promotion of cannabis. Regulations under the Cannabis Act include the following labeling and branding requirements: 
  
• | plain packaging, including a standardized cannabis symbol on every label;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | mandatory health warning messages (including specifics regarding size, placement and appearance);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a limit of one brand element aside from the brand name;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | no other image or graphic;
--+---------------------------


• | the packaging and the label need to be a single, uniform color;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | use of fluorescent or metallic colors is prohibited;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | labels and packaging cannot have any embossing; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | no inserts can be included.
--+----------------------------

 The Cannabis Act also discourages youth cannabis use by prohibiting products that are appealing to youth, packaging or labeling cannabis in a way that makes it appealing to youth, selling cannabis through self-service displays or vending machines, or promoting cannabis, except in narrow circumstances, where young people cannot see the promotion. The new legislation also helps protect public health by creating strict safety and quality regulations.
 In connection with the new framework for regulating cannabis in Canada, the Canadian federal government has introduced new penalties under the Criminal Code (Canada), including penalties for the illegal sale of cannabis, possession of cannabis over the prescribed limit, production of cannabis beyond personal cultivation limits, taking cannabis across the Canadian border, giving or selling cannabis to a youth and involving a youth to commit a cannabis-related offense.
 Most recently, the Canadian federal government triggered a public consultation which would introduce the following three categories of amendments to the cannabis regulatory regime in Canada:
  
• | Amend the Cannabis Exemption (Food and Drugs Act) Regulations to create an exemption from the application of the Food and Drugs Act for certain non-therapeutic research on cannabis authorized under the proposed regulations; such research would remain regulated under the Cannabis Act and the Cannabis Regulations. The amendments would also make a number of changes to the Cannabis Regulations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Introduce a series of amendments to the Cannabis Regulations designed to support testing activities with cannabis.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increase the quantity of cannabis beverage equivalent to 1 g of dried cannabis, which would have the effect of increasing the public possession limit for cannabis beverages from 2 100 g (2.1 L) to 17 100 g (17.1 L) by amending Schedule 3 to the Cannabis Act.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

U.S. Regulatory Framework
 On February 8, 2018, the Canadian Securities Administrators revised their previously released Staff Notice which provides specific disclosure expectations for issuers that currently have, or are in the process of developing, cannabis-related activities in the United States as permitted within a particular state’s regulatory framework. All issuers with U.S. cannabis-related activities are expected to clearly and prominently disclose certain prescribed information in prospectus filings and other required disclosure documents.
 In addition, on October 16, 2017, the TSX provided clarity regarding the application of Sections 306 (Minimum Listing Requirements) and 325 (Management) and Part VII (Halting of Trading, Suspension and Delisting of Securities) of the TSX Company Manual (collectively, the “TSX Requirements”) to applicants and TSX-listed issuers with business activities in the cannabis sector. In TSX Staff Notice 2017-0009, the TSX notes that issuers with ongoing business activities that violate U.S. federal law regarding cannabis are not in compliance with the TSX Requirements. These business activities may include:
  
• | direct or indirect ownership of, or investment in, entities engaging in activities related to the cultivation, distribution or possession of cannabis in the United States,
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | commercial interests or arrangements with such entities,
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | providing services or products specifically targeted to such entities, or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | commercial interests or arrangements with entities engaging in providing services or products to U.S. cannabis companies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The TSX reminded issuers that, among other things, should the TSX find that a listed issuer is engaging in activities contrary to the TSX Requirements, the TSX has the discretion to initiate a delisting review.
 Unlike in Canada, which has uniform federal legislation governing the cultivation, distribution, sale and possession of cannabis under the Cannabis Act, in the United States, cannabis is regulated at both the federal and state levels. Notwithstanding the permissive regulatory environment of cannabis in some states, cannabis continues to be categorized as a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”), making it illegal under federal law in the United States to cultivate, distribute, or possess cannabis. This means that while state law in certain U.S. states may take a permissive approach to medical and/or recreational use of cannabis, the CSA may still be enforced by U.S. federal law enforcement officials against citizens and businesses of those states for activity that is legal under state law.
 As a result of the conflicting views between state legislatures and the U.S. federal government regarding cannabis, investments in cannabis businesses in the United States are subject to inconsistent legislation and regulation. The response to this inconsistency was first addressed in August 2013 when then Deputy Attorney General James Cole authored a memorandum (the “Cole Memorandum”), noting that in jurisdictions that have enacted laws legalizing cannabis in some form and that have also implemented strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems to control the cultivation, distribution, sale and possession of cannabis, conduct in compliance with those laws and regulations is less likely to be a priority at the federal level. 
 In light of limited investigative and prosecutorial resources, the Cole Memorandum concluded that the Department of Justice should be focused on addressing only the most significant threats related to cannabis. The Cole Memorandum was later rescinded by U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions under the Trump Administration.
 On March 11, 2021, Merrick Garland was appointed as U.S. Attorney General.  At his confirmation hearing, he said, “It does not seem to me a useful use of limited resources that we have, to be pursuing prosecutions in states that have legalized and that are regulating the use of marijuana, either medically or otherwise”. He has not yet reissued the Cole Memorandum, however, or issued substitute guidance.   In the fiscal 2022 omnibus spending bill, Congress included the Rohrabacher-Farr amendment which prohibits the Department of Justice from spending funds to interfere with the implementation of state medical cannabis laws until September 30, 2022. Please refer to “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this Annual Report for further discussion.
 Additionally, under U.S. federal law it may, under certain circumstances, be a violation of federal money laundering statutes for financial institutions to accept any proceeds from cannabis sales or any other Schedule I controlled substances. Certain Canadian banks are similarly reluctant to transact business with U.S. cannabis companies, due to the uncertain legal and regulatory framework characterizing the industry at present. Banks and other financial institutions could be prosecuted and possibly convicted of money laundering for providing services to U.S. cannabis businesses. Under U.S. federal law, banks or other financial institutions that provide a cannabis business with a checking account, debit or credit card, small business loan or any other service could be found guilty of money laundering or conspiracy. Despite these laws, in February 2014, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FCEN”) of the U.S. Treasury Department issued a memorandum (the “FCEN Memo”) providing instructions to banks seeking to provide services to cannabis-related businesses. The FCEN Memo states that in some circumstances, it is permissible for banks to provide services to cannabis-related businesses without risking prosecution for violation of federal money laundering laws. It refers to supplementary guidance that Deputy Attorney General Cole issued to federal prosecutors relating to the prosecution of money laundering offenses predicated on cannabis-related violations of the CSA. It is unclear at this time whether the current administration will follow the guidelines of the FCEN Memo.
 Multiple legislative reforms related to cannabis and cannabis-related banking are currently being considered by the federal government in the United States. Examples include the Strengthening the Tenth Amendment Through Entrusting States Act, the 
 17

Marijuana Opportunity, Reinvestment and Expungement Act and the Secure and Fair Enforcement Banking Act. There can be no assurance that any of these pieces of legislation will become law in the United States.
 While we have several arrangements with U.S.-based companies that may themselves participate in the United States cannabis market, these relationships do not violate the federal laws of the United States respecting cannabis and in no manner involve Canopy Growth in any activities in the United States respecting cannabis. As discussed below, certain entities in which we hold securities may operate in the United States cannabis industry, however, our investment in such entities has been structured such that we hold non-participating, non-voting securities that are only exercisable or exchangeable upon cannabis becoming legal or permissible in the United States under federal law. Further, we have developed specific plans related to establishing business operations in the United States in the event cannabis becomes federally permissible which are discussed below.
 On December 20, 2018, the 2018 Farm Bill was signed into law in the United States. The 2018 Farm Bill, among other things, defines industrial hemp, removes industrial hemp and its cannabinoids, including CBD derived from industrial hemp but excluding THC, from the CSA and allows for industrial hemp production and sale in the United States. The passage of the 2018 Farm Bill has allowed us to advance our hemp interests in the United States. The FDA has retained authority over the addition of CBD to products that fall within the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”). So far, the FDA has stated that (a), to date, it has approved only one CBD product (a prescription drug to treat two forms of epilepsy), (b) it has seen only limited data about CBD safety and the data it has seen points to risks that need to be considered before taking CBD for any reason, (c) some CBD products are being marketed with unproven medical claims and are of unknown quality and (d) it is currently illegal to market CBD by adding it to a food or labeling it as a dietary supplement. Since the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, the FDA has periodically issued warning letters to CBD companies, which have been sent for the most part to companies making unfounded medical claims related to major diseases regarding their products. Courts have found that the FDA’s position on CBD amounts to guidance and have stayed cases until FDA issues final regulations. Some states take the position that CBD products are not legally permitted to be sold, but increasingly more states are allowing CBD foods, beverages, and supplements to be sold in-state and issuing more comprehensive regulations for the testing and labelling of those products.
 There can be no assurance that the FDA will approve CBD as an additive to products under the FDCA. However, the FDA has expressed a willingness to take a flexible regulatory approach to foster the development of hemp-derived products such as CBD. On February 26, 2020, then-FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said, “We know one thing, the American people are using CBD products.  People are using these products.  We’re not going to be able to say you can’t use these products.  It’s a fools’ game to try to even approach that.” The FDA has indicated that any regulations allowing CBD in regulated products will have to fit under the confines of current law and further legislation will likely be required. A pending House bill with bipartisan support, the Hemp and Hemp-Derived CBD Consumer Protection and Market Stabilization Act of 2021, would allow hemp and hemp-derived CBD to be legally marketed in dietary supplements. However, there can be no assurance that any legislation will pass Congress or become law. 
 The Acreage Arrangement
 On June 27, 2019, Canopy Growth and Acreage implemented the Original Acreage Arrangement pursuant to the Acreage Arrangement Agreement, which granted Canopy Growth the right (and obligation) to acquire, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions contained in the Acreage Arrangement Agreement, all of the issued and outstanding securities of Acreage contingent on the occurrence or waiver of the changes in U.S. federal law to permit the general cultivation, distribution and possession of marijuana or to remove the regulation of such activities from the federal laws of the United States (the “Triggering Event”). Pursuant to the Acreage Arrangement Agreement, upon the implementation of the Original Acreage Arrangement, shareholders of Acreage and certain other securityholders received an upfront payment of US$300 million. In connection with the Original Acreage Arrangement, Canopy Growth and Acreage executed a licensing agreement (the “Original Acreage Licensing Agreement”) which provides Acreage with the ability to use Canopy Growth’s brands, along with other intellectual property, on a no-fee basis. In accordance with the Original Acreage Licensing Agreement, in December 2019 Acreage began selling certain Tweed-branded cannabis products at select dispensaries in Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts and Oregon. Any products sold by Acreage under the Tweed brand in the United States are cultivated and processed by Acreage at its facilities in the respective states in the United States where permissible under state laws. 
 On June 24, 2020, Canopy Growth and Acreage entered into a proposal agreement (the “Proposal Agreement”) in order to, among other things, implement the Acreage Amended Arrangement. In September 2020, Acreage obtained the requisite approvals of the shareholders of Acreage and the Supreme Court of British Columbia and on September 23, 2020, Canopy Growth and Acreage entered into the Acreage Amending Agreement and implemented the Acreage Amended Arrangement. The Acreage Amended Arrangement provides for, among other things, the following: 
  
(a) | a capital reorganization of Acreage, pursuant to which (i) each outstanding Acreage Class A subordinated voting share (“Acreage Existing SVS”) was exchanged for 0.7 of an Acreage Fixed Share (as defined below) and 0.3 of an Acreage Floating Share (as defined below); (ii) each outstanding Acreage Class B proportionate voting share (“Acreage Existing PVS”) was exchanged for 28 Acreage Fixed Shares and 12 Acreage Floating Shares; and (iii) each outstanding Acreage Class C multiple voting share (“Acreage Existing MVS”) was exchanged for 0.7 of an Acreage Fixed Multiple Share (as defined below) and 0.3 of an Acreage Floating Share;
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 18

 
(b) | following the occurrence or waiver (at our discretion) of the Triggering Event and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set out in the Acreage Arrangement Agreement (as modified by the Acreage Amending Agreement), we will acquire all of the Class E subordinated voting shares (the “Acreage Fixed Shares”) based on an amended exchange ratio equal to 0.3048 of a Canopy Growth share for each Acreage Fixed Share, subject to adjustment in accordance with the Acreage Amended Arrangement;
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(c) | upon the occurrence or waiver (at our discretion) of the Triggering Event and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set out in the Acreage Arrangement Agreement (as modified by the Acreage Amending Agreement), we will have the right exercisable for a period of 30 days thereafter, to acquire all of the Class D subordinated voting shares (the “Acreage Floating Shares”) for cash or Canopy Growth shares or a combination thereof, in our discretion, at a price equal to the 30-day volume weighted average trading price of the Acreage Floating Shares, subject to a minimum price of US$6.41 per Acreage Floating Share;
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(d) | immediately prior to the acquisition of the Acreage Fixed Shares, each Class F multiple voting shares (each, an “Acreage Fixed Multiple Share”) will automatically be exchanged for one Acreage Fixed Share and thereafter be acquired by us;
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(e) | if the occurrence or waiver of the Triggering Event does not occur within by September 23, 2030, our rights will terminate; and
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(f) | we made a payment to certain securityholders of Acreage of approximately US$37.5 million.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We also entered into an amended and restated license agreement (the “A&R Acreage License”) in connection with the Proposal Agreement to amend and restate the Original Acreage Licensing Agreement. Pursuant to the A&R Acreage License, Acreage has the non-exclusive right to use and sublicense the intellectual property that is subject to the A&R Acreage License within the United States.
We also advanced US$50 million to Universal Hemp, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Acreage (“Acreage Hempco”) on September 23, 2020, pursuant to a secured debenture (the “Hempco Debenture”). In accordance with the terms of the Hempco Debenture, the funds advanced to Acreage Hempco cannot be used, directly or indirectly, in connection with or for any cannabis or cannabis-related operations in the United States, unless and until such operations comply with all applicable laws of the United States. The Hempco Debenture bears interest at a rate of 6.1% per annum and matures on September 23, 2030, or such earlier date in accordance with the terms of the Hempco Debenture. 
 The acquisition of Acreage, if completed, will provide a pathway into cannabis markets in the United States; however, Canopy Growth and Acreage will continue to operate as independent companies until the acquisition of Acreage is completed.
 Wana Purchase Option
 On October 14, 2021, we and Wana entered into the Wana Agreements providing us with the right, upon the occurrence or waiver (at our discretion) of the Triggering Event, to acquire 100% of the outstanding membership interests of Wana. Wana manufactures and sells gummies in the state of Colorado and licenses its intellectual property to partners, who manufacture, distribute, and sell Wana-branded gummies across the United States, including in California, Arizona, Illinois, Michigan and Florida. Wana currently has a footprint in 13 U.S. states as well as in Puerto Rico, and across Canada. Wana expects to have license agreements in place in up to a total of 20 U.S. states, including in future adult-use markets in New York and New Jersey, prior to the end of calendar 2022. Until such time as we exercise our right to acquire each Wana Entity, we will have no economic or voting interest in Wana, we will not control Wana, and we and Wana will continue to operate independently.
Other U.S. Holdings
 While we do not engage in activities in the United States relating to cultivating and distributing cannabis so long as cannabis remains illegal under United States federal law, certain companies that we have invested in may operate in the United States cannabis industry, provided that the securities held by Canopy Growth are non-participating and non-voting securities that are only convertible, exercisable, or exchangeable for common shares upon cannabis becoming legal or permissible in the United States under federal law. For instance, TerrAscend and SLANG Worldwide Inc. (“SLANG”) have interests in cannabis-related business in the United States, we have undertaken steps to structure our security holdings in these entities to insulate Canopy Growth from engaging in any unlawful United States cannabis-related activities.
 Canopy Growth holds conditionally exchangeable shares (the “TerrAscend Exchangeable Shares”) and common share purchase warrants in the capital of TerrAscend as well as an option (the “TerrAscend Option”) to acquire common shares of TerrAscend. The TerrAscend Exchangeable Shares are not entitled to voting rights, dividends or other rights upon dissolution of TerrAscend but are convertible into common shares of TerrAscend upon receipt of the approval of the stock exchanges upon which Canopy Growth’s securities are listed and following either changes in United States federal laws regarding the cultivation, distribution or possession of cannabis or changes in the policies of the stock exchanges upon which Canopy Growth’s securities are listed with respect to such activities. The TerrAscend Exchangeable Shares do not provide (and there are no related contractual rights that would otherwise provide) us with any right to dividends, entitlements upon dissolution of TerrAscend, cash flow or other current economic entitlements, voting rights or any form of control over the business, affairs, operation or financial condition of TerrAscend. The TerrAscend warrants and the TerrAscend Option described above are only exercisable upon the occurrence or waiver of the Triggering Event.
 19

Similarly, Canopy Growth holds conditionally exercisable warrants in the capital of SLANG. Canopy Growth is not permitted to exercise the warrants without, among other things, receipt of the approval of the stock exchanges upon which Canopy Growth’s securities are listed and following the date that the growth, cultivation, production, sale, use and consumption of cannabis and cannabis-related products are permitted in the United States for any and all purposes (including medical, therapeutic and recreational) under all applicable federal laws of the United States, including the CSA.
 Further, Canopy Growth has the right, upon the occurrence or waiver (at our discretion) of the Triggering Event, to acquire up to 100% of the outstanding capital stock of Jetty, a California-based producer of cannabis extracts and vape technology. Jetty has developed industry-leading capabilities in extraction and clean vape technology and, upon the occurrence or waiver (at our discretion) of the Triggering Event, would give Canopy Growth a critical position in the largest and most historically significant THC market in the United States.  Until such time as Canopy Sub elects to exercise its rights to acquire Jetty, Canopy Growth and Canopy Sub will have no direct or indirect economic or voting interests in Jetty, Canopy Growth and Canopy Sub will not directly or indirectly control Jetty, and Canopy Growth and Canopy Sub, on the one hand, and Jetty, on the other hand, will continue to operate independently of one another.
 We may also acquire rights, options or other securities in other entities that are currently engaged in activities in the United States related to cultivating and distributing cannabis that are only exercisable, convertible, or exchangeable for common shares following the date that the federal laws in the United States in regards to cannabis are amended and/or, if applicable, the date that the stock exchange(s) upon which the common shares are listed permit the investment in an entity that is involved in the cultivation or distribution of marijuana in the United States, provided that we (i) do not provide funds to such entities, and (ii) are not entitled to voting rights, dividends, or other rights upon dissolution in connection with the holding of such rights, options, or other securities. We may also invest in or loan funds to subsidiaries of entities that are currently engaged in activities in the United States related to cultivating and distributing cannabis, provided that (i) such subsidiaries do not engage in activities in the United States related to cultivating and distributing cannabis, and (ii) the funds invested or loaned to such entity are only used for lawful purposes and not in connection with activities in the United States related to cultivating and distributing cannabis.
 
We monitor the activities of TerrAscend, SLANG and other entities in which we are invested for compliance with United States cannabis laws and would make similar arrangements, if necessary, to ensure our ongoing compliance with United States federal laws.
 There is a risk that our interpretation of laws, regulations and guidelines, including, but not limited to, the Cannabis Act, the associated regulations, various United States state regulations and applicable stock exchange rules and regulations may differ from those of others, including those of government authorities, securities regulators and stock exchanges. In addition, we have and will endeavor to cause the entities that we invest in, to only conduct business and invest in entities in federally legal jurisdictions by including appropriate representations, warranties and covenants in our agreements with such entities. Any violation of these terms would result in a breach of the applicable agreement between such entity and us and, accordingly, may have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. In particular, we may be required to divest its interest in an entity or risk significant fines, penalties, administrative sanctions, convictions, settlements or delisting from the TSX and/or NASDAQ and there is no assurance that any divestiture will be completed on terms favorable to us, or at all. Please refer to “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this Annual Report for further discussion.
 Competition 
 Health Canada issues licenses to cultivate, process and/or sell cannabis under the Cannabis Act. According to the Health Canada website, as of May 26, 2022, over 860 licenses to cultivate, distribute or sell cannabis have been issued.  When considering the competitive landscape for cannabis production, cultivation and sale, each license issued by Health Canada is connected to a specific entity and a specific property, so to commence a new production site, an entity must apply for a new license. With the demand for legal cannabis increasing and given the early stage of the recreational cannabis market, as more Cannabis 2.0 products are launched, we expect that new competitors will enter the market. In the recreational market, we compete on the basis of quality, price, brand recognition, consistency and variety of cannabis products with the same competitive factors that apply in the medical market, in addition to physician familiarity with cannabis products.
 Certain companies in the Canadian cannabis market have elected to enter into contract manufacturing arrangements with license holders pursuant to which the license holder cultivates, processes and sells cannabis under the brand of the contracting company without the contracting company being required to own its own cannabis production assets. This can reduce the barriers to entry for branding companies and increase the number of cannabis products available to consumers; however, such arrangements are contingent on procuring favorable terms under manufacturing arrangements with license holders and are still subject to the ongoing requirements of maintaining cannabis production assets.  
 In addition, there are illegal growers and retailers of cannabis, operating in the illicit market that, while operating illegally, still act as competitors by either diverting customers away due to product choice, perceived quality of product, convenience of access or price point.

In regards to hemp-derived CBD, with the increased interest in CBD in Canada, the United States and internationally, the hemp-derived CBD market will likely continue to expand. Market entrants in Canada and the United States face regulatory hurdles which may impede access to the market, as well as regulatory uncertainty surrounding the treatment of CBD in both the U.S. and Canada.
 Internationally, the capacity of cannabis companies to operate is limited to those countries which have legalized aspects of the production, distribution, sale and use of cannabis. We continue to seek out opportunities internationally by engaging with local cannabis and business experts.
 Our BioSteel, This Works and Storz & Bickel subsidiaries, are each subject to their own unique competitive considerations.  
 The CBI Group Investments 
 On November 2, 2017, Greenstar Canada Investment Limited Partnership (“Greenstar”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of CBI, invested CDN$245 million in Canopy Growth in exchange for (i) 18,876,901 common shares; and (ii) 18,876,901 common share purchase warrants exercisable at an exercise price per common share of CDN$12.9783 (the “Greenstar Warrants”). 
 In connection with our offering of 4.25% convertible senior notes due 2023 (the “Canopy Notes”) pursuant to an indenture dated June 20, 2018, among Canopy Growth, GLAS Trust Company LLC and Computershare Trust Company of Canada, Greenstar purchased CDN$200 million worth of Canopy Notes, which are convertible in certain circumstances and subject to certain conditions into an aggregate of 4,151,540 common shares. 
 On November 1, 2018, CBG Holdings LLC (“CBG”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of CBI, invested CDN$5.079 billion in Canopy Growth in exchange for (i) 104,500,000 common shares at a price of CDN$48.60 per common share, and (ii) 139,745,453 common share purchase warrants (the “CBG Warrants”), of which 88,472,861 CGB Warrants (the “Tranche A Warrants”) had an exercise price of CDN$50.40 and were exercisable until November 1, 2021 and the remaining 51,272,592 CBG Warrants (the “Original Tranche B Warrants”) had an exercise price based on the five-day volume weighted average price of the common shares on the TSX at the time of exercise and will become immediately exercisable only following the exercise of the Tranche A Warrants. 
 In connection with the Acreage Arrangement Agreement, Canopy Growth and CBG entered into a consent agreement dated April 18, 2019 (the “Consent Agreement”) pursuant to which Canopy Growth agreed to (a) the extension of the expiry date of the Tranche A Warrants from November 1, 2021 until November 1, 2023, (b) the extension of the expiry date of the Original Tranche B Warrants from November 1, 2021 until November 1, 2026; and (c) the amendment of the exercise price for 38,454,444 of the Original Tranche B Warrants, such that 38,454,444 Tranche B Warrants (as defined below) will be exercisable to acquire one common share at a price of CDN$76.68 rather than the five-day volume weighted average trading price of the common shares at the time of exercise. 
 On May 1, 2020, the Greenstar Warrants were exercised on May 1, 2020, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately CDN$245 million. 
 As of May 26, 2022, the CBI Group holds, in the aggregate, 142,253,802 common shares, 139,745,453 CBG Warrants and CDN$200 million principal amount of Canopy Notes. The common shares held by the CBI Group represent approximately 35.3% of the issued and outstanding common shares. Assuming full exercise of the CBG Warrants and full conversion of the Canopy Notes, the CBI Group would hold 286,150,795 common shares, representing approximately 52.3% of the issued and outstanding common shares (assuming no other changes in Canopy Growth’s issued and outstanding common shares), calculated in accordance with applicable securities laws.
 Investor Rights Agreement
 Canopy Growth and the CBI Group also entered into the second amended and restated investor rights agreement dated April 18, 2019 among CBG, Greenstar and Canopy Growth (the “New Investor Rights Agreement”), which amended the first amended and restated investor rights agreement dated November 1, 2018 between CBG, Greenstar and Canopy Growth, pursuant to which the CBI Group has certain governance rights which are summarized below. 
 Pursuant to the New Investor Rights Agreement, the CBI Group is entitled to designate four nominees for election or appointment to our board of directors for so long as the CBI Group holds a specified number of common shares or securities convertible into common shares (the “Target Number of Shares”). Additionally, under the New Investor Rights Agreement, the CBI Group has certain pre-emptive rights as well as certain top-up rights in order to maintain its pro rata equity ownership position in Canopy Growth in connection with any offering or distribution of securities by Canopy Growth (subject to certain exceptions).
 The New Investor Rights Agreement provides that so long as the CBI Group continues to hold at least the Target Number of Shares, our board of directors will not: (i) propose or resolve to change the size of the board, except where otherwise required by law, or with the consent of CBG; or (ii) present a slate of board nominees to shareholders for election that is greater than or fewer than seven directors. In addition, the New Investor Rights Agreement provides that, subject to certain conditions, so long as the CBI Group continues to hold at least the Target Number of Shares, the CBI Group will adhere to certain non-competition restrictions including that we will be their exclusive strategic vehicle for cannabis products of any kind anywhere in the world (subject to limited exceptions. Further, the CBI Group agreed, for a limited period of time and subject to certain exceptions, to certain post-termination, non-competition restrictions, which include not pursuing other cannabis opportunities and not directly or indirectly participating in a competing business anywhere in the world.
 21

Pursuant to the New Investor Rights Agreement, for so long as the CBI Group continues to hold at least the Target Number of Shares, we will not, without the prior written consent of CBG, among other things, (a) consolidate or merge into or with another person or enter into any other similar business combination, including pursuant to any amalgamation, arrangement, recapitalization or reorganization, other than a consolidation, merger or other similar business combination of any wholly-owned subsidiary or an amalgamation or arrangement involving a subsidiary with a another person in connection with a permitted acquisition; (b) acquire any shares or similar equity interests, instruments convertible into or exchangeable for shares or similar equity interests, assets, business or operations with an aggregate value of more than CDN$250 million, in a single transaction or a series of related transactions; (c) sell, transfer, lease, pledge or otherwise dispose of any of its or any of its subsidiaries’ assets, business or operations (in a single transaction or a series of related transactions) in the aggregate with a value of more than CDN$20 million; or (d) make any changes to our policy with respect to the declaration and payment of any dividends on the common shares.
 In accordance with the New Investor Rights Agreement, CBI Group will be permitted, prior to the exercise or expiry of all of the CBG Warrants, to purchase up to 20,000,000 common shares (subject to customary adjustments for share splits, consolidations or other changes to the outstanding share capital of a similar nature): (i) on the TSX, NASDAQ or any other stock exchange, marketplace or trading market on which the common shares are then listed; or (ii) through private agreement transactions with existing holders of common shares, provided that CBG must promptly notify Canopy Growth of any acquisition of common shares.
 The New Investor Rights Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of: (i) the mutual consent of the parties; (ii) the date on which the CBI Group owns less than 33,000,000 common shares; and (iii) the date of a non-appealable court order terminating the New Investor Rights Agreement under certain circumstances.
 Consent Agreement
 In addition to the amendments to the CBG Warrants, pursuant to the Consent Agreement, we agreed that without the prior written consent of CBG, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, we will not (i) exercise our right to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Acreage prior to the Triggering Event; (ii) amend, modify, supplement or restate the Acreage Arrangement Agreement; or (iii) waive any terms, covenants or conditions set forth in the Acreage Arrangement Agreement. 
 In addition, we agreed that, in the event that CBG exercises the Tranche A Warrants in full, we will purchase the lesser of (i) 27,378,866 common shares, and (ii) common shares with a value of CDN$1,582,995,262, during the period commencing on April 18, 2019 and ending on the date that is 24 months after the date that CBG exercises all of the Tranche A Warrants. If, for any reason, we do not purchase for cancellation the common shares within such period, we are required to pay to CBG an amount (the “Credit Amount”), as liquidated damages, equal to the difference between: (i) CDN$1,582,995,262; and (ii) the actual purchase price we paid in purchasing common shares pursuant to the Consent Agreement. The Credit Amount will reduce the aggregate exercise price otherwise payable by CBG upon each exercise of the Tranche B Warrants and the Tranche C Warrants (as defined below)). 
 We also agreed that if the CBI Group receives any notification or communication of any violation or contravention of applicable law or any liability to the CBI Group under applicable law or any notification or communication that would be expected to result in a violation or contravention of applicable law or any actual liability to the CBI Group under applicable law, as a result of the license agreement between us and Acreage, CBG has the right to direct and cause us to terminate the license agreement in accordance with its terms, provided that we will have an opportunity to cure any such violation, contravention or liability and CBG will be required to take all commercially reasonable efforts to assist us in addressing such violation, contravention or liability.
 Concurrent with the execution of the Proposal Agreement, on June 24, 2020, Canopy Growth and CBG entered into a second consent agreement (the “Second Consent Agreement”). As the transactions contemplated by the Proposal Agreement may result in certain taxes owing by CBG or its affiliates, we agreed, pursuant to the Second Consent Agreement, to indemnify CBG and its affiliates for such taxes and losses incurred in relation to such taxes, subject to certain exceptions.
 
Human Capital Resources 
 As of March 31, 2022, we had 3,151 total employees, including 2,174 full-time employees in Canada. As of March 31, 2022, we had 540 employees outside of Canada, including in the United States. Our employees in production roles are critical to the success of our key markets. As of March 31, 2022, we had a total of 1,363 employees in production roles in Canada, 80 in the United States, 125 in Europe. As of March 31, 2022, a total of 24 employees are unionized in Canada. 
 
Our human resources department is striving to make Canopy Growth a first-choice employer in the cannabis industry. In fiscal 2022, we focused on the following three key priorities to action: (1) ensuring we have top talent in roles most critical to organizational success; (2) building infrastructure needed to scale the Company and continuously re-evaluating its fitness for purpose; and (3) actively engaging with our people and reinforcing behaviors foundational to our success. Supporting these three key priorities are a number of specific programs and initiatives highlighted below. 
 Our Total Rewards philosophy includes rewarding employees competitively, treating our employees fairly, and providing the flexibility needed to cultivate greatness. In fiscal 2022, we continued to execute against our Total Rewards road map of programs designed to attract, motivate, recognize, reward, and retain the talent we need to realize our vision and deliver on our growth expectations, while holistically supporting total employee well-being. 
 22

We also launched our first company-wide engagement survey to gather employee feedback and establish a baseline from which to undertake further action planning about how we can continuously improve our workplace and employee experience. 
 
In ongoing support of our employees during the COVID-19 pandemic, we initiated or continued a number of mental-health programs and offered supplemental resources.  These included wellness webinars, virtual yoga and meditation sessions and a variety of online resources to help navigate the pandemic, all of which were available to all of our employees. In addition, we continued to support remote work and offered a number of vaccine clinics at various sites which were open to employees and their friends and families to help reduce the spread of the virus. Fostering a culture of accountability and compliance is also central to effective human capital management. All of our employees completed annual training on applicable corporate policies including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Whistleblower Protection Policy, Insider Trading Policy and Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy.
 
As part of our talent management strategy, we invest in employee education and skills development through Canopy Growth Learning, our online learning management system, for regulatory requirements and corporate policies as noted above, and to build professional skills and capabilities to support career advancement. We encourage frequent performance check-ins between managers and their team members to discuss performance, development, and growth. In fiscal 2021, we implemented a formalized objective-setting process to provide our employees with clarity of focus and to understand how their work supports our organizational priorities.  Additionally, we implemented talent reviews at the Vice-President level to assess our bench strength and inform development plans and created a formal succession plan for our Executive C-suite positions to support business continuity. 
 Through our internal Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (“DEI”) efforts, we are committed to embedding equity into every part of the organization and creating an inclusive organizational environment. To accomplish this, we completed an extensive audit of DEI practices, policies and processes and subsequently developed a multi-year strategy that is supported by our Executive Management team.   Through programming and participation in our Employee Resource Groups, which help people from historically excluded groups build community internally, providing learning and development opportunities to support people leaders' ability to mitigate biases and we have established initiatives to support people with disabilities.
