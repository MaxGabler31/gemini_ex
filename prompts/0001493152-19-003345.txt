ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 
PCM, Inc. is a leading multi-vendor provider of technology solutions, including hardware products, software and services, offered through our dedicated sales force, ecommerce channels and technology services teams. Since our founding in 1987, we have served our customers by offering products and services from vendors such as Adobe, Apple, Cisco, Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, HP Inc., Lenovo, Microsoft, Oracle, Symantec, Synnex and VMware. We provide our customers with comprehensive solutions incorporating leading products and services across a variety of technology practices and platforms such as cloud, security, data center, networking, collaboration and mobility. Our sales and marketing efforts allow our vendor partners to reach multiple customer segments including small, medium and enterprise businesses, state, local and federal governments and educational institutions.
 
In recent years, we have completed several strategic acquisitions to increase the capabilities, scale and value we provide our customers and partners, as follows:
 

● | En Pointe: In April 2015, we acquired certain assets of En Pointe Technologies, one of the nation’s largest independent IT solutions providers, headquartered in Southern California. This acquisition has significantly enhanced our relationships with several key vendor partners, provided incremental advanced technical certifications and operational expertise in key practice areas, and has provided our consolidated business significantly increased scale, especially in the enterprise and public sector spaces.

● | Acrodex: In October 2015, we acquired Acrodex, Inc., an Edmonton, Alberta (Canada) based solution provider. Acrodex provides full end-to-end infrastructure solutions primarily to Canadian based commercial and governmental customers from initial plan and design, through procurement and installation, to full support and on-going management. Acrodex’s core business areas include software value-added reseller services, software asset management and hardware sales and services, including client device products, servers, storage, networks, printers and a full complement of accessories and devices. Services are a significant component to Acrodex’s product mix and include managed services, cloud-based services, consulting, IT management and other IT service areas. This acquisition enhances our ability to provide full solutions to customers across the United States and Canada. 
● | TigerDirect: In December 2015, we acquired certain Business to Business (B2B) assets of Systemax’s North American Technology Group (NATG), including the TigerDirect brand, the right to hire approximately 400 B2B sales representatives located across the United States and Canada, all rights to the NATG B2B customer list, certain B2B customer and vendor contracts, trademarks and other intellectual property rights and certain fixed assets and equipment. We believe that this acquisition provided additional scale and opportunity to PCM in the SMB space. 
● | Stratiform: In December 2016, we acquired Stratiform, Inc., a Calgary, Alberta (Canada) based provider of cloud IT solutions that includes consulting, professional, and managed services to clients across Canada. Stratiform, an innovative Gold Certified Microsoft Partner, expands our existing capabilities in Microsoft cloud technology, including Azure Cloud solutions, Office 365 and Enterprise Mobility Suite. 
● | Stack Technology: In September 2017, PCM UK, our UK based subsidiary, completed the acquisition of Stack Technology, headquartered in Liverpool, United Kingdom, which specializes in the selection, implementation and management of leading IT solutions, with offerings encompassing all aspects of cloud-based solutions, security, virtualization, data services, unified communications, and infrastructure. 
● | Provista Technology: In December 2017, PCM UK completed the acquisition of Provista Technology, which is highly regarded in its expertise across a range of technologies and manufacturers including Cisco, Avaya, Cisco Meraki, Huawei, Checkpoint, and other leading vendors, with offerings encompassing all aspects of Cloud Networking, Cloud Video, Hyperconvergence, Security, Collaboration, Secure Wireless and IP LAN, WAN & Data Center Networks. We believe this acquisition will further enhance PCM UK’s expertise and vendor accreditations in the United Kingdom as a Cisco Gold Partner, allowing PCM UK and its subsidiaries to offer further consultancy, integration and supply of services and solutions across the UK marketplace while replicating many existing offerings from our North American organization. 
● | Epoch Universal: In January 2018, we completed the acquisition of certain assets of Epoch Universal, Inc., an end-to-end IT solutions provider that is highly regarded in its expertise across a wide range of solutions including Unified Collaboration, Networking and Security, Wireless, Data Center and Virtualization, Cloud and other advanced technologies. Epoch Universal employees hold advanced Cisco and VMware certifications enabling fully integrated enterprise solutions, including managed and professional services, to customers across the United States.

In connection with our recent acquisitions and our resulting entrance into selling products, services and solutions in the Canadian and the United Kingdom (“UK”) markets, we formed two new operating segments called Canada and United Kingdom. Our Canada segment includes our operations related to these Canadian market activities, beginning as of the respective dates of the Acrodex and Tiger Direct acquisitions in 2015 and Stratiform in late 2016, as discussed above. Our United Kingdom segment includes the results of our subsidiary PCM Technology Solutions UK, Ltd (“PCM UK”), which was formed in connection with our entrance into the UK market in the first quarter of 2017 and serves as our hub for the UK and the rest of Europe. For more information about our segments, see below under “Segment Reporting Data.”
 
Investment in Non-Consolidated Affiliate
 
Based on various supplier diversity policies and requirements of certain customers whose contracts we acquired rights to in connection with the En Pointe transaction, beginning in the first quarter of 2017, our financial results do not consolidate the financial results of sales made under some customer contracts we purchased in the En Pointe acquisition, which are now held by a partner which qualifies for certification as a minority and women owned business in accordance with customer supplier diversity policies. We hold a 49% passive equity interest in this partner and we have accounted for our investment in this partner using the equity method of accounting beginning in the first quarter of 2017. We refer to this entity as the non-controlled entity or NCE. We record our results from our 49% equity interest in the NCE’s operations as “Equity income from unconsolidated affiliate” in our consolidated statement of operations.
 
Our Strategy

We offer cloud-based solutions by utilizing our three hybrid cloud data centers near Columbus, Ohio and Atlanta, Georgia, as well as a global network of partners. We maintain Network Operating Centers (NOCs) within each of our data centers to provide 24x7x365 monitoring and management of customers’ systems wherever they are located. We believe that the operation of our own data centers provides incremental value to our customers that is unmatched in our space.
 
We also have made significant investments to help our customers optimize their software environments and to better understand their needs, evaluate their existing assets and assist them with implementation and migration strategies. We offer our customers expertise in the following areas:
 

● | Local Support Staff 
--+------------------------------------------
● | Licensing Expertise 
● | Cloud Solutions Specialists 
● | Microsoft Professional Services 
● | Microsoft Contract Support 
● | 24x7x365 Cloud Help Desk 
● | Agreement Onboarding 
● | Agreement Lifecycle Services 
● | Strategic Funding Access 
● | Market Intelligence 
● | Cost Analysis & Licensing Assessments 
● | Cloud Envisioning Sessions 
● | Software Asset Management 

 
We believe our strategic focus in advanced solutions expands and enhances our capabilities to service our customers’ needs and drives conversations regarding all of our technology solution offerings. We intend to leverage our existing resources, continue to train our sales account executives and provide a high level of support to our customers.
 
Increase Our Core Sales of End Point Solutions
 
Our End Point Solutions strategy is focused on the delivery of solutions in the following areas:
 

● | Mobility 
--+-------------------------------
● | Desktop 
● | Digital Signage 
● | POS 
● | Print 
● | Field & Lifecycle Services 

 
We maintain pre-sales, engineering and post sales delivery resources focused on driving sales in the core end point technologies that customers demand. By leveraging our inside and field sales teams across the United States and Canada, and our e-Commerce and logistics capabilities, we are able to more effectively and efficiently tailor unique offerings to our diverse customer base. We seek to drive growth through our efforts to expand our relationships with our existing customers as well as by seeking new customers through targeted account acquisition efforts. We are expanding our sales reach across the United States by adding account executives to our inside and field sales teams in an effort to achieve enhanced market penetration.
 
We place significant strategic emphasis on increasing the productivity and tenure of our sales force by enhancing our training and tools, optimizing our technical pre-sales resources and other support functions, expanding our reach into higher value customer opportunities and realigning our commercial account executives and corporate and enterprise accounts under a more unified brand and go to market strategy. Through these efforts we intend to better equip our account executives to evaluate, understand and deliver profitable technology solutions that address our customers’ technology needs with a superior customer experience in a changing technology environment.

Leverage our Strong Partnerships with Key Vendors
 
We believe it is important to leverage our strong relationships with key OEM and publisher vendor partners such as Adobe, Apple, Cisco, Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, HP Inc., Lenovo, Microsoft, Oracle, Samsung, Symantec, Synnex and VMware and other key partners on a company-wide basis. We believe our long-standing relationships with our key vendor partners give us increased visibility and legitimacy in the minds of our customers and provide us key insights related to new and existing technology solutions, roadmaps for such offerings and other critical industry dynamics. These insights help to ensure that our sales and marketing organizations are knowledgeable and well positioned to profitably understand, market, sell and deliver these technologies to our customers, allowing us to meet our customers’ evolving and increasingly complex technology needs.
 
We also intend to continue to invest in and enhance our training programs, our compensation plans and our marketing activities related to each of our key vendor partners. These investments and enhancements are central to our strategic efforts intended to add additional value to these partners by maintaining and enhancing our ability to efficiently and effectively market, sell, deliver and incorporate their products and services into our comprehensive solutions with a high degree of customization.
 
Identify and Drive Further Operational Efficiencies
 
We utilize a centralized infrastructure for our back-office capabilities. In order to free our sales and marketing organizations to increase their focus on our existing and prospective customers, we maintain centralized IT, finance, human resources, and other support functions. We believe that leveraging a centralized model for these critical back-office functions drives a more efficient overall cost structure and allows us to more cost effectively introduce new tools to our sales and marketing organizations. As an additional part of our strategy to drive cost advantages and operational efficiencies, we also have located a significant number of personnel related to these functions internationally and intend to continue with this strategy. As an additional key part of our strategy to identify and drive operational efficiencies, we are currently upgrading many of our disparate IT systems to SAP. We believe the implementation and upgrade should help us to gain further efficiencies across our organization.
Selectively Pursue and Integrate Strategic Acquisitions
 
One element of our business strategy involves the potential expansion through opportunistic acquisitions of businesses, assets, personnel or technologies that allow us to complement our existing operations and expand our market coverage or add new business capabilities. The technology solutions industry has undergone significant consolidation and change over the past 15-20 years and while we believe that the fragmented nature of the industry, industry consolidation trends, and accelerated rate of change in the industry may continue to present acquisition opportunities for us, these trends may also make acquisitions more competitive.
 
We continually evaluate and explore strategic opportunities as they arise, including business combination transactions, strategic partnerships and the purchase or sale of assets. We may choose to pursue acquisitions for several reasons. For instance, we may pursue acquisitions that will broaden our technology solutions’ capabilities, enable us to further penetrate or enter new geographies we deem attractive, expand or enhance vendor relationships or provide increased economies of scale. We evaluate acquisition opportunities based on our assessment of several factors, including the perceived value of the opportunity, our available financing sources, potential synergies of the acquisition target with our business and the opportunity costs of any such investment. The implementation of our acquisition strategy depends on the availability of suitable acquisition candidates at reasonable prices and our ability to resolve challenges associated with integrating acquired businesses into our existing business.
 
Our ability to complete acquisitions in the future will depend on our ability to fund such acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash generated from operations, amounts available under our existing credit facilities, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities.
 
Expand International Capabilities
 
Many of our commercial enterprise customers continue to increase their international technology fulfillment needs related to many of the technology solutions we sell. Historically, our business has been focused on the United States and more recently has expanded across Canada and the UK. In order meet our customers’ international needs, we also have recently made investments to establish our ability to provide technology solutions to some countries throughout the world beyond the United States, Canada and the UK. Expanding these capabilities will continue to be a key strategic focus in the near term.

Our Sales and Marketing Approach
 
Sales Activities. Our account executives handle a variety of customer needs, including, assessment and support for complex technology solutions, operations and procurement processes, ongoing customer service and other value-added services. They are responsible for assisting customers in purchasing decisions, answering product pricing and availability questions and processing product orders, but more importantly, for proactively reaching out to existing and prospective clients to assess opportunities to sell them value-added technology services and solutions. Our account executives profile accounts, identify and build relationships with key decision makers and influencers within their account base and are responsible for growing the depth of hardware products, software and service offerings we sell to our customers. Account executives have the authority to vary prices within specified parameters in order to be competitive. Our account executives also utilize a support team which is focused on non-selling administrative support activities, leaving our account executives incremental time to sell and prospect. We further support our account executives with systems used for order entry, customer tracking and relationship management, product availability and fulfillment schedules and which support their ability to sell across multiple product categories.
 
We believe that the success of our account executives is substantially dependent on the quality of our recruiting and training programs. Upon hiring, our account executives undergo an initial sales training program focusing on the use of our systems, technology solutions, including hardware products, software and service offerings, sales techniques and customer service. To ensure that they are able to effectively sell all of our offerings, account executives attend regular training sessions to stay up-to-date on new technologies. Account executives are also supported by pre-sales personnel who assist them with technology specific questions and solutions support. We also require the account executives to acquire certain sales technical certifications for key technologies to ensure they are credible and competent in selling complex services and solutions.
 
We frequently enhance our tools that are used to support our sales activities. Generally, these tools enable our account executives and sales managers to utilize a number of metrics and analytics from which incremental opportunities can be identified within specific customer accounts or an account executive’s entire book of business. These capabilities provide a solid foundation from which our account executives can expand their customer account penetration and drive incremental revenue and profitability.
 
Marketing Activities. We design our marketing programs to attract new customers and to stimulate additional purchases by existing customers. Our marketing programs are tailored for the specific needs of our various customer segments and within the end point and advanced solutions businesses. We utilize sophisticated analytic tools designed to manage marketing campaigns using different media channels and to optimize campaigns through advanced data mining techniques. The analytic tools combine optimization techniques with multiple models to more effectively match offers to individuals and businesses in an effort to provide the most profitable results.
 
Vendor Supported Marketing. We provide vendor supported custom marketing campaigns that may include outbound call campaigns, customer webinars and events, lead campaigns, email marketing, promotional offers, the sale of advertising space in our catalogs and on our websites and trade-in and trade-up programs. We also work collaboratively with our vendor partners and use vendor funding to help offset portions of the costs of marketing promotions, direct mail offers, customer trainings and events and e-marketing or sales incentives. These marketing activities are based on market opportunity and vendors’ strategies. We also develop marketing campaigns designed to maximize product sales and we receive additional funds from our vendors in the form of volume incentive rebates and other programs.
 
Online Marketing. eCommerce marketing programs and capabilities, such as affiliate marketing, search engine optimization, email and search engine marketing, are essential components of our customer acquisition and retention strategy. We operate several websites, including pcm.com, pcmg.com, macmall.com, tigerdirect.com, tigerdirect.ca, pcmcanada.com, stratiform.com and abreon.com. Our websites offer features such as online ordering, access to inventory availability and a large product selection with detailed product information. We also maintain and operate commercial, customized extranets to provide businesses and their employees with an online purchasing channel with custom catalogs, pricing, security, asset management and workflow configurable to our customers’ needs. These extranet sites are designed to enhance sales productivity by allowing customers to perform routine tasks online, freeing our associated account executive’s time for other tasks.
 
Other Direct Marketing. We selectively mail catalogs to existing and prospective customers, utilize online advertising methodologies and, to a limited extent, advertise in certain major magazines, radio and local television programs. We also send direct marketing mailers to selected target audiences to drive sales to new and existing customers. We create our marketing materials in-house with our own design team and production artists. We believe the in-house preparation of catalogs, advertisements, and promotional materials streamlines the production process, provides greater flexibility and creativity in catalog production and results in significant cost savings over outside production.

Products and Merchandising
 
We screen and select new products and vendors based on evolving customer technology solution needs, the expected market opportunity and related technology adoption trends within our targeted customer markets. We also consider product attributes like features, quality, sales trends, price, margins, market development funds and vendor warranties.
 
Through our large sales force and frequent emails, website updates and catalog mailings, we believe we are able to quickly introduce new products and replace slower selling products. We also use various marketing materials, web training and local events to educate our customers on solutions and more complex technologies and to provide other content to describe technology applications and how they will benefit the customer. Through these materials and activities, we showcase the full breadth of the products and solutions we sell in an effort to provide our customers with a single source for all their technology needs.
 
The following table sets forth our net billed sales by major categories as a percentage of total net billed sales for the periods presented, determined based upon our internal product code classifications.
 

 | Years Ended December 31, | 
-----------------------------------------+------------------------------+----
 | 2018 | | | 2017 | | 2016
Software(1) | | 29 | % | | 28 | % | 28 | %
Notebooks & Tablets | | 17 | | | 20 | | 19 | 
Desktops | | 8 | | | 7 | | 7 | 
Delivered services | | 8 | | | 7 | | 6 |

----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) | All other includes power, supplies, consumer electronics, memory, iPod/MP3 and miscellaneous other items. 

Purchasing and Inventory
 
Effective purchasing is a key element of our strategy to provide technology products and solutions at competitive prices. We believe that our high volume of sales results in increased purchasing power with our primary suppliers, resulting in volume discounts, favorable product return and price protection policies and certain other vendor consideration. A substantial portion of our business is dependent on sales of Microsoft and HP Inc. products as well as products purchased from other vendors including Apple, Cisco, Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Ingram Micro, Lenovo, Synnex and Tech Data. Our top sales of products by manufacturer as a percent of our gross billed sales were as follows for the periods presented:

 | Years Ended December 31, | 
------------+------------------------------+---
 | 2018 | | | 2017 | | 2016
Microsoft | | 15 | % | | 15 | % | 15 | %
HP Inc. | | 10 | | | 10 | | 10 | 

 
We are also linked electronically with approximately 29 distributors and manufacturers, which allows our account executives to view applicable product availability online and drop-ship those products directly to customers. These arrangements allow us to reduce inventory carrying costs, achieve higher order fill rates and improve inventory turns.
 
Many of our vendor partners provide us with volume incentive rebates and market development funds to assist in the active marketing and sales of their products. Such funds help offset portions of the costs incurred to market their products. As is customary in our industry, we have no long-term supply contracts with any of our vendors. Substantially all of our contracts with our vendors are terminable upon 30 days’ notice or less.
 

8
-


We attempt to manage our inventory to optimize order fill rate and customer satisfaction, while limiting inventory risk. Inventory levels may vary from period to period, due in part to increases or decreases in sales levels, our practice of making large-volume purchases when we deem the terms of such purchases to be attractive and the addition of new manufacturers and products. We have negotiated agreements with many of our vendors that contain price protection provisions intended to reduce our risk of loss due to manufacturer price reductions; however, rights vary by product line, have conditions and limitations and generally can be terminated or changed at any time.
 
The market for technology solutions is characterized by rapid technological change and growing diversity. We believe that our success depends in large part on our ability to identify and obtain the right to market hardware products, software and services that meet the changing requirements of the marketplace and to obtain sufficient quantities to meet changing demands. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and offer technology solutions necessary to remain competitive or avoid losses related to excess or obsolete inventory.
 
Backlog
 
Our backlog generally represents open, cancelable orders and may vary significantly from period to period. We do not believe that backlog is useful for predicting our future sales.
Distribution 
 
For the U.S. market, we operate an 84,640 square foot warehouse facility in Lewis Center, Ohio, which includes a 20,000 square foot configuration center, a 20,254 square foot warehouse facility in Irvine, California and a 126,000 square foot warehouse in Worthington, Ohio, which currently includes a 5,000 square foot configuration center. While our Lewis Center and Irvine warehouses have primarily functioned as custom configuration and distribution centers for our commercial customers, our Worthington warehouse serves as the primary distribution center for general stock and use by all segments of our business.
 
For the Canadian market, we operate an approximately 20,500 square foot warehouse in Edmonton, Alberta, which includes a 1,000 square foot configuration center, a 10,750 square foot warehouse in Calgary, Alberta, which includes a 750 square foot configuration center, and a 9,185 square foot warehouse in Richmond Hill, Ontario.
 
We believe that our warehousing and distribution facilities and relationships are adequate for our current and foreseeable future needs. Our warehouse and distributor partners also provide us with electronic purchasing and drop shipping systems for products that we do not maintain in stock in our directly owned inventory. Approximately 29 distributors and manufacturers are linked to us electronically to provide inventory availability and pricing information. We transmit orders electronically for immediate shipment via an electronic interchange to the selected distributor after considering inventory availability, service level, price and location. This capability has historically allowed us to ship a high percentage of orders on the same day that they are received and we expect to continue to leverage these capabilities.
 
Management Information and Communication Systems 
 
We have committed significant resources to the development of sophisticated computer systems that are used to manage our business. Our computer systems support phone and web-based sales, marketing, purchasing, accounting, customer service, warehousing and distribution, and facilitate the preparation of daily operating control reports which are designed to provide concise and timely information regarding key aspects of our business. The systems allow us to, among other things, monitor sales trends, make informed purchasing decisions, and provide product availability and order status information. In addition to the main computer systems, we have systems of networked computers across all of our locations. We also use our management information systems to manage our inventory. We believe that in order to remain competitive, we will need to upgrade our management information systems on a regular basis, which could require significant capital expenditures.
 
Our success is dependent on the accuracy and proper utilization of our management information systems and our communications systems. In addition to the costs associated with system upgrades, the transition to and implementation of new or upgraded solutions can result in system delays or failures. We currently operate one of our management information systems using an HP3000 Enterprise System, which was supported by HP until December 2010. We currently contract with a third party service provider specializing in maintenance and support of this system to provide us adequate support until we finalize the upgrade of this system to SAP, which is more fully described in Part II, Item 7 of this report under “ERP Upgrades.” Any interruption, corruption, degradation or failure of our management information systems or communications systems could adversely impact our ability to receive and process customer orders on a timely basis.

Many of our systems are located in our data centers in El Segundo, California, Columbus, Ohio and Atlanta, Georgia. These data centers now provide geographic redundancy for certain critical systems.
 
Competition
 
The business of selling information technology hardware products, software and services is highly competitive. We compete with a variety of companies that can be divided into several broad categories:

● | other technology solution providers and direct marketers, including CDW, Insight Enterprises, Presidio and Connection; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | large value added resellers such as CompuCom Systems, Pomeroy IT Solutions and World Wide Technology; 
● | government resellers such as CDWG and GovConnection; 
● | computer retail stores and resellers, including superstores such as Best Buy, Office Depot and Staples; 
● | hardware and software vendors such as Apple, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, HP Inc. and Dell Technologies that sell or are increasing sales directly to end users; 
● | online resellers, such as Amazon.com; 
● | software focused resellers such as Soft Choice and SHI; and 
● | other direct marketers and value added resellers of information technology hardware products, software and services, such as Amazon Business and Web Services, and Google Business Services, among others. 

 
Barriers to entry are relatively low in the direct marketing industry, and the risk of new competitors entering the market is high.
 
Competition in our market is based on various factors, including but not limited to, price, product selection, quality and availability, ease of doing business, customer service, and brand recognition.
 
The manner in which technology solutions are distributed and sold is continually changing, and new methods of sales and distribution have emerged. Information technology resellers are consolidating operations and acquiring or merging with other resellers to achieve economies of scale and increased efficiency. Our largest manufacturers have sold, and continue to sell, their products directly to customers. To the extent additional manufacturers adopt this selling format, it could adversely affect our sales and profitability. In addition, traditional retailers have entered and may increase their penetration into direct marketing and the commercial market. Industry reconfiguration and consolidation could cause the industry to become even more competitive, further increase pricing pressures and make it more difficult for us to maintain our operating margins or to increase or maintain the same level of net sales or gross profit.
 
Although many of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do, we believe that our ability to offer our customers a wide selection of technology solutions, at competitive prices, with prompt delivery and a high level of customer satisfaction, together with good relationships with our vendors and suppliers, allows us to compete effectively. We compete not only for customers, but also for favorable product allocations and cooperative advertising support from our vendor partners. Some of our competitors could enter into exclusive distribution arrangements with our vendors and deny us access to their products and solutions, devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns and devote substantially more resources to their websites and systems development than we can. New technologies and the continued enhancement of existing technologies also may increase competitive pressures on us. An increase in competition could require us to adopt competitive pricing or advertising strategies that may have an adverse effect on our operating results. There can be no assurance that we can continue to compete effectively against existing or new competitors that may enter the market.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with our employees, customers, suppliers, affiliates and others to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Despite these precautions, it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property, including using our trademarks or domain names, without authorization. Although we regularly assert our intellectual property rights when we learn that they are being infringed, these claims can be time-consuming and may require litigation and administrative proceedings to be successful. We have numerous trademarks and service marks that we consider to be material to the successful operation of our business. We have registrations in the United States and in numerous foreign jurisdictions.
 
Third parties have asserted, and may in the future assert, that our business methods or the technologies we use infringe their intellectual property rights. We may be subject to intellectual property claims and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business. If we are forced to defend against any third-party infringement claims, we could face expensive and time-consuming litigation and be required to pay monetary damages, which could include treble damages and attorneys’ fees for any infringement that is found to be willful, and either be enjoined or required to pay ongoing royalties with respect to any business methods or technologies that are found to be infringing. Further, as a result of infringement claims either against us or against those who license technology to us, we may be required, or deem it advisable, to develop non-infringing business methods or technology, which could be costly and time-consuming, or enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements.
 

10
--


Third parties have in the past, and may in the future, hire employees who have had access to our proprietary technologies, processes and operations. This exposes us to the risk that former employees will misappropriate our intellectual property.
 
Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Any litigation, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, which could materially harm our business.
 
Segment Reporting Data
 
Operating segment and principal geographic area data for 2018, 2017 and 2016 are summarized in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
 
We currently operate in four reportable segments: Commercial, Public Sector, Canada and United Kingdom. Our reportable operating segments are primarily aligned based upon our reporting of results as used by our chief operating decision maker in evaluating the operating results and performance of our company. We include corporate related expenses such as legal, accounting, information technology, product management and other administrative costs that are not otherwise included in our reportable operating segments in Corporate & Other.
 
Employees
 
At December 31, 2018, we had 3,954 full-time and 86 part-time employees, consisting of 2,219 in the United States, 906 in the Philippines, 703 in Canada, 198 in the United Kingdom and 14 in India. We emphasize recruiting and training high-quality personnel and, to the extent practical, promote people to positions of increased responsibility from within the company. Many employees initially receive training appropriate for their position, followed by varying levels of training in computer technology, communication and leadership. New account executives participate in an intensive sales training program, during which time they are introduced to our business ethics and philosophy, available resources, products and services, as well as basic and advanced sales skills. Training for specific product lines and continuing education programs are conducted on a regular basis, supplemented by vendor-sponsored training programs for account executives and technical support personnel.
 
We consider our employee relations to be good. None of our employees is represented by a labor union, and we have experienced no work stoppages.
 
Regulatory and Legal Matters
 
Our businesses are subject to various regulatory and legal requirements, such as the Mail or Telephone Order Merchandise Rule and other related regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission and other laws and regulations applicable to commerce on the Internet and laws and regulations of the federal government related to our procurement of products and services and our sales to the government. These laws and regulations may cover taxation of eCommerce, user privacy, marketing and promotional practices (including electronic communications with our customers and potential customers), database protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, product safety, the provision of online payment services, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights, data security, unauthorized access (including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act), and the characteristics and quality of products and services.
 
While we believe we are currently in compliance with such laws and regulations and have sought to implement processes, programs and systems in an effort to achieve compliance with existing laws and regulations applicable to our businesses, many of these laws and regulations are unclear and have yet to be interpreted by courts, or may be subject to conflicting interpretations by courts. No assurances can be given that new laws or regulations will not be enacted or adopted, or that our processes, programs and systems will be sufficient to comply with present or future laws or regulations, which might adversely affect our operations. Moreover, changing technologies and the growth and evolution of Internet commerce has and may continue to prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection, privacy and data protection laws that, if enacted, could impose additional restrictions or burdens on us and other companies.

Based upon current law, some of our affiliated companies currently collect and remit sales and use tax only on sales of products or services to residents of the states in which they have a physical presence or have voluntarily registered. Various state taxing authorities have sought to impose on companies with no physical presence in the taxing state the burden of collecting state sales and use taxes on the sale of products or services shipped or sold to those states’ residents, and it is possible that such a requirement could be imposed in the future. In addition, a number of bills may be introduced or are pending before federal and state legislatures that would potentially expand our tax collection or reporting responsibility. Until these legislative efforts have run their course and the courts have considered and resolved some cases involving these tax collection and reporting issues, there can be no assurance that future laws or interpretations of existing laws imposing taxes or other regulations on direct marketing or Internet commerce would not substantially impair our growth or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
In addition, we and our subsidiaries may be subject to state or local taxes on income or (in states such as Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Texas, Washington or the District of Columbia) on gross receipts or a similar measure earned in a state even though we and our subsidiaries may have no physical presence in the state. State and local governments may seek to impose such taxes in cases where they believe the taxpayer may have a significant economic presence by reason of significant sales to customers located in the states. The responsibility to pay income and gross receipts taxes has also been the subject of court actions and various legislative efforts. There can be no assurance that these taxes will not be imposed upon us and our subsidiaries.
