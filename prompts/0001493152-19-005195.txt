Industry
 
The automotive parts industry is divided into three tiers of original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), which supply automotive manufacturers with parts for new vehicles, and the aftermarket parts suppliers, which manufacture parts for used vehicles.
 
The automobile industry is one of the largest sectors of the global economy. The global automotive manufacturing industry operates in an increasingly aggressive marketplace whose performance is tied directly to performance of the large and growing retail automobile industry. Management believes that the top six companies in the global manufacturing industry are General Motors (GM), Toyota, Ford, Daimler/Chrysler, Volkswagen and Honda and, of those, our subsidiary, D&R Technology, has produced machines supplying parts and components for five of the top six manufacturers. The systems that we build for our customers are for Tier 1 OEM suppliers. An OEM supplier is an “original equipment manufacturer or, in other words, a company that manufactures products or components that are purchased by a company and retailed under that purchasing company’s brand name. OEM refers to the company that originally manufactured the product. When referring to automotive parts, OEM designates a replacement part made by the manufacturer of the original part. In this usage, OEM means “original equipment from manufacturer” The Tier I OEM suppliers deal directly with the automakers - General Motors, Ford, Nissan, Honda, Toyota, Hyundai etc. We supply the systems to the Tier 1 OEM suppliers that produce the seats, front dashboards and other products for the big automakers.

Products
 
We provide special purpose machinery products and services to Automotive Tier I businesses and their suppliers. Our services include design and installation of retrofits to existing systems, spare parts, maintenance, repairs and production support. We build seat frame systems and tube processing lines. Each system consists of self contained tooling modules linked by a series of automated transfer or robots. Several modules will be integrated into a processing system by adding single or multi-axis transfer units. This approach allows uniformity of design, which provides ease of expansion, simplicity of operation, and excellent throughput rates.
 
At conception of each project, we review component designs and provide suggestions to our customers to reduce manufacturing costs. We work with customers to ensure that proposed systems strike the right balance of throughput, flexibility, automation and tooling/capital budgets. Throughout the project, our team managers work to keep the customer’s team informed with progress updates, highlighting decision points and tracking component design changes. Our designs and technologist work to ensure that our production solutions are robust, reliable and maintainable. We collaborate with our technology partners to ensure that every aspect is leading edge and proven reliable. Ultimately, we work with our customers to ensure that our production solutions provide value to every level of their organization.
 
The value propositions regarding our machinery products and services are: (i) delivery – providing on-time delivery thereby reducing customer inventory and providing them with overall cost reduction; (ii) quality – products and services that we deliver are of high quality and have attributes that enable customers to carry out their business functions; and (iii) price – products are competitively priced thus helping customers control their own overhead and expenses. We work with our customers on a one-to-one basis to the best of its ability to keep our prices competitive and within the customers’ budgets. When our customers desire to bid on jobs, they contact us and provide us with certain prerequisites. We then discuss their respective needs and start to compile all relevant information into a request for quote file. We then review all compiled information and submit to the customer its quotation regarding pricing. We have a very broad and diverse field that we have developed from which to obtain certain pricing. We would not receive purchase orders to provide our services to our respective customers if our prices were not competitive in the marketplace. Therefore, we believe we offer very competitive pricing based upon prior successful demand and awards for our products and services.


Our primary focus will be placed on product engineering and manufacturing processes to ensure the highest quality, high level of product features, and the most efficient manufacturing process possible. We will focus our market offerings on two major customer groups: (i) automobile seating manufacturers; and (ii) manufacturers of tubing products. Our products are listed below:
 
Seat Frame System is comprised of the following of which all components thereof are designed and manufactured by the Corporation:
 

● | Unbundler, Weld seam station with Roland Seamfinder, CNC bending stations with barcode readers, 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Transfers, Reject Station, Vertical 4- post press module with tooling change options

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Integrated Bend-Weld System is a system that will transfer the formed tube to a welding station to be welded to the bottom of the seat frame. 

 
The automated tube bending machines that we build require spare parts that will replace the used and worn out components on various parts of the machines. We design and manufacture the machinery and replace them as required. We will provide all maintenance and repair to the machines as the wear and tear of running them over long periods of time becomes evident.
 
Services and Support
 
Our customer centric focus enables its customers to preserve and increase the value of existing processing equipment. We provide the following programs and services:
 
Maintenance and Repairs Programs: warranty support, after sales and emergency services, preventative maintenance programs, and spare parts and consumables solutions.
 
Value Added Services: system upgrades and rebuilds, control system upgrades, tooling retrofits, pre-production and prototyping requirements, training, equipment relocation and redeployment, systems audit, manufacturing consulting and project management services.
Marketing
 
Our target customers are: (i) automotive seating manufacturers, who are customers requiring customized machine tools to better serve their clients; and (ii) manufacturers of tubing products, who are customers requiring a value adding process layout. We will continue to focus our market offerings to automobile seating manufacturers and manufacturers of tubing products. Presently, we do not have contractual agreements with customers of automotive seating manufacturers or manufacturers of tubing products. Rather, we utilizes purchase orders with those customers  . Our market research reflects that these customer segments are the most demanding in terms of the engineering, technical service support, and automated machinery design. We are particularly strong in these areas and will utilize our capacities to serve these clients. We will seek customers who require production of components used in upper-end product lines. This will provide a further possibility for us to offer our value-added engineering robotics services.
 

In previous years, including fiscal year 2017, we have had significant economic and commercial reliance and dependence on Adient/Johnson Controls Inc. (“JCI”). Adient/JCI was one our major customers after the recession of 2009 through 2010 during which some of our previous customers filed for bankruptcy or acquired by larger companies. Previously, management determined that we were not economically dependent upon Adient/ JCI. During fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, D&R Technology received purchase orders from Adient/JCI in the amount of $390,848 and $2,469,471, respectively. During fiscal year 2018, approximately 22% of our sales and .02% of   our receivables were attributable to Adient/JCI. And, during fiscal year 2017, approximately 41.78% sales and 85% of our receivables were attributable to Adient/JCI. Therefore, as of the date of this Annual Report, management has determined that while we may not be economically dependent upon Adient/ JCI, during fiscal year 2018, sales to and receivables owing from JCI constituted a smaller portion of our revenue. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to Business”.
 

We do not have an exclusive agreement with Adient/JCI and rely upon bids and subsequent purchase orders. Our business relationship with Adient/JCI is well established having commenced in 2004 with Bernardino Paolucci, our President/Chief Executive Officer, and Drasko Karanovic, a member of the Board of Directors. Both individuals established a strong relationship with JCI during their tenure at Dieco Technology based upon their respective extensive knowledge of JCI’s machines and the manufacturing and servicing section of JCI.
 
We also produced a 420A system to produce new seat frames. The system is built for Toyota Boshoku Emire, Ontario, to produce the seat frame to be used in their plants for the Rav 4 production. During fiscal year 2018, D&R Technology received from Toyota Boshoku purchase orders for $1,223,136. And during fiscal year 2017, D&R Technology received from Toyota Boshoku purchase orders for $1,098,018. During fiscal year 2016, we received orders for $20,672. for spare parts. During fiscal year 2018, purchase orders from Toyota Boshoku increased because Toyota Boshoku required two new systems from us.

The material terms regarding the purchase orders are as follows: (i) progress payment terms consisting of 30% at award of purchase order, 30% at approximate eighty percent completion, 30% at acceptance, and 10% net thirty days’ (ii) completion time for designing and building system is generally 23 to 26 weeks; (iii) if spare parts required to construct system, delivery is 3 to 10 weeks from receipt of purchase order and terms for spare parts are net 45 days; and (iv) orders cancellable but in the event engineering and purchase orders for items with a long delivery time are placed with our suppliers, the customer is liable for any time, material and costs incurred. Although this is our general policy regarding purchase orders, exceptions may be made under certain circumstances that fall outside the terms of these payment thresholds.
 
Our market strategy is to capitalize on our expertise by manufacturing high quality, durable machinery with a significant number of product features and options, which are extremely precise in control of motions. We will focus on a segment of the market and attempt to achieve the best reputation within that segment. Our goal in 2019 is to secure more engineering and manufacturing positions. Our goal in the next five years is to continue with our “value added” scheme that will assist us in achieving a strong position within the marketplace.
 
Suppliers
 
The majority of raw materials required by us are readily available from a variety of suppliers. For certain specialty items related to controls, we have two principal suppliers: (i) Allen Bradly Controls; and (ii) Baldor Controls.
 
The products we require for the assembly of our systems come from electrical companies, hydraulic and pneumatic suppliers and control system from automation companies. We do not have exclusive contracts with these companies as we send Requests for Quotations on pricing and delivery time in order to maximize savings in the production process. Examples include: motors from Rockwell Ind., electrical components from Gerrie Electric/Province Electrical hydraulics power unit from Hydrafab. We machine remaining parts as required.
 
Employees
 
We employ sixteen (16) full time employees. This may fluctuate depending on our workload. We may also use temporary employees that have previously worked for us, as required depending on the workload. Drasko Karanovic, is a full-time employee. He is primarily responsible for all of our day-to-day operations. Other services may be provided by outsourcing and consultant Berardino Paolucci and special purpose contracts. We have also engaged the service of the wife of Mr. Drasko as part-time employee, on a limited basis.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES
 
We have incurred approximately $0 during the past two fiscal years   on research and development for products. None of these research or development costs are borne by the customer. The costs are in our Cost of Sales and Engineering Labour accounts.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
We currently use the Rockwell Automation system in our machines. We purchase on a yearly basis the automation portion of the system directly from Rockwell Automation, which is known as a “tool kit”. The tool kit enables us to receive updates, upgrades, technical assistance with the portion of the automation system that we use. We must use the supplier that the customer designates in their specifications when the customer orders the tube bending system from us. Each customer has their own preference regarding the supplier for this part of the machine. We do not have an exclusive requirements contract with Rockwell Automation. There are a substantial number of other companies in the marketplace that offer the automated portion of the control system.
 
As of the date of this Annual Report, we have not filed patents on any of our systems. We do not release any drawings of our machines. The drawings are the property of D&R Technology. We may consider filing patent applications with respect to our system technologies and any novel aspects of our technology to protect our intellectual property. Future patents, if issued, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Thus, any patent that we may own may not provide adequate protection against competitors. Any patent applications that we may file in the future may not result in issued patents. Also, patents may not provide us with adequate proprietary protection or advantages against competitors with similar or competing technologies. As a result of potential conflicts with the proprietary rights of others, we may in the future have to prove that we are not infringing the patent rights of others or we may be required to obtain a license to the patent.

We may consider filing a copyright application for the drawings of our machines. We will rely on trade secrets and unpatentable know-how that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements. However, it is possible that parties may breach those agreements, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. It is also possible that its trade secrets or unpatentable know-how will otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. There can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement or other claims against us with respect to any existing or future systems or products. Litigation to protect our proprietary information or to determine the validity of any third-party claims could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, whether or not we are successful in such litigation.
 
COMPETITION
 
The market for special purpose automotive machinery products and services is highly competitive. Competition is based on the quality and range of such products, market availability, pricing, promotion and customer service as well as the nature of the distribution channels. We believe we have several highly significant competitive advantages such as: (i) engineering and technical support service; (ii) automated seat frame systems and IP beam process lines design and build expertise; (iii) vendors service and support; and (iv) current relationships with several major automotive companies. In the special purpose automotive machinery produces and services business, our additional competitive factors include the demonstrated effectiveness of the products being offered, as well as available funding sources. We face competition from other technology-based companies providing the same products and services. Competition may increase to the extent that other entities enter the market and to the extent that current competitors or new competitors develop and introduce new products that compete directly with the products distributed by us or develop or expand competitive sales channels. We believe that our marketing position is unique to certain of the markets in which we compete.
