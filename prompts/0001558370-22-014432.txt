Summary of Clinical Assets
RZ358
Our lead clinical asset, RZ358, is a potential treatment for congenital hyperinsulinism (“HI”), an ultra-rare pediatric genetic disorder characterized by excessive production of insulin by the pancreas. If untreated, the elevated insulin levels in patients suffering with congenital HI can induce extreme hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) events, increasing the risk of neurological and developmental complications, including persistent feeding problems, learning disabilities, recurrent seizures, brain damage or even death. There are no FDA approved therapies for all forms of congenital HI and the current standard of care treatments are suboptimal. The current treatments used by physicians include glucagon, diazoxide, somatostatin analogues and pancreatectomy.
RZ358, is an intravenously administered human monoclonal antibody that binds to a unique site (allosteric) on the insulin receptor in insulin target tissues, such as in the liver, fat, and muscle. The antibody modifies insulin’s binding and signaling to maintain glucose levels in a normal range which counteracts the effects of elevated insulin in the body. RZ358 shows dose dependent pharmacokinetics with a half- life greater than two weeks which has the potential for semi-monthly dosing. Therefore, we believe that RZ358 is ideally suited as a potential therapy for conditions characterized by excessive insulin levels, and it is being developed to treat hyperinsulinism and low blood sugar. As RZ358 acts downstream from the beta cells, it has the potential to be universally effective at treating congenital HI caused by any of the underlying genetic defects.
A summary of the completed clinical studies for RZ358 is as follows.
A Phase 1 pharmacokinetic (“PK”) study of single intravenous doses of RZ358 at 0.1 to 9 mg/kg in healthy volunteers revealed dose-dependent pharmacokinetics with a half-life of 15 days, supporting the biweekly dosing approach. In healthy volunteers, RZ358 prevented hypoglycemia induced by insulin administration, without producing hyperglycemia. This effect showed a PK-pharmacodynamic (dose—response) correlation, with the hypoglycemia blunting effects of RZ358 lasting for two weeks.
The clinical proof-of-concept of RZ358 in congenital HI was evaluated in a Phase 2a study in a total of 14 patients with congenital HI. The study investigated the PK, pharmacodynamics (“PD”), safety and preliminary efficacy of RZ358. RZ358 was well-tolerated in adult and pediatric patients with congenital HI who received single intravenous doses in the Phase 2a study and the PK results from the Phase 2a studies were consistent with those in healthy volunteers. There was a durable normalization of blood sugar in patients with hypoglycemia, with an approximate 50% improvement and near normalization of glucose control, which was sustained for more than two weeks after dosing. RZ358 did not increase blood sugar levels in patients with normal blood sugar levels at baseline. 
In calendar year 2022 we completed the RZ358-606 Phase 2b global clinical study for RZ358 (“RIZE”). The RIZE study was conducted in a repeat-dose fashion to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, dose-exposure response relationship and to assess the glycemic efficacy across a range of continuous glucose monitoring (“CGM”) and blood glucose monitoring-based principle glycemic endpoints to inform Phase 3. In the study, eligible patients received RZ358 in open-label fashion in one of 4, sequentially conducted dosing cohorts of up to 8 participants per cohort. RZ358 was administered as a 30 minute intravenous infusion every other week for eight weeks. The first three cohorts were fixed dosing levels of RZ358 and the fourth cohort was designed to explore whether there were any advantages of a fixed titration approach. 
The RIZE study enrolled 23 patients and was primarily in a young pediatric population, average ~6.5 years of age, and in a diverse group of patients across gender and genetic cause of congenital HIs. A key entry criterion was for patients to

have continued hypoglycemia despite available therapies, to be eligible for enrollment. We observed that patients enrolled on stable background therapies had clinically significant, and in many cases, substantial residual hypoglycemia as well as some hyperglycemia (> 180 mg/dL) at baseline.
Results from the RIZE study showed that target and expected RZ358 concentrations were achieved and dose-exposure dependent responses were also observed. RZ358 was generally safe and well-tolerated and there were no adverse drug reactions, adverse events leading to study discontinuations, or dose-limiting toxicities. Importantly, RZ358 demonstrated a ~50% improvement in hypoglycemia across all doses and cohorts and a ~75% improvement in hypoglycemia at the 6 mg/kg and 9 mg/kg cohorts. Time in range by CGM improved 8% across all doses, 16% at the top dose, and more significantly (>25%) in patients without baseline hyperglycemia on SOC.
In calendar year 2022, we reported positive topline results from the RIZE study which were presented at the Pediatric Endocrine Society Meeting on May 1, 2022. We believe that the positive results from the RIZE study will be Phase 3 enabling and accordingly we have initiated interactions with regulatory authorities in the US and Europe. Our objective is to complete the regulatory dialogue prior to the end of the first quarter of calendar year 2023, which would facilitate initiation of a Phase 3 study in the first half of calendar year 2023.
RZ402
Our second clinical asset, RZ402, is an oral plasma kallikrein inhibitor (“PKI”) being developed as a potential therapy for the chronic treatment of diabetic macular edema (“DME”). DME is a vascular complication of diabetes and a leading cause of blindness in the US and elsewhere. Chronic exposure to high blood sugar levels can lead to inflammation, cell damage, and the breakdown of blood vessel walls. Specifically, in DME, blood vessels behind the back of the eye become porous and permeable leading to the unwanted infiltration of fluid into the macula. This fluid leakage creates distorted vision, and if left untreated, blindness.
Currently available treatments for DME include anti-vascular growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections into the eye or laser surgery. RZ402 is designed to be a once daily oral therapy for the treatment of DME and unlike the anti-VEGF therapies, RZ402 targets the Kallikrein-Kinin System to address inflammation and vascular leakage. We believe that systemic exposure through oral delivery is critical to target the microvasculature behind the back of the eye. Further, as an oral therapy, RZ402 has the potential to substantially change the therapeutic paradigm for patients suffering with DME by providing a convenient, self-administered treatment option to encourage earlier initiation of therapy, adherence to prescribed treatment guidelines, and improved overall outcomes.
Results from our single ascending dose (“SAD”) Phase 1a Study (“RZ402-101”) were reported in May 2021. RZ402-101 was a first-in-human single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled SAD study in healthy adult volunteers. The study objectives were to characterize the safety profile and pharmacokinetics of RZ402 administered as single oral doses. The study enrolled 30 individuals in three planned sequential dose- level cohorts of 25 mg, 100 mg, and 250 mg. Within each ten-subject dose cohort, volunteers were randomized 8:2 to receive either RZ402 oral solution or matched placebo. After receiving single doses, participants remained in the clinic for seven days for serial PK and safety assessments, before completing two outpatient follow-up visits at study days 14 and 30. Dose advancement proceeded following blinded reviews of safety and PK data from the preceding cohort(s).
Single doses of RZ402 resulted in dose-dependent increases in systemic exposure. Plasma concentrations of RZ402 significantly exceeded the 3.5 ng/mL target concentration that was pharmacologically active in animal models of DME for a 24-hour period after receipt of RZ402. Across the dose and exposure range, there were no serious adverse events, adverse drug reactions, or discontinuations due to adverse events, and no imbalance of adverse events between the treatment and placebo control groups. Similarly, regular laboratory, hemodynamic, cardiac, and ophthalmologic safety examinations were unremarkable.
Following the success of the SAD study, we undertook a follow-on multiple ascending dose (“MAD”) study (“RZ402-102”). Results from the MAD Study were reported in February 2022. RZ402-102 was a single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, in healthy adult volunteers. The objectives of the study were to characterize the repeat dose safety profile (including maximum tolerated dose) and PK of RZ402 administered as daily oral doses for two weeks. The

study was conducted in 40 volunteers in sequential ascending dose cohorts with 10 individuals per cohort. Within each cohort, participants were randomized in an 8:2 ratio to receive either RZ402 as an oral solution or a placebo. Participants remained in the clinic throughout the two week dosing period for serial PK and safety assessments, before completing an outpatient follow-up visit at study day 28. Blood biomarkers of target engagement (kallikrein activity) were explored as a systemic surrogate for DME, using a precedent from studies of kallikrein inhibitors in a systemic vascular leakage syndrome (hereditary angioedema). Dose advancement proceeded in staggered fashion every three weeks as appropriate, following blinded reviews of data from the preceding cohort(s).
The MAD study showed dose-dependent increases in systemic exposures, with repeat-dosing to steady-state resulting in the highest concentrations of RZ402 explored to date, exceeding 200 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL at peak and 24-hour trough, respectively. Following the precedent established in hereditary angioedema, steady-state plasma kallikrein activity in human plasma was measured on Day 14 as a biomarker of RZ402 target engagement. Daily dosing with RZ402 inhibited plasma kallikrein in a dose and concentration-dependent manner (r=0.74; p < 0.001). Given that the in-vivo EC90 for RZ402 in animal models of DME is ~6 ng/mL, the results at both peak and 24-hour trough substantially exceeded target concentrations based on a combination of in-vitro and in-vivo profiling. RZ402 was generally safe and well-tolerated, including at higher doses than previously tested in the SAD study. There were no serious adverse events, adverse drug reactions or identified risks.
We are advancing developmental activities toward a Phase 2a proof-of-concept study, which we plan to initiate during the fourth quarter of calendar year 2022.
