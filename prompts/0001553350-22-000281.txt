Our Corporate History
 Information Systems Associates, Inc. (“ISA”). was incorporated in Florida on May 31, 1994. Our original business operations consisted of consulting services for asset management of large corporate data centers and the development and licensing of information technology (“IT”) asset management software. In late 2014, ISA entered negotiations with Duos Technologies, Inc. (“duostech™”) for the purposes of executing a merger between the two organizations (also known as a “reverse triangular merger”). Incorporated under the laws of Florida on November 30, 1990, duostech™ operated in various industry segments, specializing in the design, development and deployment of proprietary technology applications and turn-key engineered systems. This transaction was completed on April 1, 2015, whereby duostech™ became a wholly owned subsidiary of ISA. After the merger was completed, ISA changed its corporate name to Duos Technologies Group, Inc (together with its subsidiaries, “Duos,” “we,” “us” or the “Company”). The Company, based in Jacksonville, Florida, oversees its wholly owned subsidiary, duostech™ which employs approximately 68 people and is a technology company which designs, develops, deploys and operates intelligent technology solutions with a focus on software applications and artificial intelligence (“AI”). The company has a strong portfolio of intellectual property. The Company’s headquarters are located at 7660 Centurion Parkway, Suite 100, Jacksonville, Florida 32256 and main telephone number is (904) 296-2807.
Overview
 
The Company, operating under its brand name duostech, designs, develops, deploys and operates intelligent technology solutions for inspecting and evaluating moving objects. Its technology focus is within the Vision Technology market sector and, more specifically, the Machine Vision subsector. Machine Vision companies provide imaging-based automatic inspection and analysis for process control for industry with potential expansion into other markets. Duos has developed key technologies over the past several years in software, industry specific hardware and artificial intelligence and has demonstrated industrial strength usability of its systems supporting rail, logistics and intermodal businesses that streamline operations, improve safety and reduce costs. Our employee team include engineering subject matter expertise in hardware, software, and information technology as well as industry specific applications of artificial intelligence also referred to as Expert Artificial Intelligence.
 
Duos is currently developing industry solutions for its target markets which will address rail, trucking, aviation and other vehicle-based processes. Duos initial offering, the Railcar Inspection Portal (RIP), provides both freight and transit railroad customers and select government agencies the ability to conduct fully automated railcar inspections of trains while they are moving at full speed. The RIP utilizes a variety of sophisticated optical, laser and speed sensors to scan each passing railcar to create a high-resolution image-set of the top, sides and undercarriage. These images are then processed with our edge data center using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to identify safety and security defects on each railcar. The algorithms are developed in conjunction with industrial application experts, in this case Railcar Mechanical Engineers, to provide specific guidance in the analysis (“human in the loop”). Within minutes of the railcar passing through the RIP, a detailed report is sent to the customer where they are able to action identified issues. This solution has the potential to transform the railroad industry by increasing safety, improving efficiency and reducing costs. The Company has already deployed this system with several Class 1 railroads and anticipates an increased demand from transit and other railroad customers along with selected government agencies that operate and/or manage rail traffic. The Company has deployed RIPs in Canada, Mexico and the United States and anticipates expanding this solution into Europe and Australia in coming years.
 
The Company has also developed the Automated Logistics Information System (ALIS) which automates gatehouse operations where transport trucks enter and exit large logistics and intermodal facilities. This solution incorporates a similar set of sensors, data processing and artificial intelligence to streamline the customer’s logistics transactions and tracking and can also automate the security and safety inspection if called for. The Company has already deployed this system with one large North American retailer and anticipates increased demand from other large retailers, railroad intermodal operators and select government agencies that manage logistics and border crossing points. The Company is evaluating other solutions for moving vehicles including aircraft, which could provide similar benefits in terms of safety and efficiency for required inspections as part of an operations process.

We have developed two proprietary solutions that operate our software and artificial intelligence. centraco® is an Enterprise Information Management Software platform that consolidates data and events from multiple sources into a unified and distributive user interface. Customized to the end user’s Concept of Operations (CONOPS), it provides improved situational awareness and data visualization for operational objectives compared to traditional manual inspections. truevue360™ is our fully integrated platform that we utilize to develop and deploy Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, including Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Object Detection and Deep Neural Network-based processing for real-time applications. As an adjunct to these two platforms, the Company also has developed two other concepts which integrate with:
 

1. | Bespoke hardware that is used to enhance the results achieved by the installed systems including certain enhanced vision and lighting technology to improve image capture and speed normalization to provide consistent image quality which is critical for artificial intelligence algorithms to operate with a high level of accuracy.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Integrated specific application expertise necessary to increase the level of precision in terms of anomaly detection resulting in lower levels of “false positives” in any specific detection situation.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



These two concepts have been developed and enhanced over the last 12-months and are expected to open up other opportunities for the Company to provide revenue producing products and solutions with potentially high market acceptance.
 
During the year the Company ended support of its IT Asset Management (ITAM) solution which cataloged results for data center asset inventory and audit services. We are currently evaluating using our current operations experience within “edge data centers” (as deployed for our Railcar Inspection Portal) to drive additional revenues within other markets requiring this type of solution although no specific offering has been developed at this time.
 
The year 2021 brought significant challenges, changes and opportunities for our business that will be discussed in greater detail later in this report. They include:
 

· | Responding to the COVID-19 pandemic beginning in first quarter, 2020 and which continues as of this report.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The delay of new orders from existing customers beginning in first quarter, 2020 with a restart being expected in first quarter 2022.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Overhauling the Engineering, Software, and Information Technology units including the appointment of Jeffrey Necciai as the Companys Chief Technology Officer (“CTO”).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Addition of Mr. Edmond Harris, former COO of CSX and CN, to our Board of Directors in fourth quarter, 2020 and the addition of Mr. Craig Nixon to the Board of Directors in July of 2021
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
duostech™
 
Over the past 10 years, the Company has developed a series of industry specific technologies some of which are described below.
 
Railcar Inspection Portal (rip®)
 
Federal regulations require each railcar/train to be inspected for mechanical defects prior to leaving a rail yard. Founded in 1934, the Association of American Railroads (AAR) is responsible for setting the standards for the safety and productivity of the U.S./North American freight rail industry, and by extension, has established the inspection parameters for the rail industry’s rolling stock. Also known as the “Why Made” codes, the AAR established approximately 110 inspection points under its guidelines for mechanical inspections.
 
Under current practice, inspections are conducted manually, a very labor intensive and inefficient process that only covers a select number of inspection points and can take several hours per train. We believe our Railcar Inspection Portal has the potential to reduce this inspection to minutes while the train is moving at speed improving safety, reducing dwell time and optimizing maintenance.

Our system combines high-definition image and data capture technologies with our AI-based analytics applications that are typically installed on active tracks located between two rail yards. We inspect railcars traveling through our inspection portal at speeds of up to 70 mph and report mechanical anomalies detected by our system to the inbound train yard, well ahead of the train entering the yard.
 
Currently, three Class 1 railroads starting to use our rip® technology with one of those railroads broadly deploying the technology across its network. The ultimate objective is to change inspection regulations that would allow replacement of the current manual inspection (in the yard) with our fully automated process.
 
The following examples of automated detections are the result of the combination of our image capture technologies. Some of these mechanical defects, if unattended, could cause a derailment. Other examples of our AI-based detection applications include inspections at rail border crossings in support of the Customs and Border Protection Agency.
 
Samples of Automated Detections
 
The Company continues to expand its detection capabilities through the development and integration of additional sensor technologies to include laser, infrared, thermal, sound and x-ray to process AI-based analytics of inspection points.
Vehicle Undercarriage Examiner (vue®)
 
A system that inspects the undercarriage of railcars (both freight and transit rail) traveling at speeds of up to 70 mph. We are currently developing an expanded version for higher speeds with additional sensor technologies. We are developing additional algorithms for an increasing number of automated detection of anomalies, which we believe once completed and successfully tested, may have a significant impact on our revenues.

Thermal Undercarriage Examiner (t-vue™)
 
The Company has developed and deployed a new thermal undercarriage examiner. The system uses high-speed thermal imaging technology to inspect the thermal signature of undercarriage components. Thermal monitoring of component heat signatures while underway will provide indications of the overall operating health of the railcars that are not possible to observe during static yard inspections.
Enterprise Command and Control Suite (centraco®)
 
This intelligent user interface is at the core of all our systems and enables end users to connect to an unlimited number of operational sites from one central interface, the centraco® Enterprise Command and Control Suite. A multi-layered command and control interface, it is designed to function as the central point and aggregator for information consolidation, connectivity and communications. The platform is browser based and agnostic to the interconnected sub-systems. It provides full integration for seamless user credentialing and performs the following major functions:

· | Collection: Device management independently collects data from any number of disparate devices or sub-systems.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Analysis: Correlates and analyzes data, events and alarms to identify real-time situations and their priorities for response measures and end-users Concept of Operations (CONOPS).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Verification: The contextual layer represents relevant information in a quick and easily interpreted format which provides operators optimal situational awareness.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Resolution: Event-specific presentation of user-defined Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), that includes step-by-step instructions on how to resolve situations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Reporting: Tracking of data and events for statistical, pattern and/or forensic analysis. Features include mathematical, statistical and comparative data reporting as well as interoperability with third-party databases. Reports are customized to the end users data formats and infrastructure.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Auditing: Device-level drill down that records each operators login interaction with the system and tracks manual changes including calculations of operator alertness and reaction time for each event.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | AutoCheck: The system pings each device connected to its wide area network and performs periodic functionality audits. A variable alert feature sends out error messages to an unlimited number of user-definable stakeholders in case any device does not perform to specifications.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Automated Logistics Information Systems (alis™)
 
We have developed and deployed a proprietary intelligent system to automate security gate operations at nine distribution centers owned and operated by a national retail chain. Using similar technology that is used in our Rail Inspection Portal, this solution automates the process of entering and exiting a large logistics or intermodal yard. This automates the logistics transaction, improves throughput and can also be used to automate security and maintenance screening/detection if desired by the customer.

Markets
 
We believe the opportunity for our Rail Inspection Portal business is substantial and our number one priority at this time. We are currently providing this solution to three of seven Class 1 railroad operators with 10 systems already deployed. Because of our early leadership position, we have been able to accumulate experience and intellectual property that we believe would be time consuming and expensive for a new competitor to replicate. Furthermore, we believe we have the ability to upgrade and scale our solutions with additional technologies in the future. We believe that the current market for our technologies is substantial. At the same time, we recognize that the technology life cycle is fast and evolving. Potential competitors could move into this sector, and it is possible that some Class 1 railroads could develop their own solutions that limit our total addressable market.
 
Another market we are pursuing as our second priority is using our Automated Logistics and Information Systems solution (alis™). Potential customers include commercial retail logistics and intermodal operators, Class 1 rail intermodal operators that are moving large amounts of automobiles, and U.S. Government agencies such as the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security. Today, we currently have 20 production systems in use, but we believe the greenfield opportunity here to be substantial. We have identified over 900 lanes of traffic within nearly 300 facilities as potential business opportunities in the near-term.
 
Currently, we are focused on the North American market, but plan to expand globally in the future.
 
Patents and Trademarks
 
The Company holds a number of patents and trademarks for our technology solutions. We protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state, and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We control access to our proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with all of our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third parties. We also actively engage in monitoring activities with respect to infringing uses of our intellectual property by third parties.

Specific Areas of Competition
 
One of our primary commercial goals is to develop innovative technology solutions and target potential “greenfield” market spaces in order to maximize our business footprint and give us the ability to help define the market parameters for the future.
 
With regards to our Railcar Inspection Portal (RIP), we believe that we are the most advanced technology currently focused on 360-degree inspections of railcars and have limited direct competition domestically or globally.  There are several companies that do provide visual and optical (laser) based imaging systems, but they are specifically designed to focus on a single aspect of a railcar whereas our latest RIP will identify 50+ inspection points on each car.  This is not to be confused with track inspection technologies, where we do not compete. We are not aware of any other company, that creates images of the entire car from multiple perspectives and with many different inspection points.  Other companies that participate in the visual and optical (laser) based railcar inspection systems market include Trimble Rail Solutions/Beena Vision and KLD Labs, both primarily focused on wheel and brake inspections and the Class 1 railroads themselves developing “in-house” solutions.
 
Our Automated Logistics Information System (ALIS) also represents an opportunity to expand into a mature market that we believe has a significant technology gap.  While most facilities, such as distribution centers, that process commercial trucks in and out have sophisticated software management applications for logistics control, they have most often not implemented an advanced gatehouse automation solution.  Historically, this category was referred to as “Automated Gate Systems” or AGS.  The purpose of AGS technology is to streamline entry in to and exit out of facilities.  The marketplace for this was mostly seaports and intermodal transfer facilities and was relatively expensive technology to deploy.  We identified a market gap with regards to distribution facilities that all currently utilize manual processes and heavy staffing to accomplish commercial truck entry and exit.  The barrier to entry for distribution centers was predominately “cost”, as well as the requirement for a different set of logistics management software and tools.  The current competition includes Nascent with a primary focus on seaports and intermodal transfer facilities.

Organic Growth
 
Our organic growth strategy is to continue our focus and prioritization in the rail, logistics and intermodal market space. In this regard, the Company has made significant changes in the senior management team to include a new Chief Executive Officer who has years of experience successfully leading start-up and turn-around companies. In addition, the former divisional COO who has 20 years of experience with the Company delivering technology into rail, logistics, intermodal, and other industries, has been promoted to Chief Commercial Officer (CCO) of our wholly owned subsidiary, duostech. We have also hired a divisional Chief Operating Officer (COO) with a strong background in operations in multiple former assignments. The Company’s CFO will continue in the same role providing continuity and multiple years of public company experience. The Company’s Board of Directors is being strengthened with the addition of a retired Chief Operating Officer for a Class 1 railroad with more than 50 years of experience in the rail industry. The shareholders also approved the appointment of our CEO to the Board of Directors.
 
The new leadership team’s focus is to improve operational and technical execution which will in turn enable the commercial side of the business to expand RIP and ALIS delivery into existing customers. Even though the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to still be an issue during 2022, the Company’s primary customers have indicated readiness to order more equipment and services based upon the Company’s current performance.
 
Additionally, the CEO has directed that the Company make engineering and software upgrades to the RIP to meet anticipated Federal Railroad Association (FRA) and Association of American Railroad (AAR) standards. Similar upgrades are also being developed to improve the ALIS system.
 
Manufacturing and Assembly
 
The Company designs and develops technology solutions using a combination of in-house fabrication, commercial off-the-shelf technology, and outsourced manufacturing. On-site installations are performed using a combination of in-house project managers and engineers and using third-party sub-contractors as needed. Throughout the process of design, develop, deploy and operate, the Company maintains responsibility for all aspects. Our internal manufacturing operations consist primarily of materials procurement, assembly, testing and quality control by our engineers. If not manufactured internally, we use third-party manufacturing partners to produce our hardware related components and hardware products and we most often complete final assembly, testing and quality control processes for these components and products. Our manufacturing processes are based on standardization of components across product types, centralization of assembly and distribution centers, and a “build-to-order” methodology in which products generally are built only after customers have placed firm orders. For most of our hardware products, we have existing alternate sources of supply.
 
For 2022 and possibly beyond, we expect to face significant challenges with macro-economic impacts, specifically inflation and supply chain disruption. Although these started to be identified in late 2021, we believe they are manifesting themselves in ways that could hinder our business growth in the future. Specifically, the ability to source key components and certain implementation services will dictate just how quickly the Company can meet desired installation deadlines. In the industries in which we operate, the time from concept to contract can be substantial. Although we are now adapting to these challenges, previous bids that have been submitted could be challenging to execute within the financial framework and execution times originally envisaged. We continue to have dialogue with our customers regarding potential price increases and implementation delays, but we may suffer some economic impacts as a result of this. Revenue recognition could be delayed as result of these factors and profitability could be impacted due to higher costs for materials and other services. The Company will continue to monitor the situation and update shareholders as the situation unfolds.
 
Research and Development 
 
The Company’s R&D and software development teams design and develop all systems and software applications with a combination of full-time in-house software engineers and outside contractors. Internal development allows us to maintain technical control over the design and development of our products. Rapid technological advances in hardware and software development, evolving standards in computer hardware and software technology, and changing customer requirements characterize the markets in which we compete. We plan to continue to dedicate significant resources to research and development efforts, including software development, to maintain and improve our current product and services offerings.

Government Regulations
 
The Company has worked with various agencies of the federal government for more than 10-years including the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). When our solutions have been deployed into these agencies, they meet specific requirements for certification, safety and security that are stipulated in requirements and contract documents. The Company is currently competing for other government related work and strictly follows the rules and regulations outlined in the Federal Acquisition Regulations.
 
The Company’s primary customers are all governed by regulations related to the safe and effective transportation of goods, primarily by rail, but in future scenarios by Air, Road and Sea. While changes in the regulatory environment could impact the Company in future years, we review potential changes in the regulatory environment and maintain contact with key personnel at certain agencies including the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), Transportation Safety Agency (TSA) as well as the DHS previously mentioned. We expect to develop similar relationships with governmental agencies in target market both in the US and internationally. At this time, we believe our offerings are complementary with the current and evolving standards and that we will adapt to any new regulations as they are promulgated.
 
Employees
 
We have a current staff of 68 employees of which 60 are full-time, the majority of which work in the Jacksonville area, none of which are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
