General 
 iCAD, Inc. is a global medical technology company providing innovative cancer detection and therapy solutions. The Company reports in two operating segments: Cancer Detection (“Detection”) and Cancer Therapy (“Therapy”). Originally incorporated in Delaware in 1984 as Howtek, Inc., the Company changed its name in 2002 to iCAD, Inc. The Company’s headquarters are located in Nashua, New Hampshire. Xoft, Inc., Xoft Solutions LLC and iCAD France LLC are wholly owned subsidiaries of iCAD, Inc. and are consolidated for reporting purposes. 
 iCAD continues to evolve from a business focused on image analysis for the early detection of cancers to a broader participant in the cancer therapy market. The Company’s strategy is to provide patients and clinicians with a broad portfolio of innovative clinical and workflow solutions and technologies that address the two primary stages of the cancer care cycle, namely detection and treatment. The Company believes that its products can enhance early cancer detection and earlier targeted intervention, which could result in better health outcomes, overall savings to the healthcare system, and increased market demand and adoption of iCAD’s solutions. 
 Cancer Detection Segment 
 Background and Overview 
 According to the World Cancer Research Fund, breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide, and the second most common cancer overall, with more than two million new cases diagnosed worldwide in 2020. Approximately 39 million mammography procedures were performed in the United States in 2021.

  Although mammography is the most effective method for early detection of breast cancer, studies have shown that an estimated 20% or more of all breast cancers go undetected in the screening stage. The American Cancer Society estimates that, overall, screening mammograms do not find approximately one in five breast cancers. Observational errors are responsible for more than half of cancers missed, but products which utilize artificial intelligence (“AI”) and computer-aided detection (“CAD”) have been proven to reduce the risk of observational errors in mammography. These cancer detection solutions can improve interpretation workflow by using sophisticated deep learning AI algorithms designed to rapidly and accurately analyze image data and mark suspicious areas in the image that may warrant more attention or highlight the possibility that the area may contain a subtle, but significant abnormality. While breast cancer has been the primary focus of iCAD’s detection technology, the underlying technology has potential applications to aid in the diagnosis of many additional types of cancer. 
 In the United States, digital breast tomosynthesis (“DBT”) is rapidly replacing full-field digital mammography (“FFDM”) in breast cancer screening due to DBT’s clinical value in cancer detection. According to the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), as of February 1, 2022, the United States alone had approximately 8,745 Mammography Quality Standards Act (“MQSA”) certified facilities which provide mammography screening. These facilities operate approximately 23,873 MQSA accredited FFDM and/or DBT units with many of these units capable of both FFDM and DBT mammography. While many of these centers still use 2D FFDM systems, either alone or in combination with DBT systems, the Company believes approximately 11,000 of the mammography units in the United States are DBT capable based on January 2022 MQSA data. DBT greatly increases image data relative to FFDM, which creates significant workflow challenges for radiologists who face the additional workload and time required to accurately read all of the image data contained in DBT cases. Further, as incidence rates of cancer continue to rise, it is becoming increasingly important to find cancer sooner, optimize radiology workflow and reduce unnecessary recalls resulting from false positives. iCAD’s technology addresses these challenges with a variety of AI, CAD, and breast density and short-term risk assessment solutions for use with mammography, DBT, and Computed Tomography (“CT”) imaging, to enhance both detection and diagnosis stages of the cancer care cycle. 
 The Company launched Profound AI, a DBT cancer detection and workflow solution built on deep learning AI in the European Union (the “EU”) and Canada in 2016 and, after receiving FDA premarket approval in the United States in 2017. Most recently, ProFound AI 3.0 received FDA 510(k) clearance in March 2021 for commercial use in the United States for reading DBT exams generated using compatible DBT systems. This latest version of ProFound AI offers clinical and workflow improvements over the prior version. 
 The Company’s 2D FFDM breast density solution received FDA 510(k) clearance in December 2013. In December 2018, the Company also developed a breast density assessment product for tomosynthesis that assesses breast density using 2D synthetic images that are generated from 3D tomosynthesis datasets. 
 In July 2020, the Company received a CE mark in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) for ProFound AI Risk, the world’s first image-based 2-year risk assessment model that assesses short-term breast cancer risk based primarily on information found in a 2D mammogram. In September 2020, ProFound AI Risk for 2D was introduced in the U.S. market as a decision support tool for radiologists. In September 2021, ProFound AI Risk for DBT was launched as a clinical decision support tool that provides an accurate short-term breast cancer risk estimation that is truly personalized for each woman, based only on a 2D or 3D mammogram. 
 Based on the number of DBT units relative to the total units left to be converted to DBT, and the associated large number of installation opportunities, the Company believes that its cancer detection, breast density assessment and risk assessment solutions for DBT may represent a significant growth opportunity in the United States. The Company believes that there is also a growth opportunity for 2D mammography AI solutions in international markets, both from the analog to digital conversion and as more countries adopt the practice of each exam being read by a single radiologist using AI, rather than the alternative practice of having two radiologists read each

  case. Furthermore, additional western European countries have already implemented, or are planning to implement, mammography screening programs, which may increase the number of mammograms performed in those countries. 
 Breast Health Solutions Suite 
 The Company’s breast health solutions suite includes cancer detection solutions, automated breast density assessment, and breast cancer risk assessment, all for both 2D and 3D mammography. These solutions are designed to improve clinicians’ performance and enhance breast cancer screening. 
 PowerLook 
 PowerLook is the Company’s back-end architecture platform, which hosts AI algorithm solutions and manages the communications between (i) imaging acquisition systems (“Gantries”), and (ii) image storage and review systems such as Picture Archive and Communication Systems (“PACS”) and (iii) breast imaging viewing and interpretation systems. Workflow efficiency is critical in digital imaging environments and PowerLook was designed to streamline these processes. PowerLook includes a powerful and flexible DICOM (Digital Image and Communications in Medicine) compliant connectivity solution, which is designed to enable universal compatibility with leading PACS and review workstations. iCAD has worked with its industry partners to ensure optimal integration into the graphical user interface of their PACS and review workstations. The algorithms supported on the Powerlook platform have also been optimized for, and tested with, each supported digital imaging acquisition manufacturer based upon the characteristics of their unique components. 
 PowerLook v10.2, the latest version of the platform, consists of a hybrid-server environment, where algorithm processing still occurs on-premise (within the hospital) but license activation and usage tracking is executed via the cloud. This enables iCAD to implement various pricing and payment models, including various subscription-based models. This platform can be compartmentalized to integrate into other infrastructure, such as direct integration into imaging system infrastructure or the eventual potential offering of a cloud-hosted Software-as a-Service (SaaS) model. 
 SecondLook 
 SecondLook is a machine learning-based cancer detection algorithm that analyzes 2D FFDM images to identify and mark suspicious masses and calcifications. This technology provides radiologists with a “second look” that helps detect potentially actionable cancers earlier than screening mammography alone. SecondLook uses a sophisticated, patented machine learning algorithm designed to identify the masses and calcifications that are most likely to be malignant. The algorithm was trained using data from 2D mammography studies, enabling the product to distinguish between characteristics of cancerous and normal tissue. This differentiation results in earlier detection of hard-to-find cancers, improved workflow for radiologists, and higher quality patient care. SecondLook first received FDA premarket approval in 2002 and is currently available in the United States, Canada, and select countries in Europe and Asia. 
 Automated Density Assessment, 2D and 3D 
 The Company’s Automated Density Assessment solution provides an automated, consistent and standardized breast density assessment based on the American College of Radiology’s BI-RADS 5th Edition density categorization system, which is particularly important in the United States as at least 38 states and the District of Columbia require some level of breast density notification to patients as part of their screening mammogram. In July 2021, the Company introduced the latest version of the Company’s automated density solution, which was the first-to-market deep learning breast density assessment algorithm based on 2D synthetic images generated by DBT gantries from multiple vendors, including Hologic Medical Technology (Hologic) and Siemens. In addition, the product continues to support breast density assessment based on 2D images from leading FFDM manufactures.

  ProFound AI, 2D and 3D 
 DBT was introduced in the United States in 2010 and has been demonstrated to have multiple advantages over 2D mammography, including improved tissue visualization and detection that results in lower recall rates for patients. Clinical studies indicate that DBT improves the ability to distinguish malignant from benign tumors and can better detect malignant lesions hidden by overlapping tissues, each of which can reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies and false positive recall rates. Initial studies have indicated that physicians using DBT have the ability to detect 41% more invasive cancers than those using 2D mammography, and also can reduce false-positive reads by up to 15%. 
 While DBT has been shown to have clinical benefits for screening mammography, it can also significantly increase radiologist interpretation time compared to 2D mammography. AI-based solutions can significantly improve the efficiency and efficacy of reading breast tomosynthesis cases by identifying and highlighting suspicious breast masses and calcifications. 
 ProFound AI for DBT is iCAD’s deep-learning algorithm specifically designed to detect malignant soft-tissue densities and calcifications in DBT exams by analyzing each DBT image, or slice. In early 2018, the Company completed a large multi-reader, multi-case crossover design clinical reader study, which showed that ProFound AI can increase radiologist clinical performance by improving radiologist sensitivity by an average of 8%, improving radiologist specificity by an average of 6.9% and reduce recall rates in non-cancer cases by an average of 7.2%. The reader study also showed that the product can reduce DBT reading times by an average of 52.7%. Results from this reader study were published in the peer-reviewed journal, Radiology: Artificial Intelligence, in July 2019. 
 In 2018, the Company received regulatory clearances in the EU, Canada, and the U.S. for its multi-vendor, DBT AI cancer detection and workflow solution, Powerlook Tomo Detection 2.0, which was subsequently rebranded ProFound AI for DBT. In 2019, the Company launched ProFound AI for 2D, a similar AI cancer detection and workflow solution for 2D mammography. Profound AI for 2D is CE approved and primarily targets the European market, where 2D mammography remains the predominant procedure for breast cancer screening. On March 12, 2021, Version 3.0 of ProFound AI for DBT cleared FDA510(k) review for use in commercial reading of DBT exams from compatible DBT systems. ProFound AI for DBT Version 3.0 included algorithm changes that improved both sensitivity and specificity in reading DBT exams versus prior versions and included the Profound AI for 2D algorithm as a feature within ProFound AI for DBT. In May 2021, the Profound AI for 2D algorithm received EU approval for use with Fuji and Hologic Clarity HD DBT systems. In the fall of 2021, ProFound AI 3.0 for DBT added support for images acquired with Hologic’s Clarity HD DBT system as well as adding support for highlighting suspicious findings in GE, Hologic, and Siemens systems’ synthetic 2D images and in Hologic’s 3D Quorum slab images. 
 iCAD plans to continue its focus on (i) advancing the performance of its ProFound AI for DBT solution through algorithm improvements and additional training on larger datasets, and (ii) building clinical support for and adoption of its products and solutions. iCAD has presented ProFound AI for DBT data from numerous studies at various prominent industry meetings and trade shows. Information about past presentations and future announcements can be found in press releases on the company’s website at www.icadmed.com/press-releases. The Company has Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) relationships with General Electric Company (“GE”), Siemens AG (“Siemens”), and FUJIFILM Corporation (“Fuji”) and expects to use ProFound AI to expand its OEM partnerships with other mammography systems, PACS providers, and cloud-hosted AI platform providers. 
 ProFound AI™ Risk, 2D and 3D 
 ProFound AI Risk is the first and only commercially available clinical decision support tool that provides an accurate and personalized estimate of short-term breast cancer risk, based solely on a screening mammogram. 
 
6 

  The Company worked with leading researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, one of the world’s foremost medical research universities, to develop and clinically validate ProFound AI Risk. Unlike existing risk models that focus on family history and clinical lifestyle factors to estimate longer term risk, ProFound AI Risk focuses on a short-term risk interval. The estimation of risk of cancer occurrence within the next one to two years provides potentially different information on which to base further action relative to an elevated life-time risk of breast cancer. iCAD believes short-term risk models such as ProFound AI Risk will enable risk-based screening approaches rather than the age/ -based approach of annual screening. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the benefit of risk-based screening as several medical societies recommended that women of average risk postpone their routine annual mammograms until the threat of COVID-19 had passed. As mammography screening begins to evolve from what has traditionally been an age-based annual screening paradigm to a short-term risk-based paradigm in the years ahead, iCAD is on the leading edge of this shift. 
 ProFound AI Risk for 2D FFDM received a CE Mark in EEA in July 2020 and in September 2020, iCAD announced the publication of data in the peer-reviewed journal, Radiology, indicating that ProFound AI Risk more accurately identifies the prospect of near-term development of breast-cancer than traditional risk models. 
 The October 2021 launch of the latest version of ProFound AI Risk was a significant achievement for iCAD, as this leading-edge technology is the first commercially available clinical decision support tool that provides an accurate short-term breast cancer risk estimation truly personalized for each woman. The latest version of ProFound AI Risk offers the flexibility to work with 2D and 3D mammography images with high accuracy, showing over 10% improvement in AUC, a commonly used statistical measure of clinical accuracy, when compared to the Gail and Tyrer-Cuzick conventional lifetime risk models. The latest version of ProFound AI is designed for global application, able to (i) provide a one, two or three-year risk estimation, (ii) factor in ethnic and racial backgrounds in the assessment of the score, and (iii) factor in country specific screening guidelines and incident and mortality rates. 
 Expansion of Software Licensing Model Options for the Breast Health Solutions Suite 
 iCAD has historically offered solely perpetually-licensed software, primarily pre-installed on and sold with an iCAD configured, third-party manufactured server, capable of optimally running the software. As a result, customers using this model can only classify iCAD software and hardware as a capital purchase for accounting purposes by making a single up-front payment. 
 Beginning in 2022, iCAD will offer the full suite of software in a variety of more flexible and customer accessible options. First, iCAD will uncouple the purchase of iCAD software from the purchase of hardware. Second iCAD will evaluate a range of software licensing models designed to accommodate both capital and operating purchasing for customers. To make iCAD software more flexible, the Company’s software has been developed to run as a self-contained software package, making it executable within a variety of infrastructure environments, including iCAD configured servers, alternatively sourced specification-compliant servers, virtualized environments, integrations into channel partner infrastructure and cloud-based hosting servers. iCAD will continue to sell iCAD configured servers to customers who prefer a single-vendor, turnkey solution with guaranteed compatibility and support. The Company is actively evaluating software licensing models. 
 iCAD will continue to offer existing perpetual-license model for the Company’s software to as many customers who prefer a one-time purchase which effectively provides ownership of the license. For those customers who need or prefer an operating expense model or minimal capital investment, iCAD is evaluating subscription models for the same on-premises software products. If customers or channel partners have specification compliant infrastructure, iCAD may be able to license the Company’s software under either model. 
 Once a subscription model is offered, it will, by definition, result in reduced short-term revenue attributable to each customer electing a subscription license in lieu of a perpetual license. For example, when a perpetual license on a representative product is sold, revenue in the quarter of such sale could range from approximately $25,000 to $35,000 per license/per gantry depending on numerous factors. That same installation under a 
 
7 

  subscription model could result in monthly revenue of approximately $800 to $1,200 for an expected minimum of three years or more, depending on cancellation terms and the duration of a customer’s subscription. 
 iCAD is committed to providing solutions that will enable as many customers to purchase or utilize the Company’s products. The Company’s Therapy business and the services and hardware product portions of the Detection business are expected to remain unchanged in the coming year. The subscription licensing model is currently being evaluated and the short-term and long-term impacts on the Company’s results of operations are being tested, although iCAD believes subscriptions will be relatively slow to accumulate over time and will be largely additive to the perpetual license business. Additive customers will have positive revenue impact and while the transition of perpetual license customers to subscription customers will have negative effects in the short term, iCAD expects this to impact a limited fraction of the overall revenue base of the Company in 2022. The Company is also currently evaluating the future potential of providing a SaaS subscription model with the Company hosting its software from the cloud. 
 Colon Cancer Screening Products 
 Colon cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed globally, with more than 1.1 million new cases diagnosed worldwide in 2020. CT is a well-established and widely used imaging technology that is used to image cross-sectional “slices” of various parts of the human body. While the increased image quality and number of cross-sectional slices per scan offered by CT provides valuable diagnostic information, it adds to the challenge of managing and interpreting the large volume of data generated. CT Colonography (“CTC”) is a less invasive technique for imaging the colon when screening for cancer than a traditional colonoscopy. However, the process of reading a CTC exam can be lengthy and tedious as the interpreting physician is often required to traverse the entire length of the colon multiple times. CAD technology can play an important role in improving the accuracy and efficiency of reading CTC images by automatically identifying and highlighting polyps that can progress into cancer. 
 VeraLook is the Company’s FDA-cleared solution designed to support detection of colonic polyps in conjunction with CTC. Field testing of the product was initiated in 2008. Results of the Company’s multi-reader clinical study demonstrated that the use of VeraLook improved reader sensitivity by 5.5% for patients with both small and large polyps, and slightly reduced specificity of readers by 2.5%. VeraLook was CE marked in 2009, received FDA 510(k) clearance in 2010 and is currently distributed with advanced visualization reading workstations and CTC applications manufactured by Canon Medical Systems and Philips Healthcare. 
 Potential Future Cancer Detection Products Development 
 The Company’s current primary focus is on image analysis and workflow solutions leveraging AI in 2D mammography and DBT applications, however, iCAD’s core technologies and product development capabilities can be applied to any imaging modality, including x-ray, CT, ultrasound, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (“MRI”). Additionally, the Company could develop products that can be applied to screening and/or diagnosis of various additional cancer types such as prostate, lung, and brain cancers, as well as screening and/or diagnosis of disease related to visually differentiated tissue abnormalities. The Company continues to evaluate the adjacent or complementary opportunities in image analysis workflow solutions for future product development and commercialization possibilities. 
Cancer Therapy Segment 
 Background and Overview 
 Radiation therapy is the medical use of ionizing radiation, generally as part of cancer treatment to control or kill rapidly dividing malignant cells. Radiation therapy may be curative in numerous types of cancer if the cancer cells are localized to one area of the body. It may also be used as part of curative therapy to prevent tumor 
 
8 

  recurrence after surgical removal of a primary malignant tumor (for example, early-stage breast cancer). The clinical goal in radiation oncology is to deliver the highest radiation dose possible directly to the tumor to kill the cancer cells, while minimizing radiation exposure to healthy tissue surrounding the tumor to limit complications and side effects. 
 The three main types of radiation therapy are (i) external beam radiation therapy (“EBRT”), which involves a radiation source positioned outside the body, (ii) brachytherapy, in which sealed radiation sources are temporarily or permanently inserted in the body, within the treatment area, and (iii) systemic radioisotopes, which are given by infusion or oral ingestion. 
 Conventional EBRT typically involves up to 40 radiation treatment sessions for a tumor. Brachytherapy offers the benefit of reduced radiation exposure to healthy tissues further away from the radiation source. In addition, if the patient moves or if there is any tumor movement within the body during treatment, the radiation source retains its correct position in relation to the tumor. Thus, brachytherapy offers an advantage over EBRT in its ability to better direct high doses of radiation to the size and shape of the cancerous area while sparing healthy tissue and organs. 
 Brachytherapy is commonly used as an effective treatment for endometrial, cervical, prostate, breast, and skin cancer, and can also be used to treat tumors in many other body sites. Electronic Brachytherapy (“eBx”) is a type of radiation therapy that utilizes a miniaturized, electronically stimulated, high dose rate X-ray source to apply radiation directly to the cancerous site. Unlike live isotope sources used in some brachytherapy, eBx only emits radiation when desired and the radiation dosage can be accurately controlled. eBx may also be used in Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (“APBI”), which concentrates the radiation therapy on a smaller focal point than conventional EBRT, allowing higher concentrations of radiation over fewer treatment sessions. 
 Cancer Therapy Products 
 The Xoft Axxent Electronic Brachytherapy System (“Xoft System”) is iCAD’s proprietary electronic brachytherapy platform designed to deliver isotope-free (non-radioactive) radiation treatment in virtually any clinical setting without the limitations of radionuclides. The Xoft System utilizes a miniaturized high dose rate, low energy X-ray source to apply the radiation dose directly to the size and shape of the cancerous area while sparing healthy tissue and organs. While delivering clinical dose rates similar to traditional radioactive systems, the electronic nature of the Xoft System technology provides a faster dose fall-off which lowers the radiation exposure outside of the targeted area and eliminates the need for dedicated shielded treatment environment such as that required with traditional isotope-based radiation therapy. As the Xoft System is relatively compact, it can easily be transported for use in virtually any clinical setting under radiation oncology supervision (including the operating room, where intraoperative radiation therapy (“IORT”) is delivered). 
 The Xoft System is FDA-cleared, CE marked and licensed in an increasing number of countries for the treatment of cancer anywhere in the body. Active customers include university research and community hospitals, cancer care clinics, veterinary facilities, and dermatology offices with established strategic partnerships with radiation oncology service providers for supervised treatment delivery. The Company’s commercial focus for the Xoft System has been the treatment of early-stage breast cancer, gynecological cancers, and non-melanoma skin cancer (“NMSC”). Emerging applications include a wide and growing array of cancers, including brain and rectal tumors. Given that the Xoft System has regulatory clearance for the treatment of cancer anywhere in the body, treatments for emerging applications may not require additional regulatory clearance. 
 The Company continues to make enhancements to the Xoft System controller (the “Controller”) unit, including upgrades to the high voltage connection, and the Streamlined Module for Advanced Radiation Therapy (“SMART”) platform which uses the Axxent Hub, iCAD’s proprietary cloud-based oncology collaboration software solution. The SMART platform is an adaptive, patient-centric solution designed to improve the eBX 
 
9 

  program’s workflow efficiency, flexibility, safety, and security. This comprehensive Wi-Fi enabled platform provides all members of a care team with a collaborative environment in which to manage patient workflow and eliminate challenges related to exchanging current, accurate patient data among providers. 
 In addition to the Controller unit, the Company offers a 50kV isotope-free energy source, indication-specific applicators, a comprehensive service warranty program, and various accessories such as the Axxent eBx Rigid Shield for internal IORT shielding. The 50kV energy source is typically sold under an annual contract and is customized to individual customer volume and usage requirements. The Company offers FDA-cleared applicators for the utilization of the Xoft System, including breast applicators for IORT and APBI in the treatment of breast cancer, vaginal applicators for the treatment of endometrial cancer, cervical applicators for the treatment of cervical cancer, and skin applicators for the treatment of NMSC. The flexible single-use breast and brain applicators are offered in a variety of sizes and lengths based on clinical need. The endometrial, cervical, rectal, and skin applicators are reusable and are manufactured in various sizes based on the anatomical requirements of the patient or the size of the lesion. 
 Cancer Therapy Indications 
 Background and Overview 
 The Xoft System can be used to treat a wide and growing array of cancers, including breast cancer, NMSC, gynecological, recurrent glioblastoma (“GBM”) and various other forms of brain cancer, and additional IORT indications. 
 Approximately 300,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer every year in the United States. Currently, many early-stage breast cancer patients who are treated with radiation therapy follow a four-to-six-week daily protocol of traditional EBRT, while a small portion are treated with brachytherapy. Breast cancer therapy is one of the primary indications for the Xoft system. Xoft used in IORT aims to simplify radiation treatment for early-stage breast cancer patients by delivering a single ten to fifteen-minute precise dose of radiation directly to the lumpectomy cavity in a single, safe and effective procedure. Xoft used in APBI may reduce the daily radiation treatment duration from weeks to days. 
 There are approximately 3.5 million cases of NMSC diagnosed annually in the United States. The Xoft System is a viable alternative treatment option for patients with lesions in cosmetically challenging locations (e.g., ear, nose, scalp, neck), locations that experience difficulties in healing (e.g., lower legs, upper chest, fragile skin), patients on anticoagulants, and patients who are anxious about surgery. The Xoft System has been used to treat more than 10,000 NMSC lesions. Clinical data published from 2015 to 2017 demonstrates promising local control and supports eBx as a convenient, effective, nonsurgical treatment option offering minimal toxicity and improved cosmesis for eligible NMSC patients. 
 There are approximately 50,000 new cases of endometrial cancer each year in the United States and more than 800,000 new cases worldwide. In 2017, the first-ever European analysis of eBx using the Xoft System for endometrial and cervical cancer treatment was presented that demonstrated improved outcomes in acute toxicity in 29 endometrial or cervical cancer patients treated with the Xoft System from September 2015 to September 2016. Additional research showed that compared to an iridium isotope, the Xoft System delivered a lower dose of radiation to surrounding healthy organs at risk, such as the bladder and rectum. 
 Approximately 297,000 cases of brain and nervous system tumors are diagnosed worldwide per year. GBM is the most common and aggressive type of malignant primary brain tumor, with an estimated median survival of 10 to 12 months. The company is continuing to develop clinical support for brain IORT, primarily in the GLIOX trial, an international multi-center trial led by principal investigator and world-renowned oncologist, Santosh Kesari, MD, PhD, Chair and Professor, Department of Translational Neurosciences at the Saint John’s Cancer Institute, Santa Monica, CA. The first patient in the GLIOX trial was treated in December 2021. The GLIOX trial is 
 
10 

  designed to compare Xoft IORT plus Avastin® (bevacizumab) to the investigational arm of RTOG-1205 (EBRT plus bevacizumab). Researchers hope this study will validate the intriguing initial results from a prospective two center comparative study at the European Medical Center (the “EMC”) in Moscow, Russia. The EMC study evaluated 15 patients with recurrent GBM who were treated with maximal safe resection and Xoft Brain IORT, and 15 patients with recurrent GBM treated with maximal safe resection and other modalities (control group), between June 2016 and June 2019. In October 2021, data supporting Xoft Brain IORT for the treatment of recurrent GBM were published with a subsequent erratum published in December 2021, in the peer-reviewed journal, Surgical Neurology International. The update reported that as of March 2021, patients treated in the EMC study with Xoft Brain IORT lived for up to 54 months after treatment without recurrence, whereas patients in the control group had a recurrence within 10 months and lived for up to 22.5 months after treatment. Researchers also found there were fewer complications, such as radionecrosis, in the IORT group. Radionecrosis refers to the breakdown of normal body tissue near the original tumor site after radiation therapy. One patient from the IORT group was still alive as of January 1, 2022, whereas none of the patients in the control group survived. Preliminary results from this study were presented in August 2021 at the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) 2021 annual scientific meeting. 
 Additionally, electronic brachytherapy is appropriate for use in other IORT clinical settings where surgical resection is unable to completely eliminate all cancer cells. The Company believes that IORT for prostate, pelvic, gastrointestinal, abdominal, spinal, and soft tissue sarcoma applications are potential markets given the minimal shielding requirements associated with this treatment modality. In September 2019, the Company unveiled new and updated advancements for the Xoft System at the American Society for Radiation Oncology (“ASTRO”) annual meeting. This included an advanced prototype for early-stage rectal cancers, and extended-length balloon applicators, available in 25 cm and 50 cm lengths, which offer added versatility and the potential for additional applications for the Xoft System in different areas of the body. Based on these additional clinical applications and the potential to scale the Xoft System in the future to address other indications for use, the Company believes the Xoft System offers unique flexibility and opportunities for growth. 
 Additional Studies 
 In 2016, Melinda Epstein, PhD, of Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach, California and co-authors published two clinical papers on their experience with the Xoft System for the treatment of early-stage breast cancer with IORT. In June 2016, the Annals of Surgical Oncology published data on 702 patients treated from June 2010 to January 2016, demonstrating a 1.7% recurrence rate. Further, less than 5% of patients had significant complications, indicating that IORT allows some women who cannot (or decline to) undergo whole breast radiation to consider breast-conserving therapy rather than mastectomy. In August 2016, The Breast Journal published 20-month mean follow-up data on 146 patients with pure ductal carcinoma in situ treated with IORT. The data showed a 2.1% recurrence rate with relatively few complications and again concluded that x-ray based IORT has the potential to be a promising treatment modality that may simplify the delivery of post-excision radiation therapy. 
 In 2017, researchers from Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian published another clinical paper in the Annals of Surgical Oncology on their experience with the Xoft System in treating 204 early-stage breast cancers in a prospective, X-ray IORT trial from June 2010 to September 2013. With a median follow-up of 50 months, results indicated there were seven ipsilateral breast tumor events, no regional or distant recurrences, and no breast cancer-related deaths. Kaplan-Meier analysis projects that 2.9% of patients will recur locally at 4 years. The site’s low complication and recurrence rates support the cautious use and continued study of IORT in selected women with low-risk breast cancer. The Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian IORT series is currently the largest single-facility IORT series with the Xoft System in the United States. 
 Also, in 2017, the Company announced results of a landmark study that demonstrated the economic benefits of IORT compared to EBRT in the treatment of early-stage breast cancer. The analysis demonstrated that IORT could result in direct cost savings for the U.S. healthcare system of more than $630 million over the lifetime of 
 
11 

  patients diagnosed annually with early-stage breast cancer, as well as could significantly benefit patient health by minimizing radiation exposure and offering a better quality of life. The results of the study were published in November 2017 in the peer-reviewed Cost Effectiveness and Resource Allocation and the study determined IORT to be the preferred method of treatment for early-stage breast cancer. 
 As the Company continues to focus on broadening global awareness and patient access to IORT, 2017 also brought meaningful progress in the area of international research. Physicians from Taiwan published a clinical paper in November 2017 in the peer-reviewed PLOS One journal. The multi-center study examined patient selection and the oncologic safety of IORT with the Xoft System for the management of early-stage breast cancer. From 2013 to 2015, 26 hospitals in Taiwan performed a total of 261 IORT procedures. With a mean follow-up of 15.6 months, locoregional recurrence was observed in 0.8% of patients. The study concluded that preliminary results of IORT in Taiwan showed it is well accepted by patients and clinicians. 
 Finally, in 2017, the Company announced that results of a matched-pair cohort study of 369 early-stage NMSC patients treated with the Xoft System or Mohs micrographic surgery showed that rates of recurrence of cancer were virtually identical at a mean follow-up of 3.4 years. Mohs micrographic surgery is accepted as the most effective technique for removing basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. The study results were published online in the peer-reviewed Journal of Contemporary Brachytherapy. 
 In 2018, several additional key pieces of clinical evidence supporting IORT with the Xoft System were published. With a mean follow-up of 55 months, outcomes published in The American Journal of Surgery showed that breast cancer recurrence rates of patients who were treated with IORT using the Xoft System and complied with adjuvant medical therapy were comparable to those seen in the cornerstone TARGIT-A study, which evaluated IORT but did not use the Xoft System. The study reviewed results of 184 patients with breast cancer from November 2011 to January 2016 completing Institutional Review Board (“IRB”)-approved IORT protocol. The recurrence rate for the 184 total IORT patients was 5.4 percent at a mean follow-up of 55 months; however, the recurrence rate was 2 percent lower for the patients who complied with adjuvant medical therapy. The difference in recurrence rates between the group complying with versus declining adjuvant medical therapy was statistically significant. To date, this study presents the most long-term research of IORT using the Xoft System published in a peer-reviewed journal. 
 Further in 2018, a long-term study of 1,000 tumors performed at Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian and in the Annals of Surgical Oncology showed that IORT is a clinically effective, faster and easier alternative to whole breast radiation therapy following breast-conserving surgery for selected low-risk patients at a median follow-up of 36 months. To date, this study presents analysis of the largest series of early-stage breast cancers treated with IORT using the Xoft System published in a peer-reviewed journal. 
 In 2019, study results from the first cervical cancer cases for eight patients treated with the Xoft System at the Hospital Universitario Miguel Servet in Zaragoza, Spain were published in the Journal of Applied Clinical Medical Physics. Researchers found the treatment offered promising results at 1 month follow up, with no recurrences and low toxicity. The study concluded that electronic brachytherapy is a good alternative to treating cervical cancer in centers without access to conventional high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy. 
 Clinical data supporting the Xoft System for the treatment of various gynecological cancers, including cervical and uterine, were also presented in 2019 at the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology meeting by researchers from the Hospital Universitario Miguel Servet and the Jewish General Hospital in Montreal, Québec, Canada. A study conducted by researchers from the Hospital Universitario Miguel Servet concluded that electronic brachytherapy is an alternative to high dose-rate brachytherapy with a good rate of overall survival and progression free disease. The retrospective study conducted by researchers at the Jewish General Hospital suggested that electronic brachytherapy could replace high-dose-rate brachytherapy in uterine cancer with similar target coverage, maximum dose to surrounding structures, and treatment times and that additional studies would be needed to evaluate efficacy.

  Preliminary results of the Company’s international, multi-center clinical trial in the Xoft System were unveiled during an oral presentation at the 60th ASTRO annual meeting at the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center in San Antonio, Texas on October 23, 2018. In the presentation, A.M. Nisar Syed, MD, Principal Study Investigator, Medical Director, Radiation Oncology & Endocurietherapy, MemorialCare Cancer Institute, Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, and Professor of Radiation Oncology, UCI Medical Center and Harbor-UCLA School of Medicine, detailed clinical techniques and outcomes of IORT using the Xoft System at the time of breast conserving surgery with findings based upon ASTRO suitability criteria. The trial enrolled 1,200 patients between May 2012 and July 2018 at 28 international and U.S.-based institutions. With a median follow up of 1.6 years, less than one percent of patients had cancer regrowth (ipsilateral recurrence) or developed new primary cancers in the other breast. Treatment was generally well tolerated with grade 3, 4 and 5 adverse events occurring in 37 patients. Mean treatment time was 10.5 minutes. 
 At the ASTRO Virtual Annual Meeting in October 2020, researchers presented new data supporting the Xoft System for the treatment of early-stage breast cancer and endometrial cancer. In a study involving 1,200 patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with the Xoft System from May 2012 to July 2018 across 27 institutions worldwide, researchers concluded that IORT with the Xoft System is safe, with low morbidity, low local recurrence and excellent cosmetic results. In a study of 236 patients with endometrial cancer from September 2015 to May 2020, with a median follow up of 34 months, researchers concluded the Xoft System is a feasible alternative to HDR brachytherapy for the treatment of endometrial cancer that offers long-term benefits for patients, staff and the overall healthcare system. 
 Researchers from Miguel Servet University Hospital in Spain presented several studies supporting the Xoft System at the European Society for Radiotherapy & Oncology (ESTRO) virtual meeting in November 2020. In a study analyzing 193 patients from 2015 to 2019, where one group was treated with the Xoft System combined with external radiation and one group was treated with the Xoft System, researchers established electronic brachytherapy for endometrial cancer as a feasible alternative to HDR brachytherapy, equal in effectiveness to Iridium 192, with long-term benefits for patients. Researchers concluded that the Xoft System provided the same dosimetric coverage in the area of treatment as traditional brachytherapy with a marked reduction in dosage to organs at risk. 
 In another study presented at ESTRO 2020, researchers created 3D printed anatomic models that allowed them to create simulations to measure possible radiation doses in nearby organs, such as the lung and heart, where it is not possible to place a detector to perform in vivo dosimetry. Results calculated the maximum doses to radiochromic film representing the left lung and heart of 20 patients treated from the left breast measured retrospectively. Researchers concluded it was possible to measure and verify doses in the lung and heart for IORT treatments, enabling more accurate recommendations for a particular type of treatment. 
 A third study presented at ESTRO 2020 examined the results of 480 patients treated with IORT from May 2015 to October 2019 with treatment verification and in vivo dose measurements to understand the in vivo dose in the skin. Researchers concluded the skin doses were low with less than 1% of the cases exhibiting early toxicity of acute grade 3 dermatitis and no cases of higher-grade dermatitis. 
 Researchers presented a study supporting Xoft Breast IORT at the American Brachytherapy Society (ABS) 2021 Annual Conference. In a study evaluating the efficacy and outcome of IORT for early-stage breast cancer, researchers found recurrence rates to be similar to those reported in the TARGIT-A trial. Preliminary results from the ExBRT trial were presented at the ASBrS Annual Meeting in 2021. The multi-institutional study found at median 4-year follow-up, 1,200 breast cancer patients enrolled in the ExBRT trial were successfully treated with a single fraction of IORT to the lumpectomy cavity following breast conserving surgery with a favorable local recurrence rate. At the ESTRO meeting in 2021, researchers presented a study evaluating body mass index (BMI) in breast cancer patients treated with Xoft Breast IORT.

  Sales and Marketing 
 Cancer Detection 
 In November 2020, iCAD announced that more than 1,000 ProFound AI licenses had been sold since the product was launched, and the Company has now sold more than 1,300 ProFound AI licenses through December 31, 2021 and more than 2,000 total product licenses including ProFoundAI, upgrades, and other products. In North America, iCAD sells its AI mammography products through a direct regional sales force and through the Company’s OEM partners, which include GE Healthcare, a subsidiary of GE focused on the manufacture and distribution of diagnostic imaging agents, Fujifilm Medical Systems a subsidiary of Fuji focused on the manufacture and distribution of X-rays and other imaging equipment, and Siemens Medical Systems. In Europe, the Company sells its AI mammography products through a direct sales force and has also developed reseller relationships with regional distributors. 
 In 2020, iCAD signed a distribution agreement with Change Healthcare Inc. (“Change Healthcare”), a leading independent healthcare technology company focused on insights, innovation and accelerating the transformation of the U.S. healthcare system. The agreement will expand access to ProFound AI for more hospitals and imaging centers across North America. 
 In June 2021, iCAD signed a global distribution agreement with Sectra AB (“Sectra”), an international medical imaging IT solutions and cybersecurity company. Through this agreement, ProFound AI and ProFound AI Risk will be offered through the Sectra Amplifier Marketplace, which will expand iCAD’s access to more facilities and imaging centers worldwide. 
 In November 2021, iCAD signed a global distribution agreement with Arterys Inc. (“Arterys”), the world’s leading cloud native, vendor-neutral AI platform under which Arterys will offer iCAD’s AI-powered breast health solutions via Arterys’ FDA-cleared and CE-marked MICA platform to its installed base. 
 Additionally, as part of its sales and marketing efforts, the Company engages in a variety of public relations and local outreach programs with numerous customers and continues to cultivate relationships with industry leaders in breast cancer solutions, including at trade shows where the future of medical image analysis solutions is discussed. 
 Cancer Treatment 
 iCAD markets the Xoft System in the United States and select countries worldwide through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Xoft, Inc. a Delaware corporation (“Xoft”). In the United States, Xoft utilizes a direct sales force and selected distribution partners. Xoft has been granted regulatory approval and has established partnerships in the United States, many European Union countries, the United Kingdom, Australia, Taiwan, China, and numerous other countries. iCAD continues to evaluate regulatory and distribution opportunities throughout the world. 
 A comprehensive medical education program is a key part to the Company’s eBx market development strategy. Xoft actively participates in key industry scientific conferences and independent venues in the United States and Europe where the Company provides professional education programs and product demonstrations relating to eBx. The goal of these programs and demonstrations is to broaden physician awareness of the Xoft System and eBx technology. 
 Competition 
 The Company operates in highly competitive and rapidly changing markets with competitive products available from nationally and internationally recognized companies. Many of these competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources than iCAD and are well-established in the healthcare market. In addition to the existing technologies or products that compete with the Company’s products, some companies 
 
14 

  may develop technologies or products that compete with the products the Company manufactures and distributes or that would render the Company’s products obsolete or noncompetitive. Moreover, competitors may achieve patent protection, regulatory approval, or product commercialization before iCAD does, which would limit the Company’s ability to compete with them. iCAD believes that efficacy, safety profile, feature differentiation, cost, and reimbursement are the primary competitive factors that will affect the success of the Company’s products. 
 Cancer Detection 
 The Company currently faces direct competition in its cancer detection and breast density assessment businesses from Hologic, Inc. (Marlborough, MA), Volpara Solutions Limited (Rochester, NY), ScreenPoint Medical (Nijmegen, Netherlands), Densitas Inc. (Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada), Therapixel (Paris, France), and Lunit (Seoul, South Korea). The Company believes many factors, including breadth of innovative and clinically differentiated product offerings, ongoing development of clinical support, strong relationships with its strategic partners, and ability to provide the Company’s solutions across a number of platforms and payment structures will provide it with a competitive advantage in breast AI. 
 The Company’s VeraLook product faces competition from the traditional imaging CT equipment manufacturers and emerging CAD companies. Siemens Medical (Tarrytown, NY), GE Healthcare (Chicago, IL), and Philips Medical Systems (Andover, MA) currently offer polyp detection products outside the United States. A significant barrier to adoption in the United States has been a lack of reimbursement for CTC for colon cancer screening. The Company expects that CT manufacturers will offer a colonic polyp detection solution as an advanced feature of their image management and display products typically sold with their CT equipment, but current reimbursement policies present a significant barrier to wide-spread adoption and the Company believes that its market leadership in mammography AI may provide it with a competitive advantage within the CTC community. 
 Cancer Treatment 
 The Company’s eBx products face competition in breast IORT primarily from Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc. (“Zeiss”) (Dublin, CA), which has an established base of breast IORT installations in Europe. Zeiss manufactures and sells eBx products for the delivery of IORT, for both breast and additional anatomical areas, including the spine, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and endometrial cancers. Sensus Healthcare Inc. (Boca Raton, FL) and IntraOp Medical Corporation (Sunnyvale, CA) are other competitors in the breast IORT market. 
 The expansion of the Company’s gynecological product portfolio and new IORT applications beyond breast IORT have increased the competitive dynamic of the Company’s business. Larger and more diversified radiation therapy companies offer a wide variety of clinical solutions for HDR brachytherapy, including Varian Medical Systems (Milpitas, CA) and Elekta (Stockholm, Sweden). These companies offer broad product portfolios, which include a full range of HDR brachytherapy after loaders and applicators, traditional radiation therapy solutions, treatment planning solutions, and workflow management capabilities. 
 The Company’s NMSC products face competition from other mobile non-surgical treatment options (such as Sensus Healthcare’s Surface Radiation Therapy system and Elekta’s Esteya system), surgical treatment options and traditional radiation therapy. 
 In September 2020, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) issued a final rule establishing the Radiation Oncology Advanced Payment Model, a bundled payment model for radiotherapy treatment that incentivizes physician selection of high quality, lower cost treatment modalities like Xoft’s electronic brachytherapy for treatment of breast and other cancers. In the final notice, CMS did not include IORT treatments (including CPT codes 77424 and 77425) within the new alternative payment model for radiation oncology. As a result, whether or not a particular physician practice or hospital is subject to the new radiation oncology payment model, IORT services covered by Medicare will continue to be subject to the existing payment systems for physician services and hospital outpatient services. The model was supposed to begin in 
 
15 

  2021, but Congress passed legislation to delay the start of the new payment model until 2023. Stakeholders are encouraging CMS to make significant changes to the model before it takes effect. Medicare has not yet posted the final version of the rule outlining the details of the program. 
 Manufacturing and Professional Services 
 The Company manufactures and assembles its detection products. When a product sale is made to an end-customer by one of the Company’s OEM partners, it is usually installed at the customer site by the OEM partner or the Company. When iCAD makes a product sale directly to the end-customer, the product is generally installed by iCAD personnel at the customer site. 
 iCAD’s professional services staff provides comprehensive product support on a post-sale basis. Product support includes product demonstrations, product installations, applications training, and technical support. The Company’s support center is a single point of contact for the end-customer, and provides remote diagnostics, troubleshooting, training, and service dispatch. Service repair efforts are generally performed at the customer site by third party service organizations or in the Company’s repair depot by the Company’s repair technicians. 
 Xoft’s portable Xoft System is manufactured and assembled by contract manufacturers. Xoft’s miniaturized eBx X-ray source is manufactured by the Company at its San Jose, CA facility. Once the product has shipped, it is typically installed by Xoft personnel at the customer site. 
 Xoft’s professional services staff provides comprehensive product support, physician support, radiation therapist support and billing support on a post-sales basis. Field service staff is involved in product installation, maintenance, training and service repair. 
 Government Regulation 
 iCAD’s operations, products and customers are subject to extensive government regulation by numerous government agencies. the Company’s software, hardware systems and related accessories are regulated as medical devices in each of the jurisdictions where the Company operates, and iCAD’s customers are subject to applicable provider quality standards. 
Manufacturing and Sales 
 In the United States, numerous laws and regulations govern the processes by which iCAD’s products are brought to market. These include the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and its regulations, which govern, among other things, quality standards for product development, manufacturing, testing, labeling, storage, premarket clearance or approval, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, and post-market surveillance of medical devices. 
 For devices in the United States, FDA’s premarket clearance or approval process controls the entry of products into the market, unless a device is exempt from premarket review. Whether a product requires clearance (510(k) premarket notification) or approval (premarket approval, “PMA”) depends on the FDA’s risk-based classification of the device. Some of the Company’s products require submission of a premarket notification demonstrating that the device is at least as safe and effective, that is, “substantially equivalent”, to a legally marketed device that is not required to be approved under a PMA. Once iCAD receives an order from FDA declaring a device to be substantially equivalent, the iCAD product is “cleared” for commercial marketing in the United States. Other iCAD products require submission of a PMA, which requires non-clinical and clinical data supporting the safety and effectiveness of the device. Once the Company receives FDA approval of its PMA application based on FDA’s determination that the application contains sufficient, valid scientific evidence to assure that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s), iCAD may market the device. 
 
16 

  After our products enter the market, iCAD and our products continue to be subject to FDA regulation. For example, the FDA Quality System Regulations (“QSR”) require manufacturers to establish a quality system including extensive design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures designed to ensure that their products consistently meet applicable FDA requirements and manufacturer specifications. iCAD’s third-party manufacturers are also required to comply with applicable parts of the QSR. Manufacturers are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA to determine compliance with QSR. If at the conclusion of an inspection, FDA has made any observations that may constitute violations of applicable requirements, it may issue an FDA Form 483 (“483”) requiring corrective action within a limited amount of time. If any observations are not addressed and/or corrective action taken, FDA may issue a warning letter and or take other enforcement action. The Company also is subject to FDA regulations covering labeling and adverse event reporting as well as the FDA’s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or “off-label” uses. Failure to comply fully with applicable regulations could lead to delayed marketing clearance or approval or enforcement action, including 483s, warning letters, product seizures, import/export refusal, civil or criminal penalties, injunctions, and criminal prosecution. 
 Similarly, medical device regulators in other jurisdictions require various levels of clearance, approval, certification, licensure and/or consent before regulated medical devices can be lawfully commercialized in those jurisdictions as well as ongoing compliance with manufacturing and other regulatory requirements. These approvals, the time required for regulatory review, and the continuing compliance requirements vary by jurisdiction. Obtaining and maintaining foreign regulatory approvals and maintaining compliance is an expensive and time-consuming process. Increasingly, medical device manufacturers are adopting globally harmonized quality standards as developed by the International Organization for Standardization, and risk management standards. Manufacturers of software as a medical device are further subject to specific security standards. 
 Additionally, the U.S. government regulates the transfer of information, commodities, technology and software considered to be strategically important to the United States in the interest of national security, economic and/or foreign policy concerns. A complicated network of federal agencies and inter-related regulations in the United States that govern exports, collectively referred to as “Export Controls.” These regulate the shipment or transfer, by whatever means, of controlled items, software, technology, or services out of the United States. Exported medical products are also subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the medical product is exported. 
 Healthcare Laws 
 The Company is also subject to a variety of federal and state regulations in the United States and regulations in other jurisdictions that relate to iCAD’s interactions with healthcare practitioners, government officials, purchasing decision makers, and other stakeholders across healthcare systems. These regulations, discussed in more detail below, include among others, the following: 

• | anti-kickback, false claims, and physician self-referral statutes;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | U.S. state laws and regulations regarding fee splitting and other relationships between healthcare providers and non-professional entities, such as companies that provide management and reimbursement support services;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | anti-bribery laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Anti-Bribery Act, the Canadian Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act, and guidance promulgated by certain multi-national groups, such as the United Nations Convention Against Corruption and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Convention on Combatting Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | laws regulating the privacy and security of health data, protected health information and personally identifiable information. These include the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, the
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



17 

  
General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) in the EU, and the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act in Canada; and
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | healthcare reform laws in the United States, such as the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) and the 21st Century Cures Act, which include new regulatory mandates and other measures designed to reduce the rate of medical inflation. These include, among other things, stringent new reporting requirements of financial relationships between device manufacturers and physicians and teaching hospitals.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


These laws and regulations are extremely complex, open to interpretation, and, in some cases, still evolving. If iCAD’s operations are found to violate any of the foreign, federal, state or local laws and regulations which govern its activities, iCAD may be subject to litigation, government enforcement actions, and applicable penalties, which could include civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in certain payer programs or curtailment of the Company’s operations. Compliance obligations under these various laws are often detailed and onerous, further contributing to the risk that the Company could be found to be out of compliance with particular requirements. The risk of being found in violation of these laws and regulations is further increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. 
 The FDA, CMS, the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (“HHS-OIG”), the Department of Justice, states’ attorneys general and other governmental authorities actively enforce the laws and regulations discussed above. In the United States, medical device companies have been the target of numerous government prosecutions and investigations alleging violations of law, including claims asserting impermissible off-label promotion of medical devices, payments intended to influence the referral of federal or state healthcare business, and submission of false claims for government reimbursement. While iCAD makes every effort to comply with applicable laws, it cannot rule out the possibility that the government or other third parties could interpret these laws differently and challenge the Company’s practices under one or more of these laws. The risk of liability under certain federal and state laws is increased by the right of individual plaintiffs, known as relators, to bring an action alleging violations of such laws and potentially be awarded a share of any damages or penalties ultimately awarded to the applicable government body. Violations of these laws may lead to civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in certain payer programs or curtailment of the Company’s operations. 
 iCAD is subject to numerous laws governing safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, among others, both at the U.S. federal and state levels, and similar laws in other jurisdictions. iCAD may be required to incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations in the future, which may result in a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Federal, state, and foreign regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of medical devices and management services and software are subject to future change. iCAD cannot predict what impact, if any, such changes might have on the Company’s business. 
 Anti-Kickback Laws 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”) prohibits persons from knowingly or willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce: 
 

• | the referral of an individual for a service or product for which payment may be made by Medicare, Medicaid or other government-sponsored healthcare program; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | purchasing, ordering, arranging for, or recommending the ordering of, any service or product for which payment may be made by a government-sponsored healthcare program.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The AKS is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. The statutory penalties for violating the AKS include imprisonment for up to ten years and 
 
18 

  fines of up to $100,000 per violation. In addition, through application of other laws, conduct that violates the AKS can also give rise to False Claims Act (“FCA”) lawsuits and other penalties. 
 Congress and the HHS-OIG have established a large number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors. An arrangement that fits squarely into an exception or safe harbor is immune from prosecution under the AKS. iCAD trains and educates employees and marketing representatives on the AKS and their obligations thereunder, and the Company endeavors to comply with the applicable safe harbors. However, the failure to comply with the exceptions and safe harbor requirements does not always impose liability under the AKS, as long as the arrangement does not implicate the principal policy objectives. Thus, some of iCAD’s arrangements that may not be covered by a safe harbor, like many other common and non-abusive arrangements, nevertheless likely do not pose a material risk of program abuse or warrant the imposition of sanctions because they do not implicate any of the AKS’s principal policy objectives. However, iCAD cannot offer assurances that, with respect to any arrangements that do not squarely meet an exception or safe harbor, the Company will not have to defend against alleged violations of the AKS. Allegations of violations of the AKS also may be brought under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, which requires a lower burden of proof than other fraud and abuse laws, including the AKS. 
 Government officials have focused recent kickback enforcement efforts on, among other things, the sales and marketing activities of healthcare companies, including medical device manufacturers, and have brought cases against individuals or entities with personnel who allegedly offered unlawful inducements to potential or existing customers in an attempt to procure their business. This trend is expected to continue. Settlements of these cases by healthcare companies have involved significant fines and/or penalties and in some instances criminal pleas or deferred prosecution agreements. 
 In addition to the federal AKS, many states have their own anti-kickback laws. Often, these laws closely follow the language of the federal law, although they do not always have the same scope, exceptions, safe harbors or sanctions. In some states, these anti-kickback laws apply not only to payment made by a government health care program but also with respect to other payers, including commercial insurance companies. 
 If iCAD is found to have violated the Anti-Kickback Statute or a similar state statute, it may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, including exclusion from the Medicare or Medicaid programs, or may be required to enter into settlement agreements with the government to avoid such sanctions. Typically, such settlement agreements require substantial payments to the government in exchange for the government to release its claims and may also require the Company to enter into a Corporate Integrity Agreement. 
 Physician Self-Referral Laws 
 iCAD is subject to federal and state laws and regulations that limit the circumstances under which physicians who have a financial relationship with entities that furnish certain specified healthcare services may refer to such entities for the provision of such services, including clinical laboratory services, radiology and other imaging services and certain other diagnostic services. These laws and regulations also prohibit such entities from billing for services provided in violation of the laws and regulations. 
 This federal ban on physician self-referrals, commonly known as the “Stark Law,” prohibits, subject to certain exceptions, physician referrals of Medicare and Medicaid patients to an entity providing certain “designated health services” if the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has any financial relationship with the entity. The Stark Law also prohibits the entity receiving the referral from billing for any good or service furnished pursuant to an unlawful referral. It further obligates any person collecting any amounts in connection with an unlawful referral to refund these amounts. A person who engages in a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law’s referral prohibition may be fined up to $172,137 for each such arrangement or scheme. The penalties for violating the Stark Law also include civil monetary penalties of up to $25,820 per service, and could result in denial of payment, disgorgements of reimbursement received under a non-compliant agreement, and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. 
 
19 

  In addition to the Stark Law, many states have their own self-referral laws. Often, these laws closely follow the language of the federal law, although they do not always have the same scope, exceptions, safe harbors or sanctions. In some states these self-referral laws apply not only to payment made by a government health care program but also payments made by other payers, including commercial insurance companies. In addition, some state laws require physicians to disclose any financial interest they may have with a healthcare provider to their patients when referring patients to that provider, even if the referral itself is not prohibited. 
 iCAD has financial relationships with physicians in the form of equipment leases and services arrangements. The Company’s financial relationships with referring physicians and their immediate family members must comply with the Stark Law by meeting an applicable exception. Unlike the AKS, failure to meet an exception under the Stark Law results in a violation of the Stark Law, even if such violation is technical in nature. iCAD attempts to structure relevant relationships to meet a Stark Law exception, but the regulations implementing the exceptions are detailed and complex, and underwent significant changes in 2020, and therefore, the Company cannot provide assurance that every relationship complies fully with the Stark Law. 
 Violation of these laws and regulations may result in the prohibition of payment for services rendered, significant fines and penalties, and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on iCAD’s business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, expansion of the Company’s operations to new jurisdictions, new interpretations of laws in iCAD’s existing jurisdictions, or new physician self-referral laws could require structural and organizational modifications of the Company’s relationships with physicians to comply with those jurisdictions’ laws. Such structural and organizational modifications could result in lower profitability and failure to achieve iCAD’s growth objectives. 
 If iCAD fails to comply with federal and state physician self-referral laws and regulations as they are currently interpreted or may be interpreted in the future, or if other legislative restrictions are issued, the Company could incur a significant loss of revenue and be subject to significant monetary penalties, or exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs which could have a material adverse effect on iCAD’s business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 False Claims Laws 
 The federal FCA prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim or knowingly making, or causing to made, a false statement to obtain payment from the federal government. If iCAD violates the AKS or Stark Law, improperly bills for services, retains overpayments longer than 60 days after identification, or fails to act with reasonable diligence to investigate credible information regarding potential overpayments, the Company may be found to violate the federal FCA. 
 Those found in violation of the FCA can be subject to fines and penalties of three times the damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of $11,803 to $23,607 per false claim or statement. The qui tam or “whistleblower” provisions of the FCA allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought by private individuals has increased dramatically, causing greater numbers of healthcare companies, including medical device manufacturers, to defend false claim actions, pay damages and penalties or be excluded from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs. 
 In addition, various states have enacted false claim laws analogous to the FCA, and this legislative activity is expected to increase. Many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payer and not merely a federal healthcare program. 
 
20 

  Increased Regulatory Scrutiny of Relationships with Healthcare Providers 
 Certain state governments and the federal government have enacted legislation, including the Physician Payments Sunshine Act provisions under the ACA, aimed at increasing transparency of iCAD’s interactions with healthcare providers. As a result, the Company is required by law to disclose payments, gifts, and other transfers of value to certain healthcare providers in certain states and to the federal government. Any failure to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements could result in a range of fines, penalties, and/or sanctions, and could affect iCAD’s business. The company has devoted and will continue to devote substantial time and financial resources to develop and implement enhanced structure, policies, systems and processes to comply with these enhanced legal and regulatory requirements, which may also impact iCAD’s business. 
 U.S. Coverage and Reimbursement 
 In the United States, the federal and state governments establish guidelines and pay reimbursements to hospitals, freestanding clinics (independent diagnostic treatment facilities), and medical professionals for diagnostic examinations and therapeutic procedures under the federal Medicare program and the joint federal/state Medicaid program. CMS reviews and adjusts Medicare and Medicaid coverage policies and reimbursement levels periodically and considers various Medicare and other healthcare reform proposals that could significantly affect private and public reimbursement for healthcare services. State governments determine Medicaid reimbursement pursuant to state law and regulations. Many third-party payers use coverage decisions and payment amounts determined by CMS to set their coverage and reimbursement policies. 
 Because iCAD expects to receive payment for its products directly from iCAD’s customers, the Company does not anticipate relying directly on payment for any of iCAD’s products from third-party payers, such as Medicare, Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care companies. However, iCAD’s business will be affected by coverage and payment policies adopted by federal and state governmental authorities for Medicare and Medicaid, as well as private payers, which often follow the coverage policies of these public programs. Such policies may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products in a particular jurisdiction. For example, iCAD’s business will be indirectly impacted by the ability of a hospital or medical facility to obtain coverage and third-party reimbursement for procedures performed using the Company’s products. Third-party payers may deny coverage or pay an amount for the procedure that healthcare providers deem inadequate, which could cause such providers to use a lower-cost product from a competitor or perform a medical procedure without the Company’s device. 
 Reimbursement decisions by individual third-party payers depend upon each third-party payer’s evaluation of a number of factors, including some or all of the following: 
 

• | whether the product or service is a covered benefit under its health plan;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | whether the product or service is appropriate and medically necessary for the specific indication;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | cost effectiveness of the product or service;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | whether the product is being used in a manner consistent with its FDA-approved or cleared label (i.e., “on-label”); and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination that the product or service is neither experimental nor investigational (e.g., that its use is supported by relevant evidence in the peer reviewed literature, its use is supported by medical professional society treatment guidelines).

In 2016, the American Medical Association (“AMA”) implemented a skin-specific Category III CPT code for electronic brachytherapy for the treatment of NMSC. Reimbursement for the treatment delivery may be provided through the Category III CPT code, 0394T, defined as “high dose rate electronic brachytherapy, skin surface application, per fraction, and includes basic dosimetry, when performed”. There are additional Category I CPT codes reportable with the service as determined by physician orders, medical necessity, and documentation.

  Coverage policies and payment values associated with CPT code 0394T are determined by the regional Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) and the private payers. Coverage and payment for CPT code 0394T is individually determined by the MACs and private payers. Many of the MACs and some private payers cover and pay for 0394T. 
 Category III CPT codes are temporary codes for emerging technologies, services, and procedures that do not yet meet the criteria for Category I CPT codes. Without further action by the AMA, Category III CPT codes sunset five years after the initial publication or renewal of the code. The AMA has accepted the retention of CPT code 0394T, renewing the code through 2025. At that time, CPT code 0394T may be converted to a Category I CPT code. Alternatively, the AMA may determine the code should be further renewed or archived. 
 The healthcare industry in the United States is increasingly focused on cost containment as government and private insurers seek to control healthcare costs by imposing lower payment rates and negotiating reduced contract rates with third-party payers. The ACA went into effect in 2012. While iCAD believes that elements of the program including the shift to value-based healthcare and increased focus on patient satisfaction will benefit the Company in the future, there could be negative consequences on patient access to new technologies. Other elements of this legislation, including comparative effectiveness research, payment system reforms (such as shared savings pilots) and other provisions, could meaningfully change the way healthcare is delivered and paid for in the United States, and may materially impact numerous aspects of the Company’s business, including the demand for and availability of iCAD’s products, the reimbursement available for iCAD’s products from governmental and third-party payers, and reduced medical procedure volumes. 
 On September 18, 2020, CMS finalized a rule regarding its new Radiation Oncology model (the “RO Model”), designed, according to CMS, to improve the quality of care for cancer patients receiving radiotherapy and reduce Medicare expenditures through bundled payments. In the final notice, CMS did not include IORT treatments (including CPT codes 77424 and 77425) within the new alternative payment model for radiation oncology. As a result, whether or not a particular physician practice or hospital is subject to the new radiation oncology payment model, IORT services covered by Medicare will continue to be subject to the existing payment systems for physician services and hospital outpatient services. On December 2, 2020, an interim final rule was published by CMS, to take effect no earlier than January 1, 2022, but was subsequently delayed until January 1, 2023. 
 iCAD is evaluating the effect that changes and proposed changes to the ACA and Biden Administration policies, and the adopted RO Model by the CMS, may have on the company’s business. iCAD cannot predict whether the ACA will be repealed, replaced, or modified or how such repeal, replacement or modification may be timed or structured. As a result, the Company cannot quantify or predict the effect of such repeal, replacement, or modification might have on iCAD’s business and results of operations. However, any changes that lower reimbursement for the Company’s products or reduce medical procedure volumes could adversely affect iCAD’s business and results of operations. 
 Reimbursement in Other Jurisdictions 
 Typically, coverage and payment for healthcare products and services in other jurisdictions is determined through a public tender process that takes into consideration the results of a cost-effectiveness or value analysis conducted by a federal government-level technology assessment group, and through reference to coverage and payment policies established for the same or similar product/service in comparable jurisdictions. 
 Market acceptance of iCAD’s medical products in both the United States and other countries is dependent upon the purchasing and procurement practices of the Company’s customers, patient demand for the Company’s products and procedures, and the reimbursement policies of patients’ medical expenses set by government healthcare programs, private insurers or other healthcare payers.

  Intellectual Property 
 The Company primarily relies on a combination of patents, trade secrets and copyright law, third-party and employee confidentiality agreements, and other protective measures to protect its intellectual property rights pertaining to its products and technologies. 
 The Company has certain patents to its ongoing programs that expire between 2022 and 2029. These patents help the Company maintain a proprietary position in its markets. The Company does not believe that the patents expiring in 2022 are material to its business. Additionally, the Company has a number of patent applications pending domestically, some of which have been also filed internationally, and the Company plans to file additional domestic and foreign patent applications when it believes such protection will benefit the Company. These patents and patent applications relate to current and future uses of iCAD’s cancer detection technologies and products, including cancer detection solutions for tomosynthesis, CAD for CT colonography and lung and CAD for MRI breast and prostate. The Company has also secured a non-exclusive patent license from the National Institute of Health which relates broadly to CAD in colonography, a non-exclusive patent license from Cytyc/Hologic which relates to balloon applicators for breast brachytherapy, and a non-exclusive license from Zeiss which relates to brachytherapy. 
 Sources and Availability of Materials 
 The Company depends upon a limited number of suppliers and manufacturers for its products, and certain components in its products may be available from a sole or limited number of suppliers. The Company’s products are generally either manufactured and assembled by a sole manufacturer or a limited number of manufacturers or assembled by it from supplies it obtains from a limited number of suppliers. Critical components required to manufacture these products, whether by outside manufacturers or directly, may be available from a sole or limited number of component suppliers. The Company generally does not have long-term arrangements with any of its manufacturers or suppliers. 
 Engineering and Product Development 
 iCAD’s products have been developed by its own research and development staff or were developed by the companies iCAD acquired. Research and development expenses are primarily attributable to personnel, consulting, subcontract, licensing and data collection expenses relating to the Company’s new product development and clinical testing. iCAD believes its products are competitive and that none of the current versions of the Company’s products are approaching obsolescence. iCAD has invested and expects to continue to invest in new research and development and enhancements of the Company’s current products to maintain iCAD’s competitive position. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we incurred $9.2 million, $8.1 million, and $9.3 million of research and development expense, respectively. 
Human Capital Resources 
 As of December 31, 2021, the Company had 137 employees, 136 of whom are full time employees, with 57 involved in sales and marketing, 25 in research and development, 36 in service, manufacturing, quality assurance, technical support and operations functions, and 19 in administrative functions. None of the Company’s employees are represented by a labor organization. The Company considers its relations with employees to be good. 
 The Company’s human capital resource objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and future employees, advisors and consultants. In addition to competitive base salaries, the other competitive benefits that we provide to employees include incentive plans and paid vacation. The principal purposes of these employee benefits are to attract, retain, reward and motivate our personnel and to provide long-term incentives that align the interests of employees with the interests of our stockholders.

  Foreign Regulations 
 International sales of the Company’s products are subject to foreign government regulation, the requirements of which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval, and the requirements may differ. Obtaining and maintaining foreign regulatory approvals is an expensive and time-consuming process. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals timely or at all in any foreign country in which we plan to market our CAD products and the Xoft System. If we fail to receive and maintain such approvals, our ability to generate revenue may be significantly diminished.
