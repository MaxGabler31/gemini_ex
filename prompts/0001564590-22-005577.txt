 Impact of COVID-19, Supply Chain Disruptions and Other Matters
 The macroeconomic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to cause significant volatility in the global economy, including within the automotive market and our business. Our sales are driven by the number of vehicles produced by the automotive manufacturers, which is ultimately dependent on consumer demand for automotive vehicles, and our content per vehicle, and other factors that may limit or otherwise impact production by us, our supply chain and our customers. According to the forecasting firm IHS Markit (February 2022 release), global light vehicle production in 2021 in the Company’s key markets of North America, Europe, China, Japan and Korea, was up 0.3%, as compared to 2020. The lack of significant growth in 2021 was primarily due to the impacts of global supply chain disruptions, including the worldwide semiconductor supply shortage, and follows the significant decrease in vehicle production in 2020 which was driven by the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Light vehicle production remains well below recent historic levels and consumer demand.
 In 2021, the Company's semiconductor suppliers, along with most automotive component supply companies that use semiconductors, including Gentherm, were unable to fully meet the vehicle production demands of the OEMs largely due to events outside the control of the Company and its suppliers and customers, as well as the automotive industry generally. Supply shortages of semiconductor chips and other components not only resulted in decreased global automotive vehicle production but also caused significant volatility in customer vehicle production schedules. Sudden changes in the production schedules of OEMs and Tier 1s resulted in operating inefficiencies which adversely affect our profitability and results of operations. In addition, we experienced inflationary cost increases in certain component parts, raw materials, labor and transportation as a result of the supply-constrained environment and general economic conditions. These broad-based operational and inflationary impacts negatively impacted the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.
 In response to the global supply chain instability and inflationary cost increases the Company has taken several actions to minimize any potential and actual adverse impacts by working closely with its suppliers and customers to closely monitor the availability of semiconductor microchips and other component parts and raw materials, customer vehicle production schedules and any other supply chain inefficiencies that may arise. We expect global supply chain instability will continue to have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance for the foreseeable future, and such adverse impact may be material. The consequences of the pandemic, global supply chain instability and inflationary cost increases and their adverse impact to the global economy continue to evolve. Accordingly, the significance of the future adverse impact on our business and financial statements remains subject to significant uncertainty. 
 See further discussion of the COVID-19 pandemic and related risks in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report.

Thermoelectric Technologies
 Many of our thermal products manage the thermal conditions of people and objects using our internally developed advanced thermoelectric device technology (“TED”). A TED is a solid-state circuit that has the capability to produce both hot and cold thermal conditions by use of the Peltier effect. The advantages of advanced TED over conventional compressed gas systems are that they are environmentally friendly and less complex as they have no moving parts and are compact and light weight.  Our work on this technology has yielded improvements in areas of functionality, efficiency, durability and performance. 
Resistive Heaters 
 Resistive heater technologies are comprised of wire, carbon fiber or positive thermal coefficient (“PTC”) heating elements that quickly and effectively deliver heat to people and objects.  Wire heating elements are designed from stainless steel, copper, our proprietary carbon fiber woven lattice technology called Carbotex® or printed circuit PTC heaters based on the specifications for a particular product application.  Resistive heaters have multiple automotive applications, including seat heating, steering wheel heating, interior panel heating, and battery heating.
Products
 Climate Comfort Solutions – Seat Comfort
 CCS
 Gentherm offers a range of CCS products utilizing proprietary technologies for regulating temperature and enhancing the comfort of vehicle passengers. Our ventilated CCS products move air through the seat to provide conditioning. Our active CCS products utilize TEDs to heat and cool air used to condition the seat. The conditioning air circulates by one of our specially designed air moving devices through an air distribution system installed in the seat cushion and seat back, so that the seat surface can be heated, ventilated or cooled. Each seat has individual electronic controls to adjust the level of heating, ventilating or cooling. Our CCS products improve comfort compared with conventional vehicle cabin air conditioners by focusing heating and cooling directly on the passenger through the seat. Our CCS products can be combined with our resistive heating elements to increase heating capacity and reduce time to comfort.
 By offering different models of the CCS product, our customers have the opportunity to purchase a wider range of climate control products at different price points. Sales of CCS products, primarily ventilated CCS products, contributed 38%, 38% and 37% to our total product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
 Heated Seat 
 Heated seats, based on our resistive heater core technology, are seamlessly integrated into automotive seat designs, and are constructed using materials that offer the best capacity, installation characteristics and durability.  Our design and manufacturing capabilities allow customers to choose among a variety of resistive heater materials based on their individual vehicle specifications. Sales of heated seat products contributed 26%, 27% and 29% to our total product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  
Neck Climate Control Systems
 Neck climate control systems ventilate warm or temperature-controlled air directly onto the passenger’s neck and shoulder area.

 Gentherm manufactures automotive cable systems used to connect automotive components to power sources. The automotive cable systems are an important element in the production of many of our products and form a significant component in how we generate value to our customers by being an efficient, low-cost and high-quality manufacturer. We offer cable systems as integrated parts of our products and also as stand-alone components for other automotive applications, such as oxygen sensors.  Our cable systems business includes both ready-made individual cables and ready-to-install cable networks.
Patient Temperature Management Systems 
 Gentherm provides a full line of patient temperature management systems across multiple product categories addressing the needs of hyper-hypothermia therapy in intensive care, normothermia in surgical procedures and additional warming/cooling therapies utilized in acute care, ambulatory, clinics and home health.  Our broad array of products for patient warming provides an improved patient experience and satisfaction. Our core brands include Blanketrol® hyper-hypothermia system, WarmAir®/FilteredFlo® convective warming system, Electri-Cool®/Micro-Temp® localized cooling/warming systems, the ASTOPAD® patient warming system that utilizes resistive warming technology which is also used in our automotive products, ASTOTHERM®/ASTOFLO® IV fluid and blood warming systems, ASTODIA® diaphanoscope for transillumination, Hemotherm® cardiovascular cooling/warming system and our recent launch of our next generation cardiovascular cooling/warming system utilized to deliver precise blood temperature control during cardiopulmonary by-pass and other related cardiovascular procedures. We aspire to have innovative patient temperature management product offerings coupled with clinical education enabling our customers to have enhanced patient outcomes and improved efficiencies of care.
Customers 
 Our Automotive segment customers include primarily light vehicle OEMs and Tier 1s, including automotive seat manufacturers.  We also directly supply CCS products to aftermarket seat distributors and installers. 
 The Company’s automotive marketing is directed primarily at the OEMs and their Tier 1s and focuses on the enhanced value consumers attribute to vehicles with climate comfort products. In many cases, the OEMs direct us to work with their suppliers, primarily their Tier 1s, to integrate our products into the vehicle’s seat or interior design. 
 Once the integration work is complete, prototypes are sent to the OEMs for evaluation and testing. If an OEM accepts our product, a program can then be launched for a particular model on a production basis, but it normally takes one to three years from the time an OEM decides to include any of our products in a vehicle model to actual production for that vehicle. During this process, we derive funding from prototype sales but obtain no significant revenue until mass production begins. Upon commencement of mass production, our products are sold by Tier 1s to the OEMs as a component of an entire seat or seating system. Inherent to the automotive supplier market are costs and commitments that are incurred well in advance of the receipt of orders and resulting revenues from customers.
 The volume of products we sell is significantly affected by global and regional automotive production levels and the general business conditions in the automotive industry. Our product revenues are generally based upon purchase orders issued by our customers, with updated production schedules for volume adjustments. As such, we typically do not have a backlog of firm orders at any point in time. Once we are selected to supply products for a particular platform, we typically supply those products for the platform life, which is normally five to seven years, although there is no guarantee that this will occur. In addition, when we are the incumbent supplier to a given platform, we believe we have a competitive advantage in winning the redesign or replacement platform, although there is no guarantee that this will occur. 
 10

For 2021, our revenues from sales to our two largest customers, Adient plc (“Adient”) and Lear Corporation (“Lear”) were $156 million and $153 million, respectively, each representing 15% of our product revenues that is consistent with prior years. Revenues from Lear and Adient represent sales of our climate comfort products.   On October 28, 2021, Lear announced that it entered into an agreement to acquire the Interior Comfort Systems business unit of Kongsberg Automotive ASA, which is a key competitor of the Company’s climate comfort products, including CCS and seat heaters.
The loss of these customers would likely have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows. However, as noted above, in many cases automotive OEMs direct their suppliers such as Lear and Adient to work with us for our climate comfort solutions, battery performance solutions and cable technology products. It is, therefore, relevant to understand how our revenues are divided among the OEMs, as shown below. 
 Our total product revenues for each of the past three years were divided among the OEMs as follows:

Key Highlights of our Human Capital Strategy
 Gentherm’s Human Capital goals have evolved to a more flexible, personal, employee value proposition since the onset of the pandemic to ensure we are aiding our employees in navigating through the blurred demands of work and life. We introduced a new flexible working guideline called “Locate for Your Day”.
 In November 2021, we completed our first global engagement survey with a best-in-class response rate of 97%. The results of the survey in addition to several new listening tools help our managers continue to adapt and meet the needs of our workforce.
 Health and Safety
 At Gentherm, health and safety are an essential part of our culture and values. The “Safety Culture” of a workplace is a key issue for implementing and proceeding with the Vision Zero strategy.  This initiative outlines a global approach and mindset that strives to eliminate all work accidents and injuries by aligning the Company culture with the Seven Golden Rules: 

1. | Leadership Commitment with a Top-Down Approach
---+-----------------------------------------------


2. | Identify All Hazards and Risks
---+-------------------------------


3. | Set Safety and Health Targets
---+------------------------------


4. | Ensure a Safety System/ Standards
---+----------------------------------


5. | Use Safe and Healthy Technology
---+--------------------------------


6. | Improve Qualification
---+----------------------


7. | Involve People
---+---------------

 The global operating health and safety team is not only committed to the Seven Golden Rules to eliminate work accidents and injuries. These rules also are focused on identifying hazards and unsafe behaviors before they happen by “near miss reporting”.
 Our teams have continued to benchmark across Gentherm sites which has fostered significant optimization and continuous improvement. By implementing consistent routine components in the daily work across all sites, the overall safety culture improves for all Gentherm operations.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
 Our DE+I mission “Embracing Diversity Inspires Innovation” cascades from our corporate mission. We are building a culture of belonging where we value our differences to positively impact the lives of our employees, customers and communities.  Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council, has built strong momentum in 2021. The DE+I council conducted engagement activities and enrichment programming each month to promote awareness and celebrate various ethnic and underrepresented employees within Gentherm. We took another step forward on our DE+I journey with launching inclusion trainings to all global people leaders with the purpose of building local and global awareness of DE+I at Gentherm, ensuring all team members are educated on consistent standards, identifying feedback mechanisms to solve for conflict, and creating a culture that unites us all.
Total Rewards
 Gentherm’s compensation and benefits programs are designed to attract and retain our employees in the locations where we compete for talent using a mix of elements that allow us to achieve our Company’s short and long-term goals.

▪ | We provide employee wages that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge and geographic location.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | We align our executives’ and eligible employees’ annual bonus opportunity and long-term equity compensation with our shareholders’ interests by linking realizable pay with company financial and stock performance.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Total Talent Development
 At Gentherm, we provide foundational leadership development programs to ensure our current and future people leaders are well equipped to engage and lead in today’s complex business environment. Additionally, Gentherm’s performance management process is based on a contemporary coaching model where employees align yearly objectives with their leaders, supported with timely quarterly “check-ins” for progress updates and feedback. We have offered additional training programs to provide on-demand, flexible learning solutions for our global workforce. We introduced the Accelerator program for high potential employee development in 2021.
Environmental, Social, and Governance
 In 2021, we issued our second Sustainability report and incorporated ESG into our everyday business operations and future strategies. Our sustainability efforts are based on three pillars: People, Planet, and Places.

▪ | People: At Gentherm, our leaders treat employees with respect and provide a safe working environment. We provide career opportunities, development, support and more. People create our success.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Planet: We strive to minimize our environmental impact. We believe our product lineup reduces the environmental impact of automobiles through our innovative products and technologies, and we continue to improve our operations through more efficient use of resources and reduced emissions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Places: As a global company, we strive to be a positive force in the communities where we do business. Our teams support an array of causes, including STEM education and training, financial support for local charities and donations and support for COVID-19 efforts. Types of community involvement and support vary across our sites, based on local needs, requirements, and culture.

 These actions indicate the strength of our commitment to sustainability across Gentherm.
 Environmental and Regulatory Compliance
 Applicable laws and regulations, and significant changes to such laws and regulations, will potentially lead to increases in costs and complexity, and failure to comply with global and specific country regulations could subject us to civil penalties, production

disruptions, or limitations on the sale of affected products. We believe we are materially in compliance with substantially all these requirements or expect to be materially in compliance by the required dates.
 Chemical Regulation
 There are numerous global laws and regulations that prohibit or restrict the selection and use of certain chemicals for product development and manufacturing and potentially impact an automobile manufacturer’s responsibility for vehicle components at the end of a vehicle’s life. New chemical regulations continue to be introduced and passed, such as the new European requirements that require suppliers of parts and vehicles to the European market to disclose certain substances of concern in parts. Further, increases in the use of circuit boards and other electronics may require additional assessment under the directives related to certain hazardous substances and waste from electrical and electronic equipment.
Vehicle Safety
 In the U.S., the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (the “Safety Act”) regulates motor vehicle equipment that we manufacture and sell as well as vehicles. The Safety Act prohibits the sale in the United States of any new vehicle or equipment that does not conform to applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”). The Safety Act further requires that if a vehicle manufacturer or NHTSA determine a vehicle or an item of vehicle equipment does not comply with a safety standard, or that vehicle or equipment contains a defect that poses an unreasonable safety risk, the vehicle manufacturer must conduct a safety recall to remedy that condition in the affected vehicles. Should a vehicle manufacturer or NHTSA determine a safety defect or noncompliance issue exists with respect to any of our products, the cost of such recall campaigns could be substantial.  Further, many other countries have established vehicle and vehicle equipment safety standards and regulations.  Meeting or exceeding the many safety standards is costly as global compliance and non-governmental assessment requirements continue to evolve and grow more complex, and lack harmonization globally.
