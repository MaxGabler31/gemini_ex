ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Overview
 A-Mark, also referred to (together with its subsidiaries) as "we", "us" and the "Company", is a fully integrated precious metals platform that offers an array of gold, silver, platinum, palladium, and copper bullion, numismatic coins, and related products to wholesale and retail customers via a portfolio of channels. The Company conducts its operations through three complementary segments: Wholesale Sales & Ancillary Services, Secured Lending, and Direct-to-Consumer. The Company’s global customer base spans sovereign and private mints, manufacturers and fabricators, refiners, dealers, financial institutions, industrial users, investors, collectors, and e-commerce and other retail customers.
Specifically, A-Mark:
 •operates as a wholesaler of gold, silver, platinum, and palladium bullion and related products, including bars, wafers, grain, and coins;
 •distributes gold and silver coins and bars from sovereign and private mints;
 •sells to and purchases from the retail community; 
 •provides financing and other services relating to the purchase and sale of bullion and numismatics;
 •offers secure storage for precious metal products;
 •provides our customers a platform of turn-key logistics services; and
 •provides a variety of custom fabricated gold and silver bullion and other specialty products through sovereign and private mint suppliers and its mint operations.
 A-Mark believes it has one of the largest customer bases in each of its markets and provides one of the most comprehensive offerings of products and services in the precious metals trading industry. Our global customer base, spanning five continents, includes mints, manufacturers and fabricators, refiners, coin and bullion dealers, e-commerce retailers, banks and other financial institutions, commodity brokerage houses, industrial users of precious metals, investors, collectors, and retail customers.
A-Mark believes its businesses largely function independently of the price movement of the underlying commodities. However, factors such as global economic activity or uncertainty, including as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, and inflationary trends, which affect market volatility, have the potential to impact demand, volumes, and margins.
 History
 A-Mark was founded in 1965 and has grown into a significant participant in the bullion and coin market. A-Mark became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Spectrum Group International, Inc. ("SGI") in 2005. In March 2014, SGI distributed all of the shares of common stock of A-Mark to its stockholders, effecting a spinoff of A-Mark from SGI. As a result of this distribution, the Company became a publicly traded company independent from SGI.
 Over the years, A-Mark has been steadily expanding its products and services. In 1986, A-Mark became an authorized purchaser of gold and silver bullion coins struck by the United States Mint. Similar arrangements with other sovereign mints followed, so that by the early 1990s, A-Mark had (and continues to have) relationships with all major sovereign mints offering bullion coins and bars internationally.
 In 2005, the Company launched Collateral Finance Corporation ("CFC"), a wholly-owned subsidiary, for the purpose of making secured loans primarily collateralized by bullion and numismatic material. Since then, CFC has expanded the value of its aggregate loan portfolio and number of its customers and makes secured loans collateralized by graded sport cards and sports memorabilia. CFC has achieved its growth through both loan origination and acquisitions of loan portfolios from wholesale customers of A-Mark.
The Company opened an overseas office in Vienna, Austria in 2009, for the purpose of marketing A-Mark's goods and services in the international markets. The office operates through A-Mark Trading AG ("AMTAG"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In 2012, the Company formed Transcontinental Depository Services, LLC. ("TDS"), a wholly-owned subsidiary, for the purpose of providing customers with turn-key global storage solutions for their precious metal products.


In July 2015, the Company launched its Las Vegas-based logistics fulfillment center, A-M Global Logistics, LLC. ("AMGL" or "Logistics"), a wholly-owned subsidiary, for the purpose of providing our customers a platform of complementary services, including packaging, shipping, handling, receiving, processing, and inventorying of precious metals and custom coins on a secure basis.
 In August 2016, the Company formed a joint venture, AM&ST Associates, LLC. ("AMST"), with SilverTowne, L.P., an Indiana-based fabricator of silver bullion products, for the purpose of acquiring and operating SilverTowne, L.P.'s minting business unit ("SilverTowne Mint" or the "Mint"). Since the formation of AMST, the Company has invested in minting equipment and fabrication tools to expand output capabilities, increase production efficiencies and improve product quality, and has leveraged the Mint’s fabrication capabilities and coin die portfolio to expand our custom coin programs, as well as to introduce new custom products for individual customers. In April 2021, the Company purchased the 31% interest in AMST previously held by the joint venture partner and now owns 100% of AMST.
 In August 2017, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Goldline, LLC, a direct retailer of precious metals to the investor community, and now conducts those operations through its subsidiary Goldline, Inc. ("Goldline"). Goldline LLC was formed in 1960 and became well-known to collectors and investors for its distribution of gold, silver, and platinum bullion coins and bars, in part, due to its television, radio, and internet marketing and customer service outreach. Since our acquisition, Goldline has expanded its product offerings and improved its delivery times.
In September 2018, the Company formed AM Capital Funding, LLC. (“AMCF”), a wholly owned subsidiary of CFC, for the purpose of issuing and administering privately placed notes, which are collateralized by secured loans (contributed from CFC) and bullion product (purchased from A-Mark). The notes are Secured Senior Term Notes (collectively, the "Notes"): Series 2018-1, Class A in the aggregate principal amount of $72.0 million and Secured Subordinated Term Notes, Series 2018-1, Class B in the aggregate principal amount of $28.0 million. The Class A Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.98% and the Class B Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.98%. The Notes have a maturity date of December 15, 2023.
 In August 2019, Goldline entered into a joint venture agreement with one of the Company's related parties to form Precious Metals Purchasing Partners, LLC ("PMPP"), a 50% owned subsidiary, primarily for the purpose of purchasing precious metals from the partners' retail customers for resale back into the marketplace. PMPP commenced operations in fiscal 2020.
 In September 2014, the Company made an initial equity investment in JM Bullion, Inc. (“JMB”), and in October 2016, we made an additional investment in JMB, increasing our equity interest to approximately 20.5%. In March 2021, the Company acquired the 79.5% interest in JMB that we did not previously own. JMB is a leading e-commerce retailer providing access to a broad array of gold, silver, copper, platinum, and palladium products through its own websites and marketplaces. In April 2022, JMB commercially launched the CyberMetals online platform, where customers can purchase fractional ounces of digital gold, silver, platinum, and palladium in a range of denominations, with the option to convert their digital holdings to fabricated precious metals products via an integrated redemption flow with JMB. JMB operates six separately branded, company-owned websites targeting specific niches within the precious metals retail market, including JMBullion.com, ProvidentMetals.com, Silver.com, Cybermetals.com, GoldPrice.org, and SilverPrice.org. JMB had approximately 1.8 million total customers as of June 30, 2022, and approximately 615,800 active customers for year ended June 30, 2022.
In April 2021, CFC Alternative Investments, LLC, a newly-created wholly-owned subsidiary of CFC, formed a joint venture with a third party known as Collectible Card Partners, LLC, which was established for the purpose of making commercial loans collateralized by graded sports cards and sports memorabilia.
Through strategic relationships with its customers and suppliers and vertical integration across its markets, A-Mark seeks to grow its business volume, expand its presence in non-U.S. markets around the globe, and enlarge its offering of complementary products and services. A-Mark seeks to continue its expansion by building on its strengths and what it perceives to be its competitive advantages. These include:
 •integrated operations that span trading, distribution, logistics, minting, storage, hedging, financing, and consignment products and services;
 •an extensive and varied customer base that includes banks and other financial institutions, coin dealers, collectors, private investors, retail customers, investment advisors, industrial manufacturers, refiners, sovereign and private mints, and mines;
 •the ability to cost effectively acquire and retain new retail customers, with over 615,800 active customers on the JMB platform and approximately 7,900 active Goldline customers;
 •the ability to offer secured financing to customers;
 •secure storage and turn-key logistic services for precious metals products;
 •long-standing relationships with the United States Mint and other sovereign mints, including a working relationship with the United States Mint of over 35 years;


•access to primary market makers, suppliers and refiners that, along with government mints, provide a dependable supply of precious metals and precious metal products;
 •minting operations which produce silver bullion and custom coins, allowing for a ready response to changing market demands;
 •the ability to design and fabricate proprietary silver products for customers;
 •the largest precious metals dealer network in North America;
 •depository relationships in major financial centers around the world;
 •experienced traders who also effectively manage A-Mark's exposure to commodity price risk; and
 •a strong management team, with over 100 years of collective industry experience.
 As part of our growth strategy, we are focused on:
 •Continuing to grow our direct-to-consumer brands—We fully own six unique direct-to-consumer brands and have minority ownership interests in two additional direct-to-consumer brands. Each of these brands has a differentiated market positioning and target customer demographic, which allows us to tailor our merchandising, pricing, and advertising strategies to maximize the growth and profitability of each brand. We plan to continue to invest in the Direct-to-Consumer segment, to facilitate both the acquisition of new customers and the retention of our existing customers.
 •Cross-selling existing A-Mark products and services to JMB customers—As of June 30, 2022, JMB had over 1.8 million total customers and 615,800 active customers. We believe there is a significant opportunity to offer new products and services provided by A-Mark to this customer base, including new, proprietary minted precious metals products, secure storage and logistics, and product repurchases.
 •Leveraging our minting capabilities to sell additional proprietary products—We have long-standing relationships with the United States Mint and other major international sovereign mints. We also own one mint, SilverTowne, and have a noncontrolling interest in another mint. We leverage our relationships with these mints to offer proprietary products to our wholesale and direct-to-consumer customers. The acquisition of JMB has provided us with a significantly larger direct-to-consumer customer base, allowing us to increase the number of proprietary products we design, source, and ultimately sell. 
 •Expanding our global footprint—We currently serve customers on five continents. Although the significant majority of our current sales are to customers located in the United States, we believe there is a meaningful opportunity to expand our capabilities in order to offer additional products and services to customers in Canada, Europe, and Asia.
 •Leveraging technology to deliver new products and increased services to customers—We are dedicating significant time and resources to enhance our technology platform and capabilities across all aspects of our business and the addition of JMB is helping to enhance these efforts. We intend to develop new digital products that will allow customers to more easily buy, sell, and arrange for storage of physical metal products through a mobile interface. We also intend to continue to improve our customer interfaces to allow more seamless order processing, better cross-selling of products and services across our business units and to increase our new customer targeting and acquisition strategies.
 •Pursuing strategic investments and acquisitions—Since our initial investment in JMB in 2014, we have acquired Goldline, made minority investments in two additional direct-to-consumer precious metals retailers, acquired the entire equity interest in JMB, acquired the entire equity interest in SilverTowne Mint and acquired a noncontrolling interest in a private mint. We intend to continue to evaluate new investment and acquisition opportunities that allow us to broaden our product offerings, allow us to better serve our existing customer base, enter new geographic regions and target new customer demographics.
 Business Segments
 The Company conducts its operations in three reportable segments: (i) Wholesale Sales & Ancillary Services , (ii) Direct-to-Consumer, and (iii) Secured Lending. Each of these reportable segments represents an aggregation of operating units that meets the aggregation criteria set forth in the Segment Reporting Topic 280 of the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”). (See Note 19 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.)
The Wholesale Sales & Ancillary Services and Direct-to-Consumer segment name changes had no impact on the Company's historical financial position, results of operations, cash flow, or segment level results previously reported.
Wholesale Sales & Ancillary Services
 A-Mark operates through several business units that comprise the Wholesale Sales & Ancillary Services segment, including Industrial, Coin and Bar, Trading and Finance, Storage, Logistics, and Mint.
 Industrial. Our Industrial unit sells gold, silver, platinum, and palladium to industrial and commercial users. Customers include coin fabricators such as mints and industrial manufacturers, encompassing electronics and component parts companies and refiners. Depending on the intended usage, the metals are either investment or industrial grade and are generally in the form of bars or grains.
 Coin and Bar. Our Coin and Bar unit deals in over 1,800 different products, including gold and silver coins from around the world and gold, silver, platinum and palladium bars and ingots in a variety of weights, shapes, and sizes. Our customers include coin and bullion dealers, banks and other financial institutions, commodity brokerage houses, manufacturers, investors, investment advisors, and collectors who qualify as “eligible commercial entities” and “eligible contract participants,” as those terms are defined in the Commodity Exchange Act.
 We are an authorized distributor (and, in the case of the United States Mint, an authorized purchaser) of gold and silver coins for all of the major sovereign mints and various private mints. The sovereign mints include the United States Mint, the Australian (Perth) Mint, the Austrian Mint, the Royal Canadian Mint, the China Mint, Banco de Mexico, the South African Mint (Rand Refinery) and the Royal Mint (United Kingdom). We purchase and take delivery of coins from the mints for resale to coin dealers, financial institutions, and other qualified purchasers.
 Our distribution and purchase agreements with the mints are non-exclusive and may be terminated by the mints at any time, although in practice our relationship with the mints are long-standing, in some cases, as with the United States Mint, extending back for over 35 years. In some cases, we have developed exclusive products with sovereign and private mints for distribution through our dealer network.
 In our Industrial and Coin and Bar units, orders are taken telephonically and on an electronic trading platform that can be accessed by qualified wholesale customers at www.amark.com. Pricing is generally based on screen quotes for bullion transactions in the spot market, with two-day settlement, although special pricing and extended settlement terms are also available. Almost all customers in these units take physical delivery of the precious metal. Product is shipped upon receipt of payment, except where the purchase is financed under credit arrangements between A-Mark and the customer. We have relationships with precious metal depositories around the world to facilitate shipment of product from our inventory to these customers, in many cases for next day delivery. Product may either be shipped to the customer's location or delivered to a depository or other storage facility designated by the customer. The Company also periodically loans metals to customers on a short-term consignment basis and may charge interest fees based on the value of the metals loaned.
Trading and Finance. Our Trading and Finance units engage in commodity hedging as well as borrowing and lending transactions in support of our Industrial and Coin and Bar units.
 The Trading unit hedges the commodity risk on A-Mark's inventory in order to protect A-Mark from market price fluctuations. A-Mark maintains relationships with major market-makers and multiple futures brokers in order to provide a variety of alternatives for its hedging needs. Our traders employ a combination of future and forward contracts to hedge our market exposure. Because it seeks to substantially hedge its market exposure, A-Mark believes that its business largely functions independently of the price movements of the underlying commodities. Through its hedging activities, A-Mark may also earn contango yields, in which futures price are higher than the current spot prices, or backwardation yields, in which futures prices are lower than the spot prices. A-Mark also offers precious metals price quotes in a number of foreign currencies.
 Our Finance unit engages in precious metals borrowing and lending transactions and other customized financial transactions with or on behalf of our customers and other counterparties. These arrangements range from simple hedging structures to complex inventory finance arrangements and forward purchase and sale structures, tailored to the needs of our customers.
 Storage. Our Transcontinental Depository Services, LLC ("TDS") subsidiary provides storage solutions for precious metals and numismatic coins for financial institutions, dealers, investors, and collectors worldwide. TDS contracts on behalf of our clients with independent secure storage facilities in the United States, Canada, Europe, Singapore, and Hong Kong, for either fully segregated or allocated storage. We assist our clients in developing appropriate storage options for their particular requirements, and we manage the operational aspects of the storage with the third party facilities on our clients' behalf. TDS’s marketing efforts are conducted both in partnership with A-Mark and independently, including through its dedicated website www.tdsvaults.com.
 Logistics. Our A-M Global Logistics, LLC ("Logistics") subsidiary, located in Las Vegas, Nevada, supports our Wholesale Sales business by providing a significant amount of the secured storage and shipping and delivery services that had historically been outsourced to third-party depositories in their various locations. By consolidating those operations into one central location under our control, we have reduced our dependence on third-party service providers while enhancing quality control and reducing operating costs. Logistics also provides turn-key logistics services to our customers engaged in the retail business. We provide these customers inventory handling, packaging, storage, and drop-shipping services.


AMTAG. Our A-Mark Trading AG ("AMTAG") subsidiary promotes the Company's products and services to international markets.
 Mint. Through its AMST subsidiary, the Company now owns the entire minting operations of the SilverTowne Mint (or the "Mint"), providing greater product selection to our customers and greater pricing stability within the supply chain, as well as increased access to fabricated silver products during volatile market environments. A-Mark has leveraged SilverTowne Mint’s fabrication capabilities as well as to introduce new custom products for individual customers.
 Although the Company and JMB are the Mint’s primary customers, the Mint also markets its products at www.silvertowne.com.
Direct-to-Consumer
 The Company operates its Direct-to-Consumer segment through its wholly-owned subsidiaries JM Bullion, Inc. (“JMB”) and Goldline, Inc. (“Goldline”). The Company’s Direct-to-Consumer segment expands the Company’s distribution capabilities with a retail distribution channel and diversifies the products and services offered to the Company’s retail customers by providing them access to the Company’s wider assortment of precious metal coins and bars, as well as TDS’s storage and asset protection services.
 JM Bullion
 JMB, which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company in March 2021, is a leading internet retailer of precious metal products that it sells through its proprietary websites.
 Products. JMB’s products consist primarily of coins, rounds, and bars. Coins are minted by a sovereign government, are legal currency and have a face value, although the face value is typically less than the value of their precious metal content. Rounds are coin-like objects with thematic designs minted by private mints, have no face value and are not legal currency, and their value is solely based upon their precious metal content. Bars are ingot-shaped precious metal objects that are usually produced by private mints. Like rounds, bars have no face value, are not legal currency and are valued based on their precious metal content. Coins, rounds, and bars are made from silver, gold, platinum, or palladium and in some cases copper. JMB occasionally sells jewelry products fashioned around coins or rounds as well.
 Typically, JMB offers approximately 4,000 different products, measured by stock keeping units or SKUs, on its websites during a fiscal year. This number can vary over time, particularly when demand is high. As a service to its customers, JMB makes available for sale on its websites protective accessories for precious metal products, including acrylic coin holders and capsules, coin tubes and silver bar tubes.
 JMB owns and operates four separately branded websites targeting specific segments within the precious metals market: JMBullion.com, ProvidentMetals.com, Silver.com, and Cybermetals.com, JMB also owns two websites, GoldPrice.org and SilverPrice.org, which publish data on precious metal and cryptocurrency pricing and generate leads for its other websites.
Through the CyberMetals online platform, customers can purchase and sell fractional shares of digital gold, silver, platinum, and palladium bars in a range of denominations. CyberMetals’ customers have the option to convert their digital holdings to fabricated precious metals products via an integrated redemption flow with JMB. These products may be designated for storage by the Company or shipped directly to the customer.
Customers may order product on each of the JMBullion.com, ProvidentMetals.com and Silver.com websites. While each of these sites appeals to a different customer clientele and may from time to time have slightly different product offerings, all orders are processed in the same manner. Customers may place their orders online, or they may use the toll-free telephone number available on the websites to order through a customer representative. The SilverPrice.org and GoldPrice.org websites provide real time price information on silver, gold, and cryptocurrencies. Although customers cannot order product on these websites, the websites direct visitors to JMBullion.com for placing orders.
JMB utilizes an internally developed search engine optimization, or SEO, strategy to drive traffic to its websites, particularly to JMBullion.com. JMB also pays for placement on the major search engines, including Google, Bing, Apple, and Yahoo!, employing internally developed strategies to reach a targeted audience and to optimize the cost effectiveness of paid for searches.
 Buyback Program. JMB also offers to repurchase precious metal products through its websites. With its buyback program, JMB provides collectors of precious metal products with a means to dispose of their holdings at transparent and competitive prices. Generally, JMB will indicate on its websites the products that it is interested in repurchasing, and a collector seeking to sell such products may arrange the sale online. Alternatively, the collector may call a customer representative using the toll-free number on the website and arrange a sale by telephone.
 The buyback program is a source of inventory for JMB, which is able to acquire product for resale at a discount to dealer prices.

Logistics. Historically, the Company has provided logistics services to JMB. As of June 30, 2022, JMB's distribution facility in Dallas, Texas, handles the backend logistics for the Company's buyback program and the secured storage for CyberMetals' precious metals.
 Goldline
 Goldline, acquired by the Company in August 2017, is a direct retailer of precious metals to the investor community. Goldline markets its precious metal products on television, radio, and the internet, as well as through customer service outreach, particularly to Goldline’s repeat customers. Online orders are taken on an electronic trading platform that can be accessed by qualified retail customers at www.goldline.com.
Goldline customers are required to open an account with Goldline and enter into an account agreement. The agreement specifies the terms and conditions of purchase and explains the availability of certain programs and services offered by Goldline to its customers.
 Products. Goldline offers a variety of products from gold, silver, and platinum bullion in the form of bars and coins, as well as rare coins. Many of Goldline’s coins and bars are also IRA eligible.
 Buyback Purchases. Precious Metals Purchasing Partners, LLC ("PMPP") is a joint venture with one of the Company's related parties, in which Goldline owns a 50% interest. Through PMPP, Goldline acquires precious metals from retail customers in order to diversify its supply chain of product offerings and prices for its affiliates.
Intellectual Property. AM IP Assets, LLC ("AMIP"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Goldline, manages certain intellectual property of Goldline, including customer lists and a sales lead data base.
Secured Lending
 The Company operates its Secured Lending segment through its wholly-owned subsidiary, CFC, which in turn owns AMCF. CFC and AMCF have been operating since fiscal years 2005 and 2019, respectively. CFC Alternative Investments, LLC (“CAI”), a newly-formed subsidiary of CFC, is a party to a joint venture known as Collectible Card Partners, LLC (“CCP”), which was formed for the purpose of making commercial loans collateralized by graded sports cards and sports memorabilia.
CFC is a California licensed finance lender that originates and acquires commercial loans secured by bullion and numismatic coins. CFC's customers include coin and precious metal dealers, investors, and collectors. As of June 30, 2022, the aggregate balance of CFC's secured loans was approximately $126.2 million. The balance is comprised of approximately 64.7% of loans acquired from third-parties and approximately 35.3% of loans originated by CFC.
 AMCF is a special purpose entity whose sole activity consists of operating, owning, and financing precious metal inventory through the issuance of notes (the “AMCF Notes”). AMCF Notes are primarily payable from, and secured by, (i) precious metals obtained by AMCF, (ii) a portfolio of loans collateralized by precious metals, which loans were originated by either CFC or acquired by CFC from third parties and conveyed by CFC to AMCF, and (iii) cash. The indenture governing the AMCF Notes requires AMCF to maintain a specified level of collateral. The indenture also provides that AMCF’s assets are not to be commingled with those of CFC or A-Mark (or any affiliate) and that AMCF is to maintain separate books and records.
 General. The secured loans that CFC issues consist of on-demand loans and loans with a term of three months to 364 days, with a typical term of approximately six months. Repayment of the loans can be made at any time without penalty. Because the loans are of relatively short duration, CFC does not have significant exposure to interest rate fluctuations, even in a rising interest rate environment. Loans carried by CFC range in size from $15,000 to $10.0 million.
 All loans are fully secured by bullion, numismatic coins or graded sports memorabilia (or in rare cases, by other acceptable collateral). TDS, on behalf of CFC, takes physical custody of the coins or bullion collateralizing the loans. CFC requires loan-to-value ("LTV") ratios of between 50% and 85%. LTV ratio refers to the principal amount of the loan divided by the liquidation value of the collateral, as conservatively estimated by CFC for numismatic loans and based on daily spot market prices for bullion loans. The LTV ratio varies with the nature of the collateral, with CFC requiring, for example, a higher LTV ratio for bullion than for rare coins. If, because of fluctuations in the market price of the pledged collateral, the LTV ratio on a loan increases above a prescribed maximum ratio, typically 85%, CFC can make a margin call on the loan. If the borrower does not meet the margin call, either by wiring payment or supplying additional collateral, CFC is authorized to sell the collateral, which it does through its A-Mark affiliates. CFC has never experienced losses of principal on its loans.
 Origination Activity. CFC's origination activities are complementary to the Company’s coin and bullion businesses, and afford our customers a convenient means of financing their inventory or collections. CFC also attempts to leverage the worldwide storage capabilities of its TDS affiliate by offering clients TDS’s asset protection services in connection with the loans. CFC’s marketing efforts for its origination activity are conducted both in partnership with A-Mark, particularly with respect to dealers, and independently, including though its dedicated website www.cfcgoldloans.com. Interest rates on loans originated by CFC are determined based on current market conditions, borrower profile and type or mix of collateral. CFC also offers a variety of custom loan services to its

origination clients, including renewal options, options to increase loan size, financing arrangements tailored to facilitate participation in numismatic auctions, and revolving loan arrangements. CFC services the loans that it originates.
 Acquisition Activity. CFC also acquires portfolios of loans secured by bullion and numismatics coins from third party originators. The loans acquired by CFC are sold subject to customary representations and warranties for loan portfolios of this type, and must comply with CFC’s criteria for quality of collateral, LTV ratio, term and interest rate. Upon acquisition of a loan portfolio, CFC takes physical possession of the collateral securing the loans. In the event that a loan is non-performing, the collateral will typically be liquidated by A-Mark on behalf of the originator in order to retire the loan. Typically, loan portfolios acquired by CFC are serviced by the originator for a fee.
 Financing Activity. CFC has historically financed its loan origination and acquisition activity primarily through A-Mark's demand line of credit with a syndicate of several financial institutions. The AMCF Notes, which were issued by AMCF in September 2018, have provided an additional source of funding for CFC's loan originations and acquisitions of loan portfolios from third parties.
 Liquidity
 Our business depends substantially on our ability to obtain financing for our operations. Sources of cash generated from operating activities include receipts upon the sales of precious metals, and cash collected from interest payments on secured loans.
Sources of cash provided by financing activities are our uncommitted line of credit, fixed interest rate notes, and other structured financing products. The Company’s line of credit provides it with the liquidity to buy and sell billions of dollars of precious metals annually, and is used to fund a substantial portion of the operations of the Company. As of June 30, 2022, A-Mark's uncommitted line of credit provided access up to $350.0 million, featuring a $300.0 million base with a $50.0 million accordion option. The maturity date of the credit facility is December 21, 2024.
 The Company issued fixed rate notes in September 2018 with an aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million, having a maturity of December 15, 2023. The proceeds upon issuance of the notes were used to fund the acquisition of CFC's secured loans and other operating activities. The Company also generates funds from other finance products that include product financing arrangements with customers, whereby the Company sells its inventory with an option to repurchase, and through precious metal borrowing and leasing arrangements with its suppliers.
Market Making Activity
 We act as a principal market maker, maintaining a two-way market for buying and selling precious metals. This means we both sell product to and purchase product from our customers.
Material Resources
 We maintain a substantial inventory of bullion and coins in order to provide our customers with selection and prompt delivery. We acquire product for our inventory in the course of our trading activities with our customers, directly from government and private mints, mines, and refiners, and from commodities brokers and dealers, privately and in transactions on established commodity exchanges.
 A-Mark’s precious metals inventories are subject to market value changes created by change in the underlying commodity price, as well as supply and demand of the individual products the Company trades. Our inventory is marked-to-market daily for accounting and financial reporting purposes, except for a relatively insignificant amount of inventory that is accounted for at lower of cost or net realizable value. A-Mark’s policy is to remain substantially hedged as to its inventory position and its individual sale and purchase commitments. A-Mark seeks to minimize the effect of price changes of the underlying commodity through the use of financial derivative instruments, such as forward and futures contracts.
 Sales and Marketing
 We market our products and services to our wholesale customers primarily through our offices in El Segundo, California, and Vienna, Austria, our websites, and our dealer network, which we believe is the largest of its kind in North America. The dealer network consists of over 900 independent precious metal and coin companies, with whom we transact on a non-exclusive basis. The arrangements with the dealers vary, but generally the dealers acquire product from us for resale to their customers. In some instances, we deliver bullion to the dealers on a consignment basis. We also participate from time to time in trade shows and conventions, at which we promote our products and services. As a vertically integrated precious metals company, a key element of our marketing strategy is being able to cross-sell our products and services to customers within our various business units.
 JMB markets its products over the internet through its proprietary websites, using an internally developed search optimization strategy and paid placements with major search engines. Goldline reaches its retail customer base on television, radio, and the internet, as well as through customer service outreach.


Consistent with the marketing strategy for our wholesale customers, we market our secured loan products and services to customers primarily through our dealer network and by participating in trade shows and conventions.
 Operational Support
 The Wholesale Sales & Ancillary Services segment maintains administrative and operational support related to its trading, hedging, and finance product operations at its headquarters in El Segundo, California. We believe that our existing administrative and operational support infrastructure has the capacity to scale up with our business activities. We store our inventories of bullion and numismatics at third party depositories in major financial centers around the world and at our secured facility in Las Vegas, Nevada.
 The Direct-to-Consumer segment maintains administrative and operational support at its office in Dallas, Texas and Los Angeles, California, for originating and processing its retail orders. The Company's Trading, Finance, and Logistics business units provide supporting services such as hedging and order fulfillment.
 The Secured Lending segment maintains administrative support at its headquarters in El Segundo, California for the processing of its originated loans, including billing, managing margin calls, and tracking of precious metal collateral. For the processing and administration of loans that are acquired from a third party (which may be a customer of A-Mark), customer invoices are typically processed by the originating dealer of the loan portfolio through a fee-based servicing arrangement. Collateral custody and security is managed by our Logistics business unit. Additionally, A-Mark provides funds to CFC to purchase additional bullion and numismatic secured loans.
 Customer Concentrations
 For the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company did not have any single customer that comprised more than 10% of our revenues. (See Note 18 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.) The Company's largest customers generally have significant forward contract sales activity (as opposed to those customers with whom we principally have physical trading activity), which are entered into in order to hedge the Company's commodity holding risks, and not for speculative purposes.
Competition
 A-Mark's activities cover a broad spectrum of the precious metals industry, with a concentration on the physical market. We service public, industrial, and private sector consumers of precious metals which include industrial manufacturers, refiners, minting facilities, banks, brokerage houses, and private investors. We frequently face different competitors in each area, and it is not uncommon for a customer and/or a supplier in one market segment to be a competitor in another.
 Our Direct-to-Consumer segment competes with numerous online and other retailers of direct-to-consumer precious metal products. The principal competitors of JMB include APMEX, SD Bullion and Bullion Exchanges. Competition is based primarily on price and customer service, including the ability to offer same day shipping. To a lesser extent, competition is also based on product availability, although all major ecommerce retailers will typically stock the products that are most in demand.
 Our Secured Lending segment's market is believed to have limited direct competition. We believe factors, including access to capital, secure storage facilities, bullion and numismatic expertise, and other related services and offerings, provide us a competitive advantage in that marketplace.
 Seasonality and Other Factors Influencing Demand
 Our business is generally not seasonal, although demand in the retail market tends to be lower in the summer months. On the other hand, we believe our business is directly impacted by the perception of market trends and global economic activity. Historically, higher levels of demand for precious metals are brought on during periods of macroeconomic uncertainty. Typically, factors that impact such uncertainty and correlate with a higher level of demand for precious metals include volatility in the equity markets, increases in rates of inflation, and devaluation of the U.S. dollar. The COVID pandemic has spurred an unprecedented demand for precious metal products, in both our wholesale and retail operations, which may not continue.
Compliance with Government Regulations
 We are subject to a variety of domestic and foreign laws that relate particularly to our business. Because of the nature and value of the precious metal products in which deal, we must be careful to assure compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and a variety of anti-money laundering and know-your-customer rules in response to the USA Patriot Act, and similar foreign statutory regimes.
By reason of our direct-to-consumer business in particular, we collect personal data and are subject to European General Data Protection Regulation, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, and similar domestic and foreign statutes that address the collection, use and monitoring of such data. We continue to devote substantial resources to comply with these laws and regulations.


Our CFC financing subsidiary operates under a California Finance Lenders License issued by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation. CFC is required to submit a finance lender law annual report to the state which summarizes certain loan portfolio and financial information regarding CFC, which are subject to audit.
 We have been in discussions with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission regarding its investigation relating to certain activities by Goldline. While we do not expect the outcome of this investigation to materially adversely affect our business or operations, this agency, and possibly other federal and state agencies, may seek to assert oversight over aspects of our operations.
Human Capital
 The efforts and expertise of our team members are critical to our success. We are devoted to the attraction, development, and retention of our employees, which enable us to deliver a high level of service to our customers. Because we have a small number of employees, and certain of our subsidiaries are geographically dispersed as a result of various acquisitions as well as from internal growth, our focus is on maintaining a relationship-based and collaborative work environment within each of our geographical locations. For the most part, these operating businesses are authorized to establish specific policies and practices concerning the attraction and retention of person in their organizations, addressing, among other things: maintaining a safe work environment for employees, customers and other business partners, offering competitive compensation and benefits to employees, and hiring practices intended to identify qualified candidates and promote diversity and inclusion in the workforce.
 At the same time, we recognize the importance of “Tone at the Top”, and we have adopted company-wide corporate governance policies and procedures which emphasize accountability, transparency, fairness, and responsibility. A-Mark’s senior management is responsible for establishing and monitoring A-Mark’s corporate governance practices, including monitoring governance efforts at each location, and participating in the resolution of governance-related issues as needed. A-Mark’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics emphasizes, among other things, the commitment to ethics and compliance with the law and provides basic standards for ethical and legal behavior of all its employees.
 As of June 30, 2022, the Company had 384 employees, with 382 located in North America, and 2 located in Europe; all except 7 of these employees were considered full-time employees. Our overall full-time employee retention rate (excluding temporary workers hired for less than 90 days) for the year ended June 30, 2022 was 46.7%; excluding the Mint and Logistics operations, which hire largely in response to fluctuating business demands, our retention rate was 74.3%. For the companies we have owned for more than five years, the percentage of employees who have more than five years of service was 25.2%. For the companies we have owned and operated for less than five years, the percentage of employees who have continued their employment since the respective acquisition dates was 37.1%.
 A-Mark is committed to supporting our employees’ financial, mental, and physical well-being. Across our various companies, we offer competitive pay and benefits, including annual short-term incentive awards and long-term equity awards, an employee savings 401(k) plan and company matching contributions, health insurance, disability insurance, life insurance, health savings and flexible spending accounts, wellness incentives, paid time off, family leave, parental leave, and employee assistance programs.
The Company has taken steps to support and protect its employees during the COVID-19 pandemic, including by implementing health and safety protocols and providing additional benefits. As of June 30, 2022, many of our employees continue to work remotely under a hybrid work-from-home/work-at-the-office model. For those employees who continue to work at our facilities, we follow state and local guidelines regarding masks and have configured our various working environments to allow for social distancing to the extent feasible.
 A-Mark provides equal employment opportunities to all qualified individuals without regard to race, color, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, pregnancy, age, national origin, physical or mental disability, military or veteran status, genetic information, or any other protected classification. Equal employment opportunity includes, but is not limited to, hiring, training, promotion, demotion, transfer, leaves of absence, and termination. The diversity of our workforce is essential, and we are committed to diversity and inclusion throughout the Company to ensure a wide range of experiences, perspectives, and skills to provide better solutions, drive innovation and creativity, and enhance decision making. As of June 30, 2022, approximately 35.9% of our employees identified as female, and 44.3% of our employees were made up of underrepresented minorities.
