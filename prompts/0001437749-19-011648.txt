ITEM 1. Business
OVERVIEW
 
Salon is a technology-based advertising media business that wholly owns and operates an online news website, salon.com (“Salon.com”). Our award-winning journalism is committed to fearless journalism and combines original investigative stories and provocative personal essays along with quick-take commentary, articles, podcasts, and original video about politics, culture, entertainment, sustainability, innovation, technology and business.
 
Salon was originally incorporated in July 1995 in the State of California and reincorporated in Delaware in June 1999. In 1999, we had our initial public offering. In 2001, we adopted the name Salon Media Group, Inc. Our common stock is traded in the over-the-counter market and our stock symbol is SLNM.PK.
 
Highlights from Fiscal Year 2018 and Fiscal Year 2019 (the “Period”)
 
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 (“fiscal year 2018”), we continued to execute our business strategy to refine and broaden our editorial products in order both to attract an engaged audience and premium advertising, which would increase revenues. However, we faced increased competition from both new and larger websites for online advertising campaigns during the year, and in the quarter ended March 31, 2018, significant changes to the algorithms used by Google and Facebook led to sharp decreases in traffic. Despite changes to our advertising footprint to capture the greater programmatic opportunity for our display and video advertising inventory, and resulting higher CPMs from our programmatic advertising compared to the fiscal year ended March 2017, the reduced traffic led to a smaller ad footprint and suppressed our revenues. The highlights of our fiscal year 2018 are listed below:

● | Total revenue in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 was flat at $4.5 million, compared to $4.6 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 (“fiscal year 2017”). We have been working on strategies to better monetize our Website and increase advertising revenues. A continued significant industry shift in online advertising from advertising sold by a direct sales team to advertising being sold through software-based “programmatic” technology has taken place. Our advertising sold through networks that access these programmatic buys accounted for 88% of our advertising revenue for the fiscal year 2018. We have been making changes to our advertising footprint to capture the greater programmatic opportunity for our display and video advertising inventory, and we will continue to focus our efforts to allow better management of our advertising inventory and targeting for our advertisers. This has allowed us to improve our cost-per-thousand-impression (“CPMs”) from our programmatic advertising by over 22% in the month of March 2018 as compared to March 2017. However, the higher programmatic CPMs were offset by a smaller ad footprint due to a decline in traffic, which led to a smaller inventory of ad products to sell, so a smaller relative increase in revenues. We are now focusing our efforts on re-building our Website traffic, to take advantage of the higher CPMs and increase our revenues in fiscal year 2019.

● | Net loss for the fiscal year 2018 was $3.1 million, a 70% decrease from $10.4 million in the fiscal year 2017. The decrease in net loss was mainly attributed to higher non-cash expenses in fiscal year 2017, including $5.6 million non-cash interest expense and an approximate $0.9 million non-cash preferred deemed dividends, both recorded for the beneficial conversion feature of capital raising transactions during the fiscal year 2017, compared to a $0.3 beneficial conversion feature of capital raising transactions during the fiscal year 2018. Operating expenses in fiscal year 2018 were 13% lower, at $7.4 million in fiscal year 2018 compared to $8.5 million for the fiscal year 2017. We will continue to look for ways to reduce expenses in areas that we expect can help reduce losses and accelerate a path to profitability.

● | We were proud to be honored for our excellence in journalism during the 2018 fiscal year. In April 2017, Salon was named an honoree for the 2016 Webby Awards for its Online Film & Video, Video Remixes and Mashups category, for our Donald Trump/Big Lebowski mashup. We received further positive critical recognition for our video as we were selected as a finalist for min’s 2017 Magazine Media Awards for Video Excellence - original video. The 2018 fiscal year featured great journalism, including original reporting and analysis, as we covered in-depth the top stories in news, politics and entertainment. Our daily coverage of the Trump Administration, the #MeToo movement, gun control, the alleged Russian interference in the U. S. Presidential race, climate change and the natural disasters in the Caribbean and Texas, legalization of marijuana, and film and TV reviews and commentary drove the most views. The intersection of culture and politics also continued to drive user interest, such as stories about why college may not be worth the cost, Colin Kaepernick’s national anthem protest to raise awareness of racism, George Clooney speaking out about President Trump’s attacks against the “Hollywood Elite,” and Rihanna seeking additional aid to Puerto Rico. We have also provided broadened, thoughtful and smart coverage on relationships, lifestyle and business that have been popular with our users.

● | We have continued to roll out our strategy to produce original video content focused on news, politics, and entertainment under the banner of Salon TV, Salon Talks and Salon Stage. Our goal is to add high quality diversified content to our Website, and to attract premium video advertising that commands higher CPMs as compared to display advertising. Featured guests on Salon Talks have included Senator Al Franken, scientist Bill Nye, Deepak Chopra, Dan Rather, Pearl Jam guitarist Mike McCready and Van Jones, among others, while Salon Stage hosted acoustic sets by, among others, the Revivalists, Josh Ritter, Lukas Nelson, Bela Fleck, Wyclef Jean and more. Furthermore, to monetize our growing library of original video programming, we will begin distributing our video programming across key Over-the-Top (OTT) channels such as Apple TV, Amazon, and Roku in the quarter ending June 2018.

● | Our peak monthly users for Salon.com traffic in fiscal year 2018 was in November 2017 when we recorded 15 million users, as measured by Google Analytics. In total, the average number of monthly users in fiscal year 2018 was 10.6 million, compared to 12.7 million in fiscal year 2017, a decrease of 17%. We attribute the decline in overall traffic to a combination of events, including the changes in the algorithms used by Facebook to promote news content, which led to lower referral traffic from Facebook, and reduced referral traffic from other major websites like Yahoo and Twitter. Our focus on growing traffic has shifted from volume to quality, in order to maximize our ability to monetize our page views with higher CPM video and display advertising. As a result, we are making changes to our editorial mix in order to publish more content that attract higher CPMs, such as pre-roll video and native advertising.

● | Social media and referral traffic from other websites continue to be a major driver of traffic, at approximately 29% of Website visitors as of March 2018. We make regular updates to the Website to optimize content to be shared on social media with a special focus on our mobile platforms. In March 2018, we surpassed 995,000 Facebook “likes” and over one million Twitter followers. In March 2017, we had approximately 965,000 Facebook “likes,” and 953,000 Twitter followers.

● | In August 2015, Salon recognized the Writers Guild of America, East, Inc. (“WGAE”) as the collective bargaining representative of our non-supervisory editorial staff. We continued collective bargaining with the WGAE during the year. As we do not yet have an agreement with our union employees, we remain uncertain how it will impact our financial status, or if it will have a negative impact on our ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We launched a subscription program in March 2018 that is targeted at our users who prefer not to see advertisements. We offer a monthly or yearly subscription plan in exchange for an ad-free experience using a Salon app for the phone. In the initial weeks from launch, we signed up less than 1,000 subscribers, but we will begin to market the subscription program more actively in fiscal year 2019, as we establish additional benefits for subscribers. We are also exploring the potential of gated premium content, where a user will have an option to pay per piece of content. We plan to launch gated premium content initially to international users, as user adoption is higher for this service in countries in Europe.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Mobile users accounted for 66% of all users in March 2018, which is up slightly from 60% in March 2017. We continue to have a company-wide focus on our users’ mobile needs, especially quick and easy access to fast-loading content optimized for better readability on smaller screens. We also have increased focus on monetization of mobile traffic through implementation of native and other mobile-optimized advertising.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We continually work toward leaner, more efficient technological systems through automation, improved architecture and adoption of emerging best practices. During the fiscal year 2018, we launched a newly redesigned Website to maximize speed and navigation, and launched a subscription app, both focused on enhancing our revenue capabilities.

Material Agreements Entered into during the Period
 
Advances/Secured Notes from Related Parties
 
From June 2018 through August 2018, we received $114.5 in advances from related parties. These advances accrued interest at a rate of 10% per annum and payable on the one-year anniversary of such advances. On December 7, 2018, these advances and all accrued interest were exchanged for secured notes in the amount of approximately $118.9. These notes bear a 10% interest rate and are payable on June 30, 2019. In addition, on December 7, 2018, we issued warrants to the secured note holders to purchase 11,312,600 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share. The warrants expire five years from the issuance date and can be exercised with cash or cancellation of the secured notes referenced above.

Technology Support Agreement
 
On October 25, 2018 we entered into a Technology Support Agreement (the "Technology Agreement") with PubLife LLC under which PubLife agreed to provide certain technology support to us, including all web development activities for a six month term in consideration of $1,000 per month. The payment terms under this agreement were amended under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement (as set forth below).
General Advertising Services Agreement
 
On October 25, 2018, we entered into a General Advertising Services Agreement (the "Advertising Agreement") with Proper Media LLC ("Agent") under which we retained Agent to provide advertisement sales and trafficking services for our websites, including salon.com and related sites. The term of this agreement is for one -year, which term shall be extended for successive one-year periods under terminated by either party within 30 days’ notice prior to the end of any term. We agreed to pay agent its revenue share of all revenue invoiced by Agent in connection with Agent's performance of the services under this agreement. In addition, if we refer a 3rd party publishing partner and Agent executes an advertising services agreement with such 3rd party, Agent agrees to pay us 25% of the monthly revenue earned by Agent due to such 3rd party agreement for the first six-months of any such agreement. The payment terms under this agreement were amended under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement (as set forth below).
 
WGAE Agreement
 
In October 2018, we entered into an agreement with the WGAE for a three-year period.  As a result of the ongoing negotiations and accompanying legal fees as well as the higher cost structure per the negotiated agreement, the effect was detrimental to the company’s financial standing as we had to endure layoffs of management in order to accommodate the editorial staff.  In addition, the agreement with the union had a seemingly negative impact on our ability to obtain additional financing. 
 
Asset Purchase Agreement 
 
On March 6, 2019, we entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with Salon.com, LLC (“Buyer”) under which we agreed to sell substantially all of our assets (the "Asset Sale"), including all pertinent intellectual property rights comprising the Company’s business of owning, operating and publishing the website known as Salon.com, (the “Business”), but excluding our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and certain contracts and right related to those contracts and tax refunds and insurance policies and rights related to excluded assets, to the Buyer for an aggregate Purchase Price of $5 million payable plus the amount of the Earn-Out Payment (as described below) and the assumption of certain assumed liabilities, all pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement. The purchase price is payable in cash as follows: (i) $550,000 in payable in cash at closing; (ii) $100,000 shall be deposited with the Escrow Agent, which amount shall be released to us in accordance with the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement; (iii) $500,000 of which was previously paid to the Company as a deposit concurrent with execution of the term sheet for the Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Deposit") and (iv) $3,850,000 via issuance of a 10% secured promissory note, which note shall be paid in 2 equal installments on the 12 month and 24 month anniversary of the closing date. This note shall be secured by all of the assets being sold to Buyer under the Asset Purchase Agreement.   
 
 6



First Amendment to Asset Purchase Agreement
 
On April 15, 2019, we entered into a First Amendment to Asset Purchase Agreement ("First Amendment") with Buyer. The primary purpose of the First Amendment was to amend the payment terms under the Technology Agreement and the Advertising Agreement as set forth below:
 
(a) for the month of March 2019: (i) ad fees under the Advertising Agreement shall be payable at 6.5%, and (ii) tech management fees payable pursuant to the Technology Agreement shall be $5,000 plus costs per the Technology Agreement;
 
(b) for the month of April 2019: (i) ad fees under the Advertising Agreement shall be payable at 6.5%, and (ii) tech management fees payable pursuant to the Technology Agreement shall be $10,000 plus costs per the Technology Agreement; and
 
(c) for the month of May 2019 and for each month thereafter: (i) ad fees under the Advertising Agreement shall be payable at 6.5%, (ii) tech management fees payable pursuant to the Technology Agreement shall be $10,000 plus costs per the Technology Agreement and (iii) an amount equal to 10% APR applied to the Deposit.
 
We also amended Section 10.9 of the Asset Purchase Agreement to include the term sheet related to the acquisition for the documents related to the entire agreement of the parties.
 
Salon Strategy 
 
In May 2016, we adopted a new strategy alongside the appointment of Jordan Hoffner as Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”). Our strategy focuses on improving monetization of our user base by innovating our ad technology in order to better match our highly educated and affluent users with advertisers. In the past few years, we have successfully attracted a sizeable user base, which in fiscal year 2018 averaged 10.6 million users per month who consumed an average of 25.3 million page views per month. Our number of page views translates to our number of viewer impressions that can be sold to our advertisers and offers opportunities to develop business relationships with companies that want access to our attractive user base. We currently sell our impressions to advertisers programmatically based on Run of Site private marketplaces, or at times, based on editorial content that falls in a particular category such as “Movies” or “Innovation.” The CPM is driven by market demand for each category of content we offer and the demographics of our audience. During the 2018 fiscal year we have shifted our focus to growing higher value traffic that maximizes our ability to monetize our page views with higher CPM video and display advertising. As a result, we have continued to adjust our editorial mix and products in order to publish more content to attract a wider universe of advertising clients and products. Going forward, the CPM that we can charge our advertisers will increasingly be based on our ability to deliver highly targeted and defined users to our advertiser.   
 
Our strategy is predicated on the following core principles: (1) create high quality diversified content that meets our users’ and advertisers’ interests; (2) hire the best possible talent to create centers of excellence and (3) innovate to bring great products to our users and advertisers. Our focus on these core principles underpins our goal to continue to grow our user base, and to develop new strategies around Website monetization that will provide opportunity for future growth.

In fiscal year 2019, our goal is to continue our mission of creating high quality journalism and making the conversation smarter, while anticipating continued shifts in the online advertising market to better monetize our Website. To reach our goals, and to achieve profitability, we will push ahead in the following areas:
 

● | Develop a broader mix of provocative content in addition to the core areas of news and politics, building off the original definition of a “salon” as a center of intellectual discussion
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Develop new strategies to attract new readers, and decrease reliance on specific social media websites or search engines
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Integrate into our advertising approach a deeper focus on new advertising products that match our high-quality user with appropriate advertisers using data and innovative ad products
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Assess new possible revenue streams, including subscription, TV programming, and book publishing to supplement advertising revenues, while keeping a keen eye on costs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Develop a Broader Mix of Provocative Content
 
We target an educated, culturally engaged audience interested in original thinking and smart commentary. We pursue that audience by featuring a diverse array of voices and perspectives, and by covering a wide range of topics including News & Politics, Life Stories, the Economy & Innovation, Culture, Health & Science, and Food. Twenty-four hours a day, 365 days per year, Salon invites users to immerse themselves in thought-provoking content that impassions and empowers them to be the intellectual and cultural leaders of our time.
 
While we continue to focus on breaking news coverage with a focus on politics, culture and world events, we recently began broadening our coverage to include new categories. These new categories include Food, Health & Science, and Economy & Innovation, and aim to give our users a wider variety of topics to choose from. The focus on these categories should also give our advertisers more category-focused inventory, which should in turn allow an increase in advertising opportunities. 
 
As we continue to focus our editorial to our users’ needs, we seek to grow visitors to our Website since the resulting page views serve as a platform for advertising impressions, a key driver of our revenue generation. Using data analytics in real-time, we can assess where our users’ interests are shifting, and respond by determining content, site layout and structure to best suit their needs in the moment. In fiscal year 2019, we intend to respond to users’ interests by hosting more dynamic content, such as increased numbers of video, slideshows and images, as well as by expanding further into content areas such as innovation and lifestyle. We will expand into new content areas by reallocating internal resources, as well as continue to have content partnerships to diversify our content offerings across various verticals. We are continually evaluating the needs of our users and trying to adjust and create new solutions to meet their needs.
 
Attract New Readers 
 
We continually need fresh content and new ideas to attract readers to our Website. We plan to continue to focus on developing our audience through a combination of editorial enhancements, increased dynamic content and new user-focused functionalities and products. 
 
In addition to editorial initiatives to attract new users, we have been testing other opportunities that could attract new readers, including using marketing dollars to push our content to new users on platforms such as Facebook, develop traffic partnerships with other digital media brands, and engage in distribution deals with syndication partners. In addition, we have developed Salon TV shows that could be picked up by broadcast partners, and as a result be distributed on larger broadcast and cable platforms.

The importance in Website traffic from social media was underpinned by the significant number of Facebook “likes” at more than 995,000, and Twitter followers at 1,005,000 as of March 2018. However, social media traffic can be variable due to changes in each platform’s approach to news content, and the large number of “likes” and “followers” lost some of its prior ability to drive traffic to our website. Despite our Facebook “likes” growing to more than 995,000 in March 2018 versus 965,000 in March 2017, the portion of our traffic from Facebook has declined to 13% from 25%, respectively. In fiscal year 2019, we plan to continue our efforts to build our audience on social media, and place more emphasis on other emerging platforms, through a continuation of the strategies we have employed in the past two years.
 
Develop New Revenue Streams
 
In March 2018, we launched a subscription product that allows users to pay for ad-free content. We offer a monthly or yearly subscription plan in exchange for an ad-free experience using a Salon app for the phone. In the initial weeks from launch, we signed up less than 1,000 subscribers, but we will begin to market the subscription program more actively in fiscal year 2019, as we establish additional benefits for subscribers.
 
We have also launched a pilot to explore a strategic partnership for a co-branded Salon webinar and live events business. The initial results of our pilot were sufficiently positive to begin to draw up more detailed plans for a joint venture, with the goal to launch the business in June 2018. Also, as a result of solid conversion ratios, we have also made our Salon e-commerce partnership more prominent on our Website by placing it on our top navigation bar in order to drive additional revenues.
 
We are also working toward the launch of a gated premium content product, where a user will have an option to pay per piece of content. We plan to launch gated premium content initially to international users, as user adoption is higher for this service in countries in Europe.
 
In addition to these existing initiatives, we are exploring possible business opportunities in other areas, including a book publishing partnership that would support Salon writers, and a possible Salon TV show.
 
A Deeper Focus on New Advertising Products that Match our User with Appropriate Advertisers 
 
In order to expand our base of advertisers and increase our advertising revenues, we plan to integrate into our advertising approach a deeper focus on new advertising products that match our high-quality user with appropriate advertisers using data and innovative ad products. This includes entering possible partnerships with advertising technology companies that can offer highly tailored products that leverage new advertising technology and add software and data capabilities to understand our users better. This will allow us to match our readers’ interests with advertisers more closely.
Path to Profitability
 
Our operating losses in fiscal year 2018 decreased compared to fiscal year 2017, a result of our continued attempts to make adjustments to our revenue model in order to increase advertising revenues, and keep costs low in order to get closer to profitability. Due to an industry shift in advertising dollars toward programmatic and video advertising, and a decline in traffic during the year, our direct advertising declined 29% and programmatic advertising modestly increased 7% leading to total advertising revenues remaining constant in fiscal year 2018. At the same time, our production costs decreased 14% from a year ago, which resulted in smaller losses.
 
Entering fiscal year 2019, we plan to build on the progress we made in increasing CPMs and advertising rates at programmatic marketplaces, and take advantage of marketing opportunities and an active news cycle to increase our page views and video views. Furthermore, in April 2018, we took steps to reduce further our expense base and shift resources to create content that will generate higher CPM advertising. Given these changes, we anticipate that fiscal year 2019 will better align production costs with our revenue potential in an effort to reach profitability.

Revenue Sources
 
Most of Salon’s revenues are derived from advertising from the sale of promotional space on its Website. Internet advertising revenues accounted for 79% of revenues in fiscal year 2018. Revenue from referring users to third party websites primarily accounted for the remaining 21% of revenues in fiscal year 2018.
 
Internet advertising is affected by broad economic conditions, like other forms of advertising, but overall it has continued its upward trend even through economic turbulence. According to the 2017 IAB Internet Advertising Revenue Report conducted by PwC Advisory Services LLC, the compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) over the past ten years for Internet advertising in the United States was 15.3%, far outpacing every other media. Furthermore, on a year-over-year basis, mobile advertising revenues increased 36.2%, increasing its share of total revenue from 50.5% in FY2016 to 56.7% in fiscal year 2017. Internet advertising revenue in the United States totaled $88.0 billion in 2017, a 21.4% increase from $72.5 billion in 2016. In the quarter ended December 2017, the sources for advertising revenues were search (44%), banner (including banners, sponsorships, and rich media) (32%), video (14%) and other (10%).
 
The bulk of online advertising remains concentrated in a relatively small number of dominant Internet companies, with the top ten companies accounting for 74% of online advertising in the December 2017 quarter, and another 8% captured by the next tier of companies ranked 11th through 25th. Therefore, we believe our market opportunity falls roughly at 18% of the online advertising market, or $15.8 billion.
 
The primary factors in our ability to increase our advertising revenues in future periods are growth in our audience and the addition of higher CPM ad products, such as pre-roll video. Attracting more unique visitors to our Website is important because these users generate additional page views, and each page view becomes a potential platform for advertisements. Advertising comprises banners, video, rich media and other interactive ads across our desktop, tablet, mobile browser and apps platforms. Advertisers pay for advertising based on a CPM, and different platforms attract different CPMs. CPMs for mobile have been less than for desktop. Videos and sponsored content on mobile devices continue to grow in popularity and can demand a higher CPM. We believe that continuing to add videos and sponsored content to our mobile platform and improving and optimizing the platform’s design will help increase revenues from our mobile platform.
 
Overall, monthly unique visitors to our Website have grown from 6.3 million in March 31, 2011 to a peak of 19.6 million in June 30, 2015, and has reverted to 6.2 million in March 31, 2018. Our full year average monthly unique visitors were 6.4 million, 10.6 million, 11.2 million, 16.9 million, 16.6 million, 12.7 million and 10.6 million in fiscal years 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. These fluctuations reflect changes in content areas on our Website over this period, and adjustments to search engine optimization and social media algorithms. The table below reflects unique monthly visitors to our Website from fiscal year 2011 through fiscal year 2018. Unique visitors in the period from March 2011 to May 2013 included traffic to an affiliated website that has since been shut down.
 

Sales and Marketing
 
As a news and lifestyle Website that competes against much larger websites, we have sought to distinguish ourselves in the marketplace by offering customized, innovative and integrated advertising products that appeal to users and seamlessly and organically incorporate our advertising clients and their objectives into our Website. We work with our programmatic advertising partners to launch advertisements that match our high-quality audience, and innovate with new products as they become available.
 
Our sales and marketing office is located in both San Francisco and New York, with one advertising sales and operations employee who actively solicits orders as of March 31, 2018.

We recognize that users come to the site for online news, reporting, opinion and an engaging, active community of writers, users and commenters.

To meet users’ rapidly evolving online media needs, we are continually innovating and developing our Website, mobile Website and social media presence – by adding new features, design updates and technologies that improve the user experience, speed and search engine optimization. We have developed an internal culture of innovation where the Edit, Technology and Sales teams collaborate on product development.
 
Our Website is hosted on cloud-based virtual servers running open-source Linux operating systems and various open-source web and network software packages. Our top technical priority is the fast and reliable delivery of pages to our users. Our systems are designed to handle traffic growth and network failures by balancing the requests among several pools of servers across the globe that automatically scale to match traffic demands. We rely on multiple tiers of redundancy/failover and third-party Content Delivery Network to achieve our goal of 24 hours, seven-days-a-week Website uptime. Regular automated backups protect the integrity of our data. Our servers are continuously monitored by numerous third-party and open-source monitoring and alerting tools.
 
In fiscal year 2017, we launched a Website redesign that put in place a publishing infrastructure that better takes advantage of current technologies. The redesign allows a better user experience as a result of quicker load time, and improved re-circulation of Salon content on each page, and improved monetization due to improved viewability of ads on our website. As a part of this redesign, we continued building new products for video and mobile, expanded our social media integration, and improved security and scaling capabilities.
 
In fiscal year 2018, we completed our Website and advertising architecture redesign aimed at improving the user experience. As part of this effort, we will continue to explore new products that meet the immediate needs of our mobile users, build out new advertising products for video and mobile and improve our security and scaling capabilities.
 
Competition
 
The bulk of online advertising remains concentrated in a relatively small number of dominant Internet companies, with the top ten companies accounting for 74% of online advertising in the December 2017 quarter, and another 8% captured by the next tier of companies ranked 11th through 25th. Therefore, we believe our market opportunity falls roughly at 18% of the online advertising market, or $15.8 billion. We compete for advertising revenues with numerous websites, including major portals such as Yahoo/AOL, major search engines such as Google, major social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, and other online large media publications such as Buzzfeed, Huffington Post, New York Times, Washington Post, MSNBC and CNN.com. We also compete with many smaller news and politics-oriented websites, such as Slate, The Daily Beast, The Atlantic, Talking Points Memo, Politico and Axios for staff, audience and advertising sales.
Proprietary Rights
 
Our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on the goodwill associated with our trademarks, trade names, service marks and other proprietary rights and on our ability to use U.S. laws to protect our intellectual property, including our original content, content provided by third parties, and content provided by columnists. We have a registered trademark on our Salon name and logo.
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2018, Salon has 34 full-time employees and 2 part-time employees. We believe our relations with our employees are good. We commenced collective bargaining with our non-supervisory editorial employees in November 2015, and the results of this process are uncertain. Our future success is highly dependent on our ability to attract, hire, retain and motivate talented personnel.
