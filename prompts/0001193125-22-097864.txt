Item 1. | Business.
--------+----------

Overview 
 We are a blank check company formed as a Delaware corporation for the purpose of effecting our initial business combination. We intend to acquire and operate a business in the consumer and consumer-related products and services industries and believe our management team is well suited to identify opportunities that have the potential to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders. However, we are not limited to these industries and we may pursue a business combination opportunity in any business or industry we choose and we may pursue a company with operations or opportunities outside of the United States. Our executives are experienced at recognizing and quantifying the value of brands and creating strategies to reposition those brands globally so that they reach their full market potential. Not only does our management team bring a combination of operating, investing, financial and transaction experience, but certain members of our management team have also worked together for over a decade creating value for shareholders. 
Initial Public Offering 
 On March 4, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering of 30,000,000 units. Each unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share, and one-fourth of one redeemable warrant of the Company, with each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock for $11.50 per share. The units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $300,000,000. 
 Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 5,333,333 warrants to our sponsor at a purchase price of $1.50 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds of $8,000,000. 
 On March 3, 2021, the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in part and on March 5, 2021 purchased additional 1,750,000 units at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating additional gross proceeds of $17,500,000. In connection with the exercise of the over-allotment option by the underwriters, the Company sold 233,333 additional Private Placement Warrants to the sponsor at a purchase price of $1.50 per private placement warrant, generating additional gross proceeds of $350,000. 
 A total of $317,500,000 was placed in the trust account maintained by Continental, acting as trustee. 
 It is the job of our sponsor and management team to complete our initial business combination. Our management team is led by Steven J. Heyer, our Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman and Andrew R. Heyer, our President, who have many years of experience in the consumer and consumer-related products and services industries. We must complete our initial business combination by March 4, 2023, 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering. If our initial business combination is not consummated by March 4, 2023, then our existence will terminate, and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account. 
 Business Combination 
 Business Combination Agreement 
 On December 13, 2021, we entered into the Business Combination Agreement. Upon the closing of the Business Combination (the “Closing”), the Company will change its name to “biote Corp.” The aggregate consideration that will be paid to or retained by the Members upon the Closing is approximately $555,000,000, subject to the purchase price adjustments set forth in the Business Combination Agreement. Following the Closing, the Combined Company will be organized in an “UP-C” structure in which substantially all of the assets and business of the Combined Company will be held by Biote and its direct and indirect subsidiaries (together, the “Biote Companies”), and the Company’s only direct assets will consist of Biote Units (as defined below). 
 Prior to the Closing, the Company may issue up to $100,000,000 in shares of Class A common stock in a private placement (an “Equity Financing”), so long as the price per share is not less than $10.00. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation, in connection with the Closing, all then-outstanding shares of Class B common stock will be converted into shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis (the “Class B Common Stock Conversion”). 
 
1 

  Immediately prior to the Closing, Biote will (i) effectuate a recapitalization, pursuant to which all its Class A Units, Class AA Units, Class AAA Units and Class AAAA Units held by the Members will be converted or exchanged (whether by direct exchange, merger or otherwise) into a number of equity interests in Biote designated as “Class A Common Units” (“Biote Units”) in the amounts determined in accordance with Biote’s Second Amended and Restated Operating Agreement (the “Biote A&R OA”), which will be entered into prior to the Closing, the result of which will be that the Members will hold a single class of Biote Units as of immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) convert into a Delaware limited liability company. In connection with the Business Combination, BioTE Medical, LLC (“Biote Medical”), a subsidiary of Biote, has entered into a debt commitment letter with Truist Bank and Truist Securities, Inc. to obtain (i) a $50,000,000 senior secured revolving credit facility in favor of Biote Medical and (ii) a $125,000,000 senior secured term loan A facility in favor of Biote Medical (together, the “Debt Facilities,” and any such financing, together with any alternative financing obtained by the Company, Biote or any Biote subsidiary, the “Debt Financing”). Each holder of phantom equity in any of Biote or its direct or indirect subsidiaries (each, a “Phantom Equity Holder”) has entered into a phantom equity acknowledgement (each, a “Phantom Equity Acknowledgement”) effective as of the Closing, which shall, among other things, confirm the number of shares of Class A common stock to be issued to such Phantom Equity Holder pursuant to the biote Corp. 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Incentive Plan”) in satisfaction of his or her phantom equity rights and the vesting schedule for such shares. 
 Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth therein, at the time of the Closing, (x) in exchange for the Closing Biote Units (as defined below), the Company will transfer cash in an amount equal to (i) the cash in the trust account and any cash held by the Company outside of the trust account, less (ii) the amounts required by the redemptions of Class A common stock by the public stockholders, plus (iii) the aggregate proceeds to be received by the Company pursuant to any Equity Financing, (y) the Biote Companies will receive the aggregate proceeds from the Debt Financing (the aggregate amounts described in (x) and (y), the “Closing Date Cash”) in accordance with and in the priority set forth in the Business Combination Agreement and as described further below, and (z) the Company will issue to Biote a number of shares of its Class V common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class V Voting Stock”) equal to the number of Retained Biote Units (as defined below), which will entitle the holder thereof to one vote per share but no right to dividends or distributions. Biote will immediately thereafter distribute the Class V Voting Stock to its Members pursuant to the Biote A&R OA. The “Cash Consideration” will be equal to the portion of the aggregate consideration paid or payable to the Gary S. Donovitz 2012 Irrevocable Trust (the “Selling Member”) that is paid in cash, which amount shall in no event exceed $199,000,000. 
 At the Closing and in consideration for the acquisition of Biote Units by the Company, the Company and the Biote Companies will, subject to the Business Combination Agreement and the Trust Agreement (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement), disburse the Closing Date Cash for the following purposes and in the following order of priority: (a) first, payment of unpaid Transaction Expenses (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement), (b) second, payment to Biote (for use by the Biote Companies) in the amount of $75,000,000, (c) third, payment of Cash Consideration to the Selling Member in the amount of $50,000,000, (d) fourth, payment to Biote (for use by the Biote Companies) in the amount of $75,000,000, (e) fifth, payment of Cash Consideration to the Selling Member in the amount of $75,000,000, (f) sixth, payment to Biote and the Selling Member such that Biote and the Selling Member receive 37.8% and 62.2%, respectively, of the remaining Closing Date Cash until Biote and the Selling Member have received aggregate payments pursuant to this clause (f) equal to $45,000,000 and $74,000,000, respectively, and (g) seventh, payment to Biote (for use by the Biote Companies). 
 At the Closing, Biote will issue to the Company a number of Biote Units (the “Closing Biote Units”) equal to the aggregate number of shares of Class A common stock issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing (after giving effect to any redemptions of Class A common stock, any Equity Financing, the Class B Common Stock Conversion and the forfeiture of up to 793,750 shares of Class B common stock held by the sponsor in the event cash available to the Company at the Closing is less than $206,400,000). The Members will, immediately following the Closing, retain an aggregate number of Biote Units (such Biote Units retained by the Members, the “Retained Biote Units”) equal to the following (without duplication between clauses (y) and (z)): (w) (i) (A) Biote’s equity value (i.e., $555,000,000), minus (B) the aggregate amount of Company Transaction Expenses (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement), minus (C) the Cash Consideration, if any, divided by (ii) $10.00, plus (x) the Member Earnout Units (as defined below), minus (y) a number of Biote Units equal to the number of shares of Class A common stock to be issued to the Phantom Equity Holders pursuant to the Phantom Equity Acknowledgements (or the existing underlying phantom equity documentation with respect to any Phantom Equity Holder who has not entered into a Phantom Equity Acknowledgement as of the Closing), minus (z) a number of Biote Units equal to the quotient of (i) the amount of cash payable to the Phantom Equity Holders pursuant to the Phantom Equity Acknowledgments (or the existing underlying phantom equity documentation with respect to any Phantom Equity Holder who has not entered into a Phantom Equity Acknowledgement as of the Closing), divided by (ii) $10.00. 
 
2 

  In connection with the Closing, on the date of the Closing (the “Closing Date”) (a) the Members on a pro rata basis will subject (i) 10,000,000 Retained Biote Units held by them (the “Member Earnout Units”) and (ii) 10,000,000 shares of Class V Voting Stock distributed to them by Biote (the “Earnout Voting Shares”), (b) the Sponsor will subject 1,587,500 shares of Class A common stock held by it after giving effect to the Class B Common Stock Conversion (the “Sponsor Earnout Shares”), and (c) the Company will subject a number of Biote Units equal to the number of Sponsor Earnout Shares (the “Sponsor Earnout Units,” and, together with the Sponsor Earnout Shares, the Earnout Voting Shares and the Member Earnout Units, the “Earnout Securities”), to certain restrictions and potential forfeiture pending the achievement (if any) of certain earnout targets pursuant to the terms of the Business Combination Agreement or the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement). The Earnout Securities will have voting rights but no right to dividends or distributions (except for certain tax distributions from Biote in accordance with the Biote A&R OA) until such restrictions and potential forfeiture have lapsed. One third of each of the Member Earnout Units, Earnout Voting Shares, Sponsor Earnout Shares and Sponsor Earnout Units will vest upon the occurrence of each of the following events: (i) the first time, prior to the five-year anniversary of the Closing Date (the “Earnout Deadline”), the volume-weighted average share price of the Class A common stock (the “VWAP”) equals or exceeds $12.50 per share for 20 Trading Days (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) of any 30 consecutive Trading Day period following the Closing, (ii) the first time, prior to the Earnout Deadline, the VWAP equals or exceeds $15.00 per share for 20 Trading Days of any 30 consecutive Trading Day period following the Closing, and (iii) the first time, prior to the Earnout Deadline, the VWAP equals or exceeds $17.50 per share for 20 Trading Days of any 30 consecutive Trading Day period following the Closing. If a definitive agreement with respect to a Change of Control (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) is entered into on or prior to the Earnout Deadline, then effective as of immediately prior to closing of such Change of Control, unless previously vested pursuant to clauses (i) through (iii) of the preceding sentence, each of the Member Earnout Units, Earnout Voting Shares, Sponsor Earnout Shares and Sponsor Earnout Units will vest. 
 Assuming that none of the Company’s current stockholders exercise their right to redeem their shares of Class A common stock of the Company and Company Transaction Expenses (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) equal $11,521,000, and subject to certain adjustments in accordance with the Business Combination Agreement, as of immediately following the Closing and without giving effect to the outstanding warrants to purchase Class A common stock or any warrants issuable in respect of the Working Capital Loans or issuance of any shares under the Incentive Plan or biote Corp. 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, but including the Earnout Securities, the Combined Company is expected to own, directly or indirectly, approximately 49.9% of the Biote Units and will control Biote as the sole manager of Biote in accordance with the terms of the Biote A&R OA and all remaining Biote Units will be owned by the Members. The Members are expected to hold a controlling interest in the Company after the Closing and will therefore have the ability to control Biote. 
 Beginning on the six month anniversary of the Closing, each Retained Biote Unit held by the Members may be redeemed, together with one share of Class V Voting Stock and subject to certain conditions, in exchange for either one share of Class A common stock or in certain circumstances, at the election of the Company in its capacity as the sole manager of Biote, the cash equivalent of the market value of one share of Class A common stock, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Biote A&R OA (such exchange rights, as further described in the Biote A&R OA, the “Exchange Rights”). 
 Consummation of the Business Combination is subject to customary mutual conditions and covenants of the respective parties, including the receipt of the requisite approval of the Company’s stockholders. The Business Combination Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the consummation of the Business Combination by mutual written consent of the Company and Biote and in certain other limited circumstances, including if the consummation of the Business Combination has not occurred on or before June 13, 2022, which is prior to the Company’s initial business combination deadline of March 4, 2023. The Business Combination Agreement contains usual and customary representations and warranties for transactions of this nature by the parties thereto. The Business Combination Agreement has been approved by the Company’s board of directors, and the board has recommended that the Company’s stockholders adopt the Business Combination Agreement and approve the Business Combination. 
 On February 11, 2022, we filed a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC setting forth all of the above information and inviting the Company’s stockholders to attend the special meeting in lieu of the 2022 annual meeting of the stockholders to approve, among other things, the Business Combination Agreement and the Business Combination. 
 Related Agreements 
 The Business Combination Agreement contemplates the execution of various additional agreements and instruments, on or before the Closing, including, among others, the following: 
 Tax Receivable Agreement 
 Simultaneously with the Closing, the Combined Company, Biote, the Members and the Members’ Representative will enter into a tax receivable agreement (the “Tax Receivable Agreement”), which will provide for, among other things, payment by the Combined Company to the Members of 85% of the U.S. federal, state and local income tax savings realized by the Combined Company as a result of the increases in tax basis and certain other tax benefits related to the transactions contemplated under the Business Combination Agreement and the redemption of Retained Biote Units in exchange for Class A common stock or cash (as more fully described in the Tax Receivable Agreement). These payments are an obligation of the Combined Company and not of the Biote Companies. The Combined Company’s only material asset will be its ownership interest in Biote and, accordingly, the Combined Company will depend on distributions from Biote to make any payments required to be made by the Combined Company under the Tax Receivable Agreement. 
 The term of the Tax Receivable Agreement will continue until all such tax benefits have been utilized or expired unless the Combined Company exercises its right to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement for an amount representing the present value of anticipated future tax benefits under the Tax Receivable Agreement or certain other acceleration events occur. The actual increase in the Combined Company’s allocable share of tax basis in the Biote Companies’ assets, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of redemptions of shares of Retained Biote Units, the market price of shares of the Class A common stock at the time of the exchange, the extent to which such exchanges are taxable and the amount and timing of the Combined Company’s income. Any payments the Combined Company makes under the Tax Receivable Agreement will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to the Combined Company. To the extent that the Combined Company is unable to make timely payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, the unpaid amounts will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid; however, nonpayment for a specified period and/or under certain circumstances may constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement and therefore accelerate payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement. 
 The Tax Receivable Agreement provides that, in the event that (i) the Combined Company exercises its early termination rights under the Tax Receivable Agreement, (ii) certain changes of control occur (as described in the Tax Receivable Agreement), (iii) the Combined Company, in certain circumstances, fails to make a payment required to be made pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement by the applicable final payment date, which non- payment continues for 30 days following such final payment date or (iv) the Combined Company materially breaches any of its material obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which breach continues without cure for 30 days following receipt by the Combined Company of written notice thereof (unless, in the case of clauses (iii) and (iv), certain liquidity exceptions apply) the Combined Company’s obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement will accelerate and the Combined Company will be required to make a lump-sum cash payment to the applicable parties to the Tax Receivable Agreement equal to the present value of all forecasted future payments that would have otherwise been made under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which lump-sum payment would be based on certain assumptions, including those relating to our future taxable income.

  Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company and Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company 
 In connection with the Closing, the Company will amend and restate (i) subject to receipt of Company Stockholder Approval, its amended and restated certificate of incorporation by adopting the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the “Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation”) and (ii) the current bylaws of the Company by adopting the Amended and Restated Bylaws of Company (the “A&R Bylaws”), to establish a structure containing Class A common stock, which will carry such economic and voting rights as set forth in the Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation and A&R Bylaws, and Class V Voting Stock, which will carry only such voting rights as set forth in the Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation and A&R Bylaws (as more fully described in the Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation and A&R Bylaws). 
 Second Amended and Restated Operating Agreement of Biote 
 At the Closing, the Combined Company, Biote and the Members will enter into the Biote A&R OA, which will, among other things, permit the issuance and ownership of Biote Units as contemplated to be issued and owned upon the consummation of the Business Combination, designate the Combined Company as the sole manager of Biote, provide for the Exchange Rights, set forth the rights and preferences of the Biote Units, and establish the ownership of the Biote Units by the persons or entities indicated in the Biote A&R OA, in each case, as more fully described in the Biote A&R OA. 
Sponsor Letter 
 In connection with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, certain of the Company’s officers and directors, the Company, the Sponsor, Biote and the Members’ Representative entered into a letter agreement (the “Sponsor Letter”), pursuant to which, among other things, the Sponsor agreed to (i) vote, at any duly called meeting of stockholders of the Company, in favor of the Business Combination Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, (ii) subject to certain exceptions, not to effect any sale or distribution of any of its shares of Class B common stock or private placement warrants and (iii) waive any and all anti-dilution rights described in the amended and restated certificate of incorporation or otherwise with respect to the shares of Class B common stock held by the Sponsor that may be implicated by the Business Combination such that the Class B Common Stock Conversion will occur as discussed herein (and as more fully described in the Sponsor Letter). 
Investor Rights Agreement 
 At the Closing, the Company, the Members, the Sponsor, the Members’ Representative and certain other parties will enter into an Investor Rights Agreement (the “Investor Rights Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, (i) the Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of March 1, 2021, entered into in connection with the Company’s initial public offering will be terminated, (ii) the lock-up period set forth in the Investor Rights Agreement will supersede the lock-up period set forth in the letter agreement, dated March 1, 2021, entered into in connection with the Company’s initial public offering, (iii) the Company will provide certain registration rights for the shares of Class A common stock held by the Members, the Sponsor, and certain other parties, (iv) the Members will agree not to, subject to certain exceptions, transfer, sell, assign or otherwise dispose of the shares of Class A common stock, Class V Voting Stock and the Biote Units held by such Members for six months following the Closing, and the Member Earnout Units until the date such securities have been earned in accordance with the Business Combination Agreement and (v) the Sponsor will agree not to, subject to certain exceptions, transfer, sell, assign or otherwise dispose of its (a) shares of Class A common stock (other than the Sponsor Earnout Shares) for six months following the Closing, (b) Sponsor Earnout Shares until the date such securities have been earned in accordance with the Business Combination Agreement and (c) warrants issued to the Sponsor pursuant to that certain Private Placement Warrants Purchase Agreement, dated March 1, 2021, by and between the Company and the Sponsor, and the underlying shares of Class A common stock, for 30 days following the Closing Date (in each case, as more fully described in the Investor Rights Agreement).

  Business Strategy and Deal Origination 
 Our acquisition and value creation strategy has been and continues to be to identify, acquire and, after our initial business combination, build a company in the consumer or consumer-related products and services industries that complements the experience of our management team and can benefit from their operational expertise, such as Biote. Our business combination strategy has leveraged and will continue to leverage our management team’s network of potential proprietary and public transaction sources where we believe a combination of our relationships, knowledge and experience in the consumer and consumer-related products and services industries could effect a positive transformation or augmentation of existing businesses to improve their overall value proposition. 
 We have utilized and will continue to utilize the network and industry experience of Messrs. Heyer and Heyer and their affiliates in seeking an initial business combination and employing our business combination strategy. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team and their affiliates have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships globally that we believe will serve as a useful source of acquisition opportunities. This network has been developed through our management team’s: 
 

• | extensive experience in both investing in and operating in consumer and consumer-related products and services industries;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | marketing and growing these companies through experience engineering and de-commoditizing their services and products;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | experience in sourcing, structuring, acquiring, operating, developing, growing, financing and selling businesses;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | relationships with sellers, financing providers and target management teams; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | experience in executing transactions in the consumer and consumer-related products and services industries under varying economic and financial market conditions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


These networks have provided and will continue to provide our management team with a robust flow of acquisition opportunities. In addition, target business candidates may be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, which may include investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises. Members of our management team communicate with their networks of relationships to articulate the parameters for our search for a target company and a potential business combination and begin the process of pursuing and reviewing potentially interesting leads. 
 In addition, drawing on their extensive investing and operating experiences, our management team have tapped four major sources of deal flow: 
 

• | directly identifying potentially attractive undervalued situations through primary research into industries and companies;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | receiving information from our management team’s global contacts about a potentially attractive situation;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | contact from securities broker-dealers’ research, sales, trading or investment banking department offering or identifying businesses seeking a combination or added value that matches our strengths; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | inbound opportunities from a company or existing stakeholders seeking a combination, including corporate divestitures.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Business Combination Criteria 
 Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating candidates for our initial business combination. While we have used these criteria and guidelines in evaluating business combination opportunities, such as the Business Combination, we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that only meets some but not all of these criteria and guidelines. We have focused on candidates that we believe: 

• | have market and/or cost leadership positions in their respective consumer or consumer-related products and services niches and would benefit from our extensive networks and insights within the consumer and consumer-related products and services industries;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



5 

  
• | provide enduring products, content, or services, with the potential for revenue, market share and/or distribution improvements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | are fundamentally sound companies that are underperforming their potential and offer compelling value;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | offer the opportunity for our management team to partner with established target management teams or business owners to achieve long-term strategic and operational excellence, or, in some cases, where our access to accomplished executives and the skills of the management of identified targets warrants replacing or supplementing existing management;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | exhibit unrecognized value or other characteristics, desirable returns on capital, and a need for capital to achieve the company’s growth strategy, that we believe have been misevaluated by the marketplace based on our analysis and due diligence review; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | will offer an attractive risk-adjusted return for our shareholders.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. We used these criteria and guidelines in evaluating business combination opportunities, including Biote. Based on our evaluation of Biote and the industry in which it operates, including the financial and other information provided by Biote in the course of negotiations, we believe that Biote meets the criteria and guidelines listed above. In the event that the Business Combination is not consummated, we may decide to enter into an alternative business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the SEC. 
 Our officers and directors may become officers or directors of any other blank check company prior to completion of our initial business combination. In particular, two of our executive officers also currently serve in officer and director capacities at TMKR, which is searching for a target business in the restaurant, hospitality and related technology and service sectors, and AFAQ, which is searching for a target business in the consumer packaged goods, health and wellness, and personal care industries. As a result, our officers or directors could have conflicts of interest in determining whether to present business combination opportunities to us or to any other blank check company with which they may become involved. 
 Initial Business Combination 
 Nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account). We refer to this as the 80% of net assets test. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or from an independent accounting firm, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination, although there is no assurance that will be the case. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any initial business combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors. 
 
6 

  We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders’ own shares will own or acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in our initial business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If our initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all the target businesses. Based on the valuation analysis of our management and board of directors, we have determined that the fair market value of Biote was substantially in excess of 80% of the funds in the trust account and that the 80% test was therefore satisfied. 
 We have filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination. 
 Status as a Public Company 
 We believe our structure as a public company makes us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses, like Biote. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination with us. In a business combination transaction with us, the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange their shares of stock in the target business for our Class A common stock (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our Class A common stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. See “Business Combination” above for more information regarding such exchange in the Business Combination. We believe target businesses, such as Biote, will find this method a more expeditious and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. The typical initial public offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there are significant expenses and market and other uncertainties in the initial public offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, marketing and road show efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us. 
 Furthermore, once a proposed initial business combination is completed, such as the Business Combination, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Following an initial business combination, we believe the target business would have greater access to capital, an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders’ interests and the ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. 
 While we believe that our structure and our management team’s backgrounds will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view our status as a blank check company, our lack of an operating history and the potential need for us to seek stockholder approval of any proposed initial business combination, negatively. 
 We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) (a) December 31, 2026, (b) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.

  Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the last day of the most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last day of the most recently completed second fiscal quarter. 
 Financial Position 
 With funds available for a business combination initially in the amount of $306,469,291 (as of December 31, 2021) (assuming no redemptions), after payment of $11,112,500 of deferred underwriting fees, we offer a target business, such as Biote, a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. See “Business Combination” above for more information regarding the financing of and the agreements related to the Business Combination. 
Effecting Our Initial Business Combination 
 General 
 We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations until we consummate our initial business combination. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of the private placement warrants, the proceeds of any sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination (pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into following the consummation of our initial public offering or otherwise), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. We may, although we do not currently intend to, seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses. 
 Although our management has assessed and will continue to assess the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, including Biote, we cannot assure you that this assessment will result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely affect a target business. 
 We may need to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination, either because the transaction requires more cash than is available from the proceeds held in our trust account or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of the business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. There are no prohibitions on our ability to issue securities or incur debt in connection with our initial business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities, the incurrence of debt or otherwise. 
 See “Business Combination” above for more information regarding the financing of and the agreements related to the Business Combination.

  Sources of Target Businesses 
 Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may bring to our attention target business candidates of which they become aware through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have. In September 2021, we engaged Citigroup Global Markets Inc. as a placement agent and financial advisor, Truist Securities, Inc. as a placement agent and capital markets advisor, and William Blair & Company, L.L.C. as a placement agent, financial advisor and capital markets advisor, and in November 2021, we engaged Alvarium MB (US) BD, LLC as a placement agent and financial advisor, in each case, in connection with the Business Combination. We may also engage other professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of a finder’s fee is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. In no event, however, will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation by the company prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). 
 We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, or from completing the business combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, officers or directors. While Biote is not affiliated with our sponsor, officers, or directors, in the event we do not consummate the Business Combination and we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm, that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. 
 Evaluation of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination 
 In evaluating a prospective target business, such as Biote, we conduct a due diligence review which encompasses, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as applicable, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal, and other information which will be made available to us. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the business combination transaction. 
 The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. The company will not pay any consulting fees to members of our management team, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our initial business combination. 
 Lack of Business Diversification 
 For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may: 

• | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team 
 Although we closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business, including the management team of Biote, when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, and plan to continue to do so if the Business Combination is not consummated and we seek other business combination opportunities, our assessment of the target business’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination, including the Business Combination in which each of Andrew Heyer, Steven Heyer and Stephen Powell may continue as a director, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. No other key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. For more information, see the proxy statement we filed with the SEC on February 11, 2022, as amended. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.

  We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company, if the Business Combination is not consummated and we seek an initial business combination with a different target. 
 Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management. 
 Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination 
 We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule (as is the case with the Business Combination), or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. 
 Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction. 
 

Type of Transaction | WhetherStockholderApproval IsRequired | 
Purchase of assets | | No 
Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company | | No 
Merger of target into a subsidiary of the company | | No 
Merger of the company with a target | | Yes


Under Nasdaq’s listing rules, stockholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example: 
 

• | we issue shares of common stock that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of our shares of common stock then outstanding (other than in a public offering);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | any of our directors, officers or substantial shareholders (as defined by Nasdaq rules) has a 5% or greater interest earned on the trust account (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of common stock could result in an increase in outstanding common stock or voting power of 5% or more; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the issuance or potential issuance of common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control.

  Permitted Purchases of Our Securities 
 If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, initial stockholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will be restricted from making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. 
 In the event that our sponsor, initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. 
 The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the business combination or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrantholders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. 
 In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our Class A common stock or public warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. 
 Our sponsor, initial stockholders, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our initial stockholders, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by stockholders (in the case of Class A common stock) following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our initial business combination, whether or not such stockholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our initial business combination but only if such shares have not already been voted at the stockholder meeting related to our initial business combination. Our sponsor, executive officers, directors, advisors or any of their affiliates will select which stockholders to purchase shares from based on a negotiated price and number of shares and any other factors that they may deem relevant, and will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws. Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will be restricted from making purchases of shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. We expect any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchases are subject to such reporting requirements. 
 See “Business Combination” above for more information regarding the requisite approvals needed in the Business Combination. 
 Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination 
 We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, such as the Business Combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (net of permitted withdrawals), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account was approximately $10.00 per public share as of December 31, 2021. The per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our initial stockholders, sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares they may hold in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. 
 
11 

  Limitations on Redemptions 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. In addition, our proposed initial business combination may impose a minimum cash requirement for: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares in connection with such initial business combination, and all shares of Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. 
Manner of Conducting Redemptions 
 We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the initial business combination, such as the Business Combination, or (ii) without a stockholder vote by means of a tender offer if the Business Combination is not consummated. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed initial business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with Nasdaq’s shareholder approval rules. 
 The requirement that we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares by one of the two methods listed above will be contained in provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and will apply whether or not we maintain our registration under the Exchange Act or our listing on Nasdaq. Such provisions may be amended if approved by holders of 65% of our common stock entitled to vote thereon. 
 If we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares in connection with a stockholder meeting, we will: 
 

• | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------


If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the initial business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the Company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial stockholders will count towards this quorum and, pursuant to the letter agreement, our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to vote any founder shares they hold and any public shares purchased during or after our initial public offering (including in open market and privately-negotiated transactions) in favor of our initial business combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of common stock voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained. As a result, in addition to our initial stockholders’ founder shares, we would need only 11,906,251, or 37.5%, of the 31,750,000 public shares sold in our initial public offering to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have our initial business combination approved (assuming all outstanding shares are voted and the over-allotment option is not exercised). These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our initial stockholders, may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or whether they were a stockholder on the record date for the stockholder meeting held to approve the proposed transaction. 
 
12 

  If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will: 
 

• | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination, which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination. 
 Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, if we elect to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our Class A common stock in the open market, in order to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act. 
 We intend to require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to, at the holder’s option, either deliver their stock certificates to our transfer agent or deliver their shares to our transfer agent electronically using DWAC system, prior to the date set forth in the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable. In the case of proxy materials, this date may be up to two business days prior to the date on which the vote on the proposal to approve the initial business combination is to be held. In addition, if we conduct redemptions in connection with a stockholder vote, we intend to require a public stockholder seeking redemption of its public shares to also submit a written request for redemption to our transfer agent two business days prior to the vote in which the name of the beneficial owner of such shares is included. The proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. We believe that this will allow our transfer agent to efficiently process any redemptions without the need for further communication or action from the redeeming public stockholders, which could delay redemptions and result in additional administrative cost. If the proposed initial business combination is not approved and we continue to search for a target company, we will promptly return any certificates or shares delivered by public stockholders who elected to redeem their shares. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. In addition, our proposed initial business combination may impose a minimum cash requirement for: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed initial business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the initial business combination or redeem any shares in connection with such initial business combination, and all shares of Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. 
 See “Business Combination” above for more information regarding the requisite approvals needed in the Business Combination. 
 
13 

  Limitation on Redemption Upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination If We Seek Stockholder Approval 
 If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to Excess Shares, without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. 
 However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. 
 See “Business Combination” above for more information regarding the requisite approvals needed in the Business Combination. 
 Tendering Stock Certificates in Connection with the Exercise of Redemption Rights 
 If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection therewith pursuant to the tender offer rules, we may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemptions rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to, at the holder’s option, either tender their stock certificates to our transfer agent, or to deliver their shares to our transfer agent electronically using DWAC system, prior to the date set forth in the proxy material or tender documents, as applicable. In the case of proxy materials, this date may be up to two business days prior to the date on which the vote on the proposal to approve the initial business combination is to be held. In addition, if we conduct redemptions in connection with a stockholder vote, we intend to require a public stockholder seeking redemption of its public shares to also submit a written request for redemption to our transfer agent two business days prior to the vote in which the name of the beneficial owner of such shares is included. The proxy materials that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have up to two business days prior to the vote on the initial business combination to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that a stockholder fails to comply with these or any other procedures disclosed in the proxy its shares may not be redeemed. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares. 
 There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC system. The transfer agent will typically charge the broker submitting or tendering shares a fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to submit or tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. 
 Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination. 
 If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares. 
 
14 

  If the Business Combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete an initial business combination with a different target by March 4, 2023. 
 Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if No Initial Business Combination 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will have until March 4, 2023 to complete our initial business combination. If we do not complete our initial business combination by March 4, 2023, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (net of permitted withdrawals and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination by March 4, 2023. 
 Our initial stockholders, sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares they hold if we fail to complete our initial business combination by March 4, 2023. However, if our initial stockholders, sponsor or management team acquire public shares in or after our initial public offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination by March 4, 2023. 
 Our initial stockholders, sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a letter agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by March 4, 2023 or with respect to any other material provisions relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (net of permitted withdrawals), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement, we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. 
 If we do not consummate the Business Combination or any other business combination by the deadline set forth in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the approximately $130,359 of proceeds held outside the trust account as of December 31, 2021, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses. 
 If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account and any tax payments or expenses for the dissolution of the trust, the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than $10.00. Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.

  Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business (except for the independent registered public accountants) execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. The underwriters of our initial public offering will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than $10.00 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. 
 In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case less taxes payable, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.00 per share. 
 We have sought and will continue to seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We have access to up to approximately $130,359 from the proceeds of our initial public offering with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors. In the event that our offering expenses exceed our estimate of $1,000,000, we may fund such excess with funds from the funds not to be held in the trust account. In such case, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would decrease by a corresponding amount. Conversely, in the event that the offering expenses are less than our estimate of $1,000,000, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would increase by a corresponding amount.

  Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of the funds in our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination by March 4, 2023 may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. 
 Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of the funds in our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination by March 4, 2023, is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful (potentially due to the imposition of legal proceedings that a party may bring or due to other circumstances that are currently unknown), then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. If we do not complete our initial business combination by March 4, 2023, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (net of permitted withdrawals and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following our 24th month and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date. 
 Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, our sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay taxes and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. 
 If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.

  Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by March 4, 2023, (ii) in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by March 4, 2023 or with respect to any other material provisions relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of our initial business combination. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a stockholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. These provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, like all provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, may be amended with a stockholder vote. 
 Competition 
 In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, such as Biote, we may encounter competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other special purpose acquisition companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination. 
Employees 
 We currently have four executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. 
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 
 Our units, Class A common stock, and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. 
 We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may conduct an initial business combination with because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential business combination candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined above, or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.

  We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such business combination. 
 We have filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination. 
 We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) (a) December 31, 2026, (b) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of Class A common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.
