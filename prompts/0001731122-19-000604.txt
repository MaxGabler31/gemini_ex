Overview
 Xiamen Lutong International Travel Agency Co. Ltd. (the “Company”, “we”, “us”, “our” and similar terminology) was incorporated under the name “Highlight Networks, Inc.” in the state of Nevada on June 21, 2007. Our original plan was to engage in the business of planning, development and operation of both private and public access wireless broadband networks using WiFi (IEEE 802.11) and WiMAX (IEEE 802.16) wireless technologies. In 2013, the Company commenced a new business venture in recycling, refining, metals trading and assisting in metal recovery, with a focus on precious metals refining from electronic waste.
 On June 5, 2015, the Company experienced a change of control as a result of the purchase of 98% of its issued and outstanding capital stock from Infanto Holding Corp. by Legacy International Holdings Group, LLC and Allied Crown Enterprises Limited. The Company’s then operating subsidiary, EZ Recycling, Inc., was spun off and as a result the Company reverted to the shell company status.
 On January 29, 2018, pursuant to a stock purchase agreement dated January 26, 2018, Xiamen Lutong International Travel Agency Co., Ltd. (an entity controlled by Qiyi Zheng, the Company’s Chairman of the Board) purchased 57,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company, representing 98% of the outstanding voting securities of the Company. Following this change of control, the Company changed its name to Xiamen Lutong International Travel Agency Co., Ltd. and changed its business plan to engage in travel businesses in the People’s Republic of China. Such 98% interest in our company was subsequently transferred to Longhai Yougoubao Network Technology Co. Ltd., a related party also controlled by Mr. Zheng (“Longhai”).
 From June 2015 to date of this Report, the Company has not commenced its planned business and presently has no business operations, revenues or assets and thus is and has been a “shell company” as defined by Rule 405 of the Securities Act of 1993, as amended (the “Securities Act”). 
 Plan of Operation
 We plan to offer packaged tours and other travel-related services in the People’s Republic of China, initially in Fujian province, with a focus on developing, promoting and executing organized tours through our travel service stores. The packaged tours offer the benefits of pre-arranged itineraries, transportations, accommodations, entertainments, meals and tour guide services and cover domestic as well as international destinations. We plan to offer our travel products and services through our travel service stores as well as our website.
 We also plan to offer other travel-related services comprised mainly of sales of tourist attraction tickets, visa application services, financial services, hotel booking services, air ticketing services, train ticketing services, bus ticketing services, car rental services and insurance services. We will earn a commission or service fee on these services.
 We are presently evaluating the optimal corporate and legal structures in China necessary to establish our business there and as a U.S. publicly listed and reporting company. We do not have an established timetable to implement these plans, and until we do, we will remain a shell company.
