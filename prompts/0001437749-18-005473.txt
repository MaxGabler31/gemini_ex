ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 
We are a global medical device company founded as a Delaware corporation in 1998 and have our headquarters in Brisbane, California. We specialize in the design, development, manufacture, marketing and servicing of laser and other energy based aesthetics systems for practitioners worldwide. In addition, we distribute third-party sourced systems. We offer easy-to-use products based on the following key platforms: enlighten®, excel HR®, truSculpt®, excel V®, xeo®, Juliet®, and Secret RF— each of which enables physicians and other qualified practitioners to perform safe and effective aesthetic procedures for their customers. Each of our laser and other energy-based platforms consists of one or more hand pieces connected to a console that incorporates an intuitive user interface, a laser or other energy-based module, control system software and high voltage electronics. However, depending on the application, the laser or other energy-based module may reside in the hand piece itself.
 
Our trademarks include: “Cutera,” “Acutip,” “CoolGlide,” “enlighten,” “excel HR,” “excel V,” “GenesisPlus,” “Juliet,” “LimeLight,” “PicoGenesis,” “Titan,” “Pearl,” “truSculpt,” ”myQ,” and “xeo.” Our logo and our other trade names, trademarks and service marks appearing in this document are our property. Other trade names, trademarks and service marks appearing in this annual report on Form 10-K are the property of their respective owners. Solely for convenience, our trademarks and trade names referred to in this annual report on Form 10-K appear without the ™ or ® symbols, but those references are not intended to indicate, in any way, that we will not assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights, or the right of the applicable licensor to these trademarks and trade names.
 
A description of each of our hand pieces, and the aesthetic conditions they are designed to treat, is contained in the section below entitled “Products” and a summary of the features of our primary products is as follows:
 

● | Juliet – In December 2017, we made initial sales of the Juliet laser for vaginal health, a minimally invasive, no-downtime treatment that utilizes Er:YAG laser technology to deliver two modes of energy to the vaginal area. The first mode is ablative and stimulates collagen remodeling and the second mode is coagulative and induces hemostasis. As a result, patients experience improved sexual function and overall vaginal health with minimal downtime. Juliet addresses burning, itching, dryness and painful intercourse in the vaginal wall typically associated with diminished estrogen production resulting in symptoms associated with Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause. This product has a disposable tip, which must be changed for every procedure. As a result, the replacements of the tips results in recurring revenue.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Secret RF – In January 2018, we introduced a new fractional radio frequency (“RF”) microneedling device that delivers heat into the deeper layers of the skin using controlled RF energy. The targeted energy revitalizes, rebuilds and firms up tissue, effectively remodeling collagen, improving mild wrinkles and diminishing scars while leaving the outer layer of skin intact, minimizing downtime. Each time a procedure is performed, it requires the physician to use a new hand piece tip. The sale of the replacement results in recurring revenue.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | truSculpt –In May 2017 we introduced an advanced version of our truSculpt platform, the truSculpt 3D, for the non-surgical body sculpting market. It includes a consumable hand piece that needs to be "refilled" after a set number of treatments are performed, resulting in recurring revenue. This product is a high-powered RF system designed for deep tissue heating to treat all body areas and comes with two hand pieces versus a 40cm2 hand piece for larger body parts and a 16cm2 hand piece for smaller body parts. The truSculpt 3D delivers targeted energy at 2 MHz, which results in the uniform heating of the subcutaneous adipose tissue. It was primarily sold in the U.S. and Canada in 2017 and is planned to be sold to a broader international customer base in 2018. The original truSculpt platform was launched in August 2012 and delivered treatments at 1 MHz. In December 2016, the truSculpt platform received a 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) to market it for the temporary reduction in circumference of the abdomen.

● | enlighten – In December 2014, we introduced our enlighten laser platform with a dual wavelength (1064 nanometer, or “nm” + 532 nm) and in December 2016, we introduced a three wavelength model (1064 nm + 532 nm + 670 nm), enlighten III. The enlighten system is a dual pulse duration (750 picosecond, or “ps,” and 2 nanosecond, or “ns”) laser system and is cleared for multi-colored tattoo removal and for the treatment of benign pigmented lesions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | excel HR – In June 2014, we introduced our excel HR platform, a premium hair removal solution for all skin types, combining Cutera’s proven long-pulse 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser and a high-power 755 nm Alexandrite laser with sapphire contact cooling.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | excel V – In February 2011, we introduced our excel V platform, a high-performance, vascular and benign pigmented lesion treatment platform designed specifically for the core-market of dermatologists and plastic surgeons. This solid-state laser platform provides a combination of the 532 nm green laser with Cutera’s® award-winning 1064 nm Nd:YAG technology, to provide a single, compact and efficient system that treats the entire range of cosmetic vascular and benign pigmented lesion conditions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | xeo – In 2003, we introduced the xeo platform, which combines pulsed light technology with laser applications in a single system. The xeo is a multi-application platform on which a customer can purchase hand piece applications for the removal of unwanted hair, treatment of vascular lesions, and skin revitalization by treating discoloration, fine lines and laxity.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition to the above mentioned seven primary systems, we continue to generate revenue from our legacy products such as GenesisPlus, CoolGlide , and a third-party sourced system, myQ, for the Japanese market.
 
We offer our customers the ability to select the systems and applications that best fit their practice and to subsequently upgrade their systems to add new applications. This upgrade path allows our customers to cost-effectively build their aesthetic practices and provides us with a source of incremental revenue.
 
In addition to systems and upgrades, we generate revenue from the sale of post-warranty services, Titan and truSculpt 3D hand piece refills, and skincare products (Japanese market only). Commencing 2018, sale of replacement tips for Juliet and Secret RF are both expected to result in recurring revenue.
 
The Structure of Skin and Conditions that Affect Appearance
 
The skin is the body’s largest organ and is comprised of two layers: the epidermis and dermis. The epidermis is the outer layer, and serves as a protective barrier for the body. It contains cells that produce pigmentation, or skin color. The underlying layer of skin, the dermis, contains hair follicles and large and small blood vessels that are found at various depths below the epidermis. Collagen and elastin, also found within the dermis, provide strength and flexibility to the skin.
 
Many factors, such as advancing age, smoking, and sun damage, can result in aesthetically unpleasant changes in the appearance of the skin. These changes can include:
 

● | Undesirable hair growth; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Enlargement or swelling of blood vessels due to circulatory changes that become visible at the skin’s surface in the form of unsightly veins;
● | Deterioration of collagen, leading to uneven texture, wrinkles and skin laxity; and 
● | Uneven pigmentation or sun spots due to long-term sun exposure. 

 
In addition to these skin conditions, people seek to remove unwanted tattoos, as well as diminish fat in certain body areas in order to improve their appearance and confidence.
 
The Market for Non-Surgical Aesthetic Procedures
 
The market for non-surgical aesthetic procedures has grown significantly over the past several years. Medical Insight, an independent industry research and analysis firm, estimates that total sales of products in the global aesthetic market exceeded $8.4 billion in 2016 and expects total sales to increase 10.5% annually through 2021. For North America, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons estimates that there were over 13.9 million minimally-invasive aesthetic procedures performed in 2016, a 3% increase over 2015 and a 180% increase over 2000.
 
We believe there are several factors contributing to the global growth of aesthetic treatment procedures and aesthetic laser equipment sales, including:
 

● | Improved Economic Environment and Expanded Physician Base – The improvements in overall global economic conditions since the last recession have created increased demand for aesthetic procedures, which in turn has resulted in an expanding practitioner base to satisfy the demand. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Aging Demographics of Industrialized Countries – The aging population of industrialized countries, the amount of discretionary income available to the “baby boomer” demographic segment ─ ages 52 to 70 in 2017 ─ and their desire to retain a youthful appearance, contribute to the increased demand for aesthetic procedures.

● | Broader Range of Safe and Effective Treatments – Technical developments, as well as an increase in treatable conditions due to new product introductions, lead to safe, effective, easy-to-use and low-cost treatments with fewer side effects, resulting in broader adoption of aesthetic procedures by practitioners. In addition, technical advancements enable practitioners to offer a broader range of treatments. These technical developments reduce treatment and recovery times, which in turn lead to greater patient demand. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Broader Base of Customers – Managed care and government payor reimbursement restrictions motivate physicians to establish, or seek to expand, their elective aesthetic practices with procedures that are paid for directly by patients. As a result, in addition to core practitioners such as dermatologists and plastic surgeons, many other practitioners, such as gynecologists, family practitioners, primary care physicians, physicians performing aesthetic treatments in non-medical offices, and other qualified practitioners (“non-core practitioners”) expand their practices and offer aesthetic procedures.
● | Reductions in Cost per Procedure – Due in part to increased competition in the aesthetic market, the cost per procedure has been reduced in the past few years. This attracts a broader base of customers and patients seeking aesthetic procedures. 
● | Wide Acceptance of Aesthetic Procedures and Increased Focus on Body Image and Appearance – According to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery survey in 2016, both surgical and non-surgical procedures increased compared to 1997. Surgical procedures increased by 99%, while non-surgical procedures increased by 650% during the period. Broader social acceptance of aesthetic treatments, as well as increased popularity of social media platforms, also contribute to the growth in aesthetic procedures. 

Non-Surgical Aesthetic Procedures for Improving the Body and/or Skin’s Appearance and Their Limitations
 
Many alternative therapies are available for improving a person’s appearance by treating specific structures within the skin. These procedures utilize injections or abrasive agents to reach different depths of the dermis and the epidermis. In addition, non-invasive and minimally invasive treatments have been developed that employ laser and other energy-based technologies to achieve similar therapeutic results. Some of these common therapies and their limitations are described below.
 
Non-Invasive Body Contouring - Our radio-frequency technology based truSculpt system is designed for the non-invasive body contouring market. In performing the procedure, energy is applied to the body to achieve body sculpting and circumferential reduction through heating of the subcutaneous fat. In December 2016 we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA to market truSculpt for the temporary reduction in circumference of the abdomen. Drawbacks to this approach may include indurations that typically resolve over time, and the risk of burning the treatment area.
 
Tattoo removal – The most effective way to remove tattoos on the body is to utilize laser systems that deliver very short pulse durations with high peak power in order to break up the ink particles that comprise tattoos. According to a Tattoo Incidence Study published in ORC International in June 2015, up to 27% of Americans have one or more tattoos, and 1 in 4 tattoo bearing American adults have “tattoo regret”. Despite the effectiveness of lasers for tattoo removal, common complaints concerning laser tattoo removal include a low rate of complete clearance (sometimes no better than 50% after several treatments) as well as the high number of treatments for satisfactory clearance (often 10 or more treatments spaced four to eight weeks apart). However, the latest generation of tattoo removal lasers produce picosecond pulse durations, (pulses in the trillionths of a second) and thereby, can meaningfully improve tattoo clearance and reduce the total number of treatments.
 
Hair Removal – Techniques for hair removal include waxing, depilatories, tweezing, shaving, electrolysis, laser as well as other energy-based hair removal modalities. The only techniques that provide a long-lasting solution are electrolysis, laser, and other energy-based technology such as an Intense Pulsed Light (“IPL”). Electrolysis is usually painful, time-consuming and expensive for large areas, but is the most common method for removing light-colored hair. During electrolysis, an electrologist inserts a needle directly into a hair follicle and activates an electric current in the needle. Since electrolysis only treats one hair follicle at a time, the treatment of an area as small as an upper lip may require numerous visits and many hours of treatment. In addition, electrolysis can cause blemishes and infection related to needle use. In comparison, lasers can quickly treat large areas with a high degree of safety and efficacy.
 
Skin Rejuvenation – Skin rejuvenation treatments include a broad range of popular alternatives, including Botox and collagen injections, chemical peels, microdermabrasions, radio frequency treatments and lasers and other energy-based treatments. With these treatments, patients hope to improve overall skin tone and texture, reduce pore size, tighten skin and remove other signs of aging, including mottled pigmentation, diffuse redness and wrinkles. All of these procedures are temporary solutions and must be repeated within several weeks or months to sustain their effect, thereby increasing the cost and inconvenience to patients. For example, the body absorbs Botox and collagen, and patients require supplemental injections every three to six months to maintain the benefits of these treatments.
 
Other skin rejuvenation treatments, such as chemical peels and microdermabrasion, can have undesirable side effects. Chemical peels use acidic or caustic solutions to peel away the epidermis, and microdermabrasion generally utilizes sand crystals to resurface the skin. These techniques can lead to stinging, redness, irritation and scabbing. In addition, more serious complications, such as changes in skin color, can result from deeper chemical peels. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons estimates that approximately 4.6 million injections of Botox and 2.7 million injections of collagen and other soft-tissue fillers were administered in 2016.

Microneedling – (also known as collagen induction therapy) is a minimally invasive rejuvenation treatment that involves using fine needles to create hundreds of tiny, invisible puncture wounds in the top layer of the skin, which stimulates the body's natural wound healing processes, resulting in cell turnover and increased collagen and elastin production. Our recently introduced Secret RF product is a RF fractional microneedling system that helps deliver tailored energy to improve fine lines, wrinkles, and scars from the inside out.
 
Women’s Intimate Health – Our Juliet laser platform is an Erbium-YAG laser that emits light at a wavelength of 2940 nm and is used to address gynecologic health in postmenopausal women and treat symptoms associated with vaginal atrophy and vaginal relaxation syndrome. The application of the laser stimulates collagen and revitalizes the vaginal tissue.
 
Leg and Facial Veins – Current aesthetic treatment methods for leg and facial veins include sclerotherapy, as well as laser and other energy-based treatments. With these treatments, patients seek to eliminate visible veins, and improve overall skin appearance. Sclerotherapy requires a skilled practitioner to inject a saline or detergent-based solution into the target vein, which breaks down the vessel causing it to collapse and be absorbed into the body. The need to correctly position the needle on the inside of the vein makes it difficult to treat smaller veins, which limits the treatment of facial vessels and small leg veins. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons estimates that approximately 270,000 sclerotherapy procedures were performed in 2016.
 
Laser and other energy-based non-surgical treatments for hair removal, veins, skin rejuvenation and body contouring are discussed in the following section and in the section entitled “Our Applications and Procedures” below.
 
Laser and Other Energy-Based Aesthetic Treatments
 
Laser and other energy-based aesthetic treatments can achieve therapeutic results by affecting structures within the skin. The development of safe and effective aesthetic treatments has resulted in a well-established market for these procedures.
 
Practitioners can use laser and other energy-based technologies to selectively target hair follicles, veins or collagen in the dermis, as well as cells responsible for pigmentation in the epidermis, without damaging surrounding tissue. Practitioners can also use these technologies to safely remove portions of the epidermis and deliver heat to the dermis as a means of generating new collagen growth. Ablative skin resurfacing improves the appearance of the skin by removing the outer layers of the skin. Ablative skin resurfacing procedures are considered invasive or minimally invasive, depending on how much of the epidermis is removed during a treatment. Non-ablative skin resurfacing improves the appearance of the skin by treating the underlying structure of the skin.
 
Safe and effective laser and energy-based treatments require an appropriate combination of the following four parameters:
  

● | Energy Level – the amount of light or radio frequency emitted to heat a target; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Pulse Duration – the time interval over which the energy is delivered; 
● | Spot Size or Electrode Size – the diameter of the energy beam, which affects treatment depth and area; and 
● | Wavelength or Frequency – the position in the electromagnetic spectrum which impacts the absorption and the effective depth of the energy delivered.

 
For example, in the case of hair removal, by utilizing the correct combination of these parameters, a practitioner can use a laser or other light source to selectively target melanin within the hair follicle to absorb the laser energy and destroy the follicle, without damaging other delicate structures in the surrounding tissue.

Control Console
 
Our control console includes an intuitive user interface, control system software and high voltage electronics. All CoolGlide systems, GenesisPlus, excel V and some models of the xeo platform include our laser module which consists of electronics, a visible aiming beam, a focusing lens, and an Nd:YAG and/or flashlamp laser that functions at wavelengths that permit penetration over a wide range of depths and is effective across all skin types. Our excel HR system also includes an Nd:YAG laser as well as a 755nm alexandrite laser to allow treatment on a variety of skin types. The interface allows the practitioner to set the appropriate laser or flashlamp parameters for each procedure through a user-friendly format. The control system software ensures that the operator’s instructions are properly communicated from the graphic user interface to the other components within the system. Our high voltage electronics produce over 20,000 watts of peak laser power, which permits therapeutic effects at short pulse durations. The control system software is designed to ensure that the operator’s instructions are properly communicated from the graphical user interface to the other components within the system and includes real-time calibration to control the output energy as the pulse is delivered during the treatment. The enlighten consoles contain an innovative Nd:YAG laser engine that produces high-energy, picosecond and nanosecond laser pulses for up to three laser wavelengths. This allows the user to quickly change laser treatment parameters during treatment through a touchscreen interface without changing external hardware such as hand pieces. Our truSculpt control console includes a high-powered, mono-polar RF generator at 1 and 2 MHz capable of delivering up to 300 watts of power. The Secret RF control console includes an RF card and is capable of delivering up to 75 watts of energy. The truSculpt and Secret RF systems dynamically adjusts current, voltage and power during treatment as needed to reach and maintain the appropriate treatment levels Our Juliet system consists on an Er:YAG laser at 2940nm with an intuitive user interface and software control for ease of use. 
Hand Pieces
 
enlighten Hand Piece – The enlighten hand piece delivers 532 nm, 670 nm (in enlighten III only), and 1064 nm laser energy to treat benign pigmented lesions and remove multi-color tattoos. enlighten’s single hand piece consists of an energy-delivery component housing a motorized focus lens assembly connected to an articulated arm. The hand piece features spot size adjustability from 2 to 8mm, adjustable in 1 mm increments. As with all Cutera laser and light-based systems, the power calibration is automatic and built into the laser system, rather than requiring manual power calibration through a separate calibration port for the hand piece.
 
excel HR Hand Piece – The dual wavelength excel HR system introduced in June 2014 delivers 1064 nm and 755 nm laser energy to the treatment area for hair removal. excel HR’s single hand piece consists of an energy-delivery component housing an optical fiber and lens. The hand piece features a sapphire window and peripheral cooling plate with temperature monitoring. The sapphire window extracts up to 35 watts of heat with user selectable settings ranging from 4 to 20 degrees centigrade and provides cooling of the skin before, during, and immediately after each laser pulse. This “pre, parallel, and post” cooling provides an anesthetic benefit that makes treatments more comfortable than systems without contact cooling, and also increases the safety profile of treatments by reducing the chances of hypo- and hyper-pigmentation, as well as burns to the skin. The hand piece has a wide spot-size range between 3 to 18 mm (5 to 18 mm, alexandrite mode).
 
truSculpt Hand Pieces – The truSculpt, originally introduced in August 2012, and truSculpt 3D, introduced in May 2017, are used for the non-invasive heating of subcutaneous tissue as well as the temporary reduction in circumference. We sell two different truSculpt hand pieces: 40 cm 2 for larger body parts and the 16cm 2 for smaller parts of the body. Each of the truSculpt hand pieces are light weight and ergonomically designed for operator comfort, which allows for uniform distribution of heat delivered by the hand pieces. In addition, the hand pieces have a built-in, real time, temperature sensing system to monitor the temperature during the treatment. The truSculpt 3D hand pieces require a periodic “refilling” process, which provides us with a source of recurring revenue.
 
excel V Hand Piece – The excel V system introduced in February 2011 delivers 1064 nm and 532 nm laser energy to the skin for the treatment of vascular and benign pigmented lesion. The excel V system supports two hand pieces, both consisting of an energy-delivery component housing an optical fiber and lens. One hand piece includes a sapphire window cooling plate with temperature monitoring. This hand piece offers a spot size range from 2 to 12 mm in 0.1 mm increments, and is capable of delivering either the 1064 nm or 532 nm laser energy. The second hand piece does not have a cooling plate and includes a non-contact temperature sensor to monitor the treatment area temperature. In addition, this second hand piece includes dual aiming beams that facilitate consistent treatments by maintaining the correct distance of the hand piece to the skin to ensure that the fixed 8 mm spot size is maintained.
 
1064 nm Nd:YAG Hand Piece – Our 1064nm Nd:YAG hand piece delivers laser energy to the treatment area for hair removal, leg and facial vein treatment, and skin rejuvenation procedures to treat skin texture and fine lines. The 1064nm Nd:YAG hand piece consists of an energy-delivery component, consisting of an optical fiber and lens, and a copper cooling plate with embedded temperature monitoring. The hand piece weighs approximately 14 ounces, which is light enough to be held with one hand. The lightweight nature and ergonomic design of the hand piece allows the device to be operated without user fatigue. The design permits the practitioner an unobstructed view of the treatment area, which reduces the possibility of unintended damage to the skin and can increase the speed of treatment. The 1064nm Nd:YAG hand piece also incorporates our cooling system, providing integrated pre- and post-treatment cooling of the treatment area through a temperature-controlled copper plate to protect the outer layer of the skin. 
 
GenesisPlus Hand Piece – Our GenesisPlus system, launched in 2010, delivers 1064 nm laser energy to the treatment area for the temporary increase of clear nail in patients with onychomycosis and for the treatment of fine wrinkles, diffuse redness and rosacea. This lightweight 1064nm Nd:YAG hand piece consists of an energy-delivery component, housing an optical fiber and lens. The hand piece includes a non-contact temperature sensor to monitor the treatment area temperature. In addition, the hand piece includes dual aiming beams that facilitate consistent treatments by maintaining the correct distance of the hand piece to the skin. This hand piece offers a single 5 mm spot size.

Pulsed Light Hand Piece – The ProWave 770, ProWave LX, AcuTip 500, and LimeLight hand pieces are designed to produce a pulse of light over a wavelength spectrum to treat discoloration such as age and sun spots and other dyschromia. The hand pieces can also be used for hair removal, and treatment of superficial facial vessels. The hand pieces each consist of a custom flashlamp, proprietary wavelength filter, closed-loop power control and embedded temperature monitor, and weigh approximately 13 ounces. The filter in the AcuTip 500 eliminates long and short wavelengths, transmitting only the therapeutic range required for safe and effective treatment. The filter in ProWave 770, ProWave LX, and LimeLight eliminates short wavelengths, allowing longer wavelengths to be transmitted to the treatment area. In addition, the wavelength spectrum of the ProWave 770 and the LimeLight can be shifted based on the setting of the control console. Our power control includes a monitoring system to ensure that the desired energy level is delivered. The hand pieces protect the epidermis by regulating the temperature of the hand piece window through the embedded temperature monitor. These hand pieces are available on the xeo platform.
 
Titan Hand Piece – The Titan hand pieces are designed to produce a sustained pulse of light over a wavelength spectrum tailored to induce heating in the dermis. We are aware that some practitioners use the Titan hand piece to treat skin laxity (although the hand piece is cleared in the U.S. by the FDA only for deep dermal heating). The hand piece consists of a custom light source, proprietary wavelength filter, closed-loop power control, sapphire cooling window and embedded temperature monitor, and weighs approximately three pounds. The temperature of the epidermis is controlled by using a sapphire window to provide cooling before, during and after the delivery of energy to the treatment site. The Titan hand piece requires a periodic “refilling” process, which includes the replacement of the optical source, after a set number of pulses have been used. This provides us with a source of recurring revenue.
 
Pearl Hand Piece – The Pearl hand piece, introduced in 2007, is designed to treat fine lines, uneven texture and dyschromia through the application of proprietary YSGG laser technology. This hand piece can safely remove a small portion of the epidermis, while coagulating the remaining epidermis, leading to new collagen growth. The Pearl hand piece consists of a custom monolithic laser source, scanner and power monitoring electronics. The scanner includes multiple scan patterns to allow simple and fast treatments of the face. The hand piece includes an attachment for a smoke evacuator, allowing the practitioner to use one hand during treatment.
 
Pearl Fractional Hand Piece – The Pearl Fractional hand piece, introduced in 2008, also uses proprietary YSGG technology and is designed to treat wrinkles and deep dermal imperfections (although it is cleared in the U.S. by the FDA only for skin resurfacing and coagulation). This hand piece penetrates the deep dermis producing a series of micro-columns across the skin, which can result in the removal of damaged tissue and the production of new collagen. The Pearl Fractional hand piece consists of a custom monolithic laser source, scanner and power monitoring electronics. The scanner includes multiple scan patterns to allow simple and fast treatments of the face. The hand piece includes an attachment for a smoke evacuator, allowing the practitioner to use one hand during treatment.
 
My Juliet and Microspot Hand Pieces – The My Juliet and Microspot hand pieces are part of the Juliet system for vaginal wellness. The Juliet is an Er:YAG laser, with a 2940 nm wavelength. The My Juliet hand piece is a single use disposable hand piece designed to treat the vaginal cavity by delivering laser energy to the tissues. The hand piece is rotated, first delivering an ablative pulse and followed by a thermal pulse inducing collagen and vascularization in the area. The Microspot hand piece delivers fractionated energy to treat the vaginal and vulvar areas to induce skin resurfacing and improve skin quality, tone and texture. As both hand pieces are for a single use application, they provide us with a source of recurring revenue.
 
Secret RF Hand Pieces – The Secret RF fractional RF microneedling system has two distinct hand pieces and treatment tips. The 64-pin hand piece is utilized for the body, while the 25-pin hand piece is ideal for treating the face. Both hand pieces support microneedles that are insulated or semi-insulated and inserted into the skin, delivering energy subdermally to the selected depth (0.5-3mm). Delivering the energy subdermally spares the epidermis, minimizing patient downtime and provides the ability to customize treatment based on skin types. Both hand pieces are for a single use application, providing a source of recurring revenue.

Hand Piece Refills
 
We treat our customer’s purchase of replacement Titan and truSculpt 3D hand pieces as “refill” revenue, which provides us with a source of recurring revenue from existing customers. Our recently launched Juliet and Secret RF products have single use disposable tips which need to be replaced after every treatment. Sale of these consumable tips further enhance our recurring revenue stream. Hand piece refills of our legacy truSculpt product are included in the standard warranty and service contract offerings for this product.
Skincare
 
We distribute ZO Skin Health, Inc.’s (“ZO”) physician-dispensed, topical skincare products to physicians in the Japanese market.
 
Our Applications and Procedures
 
Our products are designed to allow the practitioner to select an appropriate combination of energy level, spot size and pulse duration for each treatment. The ability to manipulate the combinations of these parameters allows our customers to treat the broadest range of conditions available with a single energy-based system.
 
Non-Invasive Body Contouring – Our truSculpt technology allows practitioners to apply a hand piece directly to the skin and deliver high-powered RF energy that results in the deep and uniform heating of the subcutaneous fat tissue at sustained therapeutic temperatures. This heating can cause selective destruction of fat cells, which are eliminated from the treatment area through the body’s natural wound healing processes. The treatment takes approximately 45 minutes and two or more treatments may be required to obtain the desired aesthetic results. Our CE Mark allows us to market the truSculpt in the European Union, Australia and certain other countries outside the U.S. for fat reduction, body shaping, body contouring and circumferential reduction. In the U.S., truSculpt has 510(k) clearance for the temporary reduction in circumference of the abdomen, and elevating tissue temperature for the treatment of selected medical conditions such as relief of pain, muscle spasms, increase in local circulation, and the temporary improvement in the appearance of cellulite.
 
Tattoo Removal – Our enlighten systems, delivering picosecond and nanosecond pulse duration, and our myQ Q-switched laser are used for tattoo removal, the treatment of benign pigmented lesions, and a laser skin toning procedure that we refer to as PicoGenesis.
 
Hair Removal – Our laser technology allows our customers to treat all skin types and hair thicknesses. Our 1064 nm Nd:YAG and 755 nm Alexandrite lasers permits energy to safely penetrate through the epidermis of any skin type and into the dermis where the hair follicle is located. Using the universal graphic user interface on our control console, the practitioner sets parameters to deliver therapeutic energy with a large spot size and variable pulse durations, allowing the practitioner to treat fine or coarse hair. Our 1064nm Nd:YAG and 755 nm Alexandrite hand pieces on excel HR allow our customers to treat all skin types, while our ProWave 770 and ProWave LX hand pieces on the xeo, with pulsed light technology, treat the majority of skin types quickly and effectively.
 
For hair removal treatments, the treatment site on the skin is first cleaned and shaved. The practitioner then applies a thin layer of gel to improve contact and aid gliding of the hand piece across the skin. In the case of these hand pieces, delivery of light which is converted to heat destroys the hair follicles and prevents hair re-growth. This procedure is then repeated at the next treatment site on the body, and can be done in a gliding motion to increase treatment speed. Patients receive three to six treatments on average. Each treatment can take between five minutes to one hour depending on the size of the area and the condition being treated. On average, there are six to eight weeks between treatments.
 
Vascular Lesions – Our laser technology allows our customers to treat the widest range of aesthetic vein conditions, including spider and reticular veins and small facial veins. Our xeo 1064nm Nd:YAG hand piece with adjustable spot sizes of 3, 5, 7 or 10 millimeters and the excel V 1064 nm and 532 nm hand piece with adjustable spot sizes from 2 to 12 mm, each allow the practitioner to control treatment depth to target different sized veins. Selection of the appropriate energy level and pulse duration ensures effective treatment of the intended target. The laser hand piece is used to cool the treatment area both before and after the laser pulse has been applied. With the excel V hand piece the cooling can be performed before, during and after delivery of the laser pulse. The delivered energy damages the vein and, over time, it is absorbed by the body. Patients receive on average between one and six treatments, with six weeks or longer between treatments.
 
Skin Rejuvenation – Our Nd:YAG laser, picosecond laser and other energy-based technologies allow our customers to perform non-invasive and minimally-invasive treatments that reduce redness, dyschromia, fine lines and wrinkles, improve skin texture, and treat other aesthetic conditions.
 
Our recently launched Juliet laser is used to address gynecologic health in postmenopausal women and treat symptoms associated with vaginal atrophy and vaginal relaxation syndrome. The application of the laser stimulates collagen and revitalizes the vaginal tissue. The My Juliet hand piece is rotated, first delivering an ablative pulse and followed by a thermal pulse inducing collagen and vascularization in the area. The Microspot hand piece delivers fractionated energy to treat the vaginal and vulvar area to induce skin resurfacing and improving skin quality, tone and texture.
 
 12


Texture, Lines and Wrinkles – When using a 1064nm Nd:YAG laser to improve skin texture and treat fine lines, cooling is not applied and the hand piece is held directly above the skin. A large number of pulses are directed at the treatment site, repeatedly covering an area, such as the cheek. By delivering many pulses of laser light to a treatment area, a gentle heating of the dermis occurs and collagen growth is stimulated to rejuvenate the skin and reduce wrinkles. Patients typically receive four to six treatments for this procedure. The treatment typically takes less than a half hour with a spacing of two to four weeks between treatments.
 
When treating texture and fine lines with a Pearl hand piece, the hand piece is held at a controlled distance from the skin and the scanner delivers a preset pattern of spots to the treatment area. Cooling is not applied to the epidermis during the treatment. The energy delivered by the hand piece ablates a portion of the epidermis while leaving a coagulated portion that will gently peel off over the course of a few days. Heat is also delivered into the dermis, which can result in the production of new collagen. Treatment of the full face can usually be performed in 15 to 30 minutes. Patients receive on average between one and three treatments at monthly intervals.
 
When treating wrinkles and deep dermal imperfections with a Pearl Fractional hand piece, the hand piece is held at a controlled distance from the skin and the scanner delivers a preset pattern of spots to the treatment area. Cooling is not applied to the epidermis during the treatment. The energy delivered by the hand piece penetrates the deep dermis producing a series of micro-columns across the skin, which can result in the removal of damaged tissue and the production of new collagen. Treatment of the full face can usually be performed in less than an hour. Patients receive on average between one and three treatments at monthly intervals.
 
Our CE Mark allows us to market Pearl Fractional in the European Union, Australia and certain other countries outside the U.S. for the treatment of wrinkles and deep dermal imperfections. However, in the U.S. we have a 510(k) clearance only for skin resurfacing and coagulation.
 
Our recently launched Secret RF product is a fractional RF microneedling system that utilizes microneedles to deliver heat into the deeper layers of the skin using controlled RF energy. The targeted energy revitalizes, rebuilds and firms up tissue, effectively remodeling collagen, improving mild wrinkles and diminishing scars while leaving the outer layer of skin intact, minimizing downtime. 
 
Dyschromia – Our pulsed-light technologies allow our customers to safely and effectively treat red and brown dyschromia (skin discoloration), benign pigmented lesions, and rosacea. The practitioner delivers a narrow spectrum of light to the surface of the skin through our LimeLight hand pieces. These hand pieces include one of our proprietary wavelength filters, which reduce the energy level required for therapeutic effect and minimize the risk of skin injury.
 
The 532 nm wavelength green laser option of the excel V and enlighten systems, as well as the 755 nm infrared wavelength of the excel HR, can be used to treat benign pigmented lesions in substantially the same way as described above with the pulsed light devices.
 
In treating benign pigmented lesions, the hand piece is placed directly on the skin and then the pulse is triggered. The cells forming the pigmented lesion absorb the light energy, darken and then flake off over the course of two to three weeks. Several treatments may be required to completely remove the lesion. The treatment takes a few minutes per area treated and there are typically three to four weeks between treatments.
  
Practitioners can also treat dyschromia and other skin conditions with our Pearl hand piece. During these treatments, the heat delivered by the Pearl hand piece will remove the outer layer of the epidermis while coagulating a portion of the epidermis. That coagulated portion will gently peel off over the course of a few days, revealing a new layer of skin underneath. Treatment of the full face can usually be performed in 15 to 30 minutes. Patients receive on average between one and three treatments at monthly intervals.
 
Skin Quality – Our Titan technology allows our customers to use deep dermal heating to tighten lax skin. The practitioner delivers a spectrum of light to the skin through our Titan hand piece. This hand piece includes our proprietary light source and wavelength filter which tailors the delivered spectrum of light to provide heating at the desired depth in the skin.
 
In treating compromised, skin the hand piece is placed directly on the skin and then the light pulse is triggered. A sustained pulse causes significant heating in the dermis. This heating can cause immediate collagen contraction while also stimulating long-term collagen regrowth. Several treatments may be required to obtain the desired degree of tightening of the skin. The treatment of a full face can take over an hour and there are typically four weeks between treatments.
 
Our CE Mark allows us to market the Titan in the European Union, Australia and certain other countries outside the U.S. for the treatment of wrinkles through skin tightening. However, in the U.S. we have a 510(k) clearance for only deep dermal heating.

Sales and Marketing
 
In the U.S. we market and sell our products through a direct sales organization. We internally manage our U.S. and Canadian sales organization as one North American sales region. As of December 31, 2017, we had 58 territories and a direct sales force of 68 employees.
 
International sales are made both through a worldwide distributor network in over 40 countries, as well as a direct international sales force. As of December 31, 2017, we had a direct sales force in Australia, Belgium, France, Hong Kong, Japan, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom with a total of 34 direct sales employees. Our international revenue as a percentage of total revenue represented 38% in 2017, 45% in 2016, and 48% in 2015.
 
We also sell certain items like Hand Piece Refills and marketing brochures through our web site www.cutera.com.
 
Customers generally demand quality, performance, ease of use, and high productivity in relation to the cost of ownership. We respond to these customer demands by introducing new products focused on these requirements in the markets we serve. Specifically, we believe that we introduce new products and applications that are innovative, address the specific aesthetic procedures in demand, and are upgradeable on our customers’ existing systems. In addition, we provide attractive upgrade pricing to new product families. To increase market penetration, we also market to non-core practitioners in addition to our core specialties of plastic surgeons and dermatologists.
 
We seek to establish strong ongoing relationships with our customers through the upgradeability of our products, sales of extended service contracts, the refilling of hand pieces and replacement of disposable tips, ongoing training and support, and distributing skincare products in Japan. We primarily target our marketing efforts to practitioners through office visits, workshops, trade shows, webinars and trade journals. We also market to potential patients through brochures, workshops and our website. In addition, we offer clinical forums with recognized expert panelists to promote advanced treatment techniques using our products to further enhance customer loyalty and uncover new sales opportunities.
 
Competition
 
Our industry is subject to intense competition. Our products compete against conventional non-energy-based treatments, such as electrolysis, Botox and collagen injections, chemical peels, microdermabrasion and sclerotherapy. Our products also compete against laser and other energy-based products offered by other public companies, such as Hologic (acquired Cynosure in March 2017), El.En S.p.A, XIO Group (acquired Lumenis in September 2015), Allergan (acquired Zeltiq in April 2017), Valeant (acquired Solta in January 2014), as well as private companies, including Sisram, Syneron Candela (acquired in 2017 by an affiliate of private equity funds advised by Apax Partners), Sciton, and several others.
 
Competition among providers of laser and other energy-based devices for the aesthetic market is characterized by extensive research and development efforts, and innovative technology. While we attempt to protect our products through patents and other intellectual property rights, there are few barriers to entry that would prevent new entrants or existing competitors from developing products that would compete directly with ours. There are many companies, both public and private, that are developing innovative devices that use both energy-based and alternative technologies. Some of these competitors have greater resources than we do or product applications for certain sub-markets in which we do not participate. Additional competitors may enter the market, and we are likely to compete with new companies in the future. To compete effectively, we have to demonstrate that our products are attractive alternatives to other devices and treatments by differentiating our products on the basis of performance, brand name, service and price. We have encountered, and expect to continue to encounter, potential customers who, due to existing relationships with our competitors, are committed to, or prefer, the products offered by these competitors. Competitive pressures may result in price reductions and reduced margins for our products.
  
Research and Development
 
Our research and development group develops new products and applications that address unmet or underserved market needs. As of December 31, 2017, our research and development activities were conducted by a staff of 28 employees with a broad base of experience in lasers, optoelectronics, software, and other related disciplines. We develop working relationships with outside contract engineering and design consultants, giving our team additional technical and creative breadth. We work closely with thought leaders and customers, to understand unmet needs and emerging applications in aesthetic medicine. Research and development expenses were approximately $12.9 million in 2017, $11.2 million in 2016, and $10.7 million in 2015.
 
Acquisitions and Investments
 
Our strategy of providing a broad range of therapeutic capabilities requires a wide variety of technologies, products and capabilities. The rapid pace of technological development in the aesthetic device industry and the specialized expertise required in different areas make it difficult for us to develop a broad portfolio of technological solutions. In addition to internally generated growth through research and development efforts, we have considered, and expect to continue to consider, acquisitions, investments and alliances to provide access to new products and technologies in both new and existing markets.
 
 14


We expect to further our strategic objectives and strengthen our existing businesses by making future acquisitions or investments in areas that we believe we can acquire or stimulate the development of new technologies and products. Mergers and acquisitions of medical technology companies are inherently risky and no assurance can be given that any acquisition will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our consolidated operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.
 
Service and Support
 
Our products are engineered to enable quick and efficient service and support. There are several separate components of our products, each of which can easily be removed and replaced. We believe that quick and effective delivery of service is important to our customers. As of December 31, 2017, we had 56 people in our global service department. Internationally, we provide direct service support through our Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and Switzerland offices. We work with third-party service providers in Spain and the U.K, and also through a network of distributors in over 40 countries.
 
We provide a standard one-year warranty coverage for all of our systems. We provide initial warranties on our products to cover parts and service and offer extended service plans that vary by the type of product and the level of service desired. From time to time, we also have promotions whereby we include a post-warranty service contract with the sale of our products. Customers are notified before their initial warranty expires and are able to purchase extended service plans covering replacement parts and labor.
 
In countries where we are represented by distributor partners, customers are serviced through the distributor. Distributors are generally provided 14 to 16 months warranty coverage for parts only, with labor customarily provided to the end customer by the distributor.
 
In the event a customer does not purchase an extended service plan, we offer to service the customer’s system and charge the customer for time and materials. 
 
Our Titan and truSculpt 3D hand pieces generally include a warranty for a set number of shots, instead of for a period of time.
 
Manufacturing
 
We manufacture our products with components and subassemblies supplied by vendors. We assemble and test each of our products at our Brisbane, California facility. Quality control, cost reduction and inventory management are top priorities of our manufacturing operations.
 
We purchase certain components and subassemblies from a limited number of suppliers. We have flexibility with our suppliers to adjust the number of components and subassemblies as well as the delivery schedules. The forecasts we use are based on historical demands and sales projections. Lead times for components and subassemblies may vary significantly depending on the size of the order, time required to fabricate and test the components or subassemblies, specific supplier requirements, and current market demand for the same or similar components and subassemblies. We reduce the potential for supply disruption by maintaining sufficient inventories and identifying additional suppliers. The time required to qualify new suppliers for some components, or to redesign them, could cause delays in our manufacturing. To date, we have not experienced significant delays in obtaining any of our components or subassemblies.
 
We are required to manufacture our products in compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (or “QSR”). The QSR covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage and shipping of our products. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic unannounced inspections. We had an FDA full quality system audit in March 2017. There were no significant findings or observations as a result of this audit. Failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shutdown of our manufacturing operations and the recall of our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. In the event that one of our suppliers fails to maintain compliance with our quality requirements, we may have to qualify a new supplier and could experience manufacturing delays as a result. We have opted to maintain quality assurance and quality management certifications to enable us to market our products in the U.S., the member states of the European Union (“EU”), the European Free Trade Association and countries which have entered into Mutual Recognition Agreements with the EU. In January 2018, we conducted our recertification audit to the requirements of ISO 13485:2003 under the Medical Device Single Audit Program (“MDSAP”) for the 5 regulatory jurisdictions signatory to MDSAP (FDA - US, Health Canada - Canada, Therapeutic Goods Administration (“TGA”) - Australia, Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (“PMDA”) - Japan, and Agência Nacional de Vigilancia Sanitária  (“ANVISA”) - Brazil); and for the EU under Europäische Norm (“EN”) International Standards Organization (“ISO”) 13485:2012 and Medical Device Directive (MDD”) 93/42/EEC. We passed the recertification audit establishing compliance with ISO 13485:2003 under MDSAP; EN ISO 13458:2012; and MDD 93/42/EEC. The MDSAP and EU certification can be used to establish compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”), QSR, and Quality Management System (“QMS”) requirements for all six regulatory jurisdictions, replacing routine audits from each regulatory jurisdiction. Our manufacturing facility is ISO 13485 certified.

Patents and Proprietary Technology
 
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, and non-disclosure, confidentiality and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. As of February 28, 2018, we had 33 issued U.S. patents and 5 pending U.S. patent applications. In the U.S. and several foreign countries, we register our Company name and several of our product names as trademarks, including Cutera, Acutip 500, CoolGlide, excel, enlighten, Juliet, Limelight, myQ, Pearl, ProWave 770, ProWave LX, Secret RF, Solera (discontinued as of January 2018), Titan, truSculpt, and xeo. We may have common law rights in other product names, including excel V, Pearl Fractional, Solera, Titan and excel HR. We intend to file for additional patents and trademarks to continue to strengthen our intellectual property rights.
 
We licensed certain patents from Palomar (acquired by Cynosure in 2013) and paid ongoing royalties based on sales of applicable hair removal products. The royalty rate on these products ranged from 3.75% to 7.50% of revenue from sales of products that incorporate the licensed patents. The remaining U.S. patents expired in February 2015 and the remaining international patents expired in February 2016. As a result, all our revenue from February 2016 onwards is not subject to these royalties. Our revenue from systems that do not include hair removal capabilities (such as excel V, enlighten, GenesisPlus, myQ, Solera, Titan, and xeo), as well as revenues from service contracts and skincare products, were not subject to these royalties.
  
We rely on non-disclosure and non-competition agreements with employees, technical consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary technology. We also require them to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived in connection with the relationship. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge.
 
For additional information, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under the section entitled “Risk Factors - Intellectual property rights may not provide adequate protection for some or all of our products, which may permit third parties to compete against us more effectively, and [w]e may be involved in future costly intellectual property litigation, which could impact our future business and financial performance.”
 
Government Regulation
 
United States
 
Our products are medical devices subject to regulation by numerous government agencies, including the FDA and counterpart agencies outside the United States. To varying degrees, each of these agencies require us to comply with laws and regulations governing the research, development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, pre-market clearance or approval, marketing, distribution, advertising, promotion, record keeping, reporting, tracking, and importing and exporting of medical devices. In the Unites States, FDA regulations govern the following activities that we perform and will continue to perform to ensure that medical products distributed domestically or exported internationally are safe and effective for their intended uses:

● | product design and development; 
--+------------------------------------
● | product testing; 
● | product manufacturing; 
● | product safety; 
● | product labeling; 
● | product storage; 
● | record keeping; 
● | pre-market clearance or approval; 
● | advertising and promotion; 
● | production; 
● | product sales and distribution; and
● | complaint handling. 

FDA’s Pre-market Clearance and Approval Requirements
 
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we wish to commercially distribute in the U.S. will require either prior 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval from the FDA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose lower risks are placed in either class I or II, which requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a pre-market notification requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. This process is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Some low risk devices are exempted from this requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in class III, requiring pre-market approval. All of our current products are class II devices.
 
 16


510(k) Clearance Pathway
 
When a 510(k) clearance is required, we must submit a pre-market notification demonstrating that our proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of Pre-Market Approval, or PMA, applications. By regulation, the FDA is required to clear or deny a 510(k), pre-market notification within 90 days of submission of the application. As a practical matter, clearance often takes significantly longer. The FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. Laser devices used for aesthetic procedures, such as hair removal, have generally qualified for clearance under 510(k) procedures.
 
The following table details the indications for which we received a 510(k) clearance for our products and when these clearances were received.

Pre-Market Approval (“PMA”) Pathway
 
A PMA must be submitted to the FDA if the device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process. A PMA must be supported by extensive data, including but not limited to, technical, preclinical, clinical trials, manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. No device that we have developed to date has required pre-market approval, although development of future devices or indications may require pre-market approval.
 
Product Modifications
 
We have modified aspects of our products since receiving regulatory clearance, but we believe that new 510(k) clearances are not required for these modifications. After a device receives 510(k) clearance or a PMA, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new clearance or approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with our determination not to seek a new 510(k) clearance or PMA, the FDA may retroactively require us to seek 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval. The FDA could also require us to cease marketing and distribution and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
Clinical Trials
 
When FDA approval of a class I, class II or class III device requires human clinical trials, and if the device presents a “significant risk,” as defined by the FDA, to human health, the device sponsor is required to file an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, application with the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to commencing the human clinical trial. If the device is considered a “non-significant” risk, IDE submission to the FDA is not required. Instead, only approval from the Institutional Review Board “IRB”), overseeing the clinical trial is required. Human clinical studies are generally required in connection with approval of class III devices and may be required for class I and II devices. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients. Clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the application is reviewed and cleared by the FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites. Future clinical trials of our products may require that we submit and obtain clearance of an IDE from the FDA prior to commencing clinical trials. The FDA, and the IRB at each institution at which a clinical trial is being performed, may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
Pervasive and Continuing Regulation
 
After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include:
 

● | Quality system regulations, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for un-cleared, unapproved or “off-label” uses; 
● | Medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; and
● | Post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. 

 
The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA and the Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Health Services (or “CDHS”), to determine our compliance with the QSR and other regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. In the past, our prior facility has been inspected, and observations were noted. There were no findings that involved a material violation of regulatory requirements. Our responses to these observations have been accepted by the FDA and CDHS, and we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the QSR. Our current manufacturing facility has been inspected by the FDA and the CDHS. The FDA and the CDHS noted observations, but there were no findings that involved a material violation of regulatory requirements. Our responses to those observations have been accepted by the FDA and CDHS.
 
We are also regulated under the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act, which requires laser products to comply with performance standards, including design and operation requirements, and manufacturers to certify in product labeling and in reports to the FDA that their products comply with all such standards. The law also requires laser manufacturers to file new product and annual reports, maintain manufacturing, testing and sales records, and report product defects. Various warning labels must be affixed and certain protective devices installed, depending on the class of the product.

Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions:
 

● | Warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Repair, replacement, recall or seizure of our products; 
● | Operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 
● | Refusing our requests for 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval of new products, new intended uses, or modifications to existing products;
● | Withdrawing 510(k) clearance or pre-market approvals that have already been granted; and 
● | Criminal prosecution and penalties. 

 
The FDA also has the authority to require us to repair, replace or refund the cost of any medical device that we have manufactured or distributed. If any of these events were to occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
We are also subject to a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those related to the environment, health and safety, land use and quality assurance. We believe that compliance with these laws and regulations as currently in effect will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive and financial position.
 
International
 
International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign governmental regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain clearance or approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the clearance or approval requirements may be different from those in the United States. 
 
In Japan, for instance, physicians can import medical devices that are not approved for sale in Japan, under their medical license if imported from a country where the product is legally marketed and sold. We frequently sell and ship products into Japan under this regulatory allowance. If the regulations in Japan change and physicians are no longer able to import devices that are not approved for sale by the Japanese regulatory authority into Japan under their medical licenses, our business in Japan could be materially impacted. In Japan, we are actively seeking approvals for certain products to supplement our existing approvals for enlighten, xeo, Solera, LimeLight, ProWave and Titan.
 
In the European Economic Area, or EEA, (which is composed of the 28 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland), a single regulatory approval process exists, and conformity with the legal requirements is represented by the CE mark. Other countries, such as Switzerland, have entered into Mutual Recognition Agreements and allow the marketing of medical devices that meet EU requirements. The EU has adopted numerous directives and European Standardization Committees have promulgated voluntary standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms with the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout the EEA and countries which have entered into a Mutual Recognition Agreement. The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the type and class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third-party assessment by a Notified Body, an independent and neutral institution appointed by a country to conduct the conformity assessment. This third-party assessment may consist of an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system and specific testing of the manufacturer’s device. An assessment by a Notified Body in one member state of the EEA, or one country which has entered into a Mutual Recognition Agreement is required in order for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout these countries. ISO 9001 and ISO 13845 certification are voluntary harmonized standards. Compliance establishes the presumption of conformity with the essential requirements for a CE Marking. In February 2000, our facility was awarded the ISO 9001 and EN 46001 certification. In March 2003, we received our ISO 9001 updated certification (ISO 9001:2000) as well as our certification for ISO 13485:1996 which replaced our EN 46001 certification. In March 2004, we received our ISO 13485:2003 certification and in March 2006, March 2009, and January 2012 we passed ISO 13485 recertification audits. In January 2015, we passed a recertification audit establishing compliance with the requirements of EN ISO 13485:2012, CAN/CSA ISO 13485:2003, and MDD 93/42/EEC. In January 2018, we conducted our recertification audit to the requirements of ISO 13485:2003 under the Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP) for the 5 regulatory jurisdictions signatory to MDSAP (FDA - US, Health Canada - Canada, TGA - Australia, PMDA - Japan, and ANVISA - Brazil); and for the EU under EN ISO 13485:2012 and MDD 93/42/EEC. We passed the recertification audit establishing compliance with ISO 13485:2003 under MDSAP; EN ISO 13458:2012; and MDD 93/42/EEC. The MDSAP and EU certification can be used to establish compliance with GMP/QSR/QMS requirements for all six regulatory jurisdictions, replacing routine audits from each regulatory jurisdiction. For cause audits can still occur.

Applicability of Anti-Corruption Laws and Regulations
 
Our worldwide business is subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the “FCPA”), the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010 (the “UK Bribery Act”) and other anti-corruption laws and regulations applicable in the jurisdictions where we operate. The FCPA can be used to prosecute companies in the United States for arrangements with physicians, or other parties outside the United States, if the physician or party is a government official of another country and the arrangement violates the law of that country. The UK Bribery Act prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both public and private sectors. There are similar laws and regulations applicable to Cutera outside the United States, all of which are subject to evolving interpretations. For additional information, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under the sections entitled “Risk Factors - Our failure to comply with rules relating to bribery, foreign corrupt practices, and privacy and security laws may subject us to penalties and adversely impact our reputation and business operations.”
 
Environmental Health and Safety Laws
 
We are also subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations worldwide. Like other medical device companies, our manufacturing and other operations involve the use and transportation of substances regulated under environmental health and safety laws including those related to the transportation of hazardous materials. To the best of our knowledge at this time, we do not expect that compliance with environmental protection laws will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had 367 employees, compared to 297 employees as of December 31, 2016. Of the 367 employees at December 31, 2017, 149 were in sales and marketing, 101 in manufacturing operations, 56 in technical service, 28 in research and development and 33 in general and administrative. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we believe our employee relations are good.
