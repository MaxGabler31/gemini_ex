  Business Overview
  
 We are a Colorado and Utah-based healthy beverages and lifestyles company engaged in the development and commercialization of a portfolio of organic, natural and other better-for-you healthy beverages, liquid dietary supplements, and other healthy lifestyle products. We compete in the growth segments of the beverage industry as a leading one-stop shop supplier for major retailers and distributors. We also are one of few competitors that commercializes its business across multiple channels including traditional retail, e-commerce, direct to consumer, and the medical channel. We market a full portfolio of Ready-to-Drink (“RTD”) better-for-you beverages including competitive offerings in the kombucha, tea, coffee, functional waters, relaxation drinks, energy drinks, rehydrating beverages, and functional medical beverage segments. We also offer liquid dietary supplement products, including Tahitian Noni® Juice, through a direct-to-consumer model using independent distributors called independent product consultants (“IPCs”). We differentiate our brands through functional performance characteristics and ingredients and offer products that are 100% organic and natural, with no high-fructose corn syrup (“HFCS”), no genetically modified organisms (“GMOs”), no preservatives, and only natural flavors, fruits, and ingredients. We rank as one of largest healthy beverage companies in the world as well as one of the fastest growing beverage companies according to Beverage Industry Magazine annual rankings and Markets and Markets. Our goal is to become the world’s leading healthy beverage company, with leading brands for consumers, leading growth for retailers and distributors, and leading return on investment for shareholders. Our target market is health conscious consumers, who are becoming more interested and better educated on what is included in their diets, causing them to shift away from less healthy options such as carbonated soft drinks or other high caloric beverages and towards alternative beverage choices. We believe consumer awareness of the benefits of healthier lifestyles and the availability of heathier beverages is rapidly accelerating worldwide, and we are capitalizing on that shift.
 Corporate History
  
 New Age Beverages Corporation was formed under the laws of the State of Washington on April 26, 2010, under the name American Brewing Company, Inc. (“American Brewing”).
  
 On April 1, 2015, American Brewing acquired the assets of B&R Liquid Adventure, which included the brand, Búcha® Live Kombucha. Prior to acquiring the Búcha® Live Kombucha brand and business, we were a craft brewery operation. In April 2016, new management assumed daily operation of the business, and began the implementation of a new vision for the Company. In May 2016 we changed our name to Búcha, Inc. (“Búcha”), and then on June 30, 2016, we acquired the combined assets of “Xing” including Xing Beverage, LLC, New Age Beverages, LLC, Aspen Pure, LLC, and New Age Properties. We then shut down all California operations where Búcha was based, relocated the Company’s operational headquarters to Denver, Colorado and changed our name to New Age Beverages Corporation.
  
 In October 2015, we sold American Brewing, including their brewery and related assets, to focus exclusively on healthy beverages. In February 2017, we uplisted onto The NASDAQ Capital Market. In March 2017, we acquired the assets of Maverick Brands, including their brand Coco-Libre. In June 2017, we acquired the assets of Premier Micronutrient Corporation (“PMC”), and also completed the acquisition of Marley Beverage Company (“Marley”) including the brand licensing rights to all Marley brand ready to drink beverages.

 On December 21, 2018, we completed a business combination with Morinda, whereby Morinda became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Morinda is a Utah-based healthy lifestyles and beverage company founded in 1996 with operations in more than 60 countries around the world, and manufacturing operations in Tahiti, the U.S., China, Japan, and Germany. Morinda was the first company to produce and sell products derived from the noni plant, an antioxidant-rich, natural resource found in French Polynesia that we believe sustains the well-being of those who consume or use it. Morinda is primarily a direct-to-consumer and e-commerce business and works with over 300,000 independent contractor IPCs worldwide. More than 70% of its business is generated in the key Asia Pacific markets of Japan, China, Korea, Taiwan, and Indonesia. The combination with Morinda provides a portfolio of healthy beverages, with multi-channel penetration spanning traditional retail, e-commerce, and in-home, and hybrid route-to-market spanning direct-store-delivery (DSD), wholesale, and direct-to-consumer.
  
 We currently have four wholly-owned subsidiaries: NABC, Inc., NABC Properties, LLC (NABC Properties”), New Age Health Sciences, and Morinda. NABC, Inc. is our Colorado-based operating company that consolidates performance and financial results of our divisions. NABC Properties administers the New Age buildings, physical properties, and warehouses. New Age Health Sciences includes all of our patents and the operating performance for the medical and hospital channels. Utah-based Morinda provides us an additional direct-to-consumer sales channel and access to key international markets.
  
  Principal Products
  
 Our core business is to develop, market, sell, and distribute healthy liquid dietary supplements and ready-to-drink beverages. The beverage industry comprises $1 trillion in annual revenue according to Euromonitor and Booz & Company and is highly competitive with three to four major multibillion-dollar multinationals that dominate the sector. We compete by differentiating our brands as healthier and better-for-you alternatives that are natural, organic, and/or have no artificial ingredients or sweeteners. Our brands include Tahitian Noni Juice, TruAge, Xing Tea, Aspen Pure®, Marley, Búcha® Live Kombucha, PediaAde, Coco Libre, BioShield, and ‘NHANCED Recovery, all competing in the existing growth and newly emerging dynamic growth segments of the beverage industry. Morinda also has several additional consumer product offerings, including a TeMana line of skin care and lip products, a Noni + Collagen ingestible skin care product, wellness supplements, and a line of essential oils.
  
  Tahitian Noni Juice and MAX
  
 Tahitian Noni Juice® (TNJ) is the original superfruit liquid dietary supplement. Sourced from the noni fruit grown in French Polynesia, we believe TNJ supports the immune system, delivers superior antioxidants, helps rid the body of harmful free radicals, increases energy, supports heart health, and allows for greater physical performance levels. Ancient tradition and modern research both support the benefits of noni.
  
 With Tahitian Noni Juice, Morinda brought the attention of the world to Tahiti and French Polynesia. Within just a few years, Morinda made noni French Polynesia’s No. 1 agricultural export. Morinda oversees every step in the process, from tree to bottle, ensuring the highest quality.
  
 TruAge® MAX is a powerful noni-based liquid dietary supplement, containing more than 350 essential nutrients and phytonutrients from the world’s premier health-promoting plants. Some ingredients in Max include noni, Cornelian cherry, grape, blueberry, red sour cherry, olive and cranberry. These ingredients work in harmony with the body’s natural chemistry, helping balance key chemicals that support the healthy functioning of the body's systems.
  
 The Company is currently developing Noni + cannabinoids (“CBD”) products with the intent to launch domestically and internationally in 2019, consistent with evolving laws and regulations relating to CBD. The Company’s vision is to be a global leader in high-quality, research-driven CBD products across all categories. New product lines will include CBD topicals, Noni + CBD single-use shots, TNJ + CBD, Max + CBD, and our TeMana skin care line infused with CBD.  
  
  Búcha Live Kombucha
  
 Búcha® Live Kombucha (“Búcha”) is a USDA-certified organic, natural, non-GMO, non-HFCS, fermented Kombucha tea with more than two billion colony forming units (“CFUs”) at batching. Búcha is produced with a unique and proprietary manufacturing process that eliminates the common vinegary aftertaste associated with many other Kombuchas and gives the product a 12-month shelf life as compared to the typical 90-day shelf life of our competitors’ products. The production process makes Búcha one of the world’s first shelf-stable (no refrigeration needed) kombuchas without compromising efficacy, and leads to consistency and stability with no risk of secondary fermentation, secondary alcohol production, incremental sugar production or over-carbonation.

  Marley
  
 New Age owns the licensing rights in perpetuity to the Marley Brand of RTD beverages and provides an annual licensing fee as a percent of sales to the Marley estate. New Age’s Marley portfolio extends across the CBD, yerba mate, relaxation tea, and RTD coffee segments. The Bob Marley brand itself is a globally relevant healthy lifestyle brand with an elite social media presence, with more than 72 million Facebook followers and loyal Marley fans. In 2019, New Age announced its plans to commercialize a line of RTD CBD-infused beverages in the U.S and international markets, consistent with evolving legal and regulatory restrictions. We are poised, positioned, and determined to be the leader in the CBD-infused beverages market. New Age plans to create a full portfolio of CBD beverages under the Marley brand, beginning with the initial rollout of Mellow Mood + CBD and a Marley CBD Shot. In January 2019, New Age entered into license agreement with Docklight LLC to facilitate the U.S. distribution of these Marley CBD-infused beverages.
  
 Marley Mate® is a caffeinated RTD tea, serving as a clean energy alternative to coffee or traditional energy drinks, with the same uplifting benefits, but without any crash or negative stigma associated with energy drinks. Marley Mate is USDA-certified organic, clean label, and is among the lowest sugar, calories, and carbohydrates of any RTD yerba mate in the market. Quickly becoming a national brand in the new and growing category, it has enjoyed excellent early success in its initial markets since launch, outselling major competitors in each of its initial launch markets.
  
 Marley Cold Brew Coffee® is a healthier alternative to other cold brew brands, with 50% lower sugar than most brands in the segment, and fewer calories than other major Cold Brew. Brewed with authentic Jamaican Coffee, the Marley Cold Brew blend has a preferred flavor profile with low acidity and no bitterness. Created with an 18-month shelf life and requiring no refrigeration, Marley Cold Brew is developing a strong presence in ambient beverage sections, in dedicated off-the-shelf elegant wood displays, as well as in refrigerated sets. Marley also offers One Drop, an RTD Frappuccino made with Premium Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee, and unlike competitive RTD coffees, contains no artificial ingredients, no HFCS, no preservatives, and no GMO’s.
  
 Marley Mellow Mood® is a RTD relaxation drink, which, as aforementioned, will include a line extension of CBD-infused teas. Marley Mellow Mood is made with Valerian Root, Chamomile, and other natural herbs and ingredients and, unlike competitive RTD Teas, is all natural, has no HFCS, no preservatives, no GMO’s, and is kosher certified. The brand comes in 15.5 oz. cans in five flavors including Peach Raspberry, Bartlett Pear, Raspberry Lemonade, and Honey Green Tea. Marley is the leading relaxation drink, which is a developing sub-segment of the RTD category.
  
  Xing
  
 XingTea® is an all-natural, non-GMO, non-HFCS, and award winning, ready-to-drink tea. Xing is made with brewed green and black teas, and is further differentiated with unique natural fruit flavors, with no preservatives, GMOs or HFCS. The product is sweetened with only honey and pure cane sugar.
  
 Xing Craft Brew Collection Tea® is an organic, premium-brewed line of artisanal teas sold in 16 oz. glass bottles with no added sugar and no artificial flavors. Unlike competitors that have more than 21 grams of added sugar, Xing Craft has no added sugar, and is an artisanal brewed tea made with single origin grown tea blends.
  
  Coco Libre
  
 Coco Libre® is a 100% pure coconut water (also available with watermelon juice infused), bottled at the source from young Vietnamese coastal coconuts. Historically a leading brand in the coconut water segment, Coco Libre is distributed in more than 15,000 outlets throughout the United States and Canada. Coco Libre® is offered in 1-liter and 330mL packages. Additionally, New Age launched Coco Libre Sparkling® in 2018, sparkling coconut water with 30-40 calories and zero added sugar. We believe that the differentiator of Coco Libre® is a light and crisp profile, infused with green tea extract and 100% pure exotic fruit juices.
  
  TeMana Skin and Lip Care
  
 Consistent with its line of healthy beverage products, and drawing on its vast noni expertise, Morinda developed and launched a line of high-end, noni-based skin and lip care products sold under the TeMana brand.
  
   
3


  
 
 TeMana Brightening skin care products capture the essence of Tahiti, taking advantage of what we believe are four unique and beneficial elements of the noni plant: noni seed oil, noni leaf extract, noni seed extract, and noni fruit juice. The Brightening line includes Brightening Serum, Toner, Facial Shield, Moisturizer, Cleanser, Facial Refiner, Body Refiner, Facial Mask, Night Cream, and Eye Cream.
  
 RTD TeMana Noni + Collagen is an ingestible skincare product. Noni + Collagen promotes firmer, smoother, more radiant skin. It's the only collagen product featuring noni, and also features fish collagen instead of collagen derived from other animal sources.
  
 Developed in concert with the Italian cosmetics experts at B.Kolor, TeMana's lip care products help skin feel healthy and full.
  
 Each of our Tahitian Noni Essential Oil blends combines purposeful, natural, therapy-grade essential oils with pure noni seed oil. Blends include Peppermint, Embrace, Lavender, Relief, Trim, Fortify, Breathe, Repel, Energize, and Relax.
  
  New Age Health Sciences Division
  
 Our Health Sciences Division owns 11 patents, on which significant cooperative research studies with human and animal trials have been completed, making New Age a beverage company with substantive intellectual property. The patents and human need-states that are addressed by the patent portfolio were all developed in partnership with and funded by the U.S. government, who invested more than $30 million behind them. Our intention is to convert the patents into products, with direct functionality in protection, treatment, or improvement of different consumer need-states.
  
 We will pursue four main areas of focus where we believe we have the most robust science and patent protection for the commercialization of products including Rehydration/Recovery, Radiation protection, Neural Protection/Improvement, and Cardiovascular health. We also intend to either license or outsource any patent we do not intend to commercialize. The Company believes that the intellectual property portfolio is of substantial value to either pharmaceutical or beverage companies, given the quality and uniqueness of the patents, and the science and evidence on the efficacy of the technologies.
  
  ‘NHANCED
  
 ‘NHANCED is our first product that was developed by the medical and scientific team at New Age Health Sciences. ‘NHANCED delivers a first of its kind product, designed to be consumed the night before surgery to improve patient outcomes after surgery. It is a natural, clear complex carbohydrate beverage for patient use in accordance with hospital systems adopting enhanced recovery after surgery (“ERAS”) protocols. The product is coconut water based and includes key vitamins and mineral co-factors for immune support. It provides antioxidants, amino acids, and phytonutrients for improved metabolic function.
  
 ‘NHANCED was designed to facilitate recovery after surgery with less inflammatory response, less nausea, reduced gastric stress, increased GI motility, less insulin resistance, improved wound healing and immune function, and overall improved patient satisfaction. Initial patient testing has validated the benefits.
  
  Bio-Shield
  
 “Bio-Shield” is the current working brand name for our radiation and environmental protection product. We own the patents to what we believe is the only product in the world proven to protect the body from the effects of ionizing radiation and have the trials and research studies validating the efficacy of our product. Ionizing radiation, which comes from a number of sources, including near proximity to sun, nuclear facilities, medical X-rays or scans, affects the body by breaking the double-strands of DNA inside the body. New Age’s product has proven to protect double-strand DNA from breaking due to the impact of radiation. “Bio-Shield” will be launched in Asia Pacific during the first half of 2019, and thereafter we expect to launch the product into the U.S. and other markets and channels including both the travel and medical channels by the fourth quarter of 2019.
  
  Sales and Marketing
  
 We market our RTD beverage products using a range of marketing mediums, including in-store merchandising and promotions, experiential marketing, events, and sponsorships, digital marketing and social media, direct marketing, and traditional media including print, radio, outdoor, and TV.

 We currently have an in-house sales and merchandising team consisting of approximately 75 individuals based in Colorado and throughout the United States, whose compensation is variable and performance-based. Each sales team member has individual targets for increasing “base” volume through distribution expansion, and “incremental” volume through promotions and other in-store merchandising and display activity. As distribution to new major customers, new major channels, or new major markets increases, we will expand the sales and marketing team on a variable basis.
  
 We use a direct selling model to market our Tahitian Noni and TeMana products through 300,000 IPCs in over 60 countries around the world. Morinda associates in the United States and 25 other countries motivate, educate, and assist IPCs in their efforts.
  
  Distribution 
  
 Our products are currently distributed in over 60 countries internationally, and in 50 states domestically through a hybrid of four routes to market including our own DSD system that reaches more than 6,000 outlets, and to more than 35,000 outlets throughout the United States directly through customer’s warehouses, through our network of DSD partners and through our network of brokers and distributors. Our products are sold through multiple channels including major grocery retail, natural food retail, specialty outlets, hypermarkets, club stores, pharmacies, convenience stores and gas stations—and also direct to consumers through individual independent distributor IPCs and E-commerce.
  
 Our sales strategy is to distribute our products worldwide to consumers in the most cost-effective manner possible. We sell our products direct to consumers through our own E-commerce system and other E-commerce systems, through retail customers across grocery, gas, convenience, pharmacy, mass, club and other channels, to major foodservice customers, to alternative channel customers including juice/smoothie shops, military, office, and health club, and through hospitals, outpatient doctor offices, and other channels.
  
 The diversification of our channels and distributors, similar to the diversification of our retail customer base, is expected to minimize distributor and channel concentration and risk, but is also expected to have a very positive margin mix effect, and a very positive incremental volume impact.
  
  Direct-to-Consumer Distribution of Tahitian Noni, TruAge, TeMana, and Other Products
  
  Independent Product Consultants (“IPCs”)
  
 Individuals who wish to sell Morinda’s Tahitian Noni, TruAge, and TeMana-branded products through our person-to-person sales model must enroll in our independent sales force as an IPC. New IPCs are sponsored by an existing IPC, and the new IPC becomes a member of the sponsoring IPC’s sales organization. The newly enrolled IPCs must sign a written agreement or accept the terms and conditions of the agreement online at the Company’s website. The agreement includes that IPCs will comply with the Company’s policies and procedures, which include that IPCs will (i) safeguard and protect the reputation of the Company and its products; (ii) refrain from any deceptive, false, unethical, or unlawful consumer or recruiting practices; (iii) refrain from any deceptive, false, unethical, or unlawful claims about the Company’s products or compensation plan; and (iv) refrain from promoting or selling products that are competitive to the Company’s flagship product, or promoting other network marketing opportunities to IPCs whom they did not personally sponsor with the Company. The Company may take disciplinary action, up to and including termination of the IPC’s purchase and sales organization rights, against any IPC who violates its policies and procedures. In most markets, IPCs are required to purchase a starter kit which includes sales and educational materials. No commissions are paid on the purchase of a starter kit. Our policies and procedures manual is available to IPCs in this kit or is available online at the Company’s website. We sell these kits at a nominal price averaging $35. No other investment is required to become an IPC.
  
 After enrolling as an IPC, the IPC may purchase products directly from us at wholesale (member) pricing for personal use and for resale to customers. IPCs may build sales organizations by recruiting and enrolling new IPCs. As new IPCs sponsor new IPCs, levels are created in the IPC’s organizational structure called a down-line. As these new IPCs continue to sponsor, they create their own sales organization which also forms a part of the sales organization of the original sponsoring IPC. We have no requirements for IPCs to recruit or sponsor new IPCs, and IPCs are not compensated for recruiting or sponsoring IPCs. IPC compensation is based on product sales. Subject to payment of a nominal annual renewal fee (which can be substituted by the sale of Morinda product through the IPC’s account at the time of renewal), IPCs may continue to purchase our products at member pricing and recruit a sales organization provided they comply with our policies and procedures.

 The Company’s business and compensation plan for China is executed in a modified form due to Chinese law and regulations. Individuals who are residents of China and are eligible to work in China may enroll as IPCs or as Customers in China. The same policies and procedures described above, as modified for China, apply to IPCs in China. According to Chinese regulations, non-China resident IPCs are not permitted to sponsor in China or otherwise participate in the compensation plan for China.
  
  IPC Training and Motivation
  
 An IPC’s sponsor provides the initial training about our products and compensation plan. Other IPCs in the sponsor’s sales organization typically assist with this training. The Company’s policies require that a sponsor must maintain an ongoing professional leadership association with IPCs in their sales organization. We develop training materials and sales tools to assist IPCs with this training and in building their sales organizations. We also conduct online trainings and webinars, regional, national, and international IPC events, as well as intensive leadership training events. Attendance at these events is voluntary, and IPCs may attend the events that they feel will most benefit them and their sales organization. We have found that the most successful and productive IPCs tend to be those who take advantage of these events. While Morinda associates work to support the IPCs and to provide them with training materials and sales tools, we rely on our IPCs to operate as the sales force for Morinda, and to sell our products, recruit new IPCs and Customers to purchase our products, and to train new IPCs regarding our products and compensation plan.
  
  IPC Compensation
  
 Our compensation plan has several attractive features and provides several opportunities for IPCs to earn compensation. IPCs understand that success comes from the effort, dedication, resources, and time they commit to their business. The compensation opportunities require that IPCs consistently work at building, training, and retaining their sales organizations to sell Morinda products to consumers. Each compensation opportunity is designed to reward dedicated IPCs for directly and indirectly generating product sales through their sales organization and to consumers. All compensation is conditioned on the IPC’s good standing and compliance with the Company’s policies and procedures and the laws of the country where the IPC does business
  
 IPCs may build their sales organization by sponsoring new IPCs and Customers in any market where the Company has registered and sells its products. Additionally, the integration of our compensation plan across all markets (except China) allows IPCs to earn commissions from global product sales along with local product sales. We believe our compensation plan is one of the most attractive and lucrative offered by any direct selling company—and is thus a significant aspect of our ability to expand internationally.
  
  Customers
  
 Morinda also has a Customer program. Individuals may enroll as Customers and purchase products for their personal use only. Customers are not permitted to resell or distribute our products. The Customer program allows us to include individuals who wish to use Morinda’s products but who do not wish to participate in the business. Customers are not eligible to earn commissions. Customers may upgrade their account at any time to become an IPC and may then participate in the business and compensation plan and be eligible to earn commissions.
  
  Manufacturing and Distribution of Noni-Based Products
  
 Our manufacturing and bottling facilities are in Rongchang, China; Tokyo, Japan; Bad Liebenwerda, Germany; Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; Alamosa, Colorado; American Fork, Utah and in 10 other contract manufacturing facilities throughout the US. Each of our products are produced to exacting specifications and standards, and subject to strict quality control procedures.
  
 Our Coco-libre brand of coconut water is sourced from young coconuts on the southeastern coast of the country, which we believe produces the sweetest and most complex flavored coconut water of any major competitor. Xing, Búcha, and Marley products are produced using our proprietary blends and production processes.
  
 Our noni fruit is harvested from noni trees on 18 islands of French Polynesia by approximately 2,000 harvesters, who are independent contractors, and who work with Company representatives on each island. All fruit is checked at the time of harvest for quality, maturity, and purity. To date, we have maintained good relations with our suppliers and have not experienced any significant difficulties in obtaining adequate supplies of the noni fruit.
  
 
   
6


  
 
 The noni fruit is then shipped to our   85,000 square foot processing plant in Mataiea, Tahiti, where the fruit is again checked before being processed. This facility, as well as all facilities that produce products for us, adheres to the Good Manufacturing Practices as established by the FDA. The Tahiti facility is well-maintained, and the buildings and equipment are kept clean and in good repair. Technology is up-to-date. The facility is regularly inspected by the French Polynesian authorities and by the United States FDA.
  
 At this processing facility, the seeds are separated from the fruit. The seeds are later prepared for oil extraction. The fruit is extensively inspected, pasteurized, and turned into puree, which is the key component of our Tahitian Noni Juice. The pasteurized puree is checked for quality and placed into tote bins,  which are shipped by sea to a West Coast port of the United States, Japan, China or Germany for use in manufacturing our products. Each day the equipment used at this facility is automatically cleaned by a three step  Clean-in-Place (CIP) system. This system ensures the cleanliness of the equipment, tanks, and pipes used in the processing of the puree.
  
  Reliance on Third-Party Suppliers and Distributors
  
 Except as noted in the previous section, we rely on various suppliers for the raw and packaging materials, production, sale, and distribution of our products. Our third-party distribution providers are for certain areas of the country that are outside of our owned DSD distribution network. The material terms of these relationships are typically negotiated annually and include pricing, quality standards, delivery times and conditions, purchase orders, and payment terms. Payment terms are typically net 30, meaning that the total invoiced amount is expected to be paid in full within 30 days from the date the products or services are provided. We believe that we have sufficient options for each of our raw and packaging material needs, as well as our third-party distribution needs and also have long-term relationships with each of our suppliers and distributors, resulting in consistency in quality and supply. We also believe that we have sufficient breadth of retail relationships with distribution in both large and small retailers and independents and across multiple channels (mass, club, pharmacies, convenience, and small and large format retailers) throughout the United States.
  
 The contractual arrangements with all third parties, including suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers are typical of the beverage industry with standard terms. We have no long-term obligations with any of the third parties nor do any of them have long-term obligations with us. The third-party supplier, manufacturing and distribution agreements were entered into in the normal course of business within the guidelines of industry practices and are not deemed material and definite.
  
  Competition
  
 The beverage industry, specifically the healthy beverage industry, and the direct selling industries are multi-billion dollar industries which are highly competitive. We face intense competition from very large, international corporations, as well as from local and national companies. In addition, we face competition from well-known companies that have large market share. We also face stiff competition for the services of our IPCs that sell our direct-to-consumer products.
  
 The intensity of competition in the future is expected to increase, and no assurance can be provided that we can sustain our market position or expand our business.
  
 Many of our current and potential competitors are well established and have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial and operational resources, and name recognition than we have. However, we believe that, with our diverse product line, consisting of noni juice, kombucha tea, green tea, water, energy beverages, and new CBD-infused beverages, we will have the ability to obtain a large market share, and continue to generate sales and compete in the industry.
  
  Competitive Strengths
  
 New Age has five components of differentiation that distinguishes it from other companies:
   
   1.
 New Age has a full brand portfolio of healthy beverage and lifestyle products. The company’s beverages compete in only the growth segments of the industry, and as such is the only one-stop-shop supplier of healthy beverages for retailers and distributors. These entities are reticent to work with smaller, individual brand companies without the resources and infrastructure to support them.

 
   
7


  
 
 New Age’s portfolio of healthy brands fills a long-felt unmet need for consumers, retailers and distributors created by the legacy leaders in the industry. The Company enjoys the growth rate benefits of the segments in which it competes by focusing exclusively on healthy alternatives, and unlike major competitors, has limited distractions like those required investments to maintain businesses in declining segments like carbonated soft drinks for example.
  
   2.
 New Age has a unique, omni-channel distribution and sales model, with its own direct-to consumer selling system, its own direct-to-store distribution system, an e-commerce business and dedicated e-commerce fulfillment system, and a medical channel and other alternative channel distribution system as part of its go to market strategy. New Age’s, direct-to consumer system reaches over 300,000 independent distributors in more than 60 countries

 
 New Age’s direct-to-store distribution platform includes almost 40 unique routes, with an almost 100-person strong sales and merchandising team, covering more than 6,000 outlets for more than 60 partner brands and more than 600 SKU’s. Beyond New Age own direct-to-store system, the company has strong distribution in major key accounts across the U.S covering more than 300,000 points of distribution. New Age has a robust national hybrid distribution network with other major DSD operators, natural channel distributors, and direct to store wholesale distribution. The Company’s national network represents a significant competitive advantage and barrier to entry vs. many other smaller beverage companies.
  
 New Age’s e-commerce and pick-pack-ship fulfillment centers fulfills auto shipments monthly to more than 120,000 customers and exceeds $150 million in annual revenue. We believe it is one of the largest beverage e-commerce systems in existence and provides for a high-margin way to directly market to its consumers and build its database of insights and purchase behavior.
  
 We believe that each of our distribution and channel execution models are highly leverageable and under-developed, with significant growth to be obtained utilizing our infrastructure across 60 international markets, significant growth to be gained from expanding our subscribers and breadth of portfolio in our e-commerce system, significant growth from expanding our core brands in traditional national retail within the US, and significant growth in expanding our Health Sciences and other products to the Medical and other alternative channels.
  
   3.
 New Age has a portfolio of patents and intellectual property that we believe will be the future of the beverage industry. Beyond the patent protection, the company also has the cooperative research studies and human trials on many of its unique products. The science and products, many of which were developed either by or in conduction with the US government and US military, cover many fundamental human need states including cardiovascular health, neural protection, and radiation and environmental protection. We believe that as we commercialize this portfolio and convert these patents into products, that the functional benefit and differentiation of these products will create a significant new market for the Company and bridge the gap between pharma-grade medicine, nutraceuticals, and the beverage industry.

 
 As part of its Health Sciences Division, the company has developed a portfolio of cannabis-infused beverages. These cannabis-infused beverages have undergone significant consumer testing to optimize flavor, profile, dosage and efficacy. Through its strategic partnership with Privateer, we believe we have the regulatory, legal, and production insights together with the relationships and the Marley brand, that position the company to be the leader in this fast-emerging segment. New Age has been working closely with major retailers in the US and in key international markets to launch its portfolio as soon as the regulatory and legal landscape in respective geographies permit.
  
   4.
 We believe the Company has financial flexibility with a strong balance sheet and access to the capital markets unlike many other smaller beverage entities. The company’s low relative debt, profitability facilitated by its unique omni-channel structure, and positioning in the public markets enable the company to access growth capital at a lower relative cost, and access growth capital to take advantage of major opportunities it uncovers across its core businesses.


   5.

  Research and Development Activities
  
 Our research and development efforts are focused on two primary paths. The first is to continually review our existing formulas and production processes and structure to evaluate opportunities for cost of goods sold improvements, without degrading the quality or fundamentally changing the consumer appeal taste profile of our existing products. The second major research and development effort is in the development of fundamentally new and differentiated products, based on consumer insights and trends and competitive intensity in those segments. The Company’s mission to only provide healthy functional beverages governs our development efforts.
  
 The Company’s new products and R&D efforts in its Health Sciences Division are science-backed by the patents, cooperative research studies, and human and animal trials acquired from the Premier Micronutrient Corporation. They are targeted toward fundamental human needs-states, segments that do not yet exist in beverages, but do exist in the pharmaceutical arena, and opportunities where New Age can gain first mover advantage. The Company’s mission is to only provide healthy functional beverages with real efficacy for consumers. That guiding principle of “no compromise” governs all our development efforts.
  
 Morinda has an R&D group that is closely aligned with and seamlessly supports the goals and plans of the Company. In addition to developing new healthy and scientifically sound products and reviewing and improving existing formulas and processes for cost reductions, Morinda R&D continues to conduct and publish new, cutting edge benefits research on noni and other new products in order to maintain a distinct advantage in the healthy beverage and skin care categories.

Substantial inventories are required to fulfill our dual role as manufacturer and distributor of some of our products. We also watch seasonal markets and may purchase ahead of normal demand to hedge against cost increases and supply risks.

  Government and Industry Regulation
  
 We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations in the U.S. These laws and regulations apply to many aspects of our business including the manufacture, safety, labeling, transportation, advertising and sale of our products. The U.S. FDA and FTC regulate the advertising and sale of our healthy beverage products and skin care products. Violations of these laws or regulations in the manufacture, safety, labeling, transportation, and advertising of our products could damage our reputation and/or result in regulatory actions with substantial penalties. For example, changes in recycling and bottle deposit laws or special taxes on our beverages and our ingredients could increase our costs. Regulatory focus on the health, safety and marketing of beverage products is increasing. Certain federal or state regulations or laws affecting the labeling of our products, such as California’s “Prop 65,” which requires warnings on any product with substances that the state lists as potentially causing cancer or birth defects, are or could become applicable to our products. At this time, our products do not require government approval, but as federal or state laws change, the manufacture or quality of our products may become subject to additional regulation. CBD products will require registration in certain states. Additionally, existing and new functional health products sold by Morinda can require registration in some foreign markets.
  
 We are also subject to the Securities Act, the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and Washington, Nevada, Colorado, and Utah Corporation Law. We will also be subject to common business and tax rules and regulations pertaining to the operation of our business, such as the United States Internal Revenue Tax Code and the Washington, Colorado, and Utah State Tax Codes, as well as international tax codes and shipping tariffs. We will also be subject to proprietary regulations such as United States Trademark and Patent Law as it applies to the intellectual property of third parties. We believe that the effects of existing or probable governmental regulations will be additional responsibilities of management to ensure that we are in compliance with securities regulations as they apply to our products as well as ensuring that we do not infringe on any proprietary rights of others with respect to our products. We will also need to maintain accurate financial records in order to remain compliant with securities regulations as well as any corporate tax liability we incur.
  
  Seasonality
  
 We experience some seasonality whereby the peak summer months show a higher level of sales and consumption. However, we believe that the structure of our business and range of products in our portfolio mitigate any major fluctuations. Our revenue during the second and third quarters of the year have historically been approximately 60% of annual revenue, and this seasonality is expected to continue for the foreseeable future.
  
 Asia represents 70% of our Morinda sales, and Asia tends to generate lower sales during the following periods as a result of the following seasonality factors:
  
   ●
 January                        New Year holidays

   ●
 February                      Fewer business days

   ●
 May                             Golden Week holidays

   ●
 August Bon Festivities and vacation season

   ●
 December                    The end of the year holidays
