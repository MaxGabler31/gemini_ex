ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
INTRODUCTION
 BJ’s Restaurants is a national casual dining chain that, as of February 24, 2022, owns and operates 211 restaurants located in 29 states, excluding one restaurant that was closed subsequent to year-end.
 The first BJ’s restaurant, which opened in 1978 in Orange County, California, was a small sit-down pizzeria that featured Chicago style deep-dish pizza with a unique California twist. Our goal then and still today is to be a leading, varied menu casual dining restaurant brand that focuses on delivering high quality menu options at a compelling value, a dining experience that exceeds our customers’ (referred to as “guests”) expectations for service, hospitality and enjoyment, and an atmosphere that is always welcoming and approachable. 
 In 1996, we introduced our own proprietary craft beers and expanded the BJ’s concept from its beginnings as a small pizzeria to a full-service, high-energy casual dining restaurant when we opened our first large format restaurant with our own internal brewing operations in Brea, California. Today our restaurants feature a broad menu with over 100 menu items designed to offer something for everyone including: slow roasted entrees such as prime rib, EnLIGHTened Entrees® such as our Cherry Chipotle Glazed Salmon, our original signature deep-dish pizza, the world-famous Pizookie® dessert, and our award-winning BJ’s proprietary craft beers. Our craft beer is produced at several of our restaurants, our Temple, Texas brewpub locations and by independent third-party brewers using our proprietary recipes. 
 Our Internet address is http://www.bjsrestaurants.com. Electronic copies of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K are available, free of charge, by visiting the “Investor Relations” section of our website. These reports are posted as soon as practical after they are electronically filed with the SEC. We caution that the information on our website is not part of this or any other reports we file with, or furnish to, the SEC.

BUSINESS STRATEGY
 We compete in the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry, which is a large, highly fragmented segment with estimated annual sales in the $100+ billion range. We believe that the BJ’s restaurant concept offers consumers a higher quality, more contemporary and approachable “casual plus,” “premium casual,” or “polished casual” dining experience than many of the more mature, “mass–market” casual dining concepts. Our primary business objective is to increase our market share in the casual dining restaurant industry by consistently delivering on our “Gold Standard of Operational Excellence” promise to our guests while continuing our national restaurant expansion program. Our Gold Standard of Operational Excellence is our genuine commitment to take pride in passionately connecting with every guest on every visit, through flawless and relentless execution of every detail, during every shift – to create and keep fanatical fans of BJ’s. We believe that by delivering upon this commitment to our guests, we create the best opportunity to generate significant repeat business and capture additional market share. 
 While our core strategy has remained consistent, we are always striving to evolve and enhance our guests’ experience. In 2021, we embarked on a more in-depth consumer research initiative to discover and better understand why our guests love BJ’s. We have taken what we learned and applied it to initiatives that will evolve our key areas and concept. Our Gold Standard of Operational Excellence is focused on the following key areas that help to differentiate BJ’s from other casual dining restaurants:
  
• | High-Energy Atmosphere and Facilities – We believe that one of our greatest competitive differentiators is the design, ambiance and energy of our restaurants, which feature a signature bar statement, making them a destination for our guests to spend quality time with friends and family. As part of our competitive positioning as a polished casual dining concept, our restaurants have finishes consistent with upscale casual dining concepts, including high ceilings and a signature bar statement with large flat screen televisions which can be viewed from any seat and provide the comfort of a restaurant in a bar. Additionally, we use a variety of higher quality guest touchpoints, including distinctive glassware, to fit the beer or beverage style and linen napkins not generally found in “mass-market” casual dining.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Broad and Distinctive Menu – Over the years, we have expanded the BJ’s concept to include menu options that meet our guests’ preferences for any dining occasion. Our menu items are created by our talented culinary team and prepared to order in our restaurants using high-quality ingredients. Our menu features a wide variety of choices, ensuring there’s something for everyone and yet we’re able to satisfy any guests request to ensure it is “made their way”. Both are important factors in our differentiation from other casual dining competitors. We evaluate our menu offerings and prices two to three times a year in addition to offering seasonal or limited time only menu items throughout the year. Building on our early pizza legacy, we offer almost 20 signature flavors of pizza and made-to-order combinations in tavern-cut and deep-dish styles. Our hand-pressed deep-dish pizza dough is double proofed – which means it rises twice – elevating its presentation and taste. We also offer slow roast large format proteins including prime rib, double bone-in pork chops and tri-tip sirloin, as well as guest favorites that include a brewhouse twist. Our menu differentiation also includes our successful EnLIGHTened Entrees® category which features “better for you” selections of lower-calorie, “super” foods, vegetarian and gluten-sensitive options.

• | Award Winning, Proprietary Craft Beer – All of our restaurants feature our award-winning, proprietary craft beers, which we believe showcase the quality and care of the ingredients we use at BJ’s. Our high-quality, craft beers further differentiate BJ’s from many other restaurant concepts and complement our broad menu. Our beers have earned over 240 medals at different beer festivals and events, including 38 medals at the Great American Beer Festival and 11 medals at the World Beer Cup. We also offer approximately 30 domestic, imported and “guest” craft beers on tap, in addition to a selection of bottled beers in our restaurants. Additionally, our restaurants offer our craft beer for take-out, where legally permitted. Our large and unique beer offerings are intended to enhance BJ’s competitive positioning as a leading beer retailer in casual dining. We are also testing our BJ’s Brewhouse Beer Club in a majority of our California restaurants. Our club is a subscription service, which features unique beers and restaurant traffic-driving perks that are only available to club members.

• | Everyday Value Proposition – We strive to offer great everyday value throughout our menu, with diverse price points and unique flavor profiles. Our menu entrées, excluding our promotional specials, generally range in price from $7.25 to $29.95. We also offer Daily Brewhouse Specials Monday through Thursday, which feature some of our iconic food and drink items at a lower price, as well as daily lunch specials and happy hour offerings, where permitted, to reinforce our everyday value proposition. Additionally, we offer a series of take-out and delivery specific Family Meals and Bundles that serve 4 to 6 guests. These packages start at $40.00 and further enhance our strong value equation. Our average per-guest check during fiscal 2021, including beverages, increased from approximately $18.00 in 2020 to approximately $19.00 in 2021, and was impacted by changes in our sales mix and higher item incidence per

guest, in addition to menu price increases to help mitigate higher costs due to inflationary pressures. Where permitted by law, we also sell wine, alcoholic beverages and mixed drinks through take-out.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A Culture Committed to Gracious Service and Hospitality – Completely satisfying dining experiences start with engaged, knowledgeable and hospitable people. We have invested carefully to make sure we recruit, select, train and retain employees, referred to as “team members” who can take care of our guests and consistently and correctly operate our complex restaurants. In addition to hiring great team members, we continue to invest in productivity and hospitality programs to enhance our ability to consistently deliver the Gold Standard of Operational Excellence we promise our guests. These programs include a Net Promoter Scoring program that helps us evaluate several key elements of our service including pace, hospitality, value and recommend scores, as well as mystery shopper and guest loyalty programs. Our restaurant teams strive to consistently execute at a high level and to treat every guest as if they are family so guests leave smiling.

• | Technology at the Right Time – Time is a finite resource for our guests, and we believe that by being attentive to every detail, we can optimize our guests’ enjoyment when they choose to dine with us. Our handheld ordering tablets have helped to improve our pace and productivity, including reducing the time it takes to deliver the first drink or food item to our guests. The tablets have resulted in an improved guest experience and driven higher incident rates for beverages, appetizers and desserts. Additionally, our BJ’s mobile application allows our guests to use their smartphones to order ahead, add their name to our waitlist, pay at the table and manage their loyalty account, among other things. Through our contactless curbside pickup with short message service (“SMS”) text and email technology, we keep our guests informed of their menu order and allow them to notify the restaurant when they arrive. We were also one of the first in casual dining to utilize the quick response (“QR”) code and WiFi geolocation technologies for both menu browsing and mobile payment to provide a touchless experience for guests who dine at our restaurants.

• | Bringing the Brewhouse Home to Our Guests – Consumer preferences continue to evolve as e-commerce, mobile shopping and “food-on-demand” continue to gain traction and direct visitation away from traditional brick and mortar shopping locations, a trend which accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. To meet these new opportunities, we have invested in the off-premise sales channel by creating new off-premise menu items, expanding our catering menu, collaborating with third-party delivery partners to provide delivery service from our restaurants, and continuing to improve our take-out and curbside experience. We also have enhanced our technology for the off-premise sales channel by leveraging our self-developed mobile application, our website and other platforms to ensure our guests can more easily enjoy BJ’s menu from home or the office. This includes contactless curbside pickup with short message service (“SMS”) text and email technology to keep our guests informed of the status of their menu order and allow them to notify the restaurant when they arrive. These ongoing system and operational improvements are designed to improve the guest experience and drive traffic, off-premise check growth and increased catering orders.

HUMAN CAPITAL 
 As of December 28, 2021, we employed approximately 21,000 team members at our 212 restaurants. We also employed approximately 230 team members at our Restaurant Support Center in Huntington Beach, California and our field supervision positions around the country, whose primary goal is to provide gold standard support to our restaurant teams so they can focus on serving our guests. Approximately 15% of our hourly restaurant team members provide their services on a full-time basis, as defined by the Affordable Care Act. We actively work to ensure positive team member relations and a respectful workplace, frequently reinforcing the high ethical and professional standards set forth in our Code of Integrity, Ethics and Conduct which we believe should drive every decision we make. Currently, no unions or collective bargaining arrangements are in place at our Company. 
Culture, Values and Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity
 We recognize that our greatest asset and resource is our team members. One of the five key pillars embedded in our strategic plan is to CRAFT a People-First Hospitality Culture. Our commitment to our team is rooted in our core values set forth in BJ’s Promise Card, which our team members are asked to carry with them as they work. Our focus is on CRAFTing an engaging experience for our team members.
 ConnectionRespect        Advancement Fun Trust
 We strive to be an inclusive brand that reflects the diversity of our communities and provides equal opportunity and access for all of our team members to develop and advance within our Company. As of December 28, 2021, of our team members who indicated a racial or ethnic identity, or whose racial or ethnic identity can otherwise be determined, approximately 46% are female and approximately 57% are from under-represented racial or ethnic communities.

Our Inclusion, Diversity and Equity Alliance (IDEA), which launched in 2020, focuses on celebrating and fostering inclusion and belonging among our team members and guests, appreciating and embracing diversity, and providing opportunities for our team members to listen to and learn from each other. IDEA Listening Circles give our team members the opportunity to share their personal stories and provide feedback to the Company on how we can drive intentional, meaningful change to improve our team member experience for all, recognizing that we all grow in understanding and empathy when we listen to voices and stories which are different than our own. 
 In addition, IDEA hosts periodic gatherings and has curated a resource center and an internal intranet page for team members designed to support education and awareness and to celebrate our differences.
 Our Women’s Career Advancement Network (WeCAN), which launched in 2011, focuses on developing, retaining and advancing women leaders. WeCAN hosts quarterly educational workshops and philanthropic activities. In addition, IDEA and WeCAN, in partnership with our BJ’s Restaurants Foundation (the “Foundation”), focus on charitable giving and volunteer efforts that support diversity and inclusion, including the Equal Justice Initiative, Special Olympics, and educational charities. In 2020, we made a five-year annual pledge to contribute to organizations that support efforts to end systemic injustice – starting with a donation from our Foundation to the Equal Justice Initiative on behalf of BJ’s Restaurants’ team members. In the coming years, we envision IDEA providing support to additional team member-driven communities of interest or resource groups focused on specific diverse communities and their allies.
 To win and retain our talent, we recognize we must maintain a workplace culture that encourages behaviors aligned with our values, helps our team members fulfill their career aspirations, and engages them throughout their careers. In furtherance of this goal, we invest significant resources to retain and develop our talent. Our managerial leadership training includes coursework on creating a respectful and non-discriminatory workplace, identifying and eliminating bias, and promoting fair and equitable hiring We offer a variety of career development resources to help develop, grow and enable team members to make the most of their careers at the Company, including an Emerging Leader Program to promote management readiness in our hourly team members, a Career Development Conference for managers within their first or second year with the Company, and a Leadership Development Conference to develop emerging General Managers, Managing Directors and Directors of Operations. We leverage a learning management system with numerous on-line learning resources for team member development, performance management and talent planning. We strive to ensure that advancement opportunities are transparent and equitable. To further foster engagement and retain our top talent, we utilize a platform for conferences and communications, as well as a self-service payroll and human resources platform for team member related transactions. After meeting remotely in 2020, we were able to host a 2021 General Manager Conference in a hybrid in-person and remote manner which gave our General Managers, field supervision team and select Restaurant Support Center team members the opportunity to connect and learn in person. We also continued our regularly quarterly manager calls and Restaurant Support Center meetings.
 Team Member Wellbeing Initiatives
 We focus on providing health and financial wellbeing offerings that attract, retain, and engage BJ’s talent. In 2015, we launched our Enlightened Living Wellbeing Program, which includes educational resources, health fairs and incentives that inspire participation in preventive care and wellbeing activities. Along with a variety of traditional benefit offerings, 401k and deferred compensation programs, and paid time off, we provide a variety of complimentary benefits and resources to support team members’ physical and mental health, including health and life assistance programs to our team members to provide counseling services, advocacy and billing support, and referrals, discounted fitness memberships, and an on-site fitness center at our Restaurant Support Center, among other services. 
Our Response to COVID-19 
 To support the health and well-being of all of our team members during the COVID-19 pandemic, we provided the following incremental benefits in 2020, some of which continue today:

• | Paid accrued sick and vacation benefits, along with emergency COVID-19 pay, at the time of temporary layoffs in April 2020
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A resource center for our temporarily laid-off employees which included other temporary employment opportunities and information about unemployment insurance benefits
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reinforced telemedicine coverage and Health Advocate services available to benefits-eligible employees
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Implemented work from home for our Restaurant Support Center in March 2020, and a hybrid return-to-office workplace in July 2021
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provided personal protective equipment and safety protocols to foster a safe workplace in 2020 and reinforced safety protocols to foster a safe workplace in 2021
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We continuously encourage our team members to speak up about safety matters. Our commitment to safety and culture is maintained through our open door policy and empowering our team members to utilize our anonymous Team Member Hotline,

without fear of retaliation, if they have any concerns about how they or others are treated. We also have an IDEA email address for team members to use if they have any ideas to improve our culture of diversity and inclusion, and we have a “Killer Ideas” email address for team members to use to offer their innovative ideas about how to improve our business.
 Community
 At BJ’s, we believe it is important to give back to the communities we serve and to do more good things for more people. In fiscal 2006, we started the Foundation, a 501(c)(3) qualified non-profit charitable organization, which is principally dedicated to supporting charities benefiting children’s healthcare and education, with a primary focus on the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (“CFF”). Our Chairman of the Board of Directors, our former Chief Executive Officer who is now a director, and four of our current executive officers currently serve on the Foundation’s eight-person Board of Directors. Our commitment to supporting humanitarian causes is exemplified by our “Cookies for Kids” program, which was created in 1998 and continues to be the heart of BJ’s continued financial support of CFF, to which millions of dollars have been donated throughout the years. In addition, we arrange for the collection and donation of other funds to CFF through our restaurant preopening training events. 
 We also focus on supporting our local communities by providing volunteer hours, food and other resources for many worthwhile charitable causes and events through a program called Team Action to Support Communities (“TASC Force”). The TASC Force program recognizes and supports the volunteer efforts of our restaurant team members across the country, as they donate their own free time to benefit charitable causes and community events which are important to them, while helping give back to the communities in which our restaurants do business. Our TASC Force teams have helped fulfill the wishes of special needs kids, placed flags at the graves of fallen soldiers, painted over unsightly graffiti, helped clean up beaches, parks and school grounds, hosted blood drives, worked with Special Olympics, packed meals for No Kid Hungry, painted houses for elderly citizens, supported Habitat for Humanity to re-build playgrounds, worked at food banks, participated in fundraising runs and walkathons, and delivered food to families in need. 
 At BJ’s, the act of compassionate giving influences every aspect of our Company’s culture. Caring about those in the communities we serve is only one aspect of this compassion. Caring for the BJ’s family of team members and loved ones is another. Our Give A Slice program was created to help our fellow co-workers and their families in their times of need and is fully funded by voluntary team member contributions. From funeral expenses for lost team members or their loved ones, to help in times of financial distress after a fire, natural disaster, theft or illness, Give A Slice helps hundreds of team members each year. 
 Annually our restaurants participate in a variety of philanthropic partnerships, two of which are with the Alzheimer’s Association® and No Kid Hungry®. We sponsor certain events, as well as invite our guests, team members, friends and communities to get involved and contribute.

 RESTAURANT OPERATIONS 
 Based on internal and publicly available data and excluding the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe our restaurants, on average, generate relatively high guest traffic per square foot compared to many other casual dining concepts. We have implemented operational systems and procedures to support our goal to run our restaurants “quality fast,” particularly during peak dining periods, in order to effectively and efficiently serve every guest. The typical management team for a BJ’s restaurant consists of a General Manager, an Executive Kitchen Manager and three to five other managers depending on the sales volume of each restaurant. The General Manager is responsible for the day-to-day operations of their restaurant, including hiring, training, and development of personnel, as well as for sales and operating profit. The Executive Kitchen Manager is responsible for managing food quality and preparation, purchasing, inventories and kitchen labor costs as well as hiring, training and development of kitchen personnel. 
 New restaurant managers are required to successfully complete an 8-week comprehensive advanced management training program dedicated to all operational aspects of our restaurants including both restaurateuring and restaurant business-related topics. Our restaurant management training program is led by our Vice President of Operations Talent Development and is closely monitored by our field supervision team. In addition, in order to maintain our high standards, all new hourly restaurant team members participate in a formal training program and work with Team Member Instructors at each restaurant who help them master their new roles.

The General Manager of each restaurant reports to a Director of Operations or an Area Vice President, who reports to a Vice President of Operations. Our Vice Presidents of Operations report to our Senior Vice President of Operations, who is responsible for leading the day-to-day restaurant operations, including kitchen and bar operations, and restaurant facility management. Our Senior Vice President of Operations reports to our Executive Vice President of Operations, who is responsible for guiding and integrating our longer-term strategy over talent selection, talent development and new restaurant openings as well as the roll-out of key operational initiatives. Additionally, we have a kitchen operations team that oversees the food quality and safety, kitchen efficiency and consistency in our restaurants and helps educate, coach and develop our kitchen managers. Our kitchen operations team reports to our Vice President of Culinary and Kitchen Operations.
 Each of our restaurants typically employs an approximate average of 110 hourly team members, many of whom work part-time. Our goal is to staff our restaurants with qualified, trained and enthusiastic team members who desire to be an integral part of BJ’s fun, premium casual atmosphere and, at the same time, have the passion, intensity, work ethic and ability to execute our concept correctly and consistently on every shift. In January 2019, we were awarded the Diamond Catalyst Award by Black Box Intelligence™, formerly TDn2K™ (Transforming Data into Knowledge) as a tribute to our superior operational and workplace results. This award honors restaurant organizations for workplace and employment excellence in the restaurant industry and for setting the standard for overall best-in-class business performance. Additionally, in January 2020, we were awarded the Best Practices Award by Black Box Intelligence™. This award honors restaurant organizations that lead the industry in workforce diversity, community involvement and sustainable practices. 
 Our normal restaurant hours of operations are generally from 11:00 a.m. to 12:00 a.m. Sunday through Thursday and 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. Friday and Saturday; however, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been closing approximately one hour earlier than normal. Our restaurants are typically open every day of the year except for Thanksgiving and Christmas. All of our restaurants currently offer take-out and delivery services. Additionally, all of our restaurants offer a call-ahead or online wait list, on-line ordering for dine-in, guest pick-up or curbside delivery and reservations for large parties. 
 RESTAURANT SITE SELECTION AND EXPANSION OBJECTIVES 

 Our current restaurant format is expected to represent the vast majority of our planned new restaurant growth for the foreseeable future. We may also open new brewpub locations (“brewing restaurants”) to maintain our beer supply as we open more restaurants or where on-site brewing is the only legally permissible way to offer our proprietary craft beer in a particular state. 
 We seek to secure high-quality, high-profile locations for our “casual plus” restaurants, which we believe have the ability to draw guests from a larger area than most “mass market” casual dining chain restaurants. Since BJ’s has proven that it can be successful in a variety of locations (suburban shopping areas, retail strip centers, lifestyle centers, and entertainment centers – either freestanding or in-line) and in a variety of income demographics, we can be highly selective and flexible in choosing suitable locations. We prefer to open our restaurants in mature trade areas with dense populations. We generally target geographic regions that allow us to build multiple restaurants in those areas. This “clustering” approach provides economic benefits including lower supply and distribution costs, improved marketing efficiencies, management supervision leverage and increased brand awareness. 
 During fiscal 2021, we opened two new restaurants and we re-opened our Richmond, Virginia restaurant which was temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we increased our overall total restaurant operating weeks by approximately 1.3% during the year. We expect to open as many as eight new restaurants in fiscal 2022. On December 30, 2021, we closed our Pasadena, California restaurant. We are currently under contract to sell certain assets of the Pasadena restaurant to a third-party buyer and upon close of escrow, the lease agreement will be assigned to the buyer who will purchase the liquor license and certain other assets within the restaurant. We expect to close escrow in late-February once the buyer obtains the necessary permits.
 We typically enter into operating leases for our locations for periods ranging from 10 to 20 years and obtain lease extension options in most instances. Our lease payment terms vary from lease to lease but generally provide for the payment of both minimum base rent and contingent (percentage) rent based on restaurant sales. We sometimes also purchase the land underlying certain restaurant locations if it becomes available and in many cases, we subsequently enter into sale-leaseback arrangements for land parcels that we have purchased. It is not our current strategy to own a large number of land parcels that underlie our restaurants. During fiscal 2020, and as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we negotiated lease payment deferrals and rent concessions for the majority of our leases.
 TARGETED NEW RESTAURANT ECONOMICS 
 Our current restaurant prototypes average approximately 7,500 square feet with seating for as many as 250 guests with a targeted gross construction cost of approximately $5.5 million to $6.5 million, some of which may be reimbursed to us by our 
 7


landlords in the form of tenant improvement allowance incentives. The increase in our targeted gross construction cost, as compared to prior years, is due to the rising cost of materials as well as increases in wages. The gross cost of our restaurants may vary due to a variety of factors and could be greater or less than the targeted amounts due to geographic location, trade labor costs and commodity inflation for building materials, such as lumber, steel and copper, among many other factors. Potential restaurant locations may not have a tenant improvement allowance available, and such allowances, when available, will vary in amount. In selecting sites for our restaurants, an important objective is to earn a suitable rate of return on our investment. However, this return often cannot be meaningfully measured until our restaurants reach their mature sales and profitability levels. Maturation periods vary from restaurant to restaurant, but generally range from two to five years. We currently target an approximate blended 20% return on our net cash invested to build a new restaurant and an approximate blended 15% return on total capital invested, which includes our net cash invested and a factor for the landlord’s invested capital (based on a capitalized value of minimum rents to be paid to the landlord) for each group of new restaurants to be opened each year, measured once the restaurants reach their mature level of operations. 
 The return-on-investment targets for our restaurant operations do not include any allocation of opening costs, field supervision and corporate support expense, non-cash items such as depreciation, amortization, equity-related compensation expense, interest expense and income taxes, and do not represent a targeted return on our common stock. There can be no assurance that any new restaurant opened will have similar operating results to those of established restaurants. Actual results usually differ from targeted results, and such differences may be material. Assuming that sales and margins will normalize to more historic trends as we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, we generally target our new restaurants to achieve average annual sales at maturity of $5 million to $6 million, and we generally target an average “four wall” estimated operating cash flow margin in the range of 15% to 20% at maturity, after all occupancy expenses. 
 It is common in the casual dining industry for many new locations to initially open with sales volumes well in excess of their sustainable run-rate levels. Given this initial “honeymoon” sales period, it may take up to five years until a new restaurant’s sales eventually settle at a more predictable and sustainable level. Additionally, all of our new restaurants usually require a year or longer after opening to reach their targeted restaurant-level operating margin due to cost of sales and labor inefficiencies commonly associated with opening more complex casual dining restaurants. 
 RESTAURANT OPENING EXPENSES 
 Restaurant opening expenses (also referred to as “preopening” expenses) include incremental out-of-pocket costs that are directly related to the openings of new restaurants and may not be capitalized. As a result of the more complex operational nature of our “casual plus” restaurant concept compared to that of a typical casual dining chain restaurant, the preopening process for our new restaurants is more extensive, time consuming and costly. The preopening expense for one of our restaurants usually includes costs to compensate an average of six to eight restaurant management team members prior to opening; costs to recruit and train an average of 150 hourly restaurant team members; wages, travel and lodging costs for our opening training team and other support team members; costs to practice service activities; and straight-line minimum base rent during the construction and in-restaurant training period. 
 Our preopening expense averaged approximately $0.6 million per new restaurant in fiscal 2021, which is approximately $0.2 million higher than prior years due to increased costs from inflationary pressures, including costs of labor and commodities. We usually incur the most significant portion of preopening costs within the two-month period immediately preceding a restaurant’s opening. Preopening costs can fluctuate significantly from period to period, based on the number and timing of restaurant openings and the specific preopening costs incurred for each restaurant. We expense preopening costs as incurred in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”).
 BREWING OPERATIONS
 Our internal brewing operations originated in 1996 with the opening of the first large format location in Brea, California, which included our first on-site brewing operation. We currently have five restaurants with brewpub operations and two stand-alone brewpubs located around the country. We also utilize qualified independent third-party brewers to produce our beer, using our proprietary recipes. Additionally, our brewing operations team analyzes each batch of BJ’s branded beer in internal laboratories and we periodically send samples to an independent laboratory for quality control testing purposes. Our brewing operations are typically staffed with a head brewer and assistant brewers, who report to a brewing director. Production planning and quality control are monitored by our corporate brewing operations department which is led by our Senior Vice President of Brewing Operations. 
 We currently believe a combination of internal brewing and larger-scale independent third-party brewing represents the optimal production method for our craft beers as we continue the national expansion of our restaurants. This approach allows us to get the benefits provided by brewing beer in larger batches, yet also provides us the flexibility to allow our brewing operations to focus on specialty, seasonal and research and development beers. During fiscal 2021, we internally brewed approximately 55% 
 8


of our branded craft beers, with approximately 59% of this amount brewed in our Temple, Texas brewpub locations. We also produce proprietary non-alcoholic craft sodas that are sold in our restaurants. Our craft soda flavors include root beer, ginger beer, cream, orange and black cherry soda. 
 MARKETING AND ADVERTISING 
 We believe the most effective method, over the long run, to protect and enhance our guest visit frequency is to spend time and resources on the plate and provide superior food quality, hospitality and facilities for our guests. That said, one of the key insights of our guest research in 2021 was that there are over 10 million potential guests who share many of the characteristics of our most frequent guests who have never been to a BJ’s, yet live within 10 miles of our restaurants. As a result, our external marketing is primarily focused on improving awareness and brand consideration in the markets where we operate. Our marketing spend generally takes the form of limited traditional television and connected television for those markets in which we have sufficient restaurant penetration. Additionally, we are able to leverage the information we have accumulated through data-driven paid digital, including pay-per-click, social content and streaming audio to better market our brand. We also utilize in-restaurant messaging and merchandising to promote our brand and drive our average check and also have a best-in-category loyalty program, BJ’s Premier Rewards Plus®, where our guests receive one to one communication and engagement programs to drive frequency and ambassadorship.
 Our marketing related expenditures were approximately 1.4%, 1.7%, and 2.2% of revenues for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We expect our marketing expenditures in 2022 to be 1.5% to 2.0% of our revenues. However, depending on the current operating conditions for casual dining restaurants and the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, we may decide to increase or decrease our marketing expenditures from our current expectations. 
 SEASONALITY AND ADVERSE WEATHER 
 Our business is impacted by weather and other seasonal factors that typically impact other restaurant operations. Holidays (and shifts in the holiday calendar) and severe weather including hurricanes, tornados, thunderstorms, snow and ice storms, prolonged extreme temperatures and similar conditions may impact restaurant sales volumes in some of the markets where we operate. Many of our restaurants are located in or near shopping centers and malls that typically experience seasonal fluctuations in sales. Quarterly results have been and will continue to be significantly impacted by the timing of new restaurant openings and their associated restaurant opening expenses. As a result of these and other factors, our financial results for any given quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year. 
INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND CYBERSECURITY 
 We continue to focus on providing our operators with best in class, intuitive, secure technology that is tailored to our business so they can provide unsurpassed hospitality to our guests and our team members in a productive and efficient manner. Our strategy of providing and enhancing integrated systems to drive operational efficiencies enables our restaurant teams to focus on achieving restaurant operations excellence. We have implemented technology-enabled business solutions for tableside order entry, kitchen and bar system automations, labor scheduling and productivity, cost management, food preparation, table management, inventory, guest service and team member training. We also utilize a centralized accounting and human capital management system, a data center technology service with cloud based technologies, and a talent development system to provide our team members a more engaged experience, which we believe can provide a competitive advantage in the tight labor market. We will continue to develop and deploy seamless, non-invasive restaurant and support technologies that help improve our guest experience, team member effectiveness and satisfaction, financial management and cost control. New technology is thoroughly tested and validated before any company-wide rollout is implemented.
 Our information is processed, transmitted, and stored in a secure environment using hardened, proven enterprise grade technologies in order to protect both our data and the physical computing assets. We guard against business interruption by maintaining a disaster recovery plan, which includes securely storing critical business information in multiple off-site data centers, testing the disaster recovery plan at a host-site facility and providing fault tolerant devices, communication services, and utilities. We perform third-party cybersecurity audits no less than annually, following the standard set by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. We also conduct third-party security reviews and testing of our network, processes and systems on a regular basis. We use internally developed proprietary software, cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) as well as purchased software, with proven, non-proprietary hardware. As a result, we have not experienced an information systems data breach to date. While we believe that our internal policies, systems and procedures for cybersecurity are thorough, the risk of a cybersecurity event cannot be eliminated. 
 We maintain a robust system of data protection and cybersecurity resources, technology and processes. In addition to performing an annual risk assessment and developing a mitigation plan, along with a comprehensive review and update of our 
 9


cybersecurity policies and procedures, we continuously evaluate new and emerging risks and ever-changing legal and compliance requirements. We monitor risks of sensitive information compromise at our business partners where relevant and reevaluate the risks at these partners periodically. We make strategic investments to address these risks and compliance requirements to keep Company, guest and team member data secure, including maintaining a network privacy and security insurance policy. We also perform annual and ongoing cybersecurity awareness training for our management and Restaurant Support Center team members as well as specialized training for our users with privileged access. In addition, we provide annual credit card handling training following Payment Card Industry (PCI) guidelines to all team members that handle guest credit cards.
 Our management believes that our current systems and practice of implementing regular updates position us well to support current needs and future growth. We use a strategic information systems multi-year planning process that involves senior management and is integrated into our overall business planning. We provide data protection and cybersecurity reports to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis and periodically to the full Board of Directors. Information systems projects are prioritized based upon strategic, financial, regulatory, risk and other business advantage criteria.
 SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT 
 Our supply chain department, working together with our culinary, marketing and operations teams, is responsible for the selection and procurement of all of the food ingredients, beverages, products and supplies for our restaurants and brewing operations. Specifications are mandated by the supply chain department in order to consistently maintain the highest quality ingredients and operational materials. Our goal is to obtain the highest quality menu ingredients, products and supplies from reliable sources at competitive prices. In order to maximize operating efficiencies between purchase and usage, a restaurant manager determines daily usage requirements for food ingredients, products and supplies for their restaurant and places orders with vendors approved by our supply chain department. A manager also inspects our deliveries to ensure that the items received meet our quality specifications and negotiated prices. For many of our menu ingredients, we have arranged for acceptable alternative manufacturers, vendors, growers and shippers in order to reduce risk in our supply chain. In addition to procuring food ingredients, beverages, products and supplies for our restaurants, the supply chain department also manages the procurement agreements in the areas of energy, transportation and general corporate services.
 Where economically feasible and possible, we attempt to negotiate contracts for key commodities used in the preparation of our food and beverage offerings, based on our expected requirements for each fiscal year. If our attempts are successful, most of our contracts typically range in duration from three to twelve months. Although we currently do not directly engage in future contracts or other financial risk management strategies with respect to potential commodity cost fluctuations, from time to time we may opportunistically request that our suppliers consider doing so to help minimize the impact of potential cost fluctuations. Suppliers will typically pass the cost of such strategies along to us, either directly or indirectly.
 We use a leading foodservice distributor to deliver the majority of our food products to our restaurants. We also have an agreement with the largest nationwide foodservice distributor of fresh produce in the United States to service most of our restaurants and, where licensed, to distribute our proprietary craft beer to our restaurants. This distributor currently delivers our proprietary craft beer to approximately 40% of our restaurants. 
 COMPETITION
 The domestic restaurant industry is highly competitive and generally considered to be mature. There are a substantial number of casual dining, fast casual and quick service restaurant chains and other food and beverage service operations, that compete both directly and indirectly with us in every respect, including food quality and service, the price‑value relationship, beer quality and selection, atmosphere, suitable sites for new restaurants and for qualified personnel to operate our restaurants, among other factors. We also compete within each of our trade areas with locally-owned restaurants. We face growing competition as a result of the trend toward convergence in grocery, deli and restaurant services, particularly in the supermarket industry which offers “convenient meals” in the form of improved entrées and side dishes.
 Our restaurant concept is a relatively small “varied menu” casual dining competitor compared to the mature “mass market” chains, with 61 of our restaurants currently located in one state - California. Our overall brand awareness and competitive presence in states outside of California is not as significant as that of our major casual dining chain competitors. Many competitors with similar concepts to ours have been in business longer than we have, have greater consumer awareness, and often have substantially greater capital, marketing and human resources. 
 We believe, however, that our ability to offer higher quality food and beverages at moderate prices with superior service in a distinctive dining environment provides us with the opportunity to capture additional market share in the casual dining segment.

FOOD QUALITY AND SAFETY 
 Our revenues can be substantially affected by adverse publicity resulting from food quality, illness, or health concerns stemming from incidents occurring at our restaurants, as well as incidents that may occur at our competitors’ restaurants. In addition, our revenues can be affected by illness or health concerns stemming from incidents occurring at our suppliers or competing suppliers or that appear to be transmitted via public interactions such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We attempt to manage risks of this nature by leveraging food quality and safety controls throughout our supply chain and internal training programs. While we believe that our internal policies and procedures for food safety and sanitation are thorough, the risk of food-borne illness cannot be completely eliminated, and incidents at other restaurant chains or in the food supply chain may affect our restaurants even if our restaurants are not implicated in a food safety concern.
 We are committed to serving safe, high quality food. Our food quality and safety teams strive to ensure compliance with our food safety programs and practices, components of which include:
  
• | Partnering with suppliers to improve food safety processes and technology
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Food safety training for all new team members
--+----------------------------------------------


• | Advanced food safety training for management trainees
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | Manager food safety certifications

• | Daily food safety checks based on Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (“HACCP”) principles
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Tamper-resistant bag seals for all take-out orders
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | Routine disinfection of high touch points
--+------------------------------------------


• | Daily team member wellness checks and stay at home requirements for symptomatic team members during the COVID-19 pandemic
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Utilization of technology to manage food safety risks
--+------------------------------------------------------

GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS 
 We are subject to various federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations that affect our business. Since March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in frequently revised state and local government regulations affecting our business, which have significantly impacted our restaurant operations and continue to do so. Regulations relating to opening and closing of restaurant dining rooms or outdoor patios, business hours, sanitation practices, to-go alcohol sales, guest spacing within dining rooms and other social distancing practices, and employment and safety-related laws involving contact tracing, exclusions and paid sick leave have materially affected the way we operate our business and serve our guests, and have adversely impacted our cost structure and resulting profitability of our restaurants.
 Each of our restaurants is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which may include alcoholic beverage control, labor/equal employment, building, land use, health, safety and fire agencies, and environmental regulations in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located. We believe that we are in compliance with all relevant laws, rules and regulations in all material respects. Difficulties obtaining or maintaining the required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the development of a new restaurant in a particular area or could adversely affect the operation of an existing restaurant. However, we have never experienced abnormal difficulties or delays in obtaining the licenses or approvals required to open a new restaurant or in continuing the operation of an existing restaurant. 
 Alcoholic beverage control regulations require each of our restaurants to apply to a federal and state authority and, in certain locations, municipal authorities for a license and permit to sell alcoholic beverages on and off-premises. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause by such authority at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations impact numerous aspects of the daily operations of our restaurants, including the minimum age of patrons and team members, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling, and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. 
 Our restaurants and brewing operations are subject to “tied house” laws and the “three tier system” of beverage alcohol distribution, which were introduced by various states after the repeal of Prohibition. These laws generally prohibit brewers from holding an interest in retail licenses and require manufacturers, distributors and retailers to remain separate “tiers.” Over the last 25 years, “brewpubs,” which are both retailers and onsite brewers, have been authorized by law in most states through specific exceptions to these laws. These exceptions are unique to each state and do not mirror one another. However, brewpubs 
 11


are generally licensed as retailers and do not have the same privileges as microbreweries, and the privileges of, and restrictions imposed on, brewpubs vary from state to state. These restrictions sometimes prevent us from operating both brewpubs and restaurants in some states. We believe that we are currently in compliance with the brewpub regulations in the states where we hold such licenses. However, there is some risk that a state’s brewpub regulations or the interpretation of these regulations may change in a way that could impact our current model of brewing beer and/or supplying beer to our restaurants in that state. We apply for our alcoholic beverage licenses with the advice of outside legal and licensing counsel and consultants. Even after the issuance of these licenses, our operations could be subject to differing interpretations of the “tied house” laws and the requirements of the “three tier system” of beverage alcohol distribution in any jurisdiction that we conduct business. Additionally, the failure to receive or retain, or a delay in obtaining, a liquor license in a particular location could adversely affect our ability to obtain such a license elsewhere. 
 We are subject to “dram-shop” statutes in California and other states in which we operate. Those statutes generally provide a person who has been injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that has wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to such person. We carry liquor liability coverage, as part of our existing comprehensive general liability insurance, which we believe is consistent with the coverage carried by other entities in the restaurant industry and would help protect us from exposure created by possible claims. Even though we carry liquor liability insurance, a judgment against us under a dram-shop statute in excess of our liability coverage could have a materially adverse effect on us. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are liable, claims may also be expensive to defend and may divert management’s time and our financial resources away from our operations. We may also be adversely affected by publicity resulting from such claims. 
 Various federal and state labor laws, along with rules and regulations, govern our relationship with our team members, including such matters as minimum wage, overtime, tip credits, health insurance, working conditions, safety and work eligibility requirements. Significant additional governmental mandates, such as an increased minimum wage, a change in the laws governing exempt team members, an increase in paid time off or leaves of absence, mandates on health benefits and insurance or increased tax reporting and payment requirements for team members who receive gratuities, could negatively impact our restaurants’ profitability. We are also subject to the regulations of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) branch of the United States Department of Homeland Security. In addition, some states in which we operate have adopted immigration employment protection laws. Even if we operate our restaurants in strict compliance with ICE and state requirements, some of our team members may not meet federal work eligibility requirements, despite our efforts and without our knowledge, which could lead to a disruption in our work force. Additionally, our suppliers may also be affected by various federal and state labor laws which could result in supply disruptions for our various goods and services or higher costs for goods and services supplied to us.
 We are subject to various laws and regulations relating to nutritional content, nutritional labeling, product safety and menu labeling. We are also subject to federal and state environmental regulations. Various laws concerning the handling, storage, and disposal of hazardous materials, such as cleaning solvents, and the operation of restaurants and brewpubs in environmentally sensitive locations may impact aspects of our operations. 
 Our facilities must comply with the applicable requirements of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”) and related state statutes. The ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability with respect to public accommodations and employment. Under the ADA and related state laws, when constructing new restaurants or undertaking significant remodeling of existing restaurants, we must make them readily accessible to disabled persons. We must also make reasonable accommodations for the employment of disabled persons.
 ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY 
 We recognize that building a sustainable business is consistent with our goal of providing long-term shareholder value. In fiscal year 2021, we created a sustainability leadership team to spearhead our Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) initiatives. In partnership with others in our operations, supply chain, and finance departments, the committee is responsible for creating a multi-year strategic plan establishing ESG initiatives. The committee provides updates to the Governance and Nominating Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. 
 In 2021, we published a Human and Labor Rights Policy, Environmental Stewardship Policy, Food and Personal Safety and Quality Policy, and Vendor Partner Compliance Program information. These policies confirm our focus on taking care of our people, communities, stakeholders and planet.
 Climate Change and Environmental Stewardship
 We are committed to reducing our impact on air, land and water across our restaurants, Restaurant Support Center and global supply chain. We recognize the impact greenhouse gas emissions have on climate change and the importance of water 
 12


conservation and sustainability for our planet. We’ve made it a priority to work with our team members and vendor partners to reduce our carbon footprint and environmental impact.
 We are in the process of identifying consultants to assist us in measuring our emissions and developing additional programs to reduce our overall carbon footprint. 
 Examples of programs we have implemented include:
  
• | Use of recycled products for the lids and bases of our take-out containers
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Use of 100% recycled napkins and paper towels
--+----------------------------------------------


• | Use of plastic bags made of 20% post-consumer resin
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | Portioning paper towels to reduce waste
--+----------------------------------------


• | Installation of flush-valve toilets and faucets in our newer restaurants
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Adding electric vehicles to our fleet vehicle program
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | Use of energy-efficient HVAC equipment
--+---------------------------------------


• | Recycling of organics to prevent them from going into landfills at over 10% of our restaurants
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Use of digital rather than paper new-hire onboarding and other employment-related documents across our company
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Hybrid in-person/remote work schedule at our Restaurant Support Center to balance the importance of workplace culture and stewardship of the environment, including leveraging of video and telephone conferencing tools to reduce the need for travel to in-person meetings
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 INSURANCE 
 We maintain comprehensive insurance coverage, including, but not limited to, property, casualty, directors and officers liability and network privacy security liability, with coverage and limits we believe are currently appropriate for our operations. We retain a substantial portion of our workers’ compensation and general liability costs through self-insured retentions and large deductibles. There is no assurance that any insurance coverage maintained by us will be adequate or that we will not experience claims in excess of our coverage limits; that we can continue to obtain and maintain such insurance at all; or that our premium costs will not rise to an extent that they will adversely affect our ability to economically obtain or maintain such insurance. As with the vast majority of businesses in the United States, we do not have insurance coverage related to business interruptions or other effects of any pandemic (and specifically COVID-19). We carry employment practices insurance, which covers claims involving matters such as harassment, discrimination, and wrongful termination; however, it excludes class and collective action wage and hour claims. A settlement or judgment against us in excess of, or outside of, our coverage limitations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial position and business. See “Limitations in our insurance coverage or rising insurance costs could adversely affect our business or financial condition in certain circumstances” in “Risk Factors” contained in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
TRADEMARKS AND COPYRIGHTS 
 We believe that our trademarks, service marks and other proprietary rights have significant value and are important to our brand-building effort and the marketing of our restaurant concept. Our domestically-registered trademarks and service marks include, among others, our stylized logos displaying the name “BJ’s” for restaurant services, restaurant and bar services, on-line ordering and take-out restaurant services and the word mark “BJ’s” for restaurant and bar services, take-out and carry-out restaurant services. We have also registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office many of our standard and seasonal beer logos and names, as well as many of our signature menu item names including “Great White” and “Sweet Pig” for our proprietary pizzas, “Pizookie” for our proprietary dessert and “Enlightened Entrees,” “Craft Matters” and “Wow, I Love This Place” for our branding. We have registered our BJ’s logo mark in a number of foreign countries. Additional domestic and foreign trademark applications are pending. We have also registered our ownership of the internet domain name “www.bjsrestaurants.com” and other internet domain names. We have in the past protected, and expect to continue to vigorously protect, our proprietary rights. We cannot predict whether steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of these rights or the use by others of restaurant features based upon, or otherwise similar to, our concept and products. There may be other restaurants, retailers and/or businesses that also use our marks in some form or fashion throughout the United States and abroad. It may be difficult for us to prevent others from copying elements of our concept. Any litigation undertaken to enforce our rights will likely be costly. In addition, we may face claims of misappropriation or infringement of third parties’ trademarks, patents or other intellectual property rights. Defending these 
 13


claims may be costly and, if unsuccessful, may prevent us from continuing to use certain intellectual property rights or information in the future and may result in a judgment or monetary damages.
