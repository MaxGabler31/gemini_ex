Item 1. BUSINESS
HISTORY OF OUR COMPANY
 
The Greater Cannabis Company, Inc. was formed in March 2014 as a limited liability company under the name, The Greater Cannabis Company, LLC. The Company remained a wholly owned subsidiary of Sylios Corp until March 2017. The Company’s business plan is to concentrate on cannabis related investment and development opportunities through its online retail store, direct equity investments, joint ventures, licensing agreements or acquisitions. Our current operations are focused on our online store, GCC Superstore.
 
Our principal executive office is located at The Greater Cannabis Company, Inc., 244 2nd Ave N., Suite 9, St. Petersburg, FL 33701, and our telephone number is (727) 482-1505.
 
OUR CURRENT BUSINESS
 
The Company’s business segments are divided into four operating segments:
 
1. E-commerce- Through the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, GCC Superstore, LLC, the Company has established an online store whose merchandise includes pipes, vaporizers, grinders, hemp related products, CBD (Cannabidiol) related products and additional products focusing on the cannabis industry. The online store, GCC Superstore, was opened in June 2017 and can be found at www.gccsuperstore.com. At present, the GCC Superstore carries in excess of 1000 products from 20 suppliers and over 50 brands. The online store operates under a “drop-ship” model which affords it the benefit of less capital expenditure on inventory. Please see NOTE K - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS for further information.


2. Advertising- With the development of the GCC Superstore, the Company will place directed advertising throughout the online store. Advertising will originate through Google AdSense or direct-advertising sales by the Company. The company will also use social media outlets such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram in an effort to attract customers with product specific advertisements or posts.
 
3. Licensing- The Company is actively seeking licensing opportunities in the cannabis sector, for intellectual property, products and dispensary means. At present, the Company does not have any active licensing agreements. On July 31, 2014, the Company entered into a Licensing Agreement with Artemis Dispensing Technologies for the development and resell of an automated dispensing product. Under the collaboration and license agreement, Artemis was to be responsible for the development of a high end automated dispensing product. Upon launch and sales of the product, Artemis was to be responsible for the installation, training and customer support for the hardware and software. The Company was to be responsible for direct sales, addition of key distributors and sublicensing of specific territories within the U.S. The initial term of the Agreement expired December 31, 2016 and in the opinion of management the Agreement is no longer in effect. Please see NOTE C-ARTEMIS LICENSING AGREEMENT for further information.
 
4. Direct Investments- The Company may, at its election, directly invest in private entities within the cannabis sector either through stock purchase agreements, debentures, joint ventures or a hybrid of each. The Company’s planned investments will focus on those entities whose near-term goals are to maximum shareholder value through the filing of an initial public offering or a corporate event that takes the entity from private to public. Investments will be made through the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary GCC Investment Holdings, LLC.

The GCC Superstore
 
GCC Superstore Store
 
The Greater Cannabis Company, Inc. operates the GCC Superstore, an online store built on the Shopify platform. Visitors are able to order pipes, vaporizers, CBD products and other hemp and cannabis related products by selecting the products they would like to order, entering their shipping and billing information and confirming the order. The GCC Superstore is part of the Company’s primary business plan. The Company intends on aggressively expanding its product line over the next two quarters. As a drop-ship business model, the Company is not required to acquire excessive inventory.
 
The GCC Superstore is accessible at the Company’s a website, www.GCCSuperstore.com. The Company is currently in the process of developing an app as a free mobile application which can be downloaded through the iOS APP Store or the Google Play Marketplace. The Company anticipates that the mobile app will be fully developed and ready for download during the second quarter of 2018. There is no guarantee that either marketplace will approve the downloading of the Company’s app due to the nature of our business.
 
Background GCC Superstore, LLC
 
On January 9, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors voted to file Articles of Organization to form a new entity, GCC Superstore, LLC. The Articles of Organization were filed with the State of Florida on January 13, 2017 with a requested effective date of January 9, 2017. The GCC Superstore, LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
In June 2017, we launched our online store, GCC Superstore, with limited merchandise such as pipes, vaporizers, CDB, hemp and cannabis related products.
 
As an online retail store operating under a drop-ship model, GCC Superstore is able to rapidly scale its products and services with minimal marginal costs - each additional brand, category or product that we add to our platform adds negligible server hosting costs. It also allows us to have a virtual presence and exposure to every regulated cannabis market without establishing a costly physical presence in each state. This minimizes the costs of scaling and required capital while, at the same time, offering a direct role in the cannabis industry without ever touching the plant itself.
 
GCC Superstore, LLC Products
 
Currently, our products at our online store, GCC Superstore, consist of approximately 1000 SKU’s from 20 suppliers and in excess of 50 brands. Some of the more well-known brands we carry are Atmos, Green Flash Glass, Boundless, Cloud, Exxus, Santa Cruz, Grav, Cali Crusher just to name a few. Our business model consists of two revenue streams through the GCC Superstore. The first is through our direct customer sales and the second is through our business advertising portal throughout the GCC Superstore.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company’s revenue was negatively impacted due to the termination of its former merchant agreement through the Shopify platform. The Company’s former merchant vendor elected to terminate the agreement due to certain products that the GCC Superstore carried and sold. The Company has identified a new merchant vendor that will permit the GCC Superstore to carry certain products such as CBD and Kratom. Once fully implemented, sales transactions can be completed on the GCC Superstore.
 
Employees and Consultants
 
The Greater Cannabis Company, Inc. has 1 part-time employee, and two part-time independent contractors. The Company has utilized the services of two web development firms to build out the GCC Superstore. The Company’s current President, Wayne Anderson, also serves in the role of another publicly traded company, Sylios Corp. The Company anticipates that it will need to retain the services of additional management and key personnel in the near future to further its business plan.
Facilities
 
Our principal executive offices are now located at 244 2nd Ave N., Suite 9, St. Petersburg, FL 33701. Our registered office in Florida is located at 244 2nd Ave N., Suite 9, St. Petersburg, FL 33701, and our registered agent is our former parent company, Sylios Corp.
Market Conditions
 
The cannabis industry continues to exceed other industries’ growth rates and retain the title of the “fastest-growing industry in the U.S.” as the Huffington Post reported in 2015.
 
Marijuana sales in North America reached $6.73 billion in 2016, reflecting 34% growth over 2015 ($5.04 billion), according to ArcView Market Research/BDS Analytics. The research firm projects sales to jump to $21.6 billion by 2021, representing a 26% compound annual growth rate (CAGR).
 
While the industry is growing rapidly, the cannabis industry faces four major obstacles that challenge its growth and profitability. First, the cultivation of cannabis is a very capital-intensive enterprise. Many cannabis entrepreneurs do not have access to the capital required to build the infrastructure required to meet growing demand and sales projections. Traditional sources of financing, such as banks, are not available currently to cannabis producers and retailers. Second, there is a significant shortage of knowledge related to virtually all areas of the cannabis business. When new states are added to the list of regulated cannabis markets, there will be a scarcity of experience and expertise to serve the needs of growers and retailers in these states. Third, the majority of states do not allow access to medical cannabis for its patients. This presents an obstacle to the medical cannabis industry and requires financial resources and dedicated advocacy to change regulations on the state level. Fourth, as explained below, marijuana is illegal under federal law.

Government Regulations
 
Cannabis is currently a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA and is, therefore, illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of cannabis has been legalized pursuant to state law, its use, possession or cultivation remains a violation of federal law. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as one that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) defines Schedule I controlled substances as “the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence.” If the federal government decides to enforce the CSA in Colorado with respect to cannabis, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute or growing cannabis could be subject to fines and/or terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine.
 
Notwithstanding the CSA, as of the date of this filing, 28 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories of Guam and Puerto Rico allow their residents to use medical cannabis. Voters in the states of Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon and Washington have approved ballot measures to legalize cannabis for adult recreational use. Such state and territorial laws are in conflict with the federal CSA, which makes cannabis use and possession illegal at the federal level.
 
In light of such conflict between federal laws and state laws regarding cannabis, the previous administration under President Obama had effectively stated that it was not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical cannabis. For example, the prior DOJ Deputy Attorney General of the Obama administration, James M. Cole, issued a memorandum (the “Cole Memo”) to all United States Attorneys providing updated guidance to federal prosecutors concerning cannabis enforcement under the CSA (see “-The Cole Memo”). In addition, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) provided guidelines (the “FinCEN Guidelines”) on February 14, 2014, regarding how financial institutions can provide services to cannabis-related businesses consistent with their Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) obligations (see “-FinCEN”).
 
Additional existing and pending legislation provides, or seeks to provide, protection to persons acting in violation of federal law but in compliance with state laws regarding cannabis. The Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment to the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, which funds the DOJ, prohibits the DOJ from using funds to prevent states with medical cannabis laws from implementing such laws. The Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment is effective through April 28, 2017, but as an amendment to an appropriations bill, it must be renewed annually. The Compassionate Access Compassionate Access, Research Expansion, and Respect States Act (the “CARERS Act”) has been introduced in the U.S. Senate, which proposes to reclassify cannabis under the CSA to Schedule II, thereby changing the plant from a federally criminalized substance to one that has recognized medical uses. More recently, the Respect State Marijuana Laws Act of 2017 has been introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives, which proposes to exclude persons who produce, possess, distribute, dispense, administer or deliver marijuana in compliance with state laws from the regulatory controls and administrative, civil and criminal penalties of the CSA.
 
However, as of the date of this filing, neither the CARERS Act nor the Respect State Marijuana Laws Act of 2017 has been enacted, the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment has not yet been renewed beyond April 28, 2017, and the new administration under President Trump has not yet indicated whether it will change the previously stated policy of low-priority enforcement of federal laws related to cannabis set forth in the Cole Memo or the FinCEN Guidelines. The Trump administration could change this policy and decide to strongly enforce the federal laws applicable to cannabis. Any such change in the federal government’s enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us. While we do not currently harvest, distribute or sell cannabis, we may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement policies of the federal government. However, as of the date of this filing, we have provided products and services to state-approved cannabis cultivators and dispensary facilities. As a result of our providing ancillary products and services to state-approved cannabis cultivators and dispensary facilities, we could be deemed to be aiding and abetting illegal activities, a violation of federal law.
 
Absent any future changes in cannabis-related policies under the Trump administration, we intend to remain within the guidelines outlined in the Cole Memo (see “-The Cole Memo”) and the FinCEN Guidelines (see “-FinCEN”), where applicable; however, we cannot provide assurance that we are in full compliance with the Cole Memo, the FinCEN Guidelines or any applicable federal laws or regulations.

Cole Memo
 
Because of the discrepancy between the laws in some states, which permit the distribution and sale of medical and recreational cannabis, from federal law that prohibits any such activities, DOJ Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole issued the Cole Memo concerning cannabis enforcement under the CSA. The Cole Memo guidance applies to all of the DOJ’s federal enforcement activity, including civil enforcement and criminal investigations and prosecutions, concerning cannabis in all states.
 
The Cole Memo reiterates Congress’s determination that cannabis is a dangerous drug and that the illegal distribution and sale of cannabis is a serious crime that provides a significant source of revenue to large-scale criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels. The Cole Memo notes that the DOJ is committed to enforcement of the CSA consistent with those determinations. It also notes that the DOJ is committed to using its investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most effective, consistent, and rational way. In furtherance of those objectives, the Cole Memo provides guidance to DOJ attorneys and law enforcement to focus their enforcement resources on persons or organizations whose conduct interferes with any one or more of the following important priorities (the “Enforcement Priorities”) in preventing:
 

● | the distribution of cannabis to minors; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | revenue from the sale of cannabis from going to criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels; 
● | the diversion of cannabis from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states; 
● | state-authorized cannabis activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity; 
● | violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of cannabis; 
● | drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with cannabis use; 
● | the growing of cannabis on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by cannabis production on public lands; and 
● | cannabis possession or use on federal property. 

 
We intend to conduct rigorous due diligence to verify the legality of all activities that we engage in and ensure that our activities do not interfere with any of the Enforcement Priorities set forth in the Cole Memo.
 
The Cole Memo is meant only as a guide for United States Attorneys and does not alter in any way the Department of Justice’s authority to enforce Federal law, including Federal laws relating to cannabis, regardless of state law. We believe we have implemented procedures and policies to ensure we are operating in compliance with the “Cole Memo”. However, we cannot provide assurance that our actions are in full compliance with the Cole Memo or any other laws or regulations. Per The Greater Cannabis Company, Inc. and that of its wholly owned subsidiary, GCC Superstore, LLC, Terms and Conditions:
 

● | Users must agree that they are located in a state where medical-use or adult-use of cannabis is legal; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Users must be of legal age to consume cannabis in their particular state (18 or 21 years old, depending on the state); 
● | Users may only post content that is in compliance with their state’s laws; 
● | Users may not solicit or distribute cannabis through The Greater Cannabis Company, Inc. or its GCC Superstore; 
● | Posting of any other drugs or substances, including prescription pain pills, is prohibited and will result in account termination; 
● | Posting of any violence or threat of violence is prohibited and will result in account termination; 
● | Posting of any drugged-driving content is prohibited and will result in account termination; and 
● | Posting of any copyright-protected content is prohibited and will result in account termination.

We have implemented an aggressive content and account review program to ensure compliance with our Terms and Conditions. When an account is reported, the post is automatically removed from the GCC Superstore until further review. The Greater Cannabis Company, Inc. then reviews the content within 24 hours and either approves it as within our Terms and Conditions or permanently deletes it and bans the Customer’s account.
 
Our business plan includes allowing cannabis dispensaries to advertise on our website which we believe could be deemed to be aiding and abetting illegal activities, a violation of Federal law. We intend to remain within the guidelines outlined in the Cole Memo. However, we cannot provide assurance that we are in full compliance with the Cole Memo or any other laws or regulations.
 
Rohrabacher Farr Amendment
 
On December 16, 2014, H.R. 83 - Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 was enacted and included a provision known as the “Rohrabacher Farr Amendment” which states:
 
None of the funds made available in this Act to the Department of Justice may be used, with respect to the States of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin, to prevent such States from implementing their own State laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana.
 
The Rohrabacher Farr Amendment represents one of the first times in recent history that Congress has taken action indicating support of medical cannabis. The Rohrabacher Farr Amendment was renewed by Congress in 2015 and remains in effect currently.
 
The Rohrabacher Farr Amendment would appear to protect the right of the states to determine their own laws on medical cannabis use; however, the actual effects of the amendment are still unclear. The Rohrabacher Farr Amendment did not remove the federal ban on medical cannabis and cannabis remains regulated as a Schedule I controlled substance. Further, the United States Department of Justice has interpreted the Rohrabacher Farr Amendment as only preventing federal action that prevents states from creating and implementing cannabis laws - not against the individuals or businesses that actually carry out cannabis laws - and has continued to sporadically commence enforcement actions against individuals or businesses participating in the cannabis industry despite such participation being legal under state law. Whether this interpretation is appropriate is still being litigated, and, while an initial district court decision has not supported the Department of Justice’s interpretation, such decision is currently under appellate review. In addition, no matter what interpretation is adopted by the courts, there is no question that the Rohrabacher Farr Amendment does not protect any party not in full compliance with state medicinal cannabis laws.
 
Potential Changes to Federal Laws and Enforcement Priorities
 
Although the Department of Justice has stated in the Cole Memo that it is not an efficient use of limited resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state laws allowing the use and distribution of medical cannabis, there is no guarantee that the Department of Justice’s position will not change regarding the low-priority enforcement of federal laws. Further, the United States has a new administration in 2017, which could introduce a less favorable cannabis enforcement policy. There can be no assurances that any future administration would not change the current enforcement policy and decide to strongly enforce the federal laws.
 
In light of the 2005 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Gonzales v. Raich, under the commerce clause of the constitution, Congress may pass laws to criminalize the production and use of home-grown cannabis even where states have approved its use for medicinal purposes, which leads to the conclusion that the Controlled Substances Act may preempt state laws relating to any cannabis-related activity. Any such change in the federal enforcement program of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to our business. While we do not directly harvest, distribute, or distribute cannabis today, we still may be deemed to be violating federal law and may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement by the federal or state governments.
