ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
General 
ABM Industries Incorporated, which operates through its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as “ABM,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”), is a leading provider of integrated facility, infrastructure, and mobility solutions with a mission to make a difference, every person, every day. Our history dates back to 1909, when American Building Maintenance Company began as a window washing company in San Francisco with one employee. In 1985, we were incorporated in Delaware under the name American Building Maintenance Industries, Inc., as the successor to the business originally founded in 1909. In 1994, we changed our name to ABM Industries Incorporated. Since that time, we have grown into a multi-segment facility solutions company, primarily through strategic acquisitions and new service offerings, increasing our revenue to more than $7.5 billion.
The acquisition of OneSource in 2007 bolstered ABM as a leader in the janitorial market, while the Linc Group acquisition in 2010 established ABM as a “facility solutions” company with new service offerings, including lighting, mechanical, and electrical “technical solutions.” With demand increasing for industry-specific service providers, in 2012 we purchased Air Serv and established “aviation” as our first industry group. In recent years, we have strategically acquired companies in the United Kingdom (“UK”) and the island of Ireland, which expanded our janitorial and technical solutions businesses overseas. 
In 2015, we began a comprehensive transformational initiative (“2020 Vision”) to drive long-term, profitable growth through an industry-based, go-to-market approach. Through this initiative, we centralized key functional areas and industry groups, strengthened our sales capabilities, and initiated investments in service delivery tools and processes to help support standard operating practices that we believe remain foundational to our long-term success. 
As part of the transformation initiative, we also evaluated all of our service offerings and sold our Security and Government Services businesses, which did not align with our long-term focus on specialized industry groups.
In 2017, we acquired GCA Services Group (“GCA”), a provider of integrated facility services to educational institutions and commercial facilities, for approximately $1.3 billion, the largest acquisition in ABM history. The acquisition accelerated the Company’s position as a leading facility solutions provider in the education market. 
In 2021, we acquired Crown Building Maintenance Co. and Crown Energy Services, Inc. (collectively, “Able”), a leading facilities services company headquartered in San Francisco, California, with the goal to provide additional scaling to the Company’s core businesses and key geographies and bolstering ABM’s janitorial and facilities services service lines. In addition, the acquisition of Able (“the Able Acquisition”) further expands ABM’s sustainability and energy efficiency offerings amid growing demand for environmentally responsible solutions.
Building off the foundation of our 2020 Vision initiative, in 2021, we also launched our next five-year strategic plan, ELEVATE (described below). Reflecting the ELEVATE strategy to grow through strategic acquisitions that expand the Company’s core capabilities in attractive geographies and dynamic end-markets, in 2022, ABM completed two strategic acquisitions, including: 
•Dublin, Ireland-based Momentum Support (“Momentum”), a leading independent provider of facility services, primarily janitorial, across the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The addition of Momentum provided greater access to Momentum’s blue-chip customer base with the opportunity to cross sell ABM services to existing U.S.- and UK-based clients who also have an operational footprint in Ireland and Northern Ireland. 
•Alpharetta, Georgia-based RavenVolt, Inc. (“RavenVolt”), a leading nationwide provider of advanced turn-key microgrid systems utilized by diversified commercial and industrial customers, national retailers, utilities, and municipalities. A complementary extension of ABM’s Technical Solutions service offerings, the addition of RavenVolt enhances ABM’s position as a market leader in electric vehicle (“EV”) charging infrastructure, power, and bundled energy solutions.
As a result of these strategic changes and investments, we have strengthened our ability to offer janitorial, engineering, parking and eMobility, infrastructure, electrical, lighting and energy solutions, HVAC and mechanical services, landscaping and turf services, and mission critical solutions across aviation, education, manufacturing and distribution, and commercial business industries, on a standalone basis or in combination, and positioned ourselves as a leading integrated facilities management company.
Unless otherwise indicated, all references to years are to our fiscal year, which ends on October 31.
Forward-Looking Strategic Plan
Leveraging the various accomplishments achieved through 2020 Vision, in 2021, the Company embarked on the next step of our journey with a multiyear strategic plan called ELEVATE. The ELEVATE strategy is designed to strengthen our industry leadership position through end-market repositioning and building on our core services, which we expect together will drive significant long-term value for our stakeholders.
We will continue to make significant investments, which, as previously stated, are expected to total $150 – $175 million over the life of the program and we will continue to implement various measures with the aim to ELEVATE:
•the client experience, by serving as a trusted advisor who can provide innovative multiservice solutions and consistent service delivery;
•the team member experience, by investing in workforce management, training, developing the next generation of ABM leaders, and building on our inclusive culture; and
•our use of technology and data to power client and employee experiences with cutting-edge data and analytics, processes, and tools that will fundamentally change how we operate our business.
Contract Types
We generate revenues under several types of contracts, as explained below. Generally, the type of contract is determined by the nature of the services. Although many of our service agreements are cancelable on short notice, we have historically had a high rate of client retention and expect to continue maintaining long-term relationships with our clients. See Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” in the Notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the contract types that are most common in each of our service lines. 

Contract Type | Description 
Monthly Fixed-Price | These arrangements are contracts in which the client agrees to pay a fixed fee every month over a specified contract term. 
Square-Foot | Square-foot arrangements are contracts in which the client agrees to pay a fixed fee every month based on the actual square footage serviced over a specified contract term. 
Cost-Plus | These arrangements are contracts in which the clients reimburse us for the agreed-upon amount of wages and benefits, payroll taxes, insurance charges, and other expenses associated with the contracted work, plus a profit margin. 
Work Orders | Work orders generally consist of supplemental services requested by clients outside of the standard service specification and include cleanup after tenant moves, construction cleanup, flood cleanup, snow removal, and high touchpoint disinfecting services.
Transaction-Price | These are arrangements in which customers are billed a fixed price for each transaction performed on a monthly basis (e.g., wheelchair passengers served or airplane cabins cleaned). 
Hourly | In hourly arrangements, the client is billed a fixed hourly rate for each labor hour provided. 
Management Reimbursement | Under these parking arrangements, we manage a parking facility for a management fee and pass through the revenue and expenses associated with the facility to the owner. 
Leased Location | Under these parking arrangements, we pay a fixed amount of rent plus a percentage of revenues derived from monthly and transient parkers to the property owner. We retain all revenues received and are responsible for most operating expenses incurred. 
Allowance | Under these parking arrangements, we are paid a fixed amount or hourly fee to provide parking services, and we are responsible for certain operating expenses, as specified in the contract. 
Energy Savings Contracts and Fixed-Price Repair and Refurbishment | Under these arrangements, we agree to develop, design, engineer, and construct a project. Additionally, as part of bundled energy solutions arrangements, we guarantee the project will satisfy agreed-upon performance standards. 
Franchise | We franchise certain engineering services through individual and area franchises under the Linc Service and TEGG brands, which are part of ABM Technical Solutions. 
Microgrid Systems Installation | Under these arrangements, we provide electrical contracting services for energy related products such as the installation of solar solutions, battery storage, distributed generation, and other specialized electric trades. 

Segment and Geographic Financial Information
Our current reportable segments consist of Business & Industry (“B&I”), Manufacturing & Distribution (“M&D”), Education, Aviation, and Technical Solutions. The recently acquired Momentum is integrated within our B&I reportable segment, and RavenVolt is positioned within Technical Solutions. For segment and geographic financial information, see Note 17, “Segment and Geographic Information,” in the Notes to consolidated financial statements. 
REPORTABLE SEGMENTS AND DESCRIPTIONS
 | B&I, our largest reportable segment, encompasses janitorial, facilities engineering, and parking services for commercial real estate properties (including corporate offices for high tech clients), sports and entertainment venues, and traditional hospitals and non-acute healthcare facilities. B&I also provides vehicle maintenance and other services to rental car providers. 
 | M&D provides integrated facility services, engineering, janitorial, and other specialized services in different types of manufacturing, distribution, and data center facilities. We typically provide these services pursuant to monthly fixed-price, square-foot, cost-plus, and parking arrangements (i.e., management reimbursement, leased location, or allowance) that are obtained through a competitive bid process as well as pursuant to work orders. 
 | Education delivers janitorial, custodial, landscaping and grounds, facilities engineering, and parking services for public school districts, private schools, colleges, and universities. These services are typically provided pursuant to monthly fixed-price, square-foot, and cost-plus arrangements that are obtained through either a competitive bid process or re-bid upon renewal as well as pursuant to work orders. 
 | Aviation supports airlines and airports with services ranging from parking and janitorial to passenger assistance, catering logistics, air cabin maintenance, and transportation. We typically provide services to clients in this segment under master services agreements. These agreements are typically re-bid upon renewal and are generally structured as monthly fixed-price, square-foot, cost-plus, parking, transaction-price, and hourly arrangements. One client accounted for approximately 16% of revenues for this segment in 2022.
 | Technical Solutions specializes in facility infrastructure, mechanical and electrical services, including EV power design, installation and maintenance, as well as microgrid systems installation. These services can also be leveraged for cross-selling across all of our industry groups, both domestically and internationally. Contracts for this segment are generally structured as energy savings, fixed-price repair, refurbishment contracts, and franchise arrangements. 

Service Marks, Trademarks, and Trade Names
We hold various service marks, trademarks, and/or trade names, such as “ABM,” “ABM Building Value,” “ABM GreenCare,” “ABM EnhancedClean,” “ABM EnhancedFacility,” “Linc Service,” “TEGG,” “ABM Connect,” “ABM Vantage,” “Momentum Support Services,” and “RavenVolt,” which we deem important to our marketing activities, to our business, and, in some cases, to the franchising activities conducted by our Technical Solutions segment.
Dependence on Significant Client
No client accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues during 2022, 2021, or 2020.
Competition
We believe that each aspect of our business is highly competitive and that such competition is based primarily on price, quality of service, efficiency enhancements, adapting to changing workplace conditions, and ability to anticipate and respond to industry changes. A majority of our revenue is derived from projects requiring competitive bids; however, an invitation to bid is often conditioned upon prior experience, industry expertise, and financial strength. The low cost of entry in the facility services business results in a very competitive market. We mainly compete with regional and local owner-operated companies that may have more acute vision into local markets and significantly lower labor and overhead costs, providing them with competitive advantages in those regards. We also compete indirectly with companies that can perform for themselves one or more of the services we provide. 
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing activities include digital engagement and direct interactions with prospective and existing clients, pricing, proposal management, and customer relationship management by dedicated business development teams, operations personnel, and management. These activities are executed by branch and regional sales, marketing, and operations teams assigned to our industry groups and are supported by centralized sales support teams, inside sales teams, and marketing personnel. The sales and marketing teams acquire, nurture, and manage leads through the sales buying process, as well as train personnel on product offerings, sales tools, and proposal systems, all governed by standard operating procedures. 
Regulatory Environment
Our operations are subject to various federal, state, and/or local laws, rules, and regulations regulating among other things, labor, wages, and health and safety matters, as well as laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Historically, the cost of complying with these laws, rules, and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”), Responsible Practices, and Corporate Citizenship 
Our mission is to make a difference — for all those we serve, including our employees, clients, shareholders, communities, and the world around us. As a company with more than 110 years of history and experience, we embrace our role in taking care of people, places and spaces in ways that are ethical, responsible, respectful, inclusive, and environmentally sustainable. We understand the need to embed and integrate responsible and community-minded business practices into and within our operations and commit to standards to create value and support the long-term success of our business, shareholders, employees, and clients. 
Our strategy has evolved over the years to align with the needs of our business and our clients with our stakeholders’ expectations regarding ESG policies. We have established three strategic areas of focus to guide our ESG practices: 
•doing business in a responsible way to ensure compliance with ethical business practices; bring sustainable services to the market; and engage with the local communities in which we operate;
•ensuring the well-being and professional development of our employees by cultivating a culture where our employees feel seen, heard, and valued, and can grow a career and a future with ABM in a safe and healthy environment; and
•managing our environmental footprint through our expanding offering of sustainable services and measuring and enhancing our business practices to manage the greenhouse gas emissions footprint of our own operations. 
Our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the Company’s activities and practices relating to ESG, Our Board of Directors receives regular reports from meetings of its Stakeholder and Enterprise Risk Committee, which is responsible for oversight of (i) social matters, including, but not limited to, diversity, culture and inclusion, employee engagement, talent development and safety; (ii) environmental issues, including, but not limited to, sustainability and climate change; and (iii) enterprise and strategic risks. Our Board of Directors also receives regular reports from meetings of its Governance Committee, which is responsible for oversight of our Company’s corporate governance practices. Additionally, our internal culture, sustainability, diversity, equity and inclusion teams works in cross functional collaboration with departments throughout and across the enterprise to advance our ESG strategies, and regularly present to the Board of Directors’ Stakeholder and Enterprise Risk Committee.
Since 2011, we have voluntarily published an ESG Impact Report on an annual basis in alignment with the Global Reporting Initiative framework and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board to address our business, our employees, and the environment. More information about our sustainability performance, progress, and goals can be found in the corporate sustainability section of our corporate website. 
Human Capital
Our employees are the driving force behind everything we do, and supporting our employees is a foundational value for the Company. Direct labor costs represented 70% of our total revenue for 2022. As of October 31, 2022, we employed approximately 127,000 employees, of whom approximately 45,000, or 35%, were subject to various local collective bargaining agreements. As of October 31, 2022, our frontline employees represented 92% of our total workforce, while staff and management employees represented the other 8%.
Our human capital strategy is grounded and guided by our values and our employees. We prioritize our human capital development in order to do business in a responsible way and ensure our employees’ and clients’ success. The execution of this strategy is overseen at the highest levels of our organization, from our Board of Directors, our Board of Directors’ Stakeholder and Enterprise Risk Committee, and across our senior management. 
Business ethics
Our Code of Business Conduct ensures that our core values of respect, integrity, collaboration, innovation, trust, and excellence are applied throughout our operations. Our Code of Business Conduct serves as a critical tool to help all of us recognize and report unethical conduct, while preserving and nurturing our culture of honesty and accountability. We provide a comprehensive annual training and certification program on our Code of Business Conduct for our Board of Directors and all of our staff and management employees. 
Human resources, hiring, and training
With a team of approximately 127,000 employees across the United States, UK, and other locations, we continue to make investments in our human resources (“HR”) organization and structure toward centralized and standardized hiring and training practices, including incorporating modeling and advanced analytics in our HR processes to drive improvement in the retention and engagement of our frontline employees, who constitute the majority of our workforce. 
In 2021, we successfully piloted a frontline leadership training program, which launched enterprise-wide in 2022. Through this program, we are aiming to develop the management and coaching skills of frontline supervisors to improve the employee experience, create an environment for career growth, and increase retention. 
We also enhanced recruiting strategies to keep our client facilities staffed and improve our ability to hire in a more efficient manner. Specifically, in 2022, we opened dedicated regional hiring centers across key U.S. markets to support and enable the recruiting efforts of our in-market Industry Groups and hire more people as efficiently and quickly as possible. We also continued to leverage a rapid recruiting program launched in 2021 that expands the reach of our talent acquisition efforts through new processes, strategic solutions, and targeted marketing efforts to better attract and retain talent.
Enhancing the Team Member Experience is one of the main pillars of our ELEVATE strategy, with strategic investments designed to attract, develop, and retain talent and to help our operators manage labor more efficiently. 
MyRecruiting, ABM’s applicant tracking system that was introduced in 2022, provides end-to-end visibility of the applicant hiring journey and creates a high-quality candidate experience, resulting in increased hiring effectiveness.
Our online training platform, ABM University, provides our staff and management employees with access to a multitude of training courses, videos, reference material, and other tools. Outside of ABM University, our frontline employees receive on-the-job training to ensure we are executing for our clients. 
Compensation and employee benefits
In addition to competitive wages and salaries, we provide all of our employees access to a continuum of health and wellness benefits, including medical, dental, vision, disability, and basic life and voluntary supplemental life and AD&D insurance, 401K employee savings and employee stock purchase programs, a 24/7 employee assistance program, healthcare flexible spending accounts, telemedicine options, and commuter programs. 
Labor relations
With approximately 45,000 union-represented employees, we are party to more than 300 collective bargaining agreements nationwide, with more than 20 major labor unions. Our collective bargaining agreements include regional multiemployer agreements covering thousands of employees as well as localized site agreements covering smaller groups. We strive to interact with our labor partners in an atmosphere of mutual respect, and we always seek to resolve any dispute in an equitable manner. 
Safe working environment
ABM’s mission to make a difference, every person, every day, is evidenced in our approach to risk management and safety. Our programs are designed not only to ensure compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration and other regulatory bodies, but also to protect the health and welfare of our employees and our clients. A cornerstone of ABM’s comprehensive risk management and safety program is safety awareness to ensure our employees are:
•educated on how to complete tasks safely;
•trained in hazard identification;
•made aware of emergency response procedures to immediately address challenges; and
•proficient in reporting accidents, utilizing applicable procedures, to ensure appropriate loss mitigation techniques are implemented should a loss occur.
Our “Think Safe” approach to safety includes establishing a safety mindset from day one of employment. This safety culture is continuously reinforced through daily moments for safety messaging, monthly relevant training topics, and unique programs and materials created for our employees. Examples include the ABMWay Hub, which contains specific information about how to prevent certain types of workplace injuries; ways to proactively address potentially catastrophic situations such as hurricanes or tornadoes; and refreshers on ABM’s safety practices and protocols. 
One of the cornerstones of our ThinkSafe program is a collaboration with operations to help leaders identify workplace hazards and implement changes to prevent accident or injury. In our frontline leader training, participants are guided in creating a culture of safety, through leadership engagement, and participation in the safe work observations program. Frontline leader training also provides guidance on what to do should a claim occur in order to ensure our employees receive the right care at the right time to expedite their recovery. 
Culture and inclusion
Grounded by our mission and guided by our values, we employ individuals from all backgrounds with the talent, experience, and compassion that enable us to best deliver for those we serve. We cultivate a culture aimed at ensuring that our employees feel seen, heard, and valued.
Diversity, equity, and inclusion are core to our culture. Inviting different perspectives and driving inclusion enables us to connect meaningfully, adapt, innovate, and bring lasting change. In 2020, we established the Company’s Culture and Inclusion Leadership Council, supported by our executive leadership team and guided by our employees. This council is focused on how ABM successfully converts its values into measurable action. In 2022, the Culture and Inclusion Leadership Council operationalized its structure to align with business objectives 
and ABM’s ELEVATE strategy and identified three strategic priorities focused on driving meaningful change for our people, our culture, and our business. Through the Culture and Inclusion Leadership Council’s leadership, ABM will focus on making an impact to:
•Workforce Diversity and Equity: foster a diverse workforce with equitable opportunities for all employees;
•Workplace Inclusion and Belonging: cultivate a culture of inclusion so that every employee feels seen and heard; and
•Marketplace and Community: increase positive impact for our clients, partners and communities with service.
Activities of the Culture and Inclusion Leadership Council are reported to the Board’s Stakeholder and Enterprise Risk Committee through management presentations on matters such as corporate culture, diversity, equity, and inclusion. 
We are an Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action employer in compliance with the requirements of the Executive Order 11246 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans’ Readjustment Assistance Act.
