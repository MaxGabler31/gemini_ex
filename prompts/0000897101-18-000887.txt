General
 
Flexsteel Industries, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) incorporated in 1929 is celebrating its 125th anniversary of the Company’s founding in 1893. Flexsteel Industries, Inc. is one of the oldest and largest manufacturers, importers and marketers of residential and contract upholstered and wooden furniture products in the United States. Over the generations the Company has built a committed retail and consumer following based on its patented, guaranteed-for-life Blue Steel SpringTM – the all-riveted, high-carbon, steel-banded seating platform that gives upholstered and leather furniture the strength and comfort to last a lifetime. With offerings for use in home, hotel, healthcare, recreational vehicle, marine and office, the Company distributes its furniture throughout the United States & Canada through the Company’s sales force and various independent representatives.
 
In April 2018, Flexsteel Industries, Inc. merged its wholly owned subsidiary, DMI Furniture, Inc. into the parent company. In June 2018, the DMI Management, Inc. subsidiary was dissolved. The Company expects to reduce administrative and compliance expenses with these corporate structure changes.
 
The Company operates in one reportable segment, furniture products. The Company’s furniture products business involves the distribution of manufactured and imported products consisting of a broad line of upholstered and wooden furniture for residential and contract markets. Set forth below is information for the past three fiscal years showing the Company’s net sales attributable to each of the areas of application:

Manufacturing and Offshore Sourcing
 
The Company operates manufacturing facilities located in Arkansas, California, Georgia, Iowa, Mississippi and Juarez, Mexico. These manufacturing operations are integral to the Company’s product offerings and distribution strategy by offering smaller and more frequent product runs of a wider product selection. The Company identifies and eliminates manufacturing inefficiencies and adjusts manufacturing schedules on a daily basis to meet customer requirements. The Company has established relationships with key suppliers to ensure prompt delivery of quality component parts. The Company’s production includes the use of selected component parts sourced offshore to enhance value in the marketplace.
 
The Company integrates manufactured products with finished products acquired from offshore suppliers who can meet quality specifications and scheduling requirements. The Company will continue to pursue and refine this blended strategy, offering customers manufactured goods, products manufactured utilizing imported component parts, and ready-to-deliver imported products. This blended focus on products allows the Company to provide a wide range of price points, styles and product categories to satisfy customer requirements.

Competition
 
The furniture industry is highly competitive and includes a large number of U.S. and foreign manufacturers and distributors, none of which dominates the market. The Company competes in markets with a large number of relatively small manufacturers; however, certain competitors have substantially greater sales volumes than the Company. The Company’s products compete based on style, quality, price, delivery, service and durability. The Company believes its patented, guaranteed-for-life Blue Steel Spring, manufacturing and sourcing capabilities, facility locations, commitment to customers, product quality, delivery, service, value and experienced production, sales, marketing and management teams, are some of its competitive advantages.
Seasonality
 
The Company’s business is not considered seasonal.
 
Foreign Operations
 
The Company makes minimal export sales. At June 30, 2018, the Company had approximately 100 employees located in Asia to ensure Flexsteel’s quality standards are met and to coordinate the delivery of purchased products. The Company leases and operates a 225,000 square foot production facility in Juarez, Mexico utilizing contracted labor. The Company also leases a 39,000 square foot bonded warehouse in Binh Duong, Vietnam to facilitate efficient consolidation and shipment to its U.S. warehouses and customers.

Trademarks and Patents

It is not common in the furniture industry to obtain a patent for a furniture design. If a particular design of a furniture manufacturer is well accepted in the marketplace, it is common for other manufacturers to imitate the same design without recourse by the furniture manufacturer who initially introduced the design. Furniture products are designed by the Company’s own design staff and through the services of third-party designers. New models and designs of furniture, as well as new fabrics, are introduced continuously. In the last three fiscal years, these design activities involved the following expenditures (in thousands):
