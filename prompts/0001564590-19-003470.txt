Business
Overview 
 We are a leading medical device company in the global spine surgery market, focused on developing minimally disruptive surgical products and procedurally integrated solutions for spine surgery. Our currently marketed product portfolio is focused on applications for spine fusion surgery, including ancillary products and services used to aid in the surgical procedure. Our procedurally integrated solutions use innovative, technological advancements and a minimally disruptive surgical platform called Maximum Access Surgery, or MAS, to provide surgical efficiency, operative reliability, and procedural versatility. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated global revenues of $1.1 billion, including sales in over 50 countries.

Our principal product offering includes the MAS platform which combines three categories of solutions that collectively minimize soft tissue disruption during spine fusion surgery, provide maximum visualization and are designed to enable safe and reproducible outcomes for the surgeon and the patient. The platform includes our proprietary software-driven nerve detection and avoidance systems, and Intraoperative Monitoring, or IOM, services and support offered by NuVasive Clinical Services; MaXcess, an integrated split-blade retractor system; and a wide variety of specialized implants and biologics. Many of our products, including the individual components of our MAS platform can also be used in open or traditional spine surgery. Our spine surgery product line offerings, which include products for the thoracolumbar and the cervical spine, are primarily used to enable surgeon access to the spine to perform restorative and fusion procedures in a minimally disruptive fashion. To assist with surgical procedures, we offer a platform called Integrated Global Alignment, or iGA, in which products and computer assisted technology under our MAS platform help achieve more precise spinal alignment.
Our MAS platform and its related offerings are designed to provide a unique and comprehensive solution for the safe and reproducible minimally disruptive surgical treatment of spine disorders by enabling surgeons to access the spine in a manner that affords both direct visualization and detection and avoidance of critical nerves along with intraoperative reconciliation. The fundamental difference between our MAS platform, which is sometimes referred to in the industry as “minimally invasive surgery” or “MIS”, is the ability to customize safe and reproducible access to the spine while allowing surgeons to continue to use instruments that are familiar to them and effective during surgery. Accordingly, the MAS platform does not force surgeons to reinvent or learn new approaches that add complexity and undermine safety, ease of use and/or efficacy. We have dedicated and continue to dedicate significant resources toward training spine surgeons around the world; both those who are new to our MAS and other product platforms, as well as ongoing education for MAS-trained surgeons attending advanced courses. An important ongoing objective of ours has been to maintain a leading position in access and nerve avoidance, as well as to pioneer and remain the ongoing leader in minimally invasive spine surgery. Our MAS platform, with the unique advantages provided by our neuromonitoring systems, enables innovative lateral procedures, including a procedure known as eXtreme Lateral Interbody Fusion, or XLIF, in which surgeons access the spine for a fusion procedure from the side of the patient’s body, rather than from the front or back. It has been demonstrated clinically that XLIF and other procedures facilitated by our MAS platform decrease trauma and blood loss, and lead to faster overall patient recovery times compared to open spine surgery.
 We offer a range of implants for spinal surgery, which include our porous titanium and polyetheretherketone, or PEEK, implants under our Advanced Materials Science portfolio, fixation devices such as customizable rods, plates and screws, bone allograft in patented saline packaging, allogeneic and synthetic biologics, and disposables used in IOM. We also design and sell expandable growing rod implant systems that can be non-invasively lengthened following implantation with precise, incremental adjustments via an external remote controller using magnetic technology called MAGnetic External Control, or MAGEC, which allows for the minimally invasive treatment of early-onset and adolescent scoliosis. This technology is also the basis for our PRECICE limb lengthening system, which allows for the correction of long bone limb length discrepancy, as well as enhanced bone healing in patients that have experienced traumatic injury. The PRECICE limb lengthening system is sold by NuVasive Specialized Orthopedics.
 We intend to continue development on a wide variety of projects intended to broaden our MAS and other product platforms and advance the applications of our unique technology into procedurally integrated surgical solutions designed to improve clinical and economic outcomes. In 2019, we expect to commercially launch Pulse, a surgical automation platform which will incorporate LessRay, neuromonitoring, surgical planning, rod bending, imaging, navigation, and other automation capabilities. Pulse is a combined hardware and software platform designed to achieve surgical efficiencies via real-time feedback to aid in clinical decision making and to optimize the procedural workflow in the operating room. 
 We expect to continue to pursue business and technology acquisition targets and strategic relationships to identify opportunities to broaden participation along the spine care continuum. Top priorities include opportunities that complement our technology leadership position in spine, targeted geographic expansion, technology that makes procedures even safer, as well as opportunities for surgical automation.
 Our corporate headquarters is located in San Diego, California where we currently occupy approximately 169,000 square feet, including a six-suite state-of-the-art cadaver operating theatre designed to accommodate the training of spine surgeons. In August 2017, we entered into a 17 year operating lease agreement for the purpose of expanding and restructuring our corporate headquarters located in San Diego, California, from approximately 145,000 square feet to approximately 252,000 square feet. Our location in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, serves as our international headquarters. Our primary distribution and warehousing operations are located in our facility in Memphis, Tennessee. Our business is facilitated by rapid delivery of products and surgical instruments for surgeries involving our products. Because of its location and proximity to overnight third-party transporters, our Memphis facility enhances our ability to meet demanding delivery schedules and provide a greater level of customer service. Additionally, our primary self-manufacturing facility which produces spinal implants is located in West Carrollton, Ohio.

• | Expand the Reach of Our Exclusive Sales Force. We believe having a sales force dedicated to selling only our products is critical to achieving continued growth across our various product lines, driving greater market penetration and increasing our revenues. In the United States, we have a sales force consisting of a mix of directly-employed sales representatives and exclusive sales agents who are responsible for particular geographic regions of the country. Outside of the United States, our sales force consists of directly-employed sales representatives, independent sales agents and territory-based distributors.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provide Tailored Solutions in Response to Surgeon Needs. Responding quickly to the needs of spine surgeons is central to our culture, critical to our success, and we believe differentiates us from our competition. We solicit information and feedback from our surgeon customers and clinical advisors regarding the utility of, and potential improvements to, our products. For example, we have an on-site machine shop to allow us to rapidly manufacture product prototypes and a cadaver operating theatre in San Diego, California to provide clinical training and validate new ideas through prototype testing. We also maintain regional training facilities and centers for excellence in strategic locations around the globe. Responding quickly goes beyond product development to include active support in all areas, including clinical research and payer relations. Continuing to remain connected and responsive to the collective voices of the surgeon community should allow us to increase our market share and drive adoption of our procedurally-integrated spine solutions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Selectively License or Acquire Complementary Products and Technologies and Drive our International Presence. In addition to building our company through internal product development and global expansion efforts, we intend to selectively license or acquire complementary products and technologies and enter into strategic relationships that should keep us on the forefront of innovation and to pursue opportunities that allow us to expand our presence in international markets. With the 2016 acquisition of Ellipse Technologies, we offer innovative products based on the MAGEC technology platform. With this acquisition, we accelerated our entry into the pediatric and idiopathic spine deformity segment and expanded our international presence. With the 2016 acquisition of the LessRay software technology suite, we now help surgeons and hospital staff manage radiation exposure, without compromising intra-operative images or visual accuracy. With the acquisition of Vertera Spine in 2017, which developed patented porous PEEK technology, we now offer porous interbody technology across both PEEK and titanium materials, thereby addressing the spectrum of surgeons’ needs and preferences for interbody implants. In 2018, we entered into a Spine Precision Partnership with Siemens Healthineers to advance operating room workflow efficiency and provide increased precision in the delivery of minimally-disruptive spine surgery technologies through the integration of our Pulse surgical automation platform with Siemens Healthineers’ mobile 3D C-arm. By acquiring complementary products, entering into strategic relationships, and executing on domestic and international footprint expansion opportunities, we believe we can leverage our expertise of bringing new products to market that are intended to improve patient outcomes, simplify or better integrate techniques, reduce hospitalization and rehabilitation times across the globe, and, as a result, reduce overall costs to the healthcare system and continue to grow our global presence.

• | Provide Intraoperative Monitoring Capabilities. Monitoring the health of the nervous system during spinal surgery has been a key component of our strategy of product differentiation since early in our development. Over time, surgeon and hospital demand for neuromonitoring has increased along with the advancement of technologies and techniques used in IOM. We believe our proprietary neuromonitoring platform is a differentiator in the market and is unique in its ability to provide information about the directionality and proximity of nerves. With our acquisitions of Biotronic NeuroNetwork in 2016 and SafePassage in 2018, we have expanded the scale of our IOM services business and solidified our position as the largest provider of outsourced IOM services and are driving increased utilization of our neuromonitoring platform. We intend to continue to expand the utility of such platforms and broaden our IOM product and services offerings to further our value to our customers and increase adoption and usage.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Industry Background and Market 
 The spine is the core of the human skeleton, and provides a crucial balance between structural support and flexibility. It consists of 33 separate bones called vertebrae that are connected together by connective tissue (defined as bone, muscle, or ligament) to form a column and to permit a normal range of motion. The spinal cord, the body’s central nerve system, is enclosed within the spinal column. Vertebrae are paired into what are called motion segments that move by means of three joints: two facet joints and one spine disc. The four major categories of spine disorders are degenerative conditions, deformities, trauma and tumors. The largest market and the focus of our business historically are degenerative conditions of the facet joints and the intervertebral disc space. These two conditions can result in instability and pressure on the nerve roots as they exit the spinal column, causing back or neck pain or radiating pain in the arms or legs. 
 The prescribed treatment for back or neck pain depends on the severity and duration of the disorder. Initially, physicians will prescribe non-operative, conservative procedures including bed rest, medication, lifestyle modification, exercise, physical therapy, chiropractic care and steroid injections. In many cases, non-operative treatment options are effective; however, some patients eventually require spine fusion surgery. The vast majority of spine fusion surgeries are done using traditional open surgical techniques from either the front or back of the patient. These traditional open surgical approaches generally require a large incision in the patient’s abdomen or back in order to enable the surgeon to access and see the spine and surrounding area. These open procedures are invasive, lengthy and complex, and typically result in significant blood loss, extensive tissue damage and lengthy patient hospitalization and rehabilitation. 
 We believe the market for procedurally integrated spine surgery solutions will continue to grow over the long term, and we also believe our market share will increase, because of the following market dynamics: 
  
• | Demand for Surgical Alternatives with Less Tissue Disruption. As has been proven in other surgical markets, we anticipate the broader acceptance of surgical treatments with less tissue disruption and patient trauma will result in increased demand.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Favorable Domestic Demographics. The population segment most likely to experience back pain is expected to increase as a result of aging “baby boomers” (people born between 1946 and 1965). This large population segment is expected to increasingly demand a quicker return to activities of daily living following surgery than prior generations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Access to Care in Emerging Markets. Healthcare reforms in many emerging markets are expanding access to treatments to a greater proportion of their populations, which is expected to continue to drive strong increases in demand for healthcare-related product volumes. Increasing economic affluence in key developing regions will further drive demand for healthcare treatments.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Vendor/Hospital Consolidation. Given the continued economic pressures facing hospitals and healthcare systems, we anticipate broader consolidation of vendors in the spine space. We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from this vendor consolidation given our size and scale and the breadth of our portfolio.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Although the market for procedurally-integrated spine surgery solutions should continue to grow over the long term, economic, political and regulatory influences are subjecting our industry to significant changes that may slow the growth rate of the spine surgery market. 
 Surgical Alternatives with Less Tissue Disruption 
 The benefits of minimally invasive surgical procedures in other areas of orthopedics have significantly contributed to the strong and growing demand for surgical alternatives with less tissue disruption of the spine. Surgeons and hospitals seek spine procedures that result in fewer operative and postoperative complications and decreased patient hospitalization periods. At the same time, patients seek procedures that reduce trauma, allow for faster recovery times and result in more favorable and predictable clinical outcomes. Despite patient and doctor demands, the rate of adoption of alternative surgical procedures with less tissue disruption has been relatively slow with respect to the spine. Currently, the majority of spine surgery patients are treated with traditional open and invasive techniques. 
 
5

A principal factor contributing to spine surgeons’ slow adoption of traditional minimally invasive spine procedure alternatives has been inconsistent outcomes driven by the limited or lack of direct access to and visibility of the surgical anatomy, and the associated complex instruments that have been required to perform these procedures. Most traditional minimally invasive spine surgery systems do not allow the surgeon to directly view the spine and the relevant pathology point and, as such, provide only restrictive visualization through a camera system or endoscope, while also requiring the use of complex surgical techniques. In addition, most traditional minimally invasive spine surgery systems use complex or highly customized surgical instruments that require special training and the completion of a large number of trial cases before the surgeon becomes proficient using the system, which is an impediment and/or deterrent to their adoption.
 Our Commercial Products
 Our MAS platform allows surgeons to perform a wide range of minimally disruptive spine procedures in all regions of the spine and from various surgical approaches, while overcoming the shortcomings of traditional minimally invasive spine surgical techniques. The MAS platform is designed to treat a wide range of spinal pathologies while accommodating a surgeon’s preferred surgical technique. We believe our approach improves clinical results and should continue to drive an expanded number of minimally disruptive procedures performed, lead the market away from open surgery, and make less invasive techniques the standard of care in spine fusion and non-fusion surgery. 
 Our products facilitate minimally disruptive applications of the following spine surgery procedures, among others: 
  
• | Lumbar and thoracic fusion procedures in which the surgeon approaches the spine through the patient’s back, side or abdomen;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cervical fusion procedures for either the posterior occipito-cervico-thoracic region or the anterior cervical region; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Decompression, which is removal of a portion of bone or disc from over or under the nerve root to relieve pinching of the nerve.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our MAS platform combines three product categories: our MaXcess retractors, our specialized implants and fixation products, and our neuromonitoring systems and service offerings that collectively enable surgeons to detect and navigate around nerves while directing customized access to the spine for implant delivery. Biologics are used to complement procedures by promoting bone fusion. In addition to our MAS platform and biologics, our comprehensive procedural solutions include our IOM services, Integrated Global Alignment, or iGA, and Pulse, our surgical automation platform. 
 MaXcess
 MaXcess retractors have a split-blade design consisting of three blades that can be positioned to customize the surgical exposure in the shape and size specific to the surgical requirements rather than the more traditional fixed tube or two-blade designs of traditional minimally invasive spine surgical systems. This split-blade design also provides customizable access to the spine, which allows surgeons to perform surgical procedures using instruments that are similar to those used in open procedures but with a smaller incision and less tissue disruption. The ability to use familiar instruments reduces the learning curve for our procedures and facilitates the adoption of our products. Our system’s illumination of the operative corridor aids in providing surgeons with better direct visualization of the patient’s anatomy, without the need for additional technology or other special equipment such as endoscopes. Over the years, several improvements to our MaXcess systems have been made, including incorporating integrated neuromonitoring technology and improving the blade systems, and the MAS approach has broadened from the lumbar to the thoracic region. Our MaXcess products are used in the cervical spine for posterior application and anterior retraction, the lumbar spine for decompressions, transforaminal lumbar interbody fusions, or TLIFs, posterior lumbar interbody fusions, or PLIFs, the thoracolumbar spine for eXtreme Lateral Interbody Fusion, or XLIFs, and the thoracic region for tumors and trauma, as well as in adult degenerative scoliosis procedures. 
 Implants and Fixation Products
 We have many implants and fixation devices designed to be used with our MAS platform. Our portfolio of implants used for interbody disc height restoration include implants made from allograft, titanium, and PEEK. Our titanium and PEEK implants are available in both porous and non-porous formats and come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and lordosis options to accommodate specific approach, pathology, alignment restoration, and anatomical requirements of the patient and the particular fusion procedure. Our implants are designed for insertion into the smallest possible space while maximizing surface area contact for fusion. Our fixation products, including pedicle screws, rods and plates, have been uniquely designed and include a highly differentiated percutaneous minimally invasive solution with advanced guide technology, superior rod insertion options, and multiple reduction capabilities to be delivered through our procedures to provide stabilization of the spine. Our fixation offerings include our Armada, Precept and Reline posterior fixation portfolios.

Neuromonitoring
 Our neuromonitoring systems utilize electromyography, or EMG, as well as proprietary software hunting algorithms and graphical user interfaces to provide surgeons with an enhanced and intuitive nerve avoidance system. Our systems function by monitoring changes in electrical signals across muscle groups, which allows us to detect underlying changes in nerve activity. Through our neuromonitoring platforms, we give surgeons the option to connect their instruments to a computer system that provides discrete, real-time, surgeon directed and surgeon controlled feedback about the directionality and relative proximity of nerves during surgery. We believe our proprietary neuromonitoring platforms are a differentiator in the market and are unique in their ability to provide information about the directionality and proximity of nerves. Our systems analyze and then translate complex neurophysiologic data into simple, useful information to assist the surgeon’s clinical decision-making process. The health and integrity of the spinal cord and related nerves can also be assessed using motor evoked potentials, or MEPs, and somatosensory evoked potentials, SSEPs. Both of these methods of IOM involve applying stimulation and recording the response that must travel along the motor or sensory paths of the spinal cord. Surgeons can connect certain instruments to our neuromonitoring systems, thus creating an interactive set of instruments that better enable the safe navigation through the body’s nerve anatomy during surgery. The connection is accomplished using a clip that is attached to the instrument, effectively providing the benefits of our neuromonitoring systems through an instrument already familiar to the surgeon. Our proprietary software and easy to use graphical user interfaces allow the surgeon to make critical decisions in real time to help enable safer, faster, and more reproducible procedures to achieve improved patient outcomes.
Biologics
 Biologics are used to aid in the spinal fusion process or bone healing process. The global biologics market in spine surgery consists of autograft (autologous human tissue), allograft (donated human tissue), and a varied offering of synthetic products and growth factors. Our allograft biologics product offerings include Osteocel Plus and Pro – a cellular bone matrix designed to mimic the biologic profile of autograft including mesenchymal stem cells and osteoprogenitor cells to aid in spinal fusion and Propel DBM (highly moldable demineralized bone matrix putty and gel). Our synthetic biologics product offerings include Formagraft (collagen-based synthetic bone substitute) and AttraX (synthetic bone graft material delivered in putty and other forms).
Intraoperative Monitoring Services
 Monitoring the health of the nervous system during spinal surgery has been a key component of our strategy of product differentiation since early in our development. Over time, surgeon and hospital demand for neuromonitoring has increased along with the advancement of technologies and techniques used in IOM. Through our IOM services business, we provide onsite and remote monitoring of the neurological systems of patients undergoing spinal and brain-related surgeries. Our neurophysiologists are present in the operating room during procedures and work in partnership with supervising physicians who remotely oversee and interpret neurophysiological data gathered via broadband transmission over the internet. Through this service, data can be analyzed in real time by healthcare professionals for additional interpretation of intraoperative information and oversight, which we believe further improves the safety and reproducibility of the vast array of our spine procedures.
Integrated Global Alignment
 Current and emerging data illustrates a direct correlation between proper spinal alignment and long-term clinical outcomes. Our iGA platform offers a global approach for assessing, preserving, and restoring spinal alignment in an effort to promote surgical effectiveness and efficiencies, lasting patient outcomes, and improved quality of life. Using our NuvaPlanning portfolio of software products for integrated operative solutions, surgeons can preoperatively calculate and evaluate alignment parameters and implant integration by accurately modeling surgery to create a reliable plan with clear results, and then conduct a real-time intraoperative assessment in order to correct the anterior and posterior column alignment in line with the surgical plan. Following a procedure, surgeons can use our solutions to confirm the success of the procedure and effect on alignment by reviewing surgical results and easily comparing those results to the surgical plan. In addition to our software solutions, we also offer specific products that are designed to restore alignment, including our Reline posterior fixation portfolio, our VuePoint occipito-cervico-thoracic fixation system, and our Bendini spinal rod bending system.
Imaging Technology
 Our LessRay system is a software technology platform designed to help surgeons and hospital staff manage radiation exposure associated with x-ray and other imaging technology, without compromising intraoperative images or visual accuracy. This is achieved through digital imaging processing technology that generates high resolution images of the surgical field from low resolution fluoroscopy (or x-ray) images. We currently offer LessRay as a standalone product but anticipate incorporating the LessRay technology into our Pulse surgical automation platform in the future.
 
7

Integrated Surgical Automation Platform
 Pulse is our modular surgical automation platform which will incorporate LessRay, neuromonitoring, surgical planning, rod bending, imaging, navigation, and other automation capabilities. Pulse is a combined hardware and software platform designed to achieve surgical efficiencies via real-time feedback to aid in clinical decision making and to optimize the procedural workflow in the operating room. In 2018, Pulse received 510(k) clearance from the United States Food and Drug Administration and we expect to commercially launch Pulse in 2019.
MAGEC-EOS Spinal Bracing and Distraction System
 Early onset scoliosis, or EOS, refers to severely deformed curvatures of the spine diagnosed before the age of ten. EOS is a challenging health issue and can lead to more severe progressive deformities. Surgical treatments for EOS include the use of surgically adjustable expandable rods to control the spine deformity while still allowing the spine to grow until a child reaches an appropriate size or age for a more permanent solution, such as spinal fusion. Surgeries to adjust traditional growing rods are typically performed every six to nine months and are associated with scarring, elevated infection rates, postoperative pain, and impaired mobility as the child heals from surgery. Additionally, these surgeries involve repetitive exposure to general anesthesia, which can delay development and impair long-term cognitive function. The MAGEC-EOS system is designed to overcome the limitations of conventional adjustable rod treatments for EOS and reduce the number of surgical procedures required throughout childhood. Once our MAGEC growing rods are surgically implanted in a patient, they can be adjusted non-invasively using the external remote controller. The ability to adjust growing rods without surgical intervention means that EOS patients can be treated with fewer planned surgeries. Our non-invasive adjustment technology enables physicians to perform more frequent adjustments in a non-surgical outpatient setting, thereby improving deformity correction and allowing for optimal spinal growth. 
PRECICE Limb Lengthening System
 Limb length discrepancies, or LLDs, refer to a congenital deformity or injury resulting in one leg being shorter than the other. Large LLDs often require complex treatments including limb lengthening surgery to create equal limb length. The traditional limb lengthening surgical procedure includes the creation of a gap in the bone, or osteotomy, the attachment of wires or pins to the fractured bones, and the passing of the wires or pins through the skin to an external fixator, a scaffold-like frame that surrounds the limb. The external fixator distracts the bone when the patient or a family member manually turns the knobs on the fixator. These adjustments must be performed several times each day such that the bone is lengthened approximately one millimeter per day. Adjustments of the external fixator are very painful and associated with soft tissue disruption, disturbance of the wound healing process of the skin and soft tissue and high rates of pin site infection. In addition, traditional external fixation can result in significant psychosocial comorbidities that reduce quality of life for patients undergoing treatment, including anxiety, social disengagement, sleep disorders, depression and addiction to pain medication. The PRECICE LLD system uses the MAGEC technology to enable non-invasive and painless adjustments using a pre-programmed external remote controller. As a result, PRECICE LLD enables physicians to customize therapy to the needs of the patient over time without the need for surgical re-intervention and provides improved quality of life and satisfaction for patients in need of surgical limb lengthening. 
Research and Development 
 Our research and development efforts are primarily focused on developing our new technology platforms and further enhancing our existing products to improve and further integrate our procedural solutions to address unmet clinical needs while improving patient and economic outcomes. Our research and development group has extensive experience in developing products to treat spine pathologies. This group continues to work closely with our clinical advisors and spine surgeon customers to design products and procedural solutions designed to improve patient outcomes, simplify techniques, and reduce patient trauma including subsequent hospitalization and rehabilitation times; and as a result reduce overall costs to patients and the healthcare system.
International 
 As the spine market shifts towards minimally invasive surgery and international access to healthcare increases, it should provide us with an opportunity for accelerated growth outside the United States. Because our procedurally-integrated solutions and technologies treat similar pathologies around the world, we are focused on expanding our operations in select developed and emerging international markets. We are investing to tailor our products and technologies to meet varying international patient, surgeon and market requirements. We are also investing in expanding our global infrastructure to adapt to alternative distribution channels, to support differing language and customer service requirements, and to provide training and surgeon education in our MAS surgical techniques, our surgical instruments and our implants to our international customers. We intend to continue to make targeted investments in select international markets in order to increase our commercial reach outside of the United States. Our international revenue, which excludes Puerto Rico, was $205.6 million or 19% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Sales and Marketing
In the United States, we currently sell our procedurally-integrated solutions through a combination of exclusive and non-exclusive independent sales agents and directly-employed sales force. Each member of our United States sales force is responsible for a defined territory, with our independent sales agents acting as our sole representative in their respective territories. The determination of whether to engage a directly-employed sales representative or an independent sales agent is made on a territory–by-territory basis, with a focus on aligning the sales team with the best skills and experience with local surgeons’ needs. Our international sales force is comprised of directly-employed sales representatives, as well as exclusive distributors and independent sales agents. Directly-employed sales representatives make up the majority of our overall sales force.
Surgeon Training and Education 
 We devote significant resources to training and educating surgeons regarding the safety and reproducibility of our surgical techniques and our instruments and implants. We maintain state-of-the-art cadaver operating rooms and training facilities to help educate surgeons regarding our products at our corporate headquarters in San Diego, California. We continue to train surgeons on our lateral techniques, including XLIF, and our other MAS platform products including: our proprietary neuromonitoring systems, MaXcess, biologics, and specialized implants. Our surgeon education program includes a Clinical Professional Development global platform, which integrates surgical training with professional development. 
Manufacturing and Supply 
 As our business has continued to scale, we significantly expanded our self-manufacturing capabilities in 2017 as we increased production at our approximately 180,000 square foot manufacturing facility in West Carrollton, Ohio. As we increase our self-manufacturing capabilities, we will look to maintain adequate raw materials suppliers, sourcing alternatives and adequate supply to support our operations. We have identified or are in the process of identifying and qualifying additional suppliers, on a per product basis, for our highest volume products to best enable us to be able to maintain consistent supply to our customers. Our outsourcing strategy is targeted at companies that meet U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and quality standards supported by internal policies and procedures. Supplier performance is maintained and managed through a supplier qualification, performance management and corrective action program intended to ensure that all of our product requirements are met or exceeded. 
 Our products are inspected, packaged and labeled, as needed, at our San Diego headquarters, our Memphis distribution facility or our Aliso Viejo facility. Under our existing contracts with third-party manufacturers, we reserve the exclusive right to inspect and assure conformance of each product and product component to our specifications. 
 We currently rely on several tissue banks as our suppliers of allograft tissue implants, including for our Osteocel Plus and Osteocel Pro product lines. Like our relationships with our device manufacturing suppliers, we subject our tissue processing suppliers to the same quality criteria in terms of selection, qualification, and verification of processed tissue quality upon receipt of goods, as well as hold them accountable to compliance with FDA regulations, state requirements, and as-voluntary industry standards (such as those put forward by the American Association of Tissue Banks). 
 We rely on two suppliers for PEEK, which comprises many of our partial vertebral body replacement and interbody product lines. We rely on one, exclusive supplier for our neuromonitoring platforms, and rely on one, exclusive supplier for our neuromonitoring equipment that is used outside of the NVM5 and Pulse platforms. 
 We, and our third-party manufacturers, are subject to the quality system regulations of the FDA, state regulations (such as the regulations promulgated by the California Department of Health Services), and regulations promulgated by foreign regulatory bodies (such as in the European Union). For tissue products, we are FDA registered and licensed in the States of California, New York, Florida, Maryland and Oregon. For our device implants and instruments, we are FDA registered, California licensed, CE marked and ISO certified. CE is an abbreviation for “Conformité Européenne” or European Conformity, and is the registration marking designating that a device can be commercially distributed throughout Europe. Our facilities and the facilities of our third-party manufacturers are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by regulatory authorities, and may undergo compliance inspections conducted by the FDA, state, and/or international regulatory agencies. 
 Surgical Instrument, Implant Sets and Equipment Sales
 For many of our customers, we provide surgical instrumentation sets, including both implants and instruments, as well as our neuromonitoring systems in a manner tailored to fulfill our customer’s obligations to meet surgery schedules. We do not generally receive separate economic value specific to the surgical instrument sets from the surgeons or hospitals that utilize them. In many cases, once the surgery is finished, the surgical instrument sets are returned to us, and we prepare them for shipment to meet future surgeries.

We complement this implant and instrument shipment model with field-based instrument assets. This hybrid strategy is designed to improve customer service, minimize backlogs, increase asset turns, optimize freight costs, and maximize cash flow. Our pool of surgical equipment that we make available to hospitals continues to increase as we increase our product offering, expand our distribution channels and increase the market penetration of our products. These surgical instrumentation and implant sets are important to the growth of our business, and we anticipate additional investments in such assets going forward. 
 In certain cases we will sell either surgical instruments, implant sets or both to our customers. While this does not constitute a material component of our business, as customer penetration and volume increases, these sales of sets allows our customers to increase the amount of surgical volume performed locally. Additionally, LessRay units are sold as a capital sale or as a lease. We also intend to offer the Pulse platform through a capital sales and leasing model. We do not have a long history of selling, leasing or servicing capital equipment, and we have recently invested and intend to continue to invest in building resources and expertise in this area.
 Intellectual Property 
 We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure agreements and other measures to protect our intellectual property rights. In order to have a competitive advantage, we must develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technologies. We require our employees (who we refer to as “shareowners”), consultants and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment, consulting or advisory relationships with us. We also require our shareowners, consultants and advisors who we expect to work on our products to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived using our property or which relate to our business. Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. 
Patents 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had over 1,125 issued and pending patents world-wide, including over 530 U.S. issued patents. Our issued and pending patents cover, among other things:
  
• | MAS surgical access instrumentation and methodology, including our XLIF procedure and aspects thereof;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Neurophysiology enabled instrumentation and methodology, including pedicle screw test systems, software hunting algorithms, navigated guidance, rod bending and surgical access systems;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Implants and related instrumentation and targeting systems;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | Biologics, including Osteocel Plus and Osteocel Pro, Formagraft and AttraX;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Magnetic technology for non-invasive distraction of an implanted device, including the MAGEC technology platform;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Digital imaging processing technology that generates high resolution images of the surgical field from low resolution scans, including the LessRay technology platform; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Porous PEEK technology, included in our Cohere, Coalesce and Coalesce Straight interbody implants.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our issued patents began to expire in 2018. We do not believe that the expiration of any single patent is likely to significantly affect our intellectual property position. 
 The medical device industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement. Patent litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions and its outcome is uncertain. Our success will depend in part on our not infringing patents issued to others, including our competitors and potential competitors. As the number of entrants into our market increases, the possibility of future patent infringement claims against us grows. While we make extensive efforts to ensure that our products do not infringe other parties’ patents and proprietary rights, our products and methods may be covered by patents held by our competitors. There are numerous risks associated with our intellectual property. For a complete discussion of these risks, please see the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report. 
 Trademarks 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had over 265 trademark registrations in both domestic and foreign regions.

Competition 
 Competition within the industry is primarily based on technology, innovation, quality, reputation and customer service. Our significant competitors are Medtronic Sofamor Danek, or Medtronic, DePuy/Synthes, a Johnson & Johnson company, Stryker Spine, Globus Medical, and Zimmer Biomet Spine, which together represent a significant portion of the spine market. We also face competition from a significant number of smaller companies with more limited product offerings and geographic reach than our larger competitors. These companies, who represent intense competition in specific markets, include Orthofix International N.V., Alphatec Spine, and others. With respect to our neuromonitoring systems, we primarily compete with Medtronic, and Cadwell Industries. Our IOM services business competes with SpecialtyCare and numerous smaller and regional neuromonitoring companies. We also face competition from physician owned distributorships, or PODs, which are medical device distributors that are owned, directly or indirectly, by physicians. However, these PODs have come under scrutiny by the Office of Inspector General, or OIG as the associated physicians derive a portion of their revenue from selling or arranging for the sale of medical devices for use in procedures they perform on their own patients. The prevalence of these PODs may impact our ability to grow.
The United States Government Regulation 
 Our products are medical devices and human tissue products subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory bodies both inside and outside of the United States. Each of these agencies requires us - to varying degrees - to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, storage, labeling, marketing and distribution of our products. 
FDA’s Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements 
 Unless an exemption applies, each medical device that we market and sell in the United States must first receive either premarket clearance (by submitting a 510(k) notification) or premarket approval (by filing a premarket approval application, or PMA) from the FDA. In addition, certain modifications to marketed devices may require 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA supplement. The FDA will clear marketing of a medical device through the 510(k) process if it is demonstrated that the new product is substantially equivalent to other 510(k)-cleared products (referred to as a predicate device). The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes between three and six months from the date the application is completed, but may last longer. The process of obtaining PMA approval is much more costly, lengthy and uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process and generally takes between one and three years, or even longer, from the time the application is submitted to the FDA until any approval is obtained. In addition, a clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA application and may be required for a 510(k) premarket notification. 
 In 2018, the FDA issued draft guidance and announced steps to modernize the 510(k) clearance pathway that, if finalized and implemented, could impact the ability of medical device manufacturers to obtain or maintain 510(k) clearance for devices. Among other initiatives, the FDA has proposed to “sunset” the use of older predicate devices for purposes of comparison in new device 510(k) clearance submissions. If we cannot establish that a new or modified product is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, we may be required to seek pre-market approval through the PMA process. There are numerous risks associated with the PMA process, which typically requires conducting clinical trials with high costs and uncertain outcomes. For a complete discussion of these risks, please see the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report.
 Human Cell, Tissue, and Cellular and Tissue Based Products 
 Our allograft products, including our Triad and ExtenSure, and our Osteocel Plus and Osteocel Pro products, are regulated by the FDA as Human Cell, Tissue, and Cellular and Tissue Based Products. FDA regulations do not currently require these minimally manipulated human tissue-based products to be subjected to a premarket approval or pre-market notification process before they are marketed if they are deemed to meet the requirements of a “361” product under the Public Health Safety Act. 
 We are, however, required to register with the FDA as a provider of such products and to list these products with the FDA and comply with its Current Good Tissue Practices for Human Cell, Tissue, and Cellular- and Tissue-Based Product Establishments. The FDA periodically inspects tissue facilities to determine compliance with these requirements. Entities that provide us with allograft bone tissue are responsible for performing donor recovery, donor screening, donor testing, processing, and packaging and our compliance with those aspects of the Current Good Tissue Practices regulations that regulate those functions are dependent upon the actions of these independent entities. 
 The procurement and transplantation of allograft bone tissue is subject to United States federal law pursuant to the National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA), a criminal statute that prohibits the purchase and sale of human organs used in human transplantation - including bone and related tissue - for “valuable consideration” (as defined in the NOTA). The NOTA permits reasonable payments associated with the removal, transportation, processing, preservation, quality control, implantation and storage of human bone tissue. With the exception of removal and implantation, we provide services, directly or indirectly, in all of these areas. We make payments to vendors in consideration for the services they provide in connection with the recovery and screening of donors. Failure to comply with the requirements of NOTA could result in enforcement action against us. 
 The procurement of human tissue is also subject to state anatomical gift acts and some states have statutes similar to NOTA. In addition, some states require that tissue processors be licensed by that state. Failure to comply with state laws could also result in enforcement action against us.

Continuing FDA Regulation 
 After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These regulatory requirements include, but are not limited to, the following: 
  
• | product listing and establishment registration;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | adherence to the Quality System Regulation which requires stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling requirements and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of off-label uses or indications;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | adverse event reporting;
--+-------------------------


• | post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval clinical trials or other required testing;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post-market surveillance requirements;
--+---------------------------------------


• | the FDA’s recall authority, whereby it can ask for, or require, the recall of products from the market; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requirements relating to voluntary corrections or removals.
--+------------------------------------------------------------

 Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in fines and other enforcement actions by the FDA, which could adversely impact our business. 
 We are also subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA, the California Food and Drug Branch, American Association of Tissue Banking, as well as other regulatory agencies overseeing the implementation and adherence of applicable state and federal device and tissue licensing regulations. These inspections may include our manufacturing and subcontractors’ facilities. 
 Pursuant to FDA regulations, we can only market our products for cleared or approved uses. Although surgeons are permitted to use medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by the FDA based on their medical judgment, we are prohibited from promoting products for such “off-label” uses. 
 Healthcare Regulation and Commercial Compliance 
 The healthcare industry is highly regulated and changes in laws and regulations can be significant. The federal government and all states in which we currently operate regulate various aspects of our business.  Changes in the law or new interpretation of existing laws can have a material effect on our permissible activities, the relative costs associated with doing business and the amount of reimbursement by government and other third-party payers.  
Anti-kickback Statute
 We are subject to the federal anti-kickback statute which, among other things, prohibits the knowing and willful solicitation, offer, payment or receipt of any remuneration, direct or indirect, in cash or in kind, in return for, or to induce the referral of patients for, items or services covered by Medicare, Medicaid and certain other governmental health programs. Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (ACA), neither knowledge of the anti-kickback statute nor the specific intent to violate the law is a requirement for being found in violation of such laws. Violation of the anti-kickback statute may result in civil or criminal penalties and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, and - according to ACA - now provides a basis for liability under the False Claims Act. Many states have enacted similar statutes, which are not limited to items and services paid for under Medicare or a federally funded healthcare program. We believe our operations materially comply with the anti-kickback statutes; however, because these provisions are interpreted broadly by regulatory authorities, we cannot be assured that law enforcement officials or others will not challenge our operations under these statutes.

Federal False Claims Act
 The Federal False Claims Act (in particular -its “qui tam” or “whistleblower” provisions) allow(s) private individuals to bring actions in the name of the United States government alleging that a defendant has made false claims for payment from federal funds. In addition, various states are considering enacting or have enacted laws modeled after the Federal False Claims Act, penalizing false claims against state funds. In 2013, we received a federal administrative subpoena from the OIG in connection with an investigation into possible false or otherwise improper claims submitted to Medicare and Medicaid. The subpoena sought discovery of documents for the period January 2007 through April 2013. In July 2015, we entered into a definitive settlement agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, to settle this matter. Under the terms of the agreement, we paid $13.5 million plus fees and accrued interest of approximately $0.3 million to resolve this matter. The settlement was not an admission of liability or wrongdoing by us, and we were not required to enter into a corporate integrity agreement with the OIG as part of the settlement. In August 2015, we received a civil investigative demand, or CID, issued by the DOJ pursuant to the federal False Claims Act. The CID requires the delivery of a wide range of documents and information related to an investigation by the DOJ concerning allegations that we assisted a physician group customer in submitting improper claims for reimbursement and made improper payments to the physician group in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute. We are cooperating with the DOJ in regards to this matter. Any adverse findings related to this investigation could result in material financial penalties against the Company.
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
 Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as was amended in 2005 and in 2009, or HIPAA, a Covered Entity, as further defined under HIPAA, is required to adhere to certain requirements regarding the use, disclosure and security of protected health information, or PHI. In the past, HIPAA has generally affected us indirectly, as NuVasive is generally neither a Covered Entity nor a Business Associate, as further defined under HIPAA, to Covered Entities, except that our provision of IOM services through various subsidiaries may create a Business Associate relationship; additionally, we treat our Puerto Rico subsidiary as a Covered Entity. Regardless of Covered Entity status under HIPAA, in those cases where patient data is received, NuVasive is committed to maintaining the security and privacy of PHI. The potential for enforcement action against us is now greater, as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) can take action directly against Business Associates. Thus, while we believe we are and will be in compliance with all required HIPAA standards, there is no guarantee that the government will agree. Enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt regular operations of our business.Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 The United States and foreign government regulators have increased regulation, enforcement, inspections and governmental investigations of the medical device industry, including increased United States government oversight and enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. If the United States or another foreign governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, such governmental authority can impose fines, delay or suspend regulatory clearances, institute proceedings to detain or seize our products, issue a recall, impose operating restrictions, enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against us or our officers or employees, and can recommend criminal prosecution to the Department of Justice. Moreover, governmental authorities can ban or request the recall, repair, replacement or refund of the cost of any device or product we manufacture or distribute. We are also potentially subject to the UK Bribery Act, which would also subject us to the imposition of civil and criminal fines. Any of the foregoing actions could result in decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.Physician Payments Sunshine Act of 2009 (Sunshine Act)
 The Sunshine Act was enacted into law in 2010 and requires public disclosure to the United States government of payments to physicians and teaching hospitals, including in-kind transfers of value such as free gifts or meals. The Act also provides penalties for non-compliance. The Sunshine Act requires that we file an annual report on March 31 of a calendar year for the transfers of value incurred for the prior calendar year. This law, along with various international and individual state reporting requirements, such as in Massachusetts and Vermont, increases the possibility that a healthcare company may run afoul of one or more of the requirements.Compliance Program
 A compliance program is a set of internal controls established by a company to prevent and/or detect any non-compliant activities and to address properly those issues that may be discovered. The United States government has recommended that healthcare companies, among others, develop and maintain an effective compliance program to reduce the likelihood of any such non-compliance by the company, its employees, agents and contractors. In addition, some states, such as Massachusetts and California, now require certain healthcare companies to have a formal compliance program in place in order to do business within the state. For years, we have maintained a compliance program structured to meet the requirements of the federal sentencing guidelines for an effective compliance program and the model compliance program guidance promulgated by HHS over the years. Our program includes, but is not limited to, a Code of Ethical Business Conduct, designation of a compliance officer, oversight by a designated committee of our Board of Directors, policies and procedures, a confidential disclosure method (a hotline), and conducting periodic audits to ensure compliance.

Foreign Government Regulation 
 Sales of medical devices outside the United States are subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval, and the requirements may differ. 
 The European Union has adopted numerous directives and standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling, and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Additionally, certain countries (such as Switzerland), have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the European Union with respect to medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear “CE” conformity marking, and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout Europe. The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third-party assessment by a “Notified Body”. This third-party assessment consists of an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system and technical review of the manufacturer’s product. We have now successfully passed several Notified Body audits since our original certification in 2001, granting us ISO certification and allowing the CE conformity marking to be applied to certain of our devices under the European Union Medical Device Directive. 
 In 2017, the European Union adopted the EU Medical Device Regulation (Council Regulations 2017/745) which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices, including new quality system and post-market surveillance requirements. The regulation has a three-year implementation period to May 2020 and will replace the existing directives on medical devices in the European Union. After May 2020, medical devices marketed in the European Union will require certification according to these new requirements, except that devices with valid CE certificates, issued pursuant to the Medical Device Directive before May 2020, may be placed on the market until 2024. Complying with this new regulation will require us to incur significant costs and failure to meet the requirements of the regulation could adversely impact our business in the European Union and other countries that utilize or rely on European Union requirements for medical device registrations. 
 In 2014, the Japanese government made revisions to the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law (now called PMD Act) that made significant changes to the preapproval regulatory systems. These changes have - in part - stipulated that, in addition to obtaining a manufacturing or import approval from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, certain low-risk medical devices can now be evaluated by third-party organizations. Based on the risk-based classification, manufacturers are provided three procedures for satisfying the PMD Act requirements prior to placing products on the market: Pre-market Submission, or Todokede; Pre-market Certification, or Ninsho; and Pre-market Approval, or Shonin. NuVasive markets devices in Japan that are assessed by both government entities and third-party organizations using all three procedures in place for manufacturers. The level of review and time line for medical device approval will depend on the risk-based classification and subsequent regulatory procedure that the medical device is aligned based on assessment against the current PMD Law. Manufacturers must also obtain a manufacturing or import license from the prefectural government prior to importing medical devices. We also pursue authorizations required by the prefectural government as required. 
 Device and tissue premarket approval and/or registration and/or facility licensing requirements also exist in other markets where international NuVasive facilities are established and/or where we may conduct business, including, but not limited to, Southeast Asia, Australia, and Latin America.  Such requirements vary by country and NuVasive has established procedures to drive its compliance with these requirements.
 Data protection laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), also apply to our international operations. The GDPR requires, among other things, obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer EU personal data and the prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances. These data protection regulations create a range of compliance obligations and permit substantial fines for noncompliance. 
 Third-Party Reimbursement 
 Broadly speaking, payer pushback on spine surgery and IOM services in the United States has increased in the recent past, and we believe this has had an overall dampening effect on spine procedure volumes and prices. 
 We expect that sales volumes and prices of our products and services will continue to be largely dependent on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers, such as governmental programs, for example, Medicare and Medicaid, private insurance plans, accountable care organizations and managed care programs. Reimbursement is contingent on established coding for a given procedure, coverage of the codes by the third-party payers, and adequate payment for the resources used. 
 Physician coding for procedures is established by the American Medical Association, or AMA. For coding related to spine surgery, the North American Spine Society, or NASS, is the primary liaison to the AMA. In July of 2006, NASS established the proper physician coding for the XLIF procedure by declaring it to be encompassed in existing codes that describe an anterolateral approach to the spine. This position was confirmed in a formal statement by NASS in January 2010. Hospital coding is established by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. XLIF is included in the nomenclature for hospital codes as an additional descriptor under long standing codes. All physician and hospital coding is subject to change which could impact reimbursement and physician practice behavior. 
 
14

Independent of the coding status, third-party payers may deny coverage based on their own criteria, including if they feel that a device or procedure is not well established clinically, is not the most cost-effective treatment available, or is used for an unapproved indication. At various times in the past, certain insurance providers have adopted policies of not providing reimbursement for the XLIF procedure. We have worked with our surgeon customers and NASS who, in turn, have worked with these insurance providers to supply the information, explanation and clinical data they require to categorize the XLIF procedure as a procedure entitled to reimbursement under their policies. At present, the majority of insurance companies provide reimbursement for XLIF procedures. 
 However, certain carriers, large and small, may have policies significantly limiting coverage of XLIF, Interlaminar Lumbar Interbody Fusion, or ILIF, Osteocel Plus and Osteocel Pro, cervical interbody implants, and/or other procedures, products or services that we offer. We will continue to provide resources to patients, surgeons, hospitals, and insurers in order to ensure optimum patient care and clarity regarding reimbursement and work to remove any and all non-coverage policies. National and regional coverage policy decisions are subject to unforeseeable change and have the potential to impact physician behavior and reimbursement for physician services. We cannot offer definitive time frames or final outcomes regarding reversal of the coverage-limiting policies, as the process is dictated by the third-party insurance providers. For a discussion of these risks, please see the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report.
 Payment amounts are established by government and private payer programs and are subject to fluctuations which could impact physician practice behavior. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for a wide range of medical products and services, including those in spine and intraoperative monitoring where we participate. 
 In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific product lines. There can be no assurance that our products will be accepted by third-party payers, that reimbursement will be available, and/or that the third-party payers’ reimbursement policies (if available) will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably. 
 In the United States, as a result of healthcare reform, third-party payers are increasingly required to demonstrate they can improve quality and reduce costs; we accordingly see an increase in pre-approval/prior authorizations and non-coverage policies citing higher levels of evidence required for medical therapies and technologies. In addition, insured individuals are facing increased premiums and higher out–of-pocket costs for medical coverage which can lead a patient to delay medical treatment. An increasing number of insured individuals receive their medical care through managed care programs, which monitor and often require pre-approval of the services that a member will receive. The percentage of individuals covered by managed care programs is expected to grow in the United States over the next decade.
 Overall escalating costs of medical products and services has led to, and is expected to continue to lead to, increased pressures on the healthcare industry to reduce the costs of products and services. There can be no assurance that third-party reimbursement and coverage will be available or adequate, or that future legislation, regulation, or reimbursement policies of third-party payers will not adversely affect the demand for our products and services or our ability to sell these products and services on a profitable basis. The unavailability or inadequacy of third-party payer coverage or reimbursement could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. For a discussion of these risks, please see the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report. 
 Shareowners (our employees)
 We refer to our employees as “shareowners.” As of December 31, 2018, we have approximately 2,600 shareowners. In addition to our shareowners, we partner with independent sales agents and independent distributors who sell our products in the United States and internationally. None of our shareowners or sales agents are represented by a labor union, and we believe our shareowner and agency relations are good.
