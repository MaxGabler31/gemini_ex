Our Business
 
During 2005 the Company acquired CGM Security Solutions, Inc. as a wholly owned subsidiary and changed its name to CGM Applied Security Technologies, Inc. In conjunction with the acquisition the Company has changed its primary focus from the law enforcement market to the security market in general as it believes that the potential for revenue is much greater.
 
Description of Business of CGM
 
CGM-AST is a manufacturer and distributor of indicative and barrier security seals, security tapes and related packaging security systems, protective security products for palletized cargo, physical security systems for tractors, trailers and containers as well as a number of highly specialized authentication products. Focused primarily on “deterrent technologies,” CGM-AST designs and develops customized tamper evident devices which when integrated into a security protocol; provide chain of custody and/or proof of tampering for targeted assets.
 
The primary factors behind the need for CGM-AST’s products are: (i) the escalation of cargo theft and tampering, (ii) the need for enhanced cargo security because of the fear of terrorism, (iii) damage control of freight and cargo, (iv) the need for security products, (v) brand protection and authentication requirements and (vi) governmental and regulatory requirements.
 
CGM-AST products are certified by the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism ("C-TPAT"), a joint initiative between government and business designed to protect the security of cargo entering the United States while improving the flow of trade. C-TPAT requires importers to take steps to assess, evolve and communicate new practices that ensure tighter security of cargo and enhanced security throughout the entire supply chain. In return, their goods and conveyances will receive expedited processing into the United States. Many of our products are also ISO 17712 compliant, which is a standard for international shipping and container security.
 
Products
 
CGM-AST has Trade Secret protection on its Secure T.R.A.C.® tape, Super Seals, Water Gum Tape, developed a Button Memory Seal and Sentry Sensor®. It also has distribution rights on all NAVATECH products and seals, and owns the rights to the patented ToppClip® pallet security device. In addition, CGM-AST provides authentication technology and products to clients to act as brand protection elements to finished goods. This brand protection technology can help manufacturers reduce the incidences of "knock-offs" that are common in the garment and accessory businesses. CGM-AST’s core products are: CGM-AST Tapes, Self-Wound Security Tape, Void Labels and Void Tape for Bag Closure, SUPERSEALS®, Custom Coated Products, CGM-AST Conductive Inks and Membrane Switch Components, EMAPS®, Locks, Sentry Sensor® and other representative items.
 
SUPERSEAL® and self-voiding carton sealing tape known as SECURE T.R.A.C.(R) show a customized signature if attempts are made at removing them. If cut and resealed, SUPERSEAL® further shows an "opened" legend on the seal's center surface. With self-wound void tape, any attempt at resealing is negated by the surface coating on the tape. An "opened" legend is also left on the tape if removed. Since the products are manufactured in-house, CGM-AST controls all features and has the ability to customize the products to the customer's needs. CGM-AST also offers converted labels, seals, and money bags. CGM-AST manufactures a variety of adhesives, graphics and die cut label configurations for companies whose logos always appear on the tape or label for security purposes. No generic product can be substituted for this product since no one makes an identical product.

Employees
 
ADSV develops, assembles, markets and installs computer systems which capture video, digitally captured images and scanned images, digitize the image, link the digitized images to text/data and store the image and text on a computer database which allows for transmitting the image and text by computer or telecommunication links to remote locations.
 
Imaging technology enables computers to record, store and retrieve both textual information and visual images. The common problem in imaging technology is how to record, store, process and retrieve information and images within the same system. ADSV's software programs utilize technology to link the textual information with the images so that customers can record and retrieve related text and images. ADSV originally developed the software to address the information retrieval problems of tax assessors. ADSV subsequently adapted the software for use by law enforcement agencies and management of jail facilities. ADSV's software also addresses different information retrieval needs such as reproducing line ups and producing housing badges (jails), bar coded wristbands for identification which facilitates movement within jails and courts and storing and retrieving hand written and computer generated document images within arrest records. The marketplace for this technology has become more of a commodity item than the specialized software it was in the past and the Company has made a decision not to actively pursue this market in the future as the cost of upgrading the software and competing in what we consider to be a very small marketplace does not justify the investment that would be necessary. While we will still support and maintain the existing customer base we will no longer actively solicit new customers.
 
ADSV does offer maintenance and support for their products.
 
Maintenance and Support
 
ADSV offers its customers' ongoing maintenance and support plus updates of the software, for an annual fee.
 
Marketing
 
Law Enforcement Applications
 
ADSV markets its Law Enforcement products through vendors of compatible software applications.
 
Customers
 
ADSV maintains a continuing relationship with its customers based upon support services and periodic upgrades of the Compu-Capture(R) line and Compu-Sketch(R) software. The major revenue-generating event is presently the support and maintenance of our existing customer base.
Product Liability Insurance
 
Although ADSV believes its products are safe, it may be subject to product liability claims from persons injured through the use of ADSV's marketed products or services. ADSV carries no direct product liability insurance, relying instead on the coverage maintained by its distributors and manufacturing sources from which it obtains product. There is no assurance that this insurance will adequately cover any liability claims brought against ADSV. There also can be no assurance that ADSV will be able to obtain its own liability insurance (should it seek to do so) on economically feasible terms. ADSV's failure to maintain its own liability insurance could materially adversely affect its ability to sell its products in the future. Although no product liability claims have been brought against ADSV to date, if there were any such claims brought against ADSV, the cost of defending against such claims and any damages paid by ADSV in connection with such claims could have a materially adverse impact upon ADSV, including its financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
 
ADSV owns the proprietary rights to the software used in the Compu-Capture(R) programs. In addition, ADSV owns the rights to the trademarks "Compu-Capture(R)," "Compu-Color(R)" and "Compu-Scan(R)," all trademarks have been registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
