Our Markets
Automotive Industry Analysis and Industry Trends
North America is our core market. We manufacture multi-material foam, rubber, plastic components, and tape adhesive related products utilized in noise, vibration and harshness management, acoustical management, water and air sealing, decorative and other functional applications.
Demand for automotive parts in the OEM market is generally a function of the number of new vehicles produced, which is primarily driven by macro-economic factors, such as credit availability, interest rates, fuel prices, consumer confidence, employment, and other trends including more recently raw material, component, and labor availability. Although automotive OEM demand is tied to actual vehicle production, participants in the automotive parts industry can also grow through increasing product content per vehicle by increasing business with current customers and in existing markets, gaining new customers, and increasing share in adjacent markets. We believe that we are well-positioned to take advantage of these opportunities with our strong North American geographical presence and advanced technology, engineering, manufacturing and customer support capabilities.
Based upon industry sources, North American light vehicle production is expected to recover in 2022 from the COVID-19 impacted low levels in 2021 and 2020, with one third party forecast projecting a 17% growth in vehicle production in 2022 from 2021 production levels, which have been impacted by supply chain issues, including the chip shortage, labor, logistics, and weather related challenges. We also expect higher industry production volumes in 2023 and 2024, based on third-party forecasts, with relatively flat production thereafter.

(Source: IHS Market Automotive) (December 2021)
In addition to the overall industry growth from the depressed levels of 2020 and 2021, we believe there are a variety of trends that continue to influence the future of the North American automotive market. We believe that we are well-positioned to benefit from trends driven by market forces such as:
▪Fuel efficiency/vehicle light-weighting:  Government mandates on fuel efficiency and emission reductions will continue to force the automotive industry to focus on improving the fuel economy of vehicles. This is one of the factors driving the trend of replacing heavier materials used in the past in vehicle production with lighter weight components, such as plastics and foams. 
▪Interior comfort:  Comfort of interiors consistently rank in the top three factors that consumers consider when purchasing a new vehicle and is a key area where vehicle manufactures can differentiate their vehicles. With the ongoing trend of electrification (no engine noise) and increasing demand for quieter vehicles, we expect the use of foam and acoustical insulation in vehicles to increase.
▪Telematics and Infotainment:  The increasing use of telematics and infotainment requires increasingly quieter vehicles for the telematics systems to recognize voice commands and passengers to enjoy the infotainment options. Over the next few years, the vast majority of all new vehicles are expected to include voice recognition systems, increasing the need for quiet interiors. We believe the result will increase the use of acoustic insulation materials, more precise air seals and other noise, vibration, and harshness products in all vehicles.
▪Rapid pace of new vehicle launches:  In order to meet consumers’ increasing demand for new products, the automotive market will see a significant number of new launches from vehicle manufacturers over the next few years. Each launch creates new product opportunities for us with the OEMs because of the need for noise, vibration, and harshness (collectively “NVH”) and buzz, squeak, rattle (collectively “BSR”) solutions as they discover unplanned noise issues at the production launch for a new vehicle program. In many of these situations, we develop and begin supplying a solution within days, a level of responsiveness that avoids competitive requests for quotations and produces premium value for our customers.
▪Localization of production:  Due to freight costs, currency fluctuations, logistic issues and protection of supply, many foreign vehicle manufacturers have increased their North American production volumes and are increasing local sourcing of vehicle components. This trend has been accelerated with the impacts of the various supply chain disruptions seen over the last year. We believe that the geographic location of our production facilities, which are in close proximity to most North American vehicle assembly locations, provides us competitive advantage.
We believe these market trends create opportunities for us to achieve market share gains from increased content per vehicle, new solution-oriented products, geographic shifts in vehicle and component production, and evolving customer sourcing strategies. We continue to develop solutions focused on addressing these trends with solutions that enable our customers to produce distinctive market-leading products.
As an example of our innovative technical capabilities, we utilized our thermoforming process to develop and produce a line of lightweight flexible air duct systems for a leading automotive OEM, providing an 80% weight reduction and enhanced functionality. This air duct system has developed into our patented TwinShape® line of proprietary foam air ducts. We have also leveraged our knowledge in reaction injection molding (“RIM”) to offer NVH and sealing products that meet or exceed stringent flammability requirements for all of the markets we serve. 
Appliance Market 
We are a leading provider of fabricated, non-metallic components to a diverse group of OEMs and tiered suppliers in the appliance, HVAC, and water heater industries. These sales represented approximately 10% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021. These components are primarily manufactured from foam, adhesives, fiberglass, rubber and board-back material. We have extensive materials, engineering and fabrication expertise and deliver custom-designed, innovative solutions for our customers. Our component solutions primarily consist of products used in gasketing, heat deflection, packaging, insulation, water seals, noise reduction and vibration control. Demand for these products is largely driven by the replacement of older units and the broader health of the housing sector. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the seasonally adjusted annual rate for new housing starts in December 2021 was at 1.7 million, a 2.5% increase from the seasonally adjusted annual rate in December 2020. Existing home sales fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.18 million in December 2021, down 4.6% from December 2020, primarily due to low inventory.
The United States major household appliance industry, which includes water heaters, is forecasted to grow in 2022 as new and existing home sales and home improvement spending, both of which have a direct impact on appliance industry sales, continue to show positive outlooks. Recent estimates for projected 2022 appliance industry growth are 2.8%, compared to estimated growth rates of 1 - 2.5% for 2021. The Covid-19 pandemic increased the amount of time individuals spend in their households as well as the number of individuals working from home. This “home nesting” behavior is expected to continue to drive 
consumer spending for home improvements as indicated by the Leading Indicator for Remodeling Activity (“LIRA”), which is projected to increase 13 - 17% from the end of 2021 to 2022.

Products
Our primary products, which are identified by manufacturing process, are traditional die cut products, precision die cut products, thermoformed products, fusion molded products, and reaction injection molding (RIM) products. Our production capabilities enable us to work with a wide variety of raw materials and dimensions to develop the optimum solution for a given application. 
Die Cut Products
Our core process, within all the markets we serve, is die cutting of non-metallic materials and components. Die cutting is a process of using a steel knife (called rule) in a die to cut out a shape of a part from a desired material. We also utilize alternative methods to cut material for parts including CNC-programmed, die-less cutters and laser cutters. Precision Die Cutting is also a core process, where we use a rotary machine to die cut intricate shapes for parts on rolls or sheets. Our technical expertise in die cutting, broad customer base, strategic manufacturing footprint, diverse material selection, and strong quality and delivery performance make us a preferred supplier to many customers. We believe that we can leverage our market position in die cutting by offering more highly engineered, higher value products and processes such as thermoforming, fusion molding, and RIM molded polyurethane. 
Our die cut products include NVH pads for lining internal panels, BSR felts and flocks, foam blocks for gap closer and support, gaskets, seals, insulation, and attachment tapes. In addition, die cutting can be a first production step for our other processes, such as fusion molding and thermoforming.
Thermoformed Molded Products
Our product offerings include thermoformed molded products, which utilize heat, pressure, and metal tooling to mold the raw materials into the designed product. We have leveraged our die cut product market position to gain traction with customers who want a single-source solution for other related products. Thermoformed products generally have a higher engineering content, which we believe provides an opportunity for margin expansion. These products also differentiate us from many of our competitors, which we believe makes us a more desirable supplier to our customers. 
Our thermoformed products include TwinShape® foam air ducts, door water shields, HVAC evaporator liners, console bin mats, fender insulators, and molded seat undercovers. We believe there is significant room to grow within each of our thermoformed molded product areas. 
Fusion Molded Products
Fusion molding is a foam molding process used to manufacture precise three-dimensional components that are lightweight and provide excellent thermal and acoustic performance. Our fusion molded products are manufactured by “fusing” multiple foam details together in machined tools, which yields lightweight closed-cell parts which can also incorporate a variety of common plastic or metal components like clips and fasteners during the production process. Our fusion molded products are primarily used for NVH management and body sealing applications. 
Our fusion molded products include exterior mirror seals, cowl-to-hood seals, cowl-to-fender seals, and other NVH management and sealing applications, such as fillers, spacers, and gaskets. Fusion molded products have also been developed for medical packaging applications by molding United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved foam. 
In Europe, the market for fusion molded products is developed. BMW, Mercedes and VW have integrated the technology in their vehicles for several years. The North American market for fusion molding is growing rapidly as European OEMs source more fusion molded products in their North American vehicles and the technology has gained traction with domestic OEMs including Stellantis, General Motors, and Ford. In addition, since there are a very limited number of North American suppliers with the engineering and manufacturing capabilities to produce fusion molded components, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the anticipated growth in the North American market.
Reaction Injection Molded Products
Our RIM products offer the benefit of a three-dimensional part with superior temperature insulation, water sealing, and NVH performance. RIM is the process of blending isocyanate, polyol, and other additives with specialized metering equipment into engineered molds to make polyurethane foams and elastomers. We offer multiple formulations to generate material properties to meet our customers’ performance requirements. We can produce rigid foam, integral-skin, viscoelastic, energy absorbing, and high resilience products. RIM products are capable of meeting the V-0 flammability rating and can be produced with a “Class A” finish. 
Our RIM products can be utilized within all of the markets we serve and include under hood engine covers, compressor covers, NVH muckets, comfort padding, toilet rings, body positioners, and many seating applications.
Significant Customers
The Company’s customers are principally engaged in the North American transportation industry (approximately 89% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021), and in the manufacture of durable residential housing and commercial appliance products (approximately 10% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021). In the transportation market, the Company’s sales are primarily to Tier 1 suppliers to transportation OEMs. Net sales to automotive OEMs for the year ended December 31, 2021, as a percentage of total net sales were as follows: General Motors Company 7%, Stellantis 7%, and Ford Motor Company 4%. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our net direct sales for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Please refer to Note 2 of our notes to the consolidated financial statements, included in Item II Part 8 of this Annual Report, for further disclosure on net sales made directly to vehicle OEMs in 2021 and 2020 as well as net sales for our foreign operations located in Mexico and Canada for 2021 and 2020.
Competitive Environment
We believe that our customers base their sourcing decisions on the responsiveness of a supplier and its ability to deliver innovative solutions, quality products, and competitive pricing. We strive to develop mutually beneficial relationships with our customers through technical support and consistent/predictable performance. We have attempted to differentiate ourself through our extensive knowledge of materials, rapid responsiveness, and diverse manufacturing capabilities in the United States, Mexico, and Canada.
There is not a dominant supplier within our core transportation and appliance markets. There are moderate barriers to entry for some of our markets with certain processes, such as RIM and fusion molding, including the complexities of managing the scale of production and the complex supply chain necessary to obtain customer acceptance.
Environmental Matters
Our facilities are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air emissions, wastewater discharges, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, and occupational safety and health. Our operations and facilities have been, and in the future may become, the subject of enforcement actions or proceedings for non-compliance with such laws or for remediation of company-related releases of substances into the environment. Resolution of such matters with regulators can result in commitments to compliance abatement or remediation programs and, in some cases, the payment of penalties.
We believe that our facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Our facilities have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with these laws and regulations. However, we currently do not anticipate that the future costs of environmental compliance will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2021, we had 915 full-time and 58 contract workers, 54% work in the United States, 42% work in Mexico, and 4% work in Canada. In the Auburn Hills, Michigan facility, 64 hourly workers are represented by a labor union and are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, which is effective through August 2022. In the Louisville, Kentucky facility, 45 hourly workers are represented by a labor union and are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, which is effective through February 2023. We have never experienced a material work stoppage or disruption to our business relating to employee matters. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
