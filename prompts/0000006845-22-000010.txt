ITEM 1. BUSINESS
The Company
Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Apogee, the Company or we) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Minnesota in 1949. We are a leading provider of architectural products and services for enclosing buildings, and high-performance glass and acrylic products used in applications for preservation, protection and enhanced viewing. 
Our Company has four reporting segments, with three of the segments serving the commercial construction market: 
•The Architectural Framing Systems segment designs, engineers, fabricates and finishes aluminum window, curtainwall, storefront and entrance systems for the exterior of buildings. In fiscal 2022, this segment accounted for approximately 45 percent of our net sales. 
•The Architectural Glass segment coats and fabricates, high-performance glass used in custom window and wall systems on commercial buildings. In fiscal 2022, this segment accounted for approximately 20 percent of our net sales.
•The Architectural Services segment integrates technical services, project management, and field installation services to design, engineer, fabricate, and install building glass and curtainwall systems. In fiscal 2022, this segment accounted for approximately 27 percent of our net sales. 
•The Large-Scale Optical Technologies (LSO) segment manufactures high-performance glass and acrylic products for custom framing, museum, and technical glass markets. In fiscal 2022, this segment accounted for approximately 8 percent of our net sales. 
Strategy
In fiscal 2022, we conducted a holistic strategic review of our business and the markets we serve. This review included extensive input from customers and industry influencers, along with detailed competitive benchmarking. We analyzed our portfolio of products, services, and capabilities to identify the best areas for future growth. We also evaluated our operating model to ensure we have the organizational structure and capabilities needed to deliver consistent profitable growth. Through this work, we validated the Company’s strengths that we can leverage as we move forward. We also identified several challenges facing the Company and opportunities for improved performance. 
Following this review, we established a new enterprise strategy, with three key elements:
1.Become the economic leader in our target markets. We will achieve this by developing a deep understanding of our target markets and aligning our businesses with clear go-to-market strategies to drive value for our customers through differentiated product and service offerings. We will also build a relentless focus on operational execution, driving productivity improvements, and maintaining a competitive cost structure, so that we may bring more value to our customers and improve our own profitability. 
2.Actively manage our portfolio to drive higher margins and returns. We intend to shift our business mix toward higher operating margin offerings and improve our return on invested capital performance. We will accomplish this by allocating resources to grow our top performing businesses, actively addressing underperforming businesses, and investing to add new differentiated product and service offerings to accelerate our growth. 
3.Strengthen our core capabilities. We are shifting from our historical, decentralized operating model, to one with center-led functional expertise that enables us to leverage the scale of the enterprise to better support the needs of the business. We are establishing a Company-wide operating system with common tools and processes that are based on the foundation of Lean and Continuous Improvement. This will be supported by a robust talent management program and a commitment to strong governance to ensure compliance and drive sustainable performance. 
During the fiscal year, we began to implement our new strategy, building significant momentum in the transformation of our business. We realigned Architectural Framing Systems to better leverage the scale and capabilities of the organization, and to bring more clarity and focus in our go-to-market approach. We refocused Architectural Glass to emphasize differentiated, high value-added products. We also announced our intention to move the Sotawall business into Architectural Services, beginning in fiscal 2023, to create a single, unified offering for larger custom curtainwall projects. During the fiscal year, we began several enterprise transformation initiatives designed to strengthen core processes and systems and provide new capabilities across several functional areas. Finally, we relaunched our Lean and Continuous Improvement program, adding key talent and developing a set of tools and processes that we will use to drive improved performance across the enterprise. 
We plan to continue to execute this strategy over the next several years. To measure our progress, we have established three consolidated enterprise financial targets, which we expect to achieve by the end of fiscal year 2025:
•Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)* greater than 12 percent,
•operating margin greater than 10 percent,
•and revenue growth greater than 1.2 times the overall non-residential construction market.  *ROIC is a non-GAAP measure. See discussion of non-GAAP measures within the Overview section of Management's Discussion and Analysis.
Products and Services
Architectural Framing Systems, Architectural Glass and Architectural Services segments
These three segments primarily serve the construction industry and participate in various phases of the value stream to design, engineer, fabricate and install custom glass and aluminum window, curtainwall, storefront and entrance systems for the exterior of buildings, primarily in the commercial, institutional, and multi-family residential construction sectors.

Products vary based on size and coatings to provide conservation-grade UV protection, anti-reflective and anti-static properties and/or security features. 
Product Demand and Distribution Channels
Architectural Framing Systems, Architectural Glass and Architectural Services segments
Demand for the products and services offered by our architectural segments is affected by changes in the North American commercial construction industry, as well as by changes in general economic conditions. Additionally, the Architectural Glass segment has Brazilian operations which are impacted by Brazil's commercial construction industry and general economic conditions. 
We look at several external indicators to analyze potential demand for our products and services, such as U.S. and Canadian job growth, office vacancy rates, credit and interest rates, architectural billing statistics, and material costs. We also rely on internal indicators to analyze demand, including our sales pipeline, which is made up of contracts in review, projects awarded or committed, and bidding activity. Our sales pipeline, together with ongoing feedback, analysis and data from our customers, architects and building owners, provide visibility into near- and medium-term demand. Additionally, we evaluate data on U.S. and Canadian non-residential construction market activity, industry analysis and longer-term trends provided by external data sources. 
Our architectural products and services are used in subsets of the construction industry differentiated by the following types of factors: 
•Building type - Our products and services are primarily used in commercial buildings (office buildings, hotels and retail centers), institutional buildings (education facilities, health care facilities and government buildings), and multi-family residential buildings (a subset of residential construction).
•Level of customization - Many of our projects involve a high degree of customization, as the product or service is designed to meet customer-specified requirements for aesthetics, performance and size, and local building codes. 
•Customers and distribution channels - Our customers are mainly glazing subcontractors and general contractors, with project design being influenced by architects and building owners. Our high-performance architectural glass is primarily sold using both a direct sales force and independent sales representatives. Our installation services are sold by a direct sales force in certain metropolitan areas in the U.S. Our window, curtainwall, storefront and entrance systems are sold using a combination of direct sales forces, independent sales representatives and distributors.
•Geographic location - We primarily supply architectural glass products and aluminum framing systems, including window, curtainwall, storefront and entrance systems, to customers in North America. We are one of only a few architectural glass installation service companies in the U.S. to have a national presence and we have the ability to provide installation project management throughout the U.S. and Canada. Our Architectural Glass segment also supplies architectural glass products to customers in Brazil and certain other international locations.
LSO segment
In our LSO segment, we have a leading brand of value-added coated glass and acrylic used in the custom picture-framing market, museum market, and various technical glass applications. Under the Tru Vue brand, products are sold primarily in North America through national and regional retail chains using a direct sales force, as well as to local retailers through an independent distribution network. We have a global distribution network and also supply our products to museums, galleries and other customers in Europe, Asia and other international locations.
Competitive Conditions
Architectural Framing Systems, Architectural Glass and Architectural Services segments
The North American commercial construction market is highly fragmented. Competitive factors include price, product quality, product attributes and performance, reliable service, on-time delivery, lead-time, warranties and the ability to provide project management, technical engineering and design services. To protect and improve our competitive position, we maintain strong relationships with building owners, architects, and other stakeholders who influence the selection of products and services on a project, and with general contractors, who initiate projects and develop specifications. 
Our Architectural Framing Systems segment competes against several national, regional and local aluminum window and storefront manufacturers, as well as regional paint and anodizing finishing companies. Our businesses compete by providing a broad portfolio of high-quality products, robust engineering capabilities, and dependable, short lead-time service. 
In our Architectural Glass segment, we experience competition from regional glass fabricators and international competitors who can provide certain products with attributes similar to ours. We differentiate by providing a wide range of high-quality products, including several proprietary offerings, that we can bundle together into customized solutions. We maintain strong relationships with architects, developers, and other industry stakeholders, and provide strong customer service and reliable delivery. 
Our Architectural Services segment competes against national and regional glass installation companies. We compete by offering a robust set of capabilities at a competitive cost. Our capabilities include preconstruction services, engineering and design, project management, manufacturing, and field installation. We deliver these services using an operating model which reduces costs and risks for our customers, and we’ve established a track record of regularly meeting each project's unique execution requirements. 
LSO segment
Our LSO segment competes with European and U.S. providers of both basic and valued-added glass and acrylic. Our competitive strengths include innovative proprietary products and process technologies, a highly automated manufacturing model, innovative marketing programs, strong relationships with our customers, and an established distribution network. 
Warranties
We offer product and service warranties that we believe are competitive for the markets in which our products and services are sold. The nature and extent of these warranties depend upon the product or service, the market and, in some cases, the customer being served. Our standard warranties are generally from two to 10 years for our architectural glass, curtainwall and window system products, while we generally offer warranties of two years or less on our other products and services. 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
Materials used in the Architectural Framing Systems segment include aluminum billet and extrusions, fabricated glass, plastic extrusions, hardware, paint and chemicals. Raw materials used within the Architectural Glass segment include flat glass, vinyl, silicone sealants and lumber. Within the Architectural Services segment, materials used include fabricated glass, finished aluminum extrusions, fabricated metal panels and hardware. Materials used in the LSO segment are primarily glass and acrylic. Most of our raw materials are readily available from a variety of domestic and international sources. 
Intellectual Property
We have several patents, trademarks, trade names, trade secrets and proprietary technologies and customer relationships that we believe, in the aggregate, constitute a valuable asset. However, we do not believe that our business is materially dependent on any individual patent, trademark or other intellectual property asset.
SeasonalityActivity in the construction industry is impacted by the seasonal impact of weather and weather events in our operating locations, with activity in some markets reduced in winter due to inclement weather. 
Working Capital Requirements
Trade and contract-related receivables and other contract assets are the largest components of our working capital. Inventory requirements, mainly related to raw materials, are most significant in our Architectural Framing Systems and Architectural Glass segments. 
Backlog
Backlog represents the dollar amount of signed contracts or firm orders, generally as a result of a competitive bidding process, which may be expected to be recognized as revenue in the future. Backlog is not a term defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and is not a measure of contract profitability. In addition to backlog, we have a substantial amount of projects with short lead times that book-and-bill within the same reporting period and are not included in backlog. We have good visibility beyond backlog, as projects awarded, verbal commitments and bidding activities are not included in backlog.
Architectural Framing Systems segment backlog as of fiscal year-end was $428.7 million, compared to $411.3 million at the end of the prior year, reflecting an increase in order volume. We expect approximately 78 percent of the backlog in this segment to be fulfilled in fiscal 2023, with the remainder expected to be filled in fiscal 2024 and beyond; however, the timing of backlog may be impacted by project delays.
Backlog is not a significant metric for the Architectural Glass segment, as orders are typically booked and billed within a short time-frame. 
Backlog in the Architectural Services segment as of fiscal year-end was $517.7 million, compared to $570.9 million at the end of the prior year, due to execution of projects in backlog, timing of firm orders, and signed contracts. We expect approximately 61 percent of the backlog in this segment to be filled during fiscal 2023, with the remainder expected to be filled in fiscal 2024 and beyond; however, the timing of backlog may be impacted by project delays. 
Backlog is not a significant metric for the LSO segment, as orders are typically booked and billed within a short time-frame.
Compliance with Government Regulations
We are subject to various environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. These laws and regulations relate to, among other things, our use and storage of hazardous materials in our manufacturing operations and associated air emissions and discharges to surface and underground waters. We have several continuing programs designed to ensure compliance with foreign, federal, state and local environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations. We contract with outside vendors to collect and dispose of waste at our production facilities in compliance with applicable environmental laws. In addition, we have procedures in place that enable us to properly manage the regulated materials used in and wastes created by our manufacturing processes. We believe we are currently in material compliance with all such laws and regulations. While we will continue to incur costs for compliance with government regulations for our ongoing operations, we do not expect these to have a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. At one manufacturing facility in our Architectural Framing Systems segment, we are continuing to work to remediate historical environmental impacts. These remediation activities are being conducted without significant disruption to our operations. 
Human Capital Resources
The Company had approximately 5,500 employees on February 26, 2022, down from 6,100 employees on February 27, 2021. As of February 26, 2022, approximately 420 of these employees were represented by U.S. labor unions. 
Competition for qualified employees in the markets and industries in which we operate is intense, and the success of our Company depends on our ability to attract, select, develop and retain a productive and engaged workforce. Investing in our employees and their well-being, offering competitive compensation and benefits, promoting diversity and inclusion, and adopting positive human capital management practices are critical components of our corporate strategy.
Health, Wellness and Safety
The safety of our employees is integral to our Company. Providing a safe and secure work environment is one of our highest priorities and we devote significant time and resources to workplace safety. Our safety programs are designed to comply with stringent regulatory requirements and to meet or exceed best practices in our industry. This commitment requires focus and dedication to fundamental aspects of our business to minimize the risk of accidents, injury, and exposure to health hazards. We utilize a safety culture assessment process along with a safety compliance audits to monitor safety programs within our businesses. These assessments and audits provide suggestions for continuous improvement in safety programs and measure employee engagement. In addition, the programs encourage the development of a proactive, inter-dependent safety culture in which leadership and employees interact to ensure safety is viewed as everyone’s responsibility. 
We offer comprehensive health and wellness programs for our employees. In addition to standard health programs including medical insurance and preventive care, we have a variety of resources available to employees relating to physical and mental wellness. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has magnified the importance of keeping our employees safe and healthy. In response to the pandemic, we have taken actions consistent with recommendations of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other local, state, and federal government agencies, to protect our employees.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
Our diversity, equity and inclusion program promotes a workplace where each employee’s abilities are recognized, respected, and utilized to further the Company’s goals. Our aim is to create an environment where people feel included as a part of a team because of their diversity of outlooks, perspectives, and characteristics, which ultimately adds value for our Company. We strive to create a culture of inclusion, reduce bias in our talent practices, and invest in and engage with our communities. We conduct diversity and code of conduct trainings with employees and managers to make clear our views on diversity and promote an inclusive and diverse workplace, where all individuals feel respected and part of a team regardless of their race, national origin, ethnicity, gender, age, religion, disability, sexual orientation or gender identity. 
Talent Management and Development
Our talent management program is focused on developing employees and leaders to meet the Company’s evolving needs. Managers actively engage with their employees to provide coaching and feedback and identify training and development opportunities to improve performance in the employee’s current role and to position the employee for future growth. Training and development opportunities include new-hire training, job specific training, stretch assignments, and safety training. The Company also offers leadership development opportunities, such as our Apogee Leadership Program, along with technical training for engineers, designers and sales staff. In addition, the Company offers an education assistance program in which certain eligible employees receive tuition reimbursement to help defray the costs associated with their continuing education. Our executive leadership and Human Resources teams regularly conduct talent reviews and succession planning to assist with meeting critical talent and leadership needs.
