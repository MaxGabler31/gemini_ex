ITEM 1.BUSINESS
Overview
We envision a world where anyone who wants to have a child can do so. Our mission is to make dreams of parenthood come true through healthy, timely and supported fertility journeys. Through our differentiated approach to benefits plan design, patient education and support and active network management, our clients’ employees are able to pursue the most effective treatment from the best physicians and achieve optimal outcomes.
Progyny is a leading benefits management company specializing in fertility and family building benefits solutions in the United States. Our clients include many of the nation’s most prominent employers across a broad array of industries. We launched our fertility benefits solution in 2016 with our first five employer clients, and we have grown our current base of clients to over 265 with at least 1,000 covered lives. We currently have contracts to provide coverage to approximately 4.0 million employees and their partners (known in our industry as covered lives), whom we refer to as our members. We have achieved this growth by demonstrating that our purpose-built, data-driven and disruptive platform consistently delivers superior clinical outcomes in a cost-efficient manner while driving exceptional client and member satisfaction. We have retained substantially all of our clients since we launched our fertility benefits solution, and our member satisfaction is evidenced by our most recent industry-leading Net Promoter Score, or NPS, of +81 for our fertility benefits solution and +79 for our integrated pharmacy benefits solution, Progyny Rx as of December 31, 2021.
We are redefining fertility and family building benefits, proving that a comprehensive fertility solution can simultaneously benefit employers, patients and physicians. We believe the differentiated value proposition we deliver to all of these constituents is key to our success and growth. By empowering our members with education, guidance and financial support, and enabling high-quality fertility specialists to use the latest science and technologies, our solution leads to the development of customized treatment plans that result in optimal clinical outcomes for our members and cost savings for our clients.
In order to simplify the process for our members, we position the benefit to them using our proprietary Smart Cycle approach. Smart Cycles are designed by us to include the medical services required for a member’s full course of treatment, including all necessary diagnostic testing and access to the latest technology. In conjunction with the Smart Cycle plan design, each of our members who utilizes our benefit has a dedicated Patient Care Advocate, or PCA, who has fertility expertise and provides end-to-end concierge support, including logistical support (i.e., fertility specialist selection, appointment scheduling, treatment authorization and treatment payment), clinical guidance (i.e., treatment options, outcomes statistics and what to expect) and emotional support during the often challenging and unpredictable fertility journey. Additionally, all Progyny members have access to our selective network of high-quality fertility specialists who we equip with a benefits design that enables them to pursue the best treatment pathways, providing our members with tailored treatments that result in optimal clinical outcomes.
In addition to our fertility benefits solution, we offer an integrated pharmacy benefits solution, Progyny Rx, which can be added by our clients. Progyny Rx provides our members with access to the medications needed during their fertility treatment. As part of this solution, we provide care management services, which include our formulary plan design, simplified authorization, assistance with prescription fulfillment and timely delivery of the medications by our network of specialty pharmacies, as well as medication administration training, pharmacy support services and continuing PCA support. 
We have demonstrated our ability to drive better outcomes for our clients, members and provider clinics across multiple metrics. Provider clinics within our network produce outcomes that surpass their own reported practice averages when treating Progyny members because of our differentiated solution. Additionally, across our membership, our outcomes compared to national averages have been consistently superior to date. 
Industry Background
The prevalence of infertility is high, affecting one in eight couples in the United States according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the CDC, and infertility is gaining attention as individuals are more openly 

6




discussing their struggles with fertility. As transparency and dialogue around infertility have increased, there has been a de-stigmatization of the disease. Despite this change in perception of infertility and its high prevalence, it is one of the only high-prevalence medical conditions with limited or non-existent medical insurance. By comparison, medical conditions with a similar prevalence, such as diabetes and asthma, are comprehensively covered by conventional health insurance carriers and employers. Due to the high prevalence of infertility, its high costs of treatment and the limited insurance coverage provided for the disease, there is a significant unmet need for fertility services in the United States and several macro trends are driving that need for fertility treatments and propelling the overall size of the fertility market higher.
While fertility treatments have been available for almost 40 years to help individuals suffering from infertility build their families, access to these treatments has been limited due to the lack of comprehensive coverage and the prohibitive costs. Only a small percentage of employers provide a benefits plan that addresses these costs. As a result, the vast majority of patients who undergo fertility treatment must pay for most or all of their care out-of-pocket, which is cost-prohibitive for many families and individuals.
We believe that the lack of adequate coverage has been the result of both broader public policy issues, as well as conventional health insurance carrier-specific policies. For example, it was not until 2017 that infertility was first recognized as a disease by the American Medical Association and, even now, only 19 states have mandated insurance coverage for infertility. For the states that do mandate coverage, the mandates vary greatly and often leave patients with inadequate coverage or unable to pursue care at all. When conventional health insurance carriers have chosen to structure fertility coverage for their employer clients, that coverage often has limited lifetime dollar maximums and clinically antiquated "one size fits all" clinical protocols, such as mandated step therapy protocols.
Major cultural shifts and the evolving demographics of the workforce in the United States are driving demand for fertility treatments and adequate coverage to support them. More individuals than ever are making the choice to start their families later in life, increasing the biological likelihood of infertility as an individual's fertility declines with age. Additionally, the increased acceptance of non-traditional paths to parenthood has created an increased need for access to fertility treatments. As employees are demanding more robust fertility benefits coverage, employers are increasingly focused on providing a comprehensive fertility benefits plan that supports an inclusive and diverse workplace in order to attract and retain top employees. Because employers in the same industry are competing for employee talent, once the availability of fertility benefits begins to penetrate a particular industry, a demonstrable network effect occurs in which employees within that industry begin to expect the benefit from their employers, which can cause an employer to adopt the benefit to remain competitive and bolster employee satisfaction.
Driven by these market dynamics, according to the CDC, the market for fertility treatments grew at a 9.4% compound annual growth rate from 2010 to 2019 as more individuals pursued treatment. Given this increasing demand coupled with inadequate existing coverage, there is a greater need than ever before for a fertility benefits manager who can provide comprehensive and effective benefits to the employer market.
Industry Challenges
We believe employers are faced with three major challenges relating to providing fertility benefits to their employee bases:

● | the lack of a comprehensive fertility benefits solution that optimizes their fertility treatment expenditures;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the need to reduce the significant maternity and neonatal intensive care unit, or NICU, expenses, and the workplace impact, resulting from multiple births caused by fertility treatments; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the desire to find innovative ways to attract and retain highly sought-after talent.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Employers are seeing an increasing demand for fertility and family building benefits solutions from their employees, yet the programs offered by their conventional health insurance carriers do not successfully address these core challenges.

7




Lack of Effective Fertility Benefits Solutions 
The conventional fertility benefits options available to employers have been designed to control the utilization of services (and expenditures) by employees rather than to optimize outcomes. As such, their plan designs have included restrictive features, such as lifetime dollar maximums, mandated step therapy protocols and limited or no coverage for advanced diagnostics and procedures. In addition, these plan designs have failed to provide access to premier fertility specialists, robust patient support and the ability to dispense fertility medication in a timely manner. 
When conventional fertility benefits coverage is restrictively structured with a lifetime dollar maximum, the patient often makes poor clinical decisions that ultimately result in greater costs for the employer. Because the dollar maximum can easily be exhausted in the midst of a fertility treatment cycle, patients may elect to transfer multiple embryos because they are under financial pressure and mistakenly believe that it will optimize their chance of becoming pregnant. The common use of multiple embryo transfer belies the fact that this procedure greatly increases the risk of multiple births and health complications among the mother and babies. One of the most common complications associated with multiples is preterm births, which significantly escalates healthcare costs, including maternity care, labor and delivery costs and NICU expenses.
Conventional health insurance carriers also often mandate step therapy protocols and restrict access to use of advanced diagnostics and procedures, which exacerbates the inefficient utilization of dollars available under the lifetime dollar maximum and wastes valuable time on less effective treatments. A patient with mandated fertility step therapy protocol may be required to undergo three to six cycles of intrauterine insemination, or IUI, which has an average success rate range of 5% to 15%, takes place over three to six months and can cost up to $4,000 per cycle (or an aggregate of approximately $12,000 to $24,000), according to FertilityIQ. 
The fertility process is a long, rigorous journey, both emotionally and physically. Conventional benefits programs lack any meaningful care coordination, education or patient support. Patients and their dependents have no help in understanding the complex choices they are faced with and discerning between treatment alternatives. There is also limited emotional support when patients face setbacks or unexpected outcomes as the current system ignores the emotional burden of patients embarking on the path to pregnancy through assisted reproductive technology, or ART, treatments and the impact that burden has on employee productivity and the workplace. 
The conventional pharmacy delivery infrastructure is not designed to address the uniqueness of fertility treatment, which requires highly coordinated and timely delivery of medications. Conventional benefits managers require extensive and multiple authorizations and have inconsistent approval processes, which can complicate and delay the provision of medications that are essential to fertility treatment. We believe that with conventional benefits programs, authorization and delivery times of one to two weeks are typical. If medications are not received on time, patients may have to wait a month or longer to commence another round of fertility treatment, wasting valuable time and money. In addition, the storage, preparation and administration of fertility medication is complex and requires extensive self-administered injections, yet most fertility benefits programs offer limited guidance and clinical support to patients around these issues. Additionally, fertility medications are often self-administered injectable drugs, and the effectiveness of a patient’s treatment may be compromised by improper storage and/or incorrect administration of their medications if the patient is not provided access to education and support.
Because of the unique challenges of infertility, including the high costs and complexity of treatment and the variability of outcomes across fertility specialists, conventional benefits solutions have been unable to optimize outcomes and efficiently utilize employers’ dollars committed to fertility. As a result, employers are facing increased demand for an expensive benefits program without the availability of an effective solution in the conventional managed care environment.

Costs Associated with Multiple Births and Poor Fertility Treatment Outcomes
Regardless of whether an employer chooses to cover fertility treatments, they end up bearing the significant medical costs associated with unanticipated multiple births and miscarriages, as well as the associated impacts on the workplace. The high number of multiple embryo transfers that conventionally occurs during IVF leads to a significant number of multiple births, which in turn is a primary cause of dangerous and expensive preterm births, the most common complication resulting from multiple births, which lead to extensive maternity and NICU costs. In addition to multiple birth rates, the relatively higher miscarriage rate associated with IVF treatment also results in significant additional medical costs for employers and their employees, as well as emotional and physical strain on patients. As a result of these suboptimal treatment outcomes, employers also bear the related costs of increased employee absenteeism at the workplace, which is common with instances of multiples births. Employers may not be fully aware of the causal effect and ultimate impact of suboptimal fertility care under the current solutions offered by the conventional benefits programs since these programs do not collect outcomes data from their fertility specialists and therefore cannot accurately report on their program’s performance in a timely manner.
Ability to Attract and Retain Talent
Employers are facing increasing competition to attract and retain talent. As a result, we believe that employers are enhancing their value proposition to employees by evaluating and providing benefits that are most in demand. Family building solutions are an increasing area of focus for employees, and in turn, employers.
Our Market Opportunity
We believe we have a significant opportunity to provide employers with a superior comprehensive solution that addresses the unique challenges and complexities of fertility treatment and related fertility pharmacy services. We estimate that the market for fertility treatments in the United States was approximately $8.0 billion in 2019, based on data published by the CDC regarding the number of treatment cycles and FertilityIQ’s estimate of the average cost per cycle. We estimate the potential size of the U.S. fertility market to be at least twice as large because this figure excludes those individuals who do not seek treatment for infertility. Furthermore, when comparing the United States to other countries, the percentage of babies born utilizing ART is materially lower, at less than 2% in the United States (where fertility treatment is not adequately covered), compared to approximately 10% in Denmark and 5% in Japan (where there is more public health funding for fertility treatment).
We contract with employers to provide fertility and family building benefits to their employees and covered dependents. We believe our addressable market consists of the approximately 8,000 self-insured employers in the United States (excluding quasi-governmental entities, such as universities, school systems, and labor unions). These 8,000 employers have a minimum of 1,000 employees, representing approximately 75 million potential covered lives in total. As such, we estimate that our current member base of 4.0 million covered lives under contract represents a low single digit percent of our total market opportunity.
Regardless of whether or not these self-insured employers currently provide a fertility benefit, we believe they are prospective clients of Progyny. Further, 35% of our clients had no prior fertility coverage before adopting Progyny and 94% of our clients enhanced their coverage when they switched to Progyny. Overall, we believe our market opportunity is substantial and is continuing to grow as a result of the rising demand for fertility benefits solutions, the lack of adequate offerings in the market today and the increasing awareness of the challenges of infertility we are driving.
Our Solutions
We are redefining effective fertility and family building benefits through our purpose-built, data-driven and disruptive platform through which we offer our fertility benefits and Progyny Rx solutions. Our innovative and comprehensive fertility solution has proven to be simultaneously beneficial for our clients, our members and our network of fertility specialists. Through our differentiated approach to benefits plan design, patient education and support and active network management, our clients’ employees are able to pursue the most effective treatment from the best fertility specialists and achieve optimal outcomes in a cost-efficient manner, while our clients and members achieve savings in upfront treatment costs as well as reduced maternity and NICU expenses.

Fertility Benefits Solution
Differentiated Benefits Plan Design
The innovative Smart Cycle is our easy-to-understand fertility benefits design. Our Smart Cycle plan design allows members equitable access to the treatment they need and is designed to drive superior outcomes and reduce both upfront treatment expenses and subsequent costs. Everything needed for a comprehensive fertility treatment is contained within a Smart Cycle treatment bundle, including all necessary diagnostic testing and access to the latest technology (e.g., in the case of IVF treatment, preimplantation genetic testing). We currently offer 19 different Smart Cycle treatment bundles, which may be used independently or in combination depending on the member’s need. Each Smart Cycle has a separate unit value (i.e., some have fractional values and some have whole values). Our clients contract to purchase a cumulative Smart Cycle unit value per eligible member. These can range from one to unlimited cumulative Smart Cycles units. Members can choose their preferred provider clinics within our network and utilize their Smart Cycles for whichever treatments they and their fertility specialists determine to be necessary throughout their fertility journey. 
The Smart Cycle structure allows our members, together with the advice of their fertility specialists and the support of their PCAs, to select the Smart Cycle treatment bundles that align with their unique treatment needs and their intended family building pathway, without having to follow the “one size fits all” protocols common to conventional health insurance carriers, and without the worry that their desired treatment approach will not be authorized or covered for the full treatment cycle. Our comprehensive Smart Cycles, which are our proprietary treatment bundles, are assessed regularly by our Medical Advisory Board, and include access to the latest science and technologies, enabling our network of fertility specialists to utilize best practices. Our superior clinical outcomes driven by our Smart Cycle plan design include higher rates of pregnancy and live births, as well as lower miscarriage rates and fewer multiple births.
Personalized Concierge-Style Member Support Services
Our fertility benefits solution provides members with access to significant support services that are crucial to the success of the fertility and family building journey. Before the fertility treatment process begins, and throughout every step of the fertility journey, we deliver high-touch member support services through a dedicated PCA, who is paired to a member and interacts with them an average of 15 times over the course of their treatment. Our PCAs have deep fertility expertise and provide extensive clinical education, guidance and emotional support to our members. Additionally, we have an in-house clinical staff, comprised of professionals with substantial expertise in reproductive endocrinology, fertility nursing, clinical psychology and social work that design our PCA training curriculum and direct our comprehensive member experience. 
Our comprehensive member portal, accessible via any desktop or mobile device, further supports the member experience by providing key educational resources and easy-to-access benefits information to our members. Our members can use the portal to securely message their PCA or access a curated library of videos, articles, podcasts and webinars on fertility and family building. The portal also offers digital solutions that help our members address the emotional effects that are often associated with infertility, including loss, self-blame, anxiety and depression. Additionally, the portal can be used to review plan coverage, benefit utilization, claim details and account balances. We believe our platform provides our members with best-in-class support services to help them navigate their fertility and family building journeys.
Selective Network of High-Quality Fertility Specialists
We have utilized our deep industry knowledge and the insights derived from our data analytics platform to establish and actively manage a national network of the leading fertility specialists in the country. Our members receive access to our selective Center of Excellence network of high-quality providers that includes approximately 900 fertility specialists who practice at over 650 provider clinic locations throughout the United States. Our network includes 46 of the top 50 fertility practice groups by volume in the United States according to 2019 CDC data, which was published in 2021 and is the most recent data available. Fertility specialists who are invited to join our network must meet and maintain rigorous credentialing standards and quality thresholds that we set for inclusion in our network to ensure that our members receive the highest quality of care. Our national network serves members in virtually every state, providing extensive geographic coverage to our national employers.

Progyny Rx, an Integrated Pharmacy Benefits Solution
Progyny Rx is our integrated pharmacy benefits solution that can be added by clients that utilize our fertility benefits solution. This solution provides our members with access to the medications needed during their treatment. As part of this solution, we provide care management services, which include our formulary plan design, simplified authorization, assistance with prescription fulfillment and timely delivery of the medications by our network of specialty pharmacies, as well as medication administration training, pharmacy support services and continuing PCA support. Our single treatment and medication authorization process reduces the administrative burden, creating an efficient pharmacy solution for our members and their fertility specialists. Progyny Rx reduces dispensing and delivery time to two days to eliminate the risk of missed treatment cycles. Our single medication authorization and delivery process ensures that our members will not miss or delay cycles. We provide access to phone-based, clinical education and support seven days a week to ensure that our members understand any necessary medication storage requirements and administration techniques, including injection training. To further support those members that require additional education, we also offer a library of on-demand videos. Given the importance of the timely use of medication to the success of fertility treatments, and the complexity involved in administering the medications, we believe Progyny Rx provides a differentiated and effective pharmacy solution for our clients and their employees.
Robust Data Collection Process 
We believe that we are the only fertility and family building benefits company to collect data in a timely manner directly from providers on adherence to treatment protocols and clinical outcomes, including single embryo transfer rates, pregnancy rates, miscarriage rates, live birth rates, multiple birth rates, practice patterns, treatment timelines and costs per birth. Our data is used to understand the utilization of our benefits, our provider clinics’ adherence to best practices and the outcomes produced by each clinic and across our network. This data informs decisions across our platform, from services covered to our fertility network standards. The insights from our data also enable us to actively manage our fertility specialist network and ensure that our fertility specialists are utilizing best practices and optimizing outcomes. The data collection process also includes extensive member surveys, which allow us to understand and improve our member satisfaction. Finally, our data allows us to provide our clients with unique and detailed quarterly reports in order to provide full transparency into the utilization of their benefit program, their expenditures and the outcomes delivered and value created. We believe that we effectively utilize our thorough data collection and analysis process and our unique and robust data set to continuously improve the client and member experience across our platform.
Prestigious Medical Advisory Board 
Our Medical Advisory Board is comprised of nationally recognized fertility specialists who are advancing fertility science and research. They are responsible for oversight of key clinical issues, including evaluating new fertility treatment diagnostics and procedures to ensure that our benefits design and overall program is comprehensive and designed to drive to the best outcomes. This review ensures that we are evaluating and covering the latest and most effective fertility treatments and identifying opportunities to improve our plan design, member experience and fertility specialists network standards.
Full Service Client Account Management 
We provide a dedicated account management team to ensure that we are delivering superior service. Our account managers support our clients’ day-to-day needs and resolve issues that arise. For example, to help our clients ensure that their employees are fully aware of the Progyny program, our account management teams work with our clients to create co-branded materials to support health fairs, open enrollment events and other employee communications. The account management team also attends open enrollment benefits fairs and other health fairs throughout the year and hosts virtual open enrollment webinars for members to attend live or on-demand. Our account management team also reviews all quarterly and annual program reports with our clients to reinforce the transparency we provide to clients into their expenditures and outcomes and to review and quantify the value created by our solutions. We believe our account management services, including our detailed client reporting, play an important role in helping us maintain and strengthen our client relationships.

Ease of Integration for Our Clients 
Once we are selected by an employer to manage their fertility and family building benefit, our solution is easy to implement as part of their broader pre-tax medical benefits package. Integrating our solution involves only a small commitment of our client's time (typically only six to ten hours over the course of six weeks). Facilitating the ease of integration is the fact that we have developed multiple integration solutions that allow us to integrate with any health plan or health insurance carrier, reducing significant time and expense for our clients. Our ability to integrate our solution with our clients' health insurance coverage allows our benefit to be offered to employees on a pre-tax basis, providing our members with significant savings in comparison to a post-tax reimbursement. We believe our ability to integrate our benefits solutions with all of the large national health insurance carriers is a differentiating factor within the industry.
Surrogacy and Adoption Reimbursement Program
We also offer a surrogacy and adoption reimbursement program. We can manage the reimbursement of surrogacy and adoption expenses for those clients who offer such reimbursement benefits. For these programs, employers designate a specific lifetime dollar amount toward surrogacy and/or adoption services for their employees. We then administer the expense reimbursement to employees up to this dollar amount. We work with our clients to determine what expenses related to adoption and/or surrogacy will be covered under their plan, thereby alleviating their administrative burden. Examples of reimbursement expenses typically include agency fees, surrogacy fees, travel expenses and healthcare expenses for the surrogate.
Our Value Proposition
We believe that our competitive success is a function of our ability to concurrently: (1) provide tangible financial value to our clients; (2) deliver a better and more supported fertility journey to our members; and (3) provide value to, and work collaboratively with, the nation’s finest fertility specialists. 
We Provide Measurable Value to Our Employer Clients

Our Growth Strategy 
Expand Our Client Base 
We intend to continue increasing our client base of self-insured employers throughout the United States by leveraging our experienced salesforce and strong relationships with benefits consultants. We believe we have an addressable market of approximately 8,000 potential self-insured employer clients in the United States (excluding quasi-governmental entities, such as universities, school systems, and labor unions), who have a minimum of 1,000 employees and, with our base of over 265 clients under contract, are still in the early stages of our growth trajectory. Importantly, as we have continued to grow, we have meaningfully diversified our client base across an array of different industries. We are expanding our client base within each industry that we serve, and have an industry-specific strategy, which enables us to most effectively target our addressable market. Additionally, we believe that our expanding presence has resulted in a heightened awareness of fertility benefits and has informed the market of the value we provide to our employer clients and our members, which we believe also helps facilitate growth. 
Capitalize on Embedded Growth Potential within Our Existing Client Base 
Because of how our revenue model is structured, we believe we are positioned to realize organic revenue growth as our clients and their respective employee bases grow and utilize more fertility treatment services as a result. A meaningful portion of our clients have grown, and we believe many of them will continue to grow. In addition, we have historically realized similar utilization trends of fertility services for new members compared with existing members on a same client basis. We believe the combination of these factors results in meaningful and sustainable embedded growth potential well into the future. 
Expansion of Progyny Benefits Solutions within Our Existing Client Base 
We expect to see further growth from existing clients that add incremental services to their fertility benefits program. For example, a client can expand the fertility benefits they offer to their employees by increasing the number of Smart Cycles they contract for. In addition, our fertility benefits solution clients can purchase our add-on Progyny Rx solution. We introduced Progyny Rx in the third quarter of 2017 and went live with a select number of clients in January 2018. Currently, 81% of our clients under contract are utilizing this solution, including 93% of the clients we signed in 2021. We believe our sales and marketing capabilities play an important role in informing and educating clients about the additional value and impact we can provide to them and their members by enhancing their benefit program.

New Services and Addressable Markets to Enhance the Depth and Breadth of Our Comprehensive Fertility Offering 
As we continue to grow and expand our client base, we are continuously evaluating the latest evolving trends to find ways we can better serve the needs of existing and new potential clients and their employees. We believe we are uniquely positioned to do this for several reasons. First, we believe the combination of our Medical Advisory Board and our selective network of high-quality fertility specialists, as well as the data we collect and analyze, provides us with differentiated insights into fertility care delivery and support. In addition, we believe we have positive and collaborative relationships with our clients that offer us additional insights into their needs. We believe the combination of these factors, coupled with our demonstrated track record of adding more services to our benefits design, highlights that we are well positioned to do so in the future. To date, we have identified several ways we believe we can potentially expand our offering, our addressable market, and our client base in the future. We will continue to evaluate opportunities as our platform continues to expand. 
Our Clients
We currently have contracts to serve over 265 employers in the United States across more than 30 industries. Our current clients, who are industry leaders across both high-growth and mature industries and range in size from at least 1,000 to 500,000 employees, represent approximately 4.0 million covered lives under contract. For the year ended December 31, 2021, two clients accounted for 19% and 15%, or a combined 34%, of our total revenue. No other clients accounted for more than 10% for the year ended December 31, 2021.
We believe that our employer clients are thought leaders in their respective industries and are creating a network effect that is helping to drive more widespread adoption of fertility benefits in their specific industries. We have clients in the technology, consumer retail, industrial, healthcare, media, insurance, legal, food and beverage, financial services, life sciences, professional services, government services, energy, manufacturing, logistics, transportation, real estate, nonprofit and hospitality sectors.
Substantially all of our clients have renewed their benefits management contracts since our initial benefits offerings launched in 2016. The majority of our clients have signed multi-year contracts or contracts that renew automatically on an annual basis.
Given that the majority of our clients contract with us for a January 1st benefits plan start date, our sales cycle follows the conventional healthcare benefits cycle, which largely concludes by the end of October of the prior year to allow for benefits education and annual open enrollment to occur. In the 2021 sales cycle, more clients have opted for comprehensive coverage, with substantially all of our new clients electing for Progyny Rx, multiple Smart Cycles and/or egg-freezing.
Our Competitive Landscape
We believe we are the leader in the market for employer-sponsored fertility benefits and family building solutions.
We believe we compete favorably based on the following competitive factors:

● | the value and comprehensiveness of the benefits solution and superior outcomes for employees;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | benefits plan design;
--+----------------------


● | access for all employees and their covered dependents, including LGBTQ+ and single mothers by choice;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | equitable access to care across geographies;
--+---------------------------------------------


● | treatment plans that maximize effectiveness and achieve desired outcomes;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | member experience, including unlimited dedicated patient education, clinical guidance and emotional support;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

15





● | access to a network of high-quality fertility specialists;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | data reporting and sharing; and
--+--------------------------------


● | access to an integrated pharmacy solution.
--+-------------------------------------------

While we do not believe any single competitor offers a comparably robust, integrated fertility and family building benefits solution, we compete primarily with health insurance companies and benefits administrators that also provide fertility benefits management services as part of their overall healthcare coverage. These competitors include conventional health insurance carriers, such as UnitedHealthcare, Cigna, Aetna and members of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. Other competitors who currently provide fertility benefits management services to employers include WIN Fertility and Optum Fertility Solutions as well as emerging companies such as Carrot Fertility and Maven Clinic, among others.
Our solutions are structured as a pre-tax benefit program integrated into employers’ overall employee medical insurance, which is unique compared to the offerings of benefits managers new to the industry that do not have integrated health insurance carrier solutions. In addition to our unique plan design, member support and fertility specialist network, one of the key structural differences between our pre-tax benefit and their post-tax reimbursement programs is that the individual receiving reimbursement for fertility treatments must pay income taxes on the amount of that reimbursement for the post-tax programs.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our solutions through our sales organization and, in many cases, we leverage our relationships with top benefits consultants to establish relationships with potential clients. Our sales team has broad experience in health benefits management and extensive long-term relationships with industry participants and benefits executives at large employers. Our sales team is organized principally by geography and account size and is responsible for identifying potential clients and managing the overall sales process. The success and effectiveness of our sales team is evidenced by the approximately 85 new clients that we added in 2021, and the fact that a majority of our current clients terminated their existing fertility coverage to switch to Progyny.
We generate client leads, accelerate sales opportunities and build brand awareness through our marketing programs. Our marketing programs target human resource, benefits and finance executives in addition to health professionals and senior business leaders. Our principal marketing programs include learning opportunities for potential members, demand generation, field marketing events, integrated marketing campaigns (including direct email and online advertising) and participation in industry events, trade shows and conferences. We also benefit from strong referrals as several of our prominent clients have publicly endorsed Progyny and discussed the value they and their members receive.
Government Regulation
As a participant in the healthcare industry, we are required to comply with extensive and complex U.S. laws and regulations at the federal and state levels. Although many regulatory and governmental requirements do not directly apply to our business, our clients are required to comply with a variety of U.S. laws, and we may be affected by these laws as a result of our contractual obligations. We have attempted to structure our operations to comply with laws, regulations and other requirements applicable to us directly and to our clients, members, fertility specialists and specialty pharmacies, but there can be no assurance that our operations will not be challenged or impacted by enforcement initiatives.
Healthcare Reform
It is uncertain how our operations will be affected by the changing political, legislative, and regulatory landscapes, as well as other influences impacting the healthcare industry. While the most salient vehicle for healthcare reform, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, does not directly regulate our business, it does affect the coverage and plan designs that are or will be provided by certain insurance carriers and certain of our clients, as well as the overall reimbursement environment for healthcare providers. Since its enactment in March 2010, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges 

16




to certain aspects of the ACA, and on June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Other health reform efforts have been proposed by members of Congress, such as measures that would expand the role of government-sponsored coverage, including further reform to the ACA, as well as single payer or so-called “Medicare-for-All” proposals, which could have far-reaching implications for the healthcare industry if enacted. In October 2020, the Departments of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), Labor (“DOL”) and the Treasury issued a final rule that requires most group health plans and health insurance issuers in the individual and group markets to disclose certain price and cost-sharing information for all covered healthcare items and services, including prescription drugs to participants, beneficiaries and enrollees (the “Rule”). The Rule also requires plans and issuers to disclose in-network negotiated rates, historical out-of-network allowed amounts, and drug pricing information through three publicly available machine-readable files. On August 20, 2021, the agencies jointly released guidance regarding the implementation of the Rule. Importantly, the guidance announced that the agencies will (i) indefinitely defer enforcement of the Rule’s requirement that plans and issuers publish machine-readable files relating to prescription drug pricing pending further rulemaking and (ii) defer enforcement of the Rule’s requirement to publish the remaining machine-readable files until July 1, 2022. The cost-sharing information requirements under the Rule take effect in a phased approach beginning January 1, 2023. On January 28, 2021, President Joe Biden issued an Executive Order directing federal agencies to examine all existing regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies and similar agency actions to determine if any such actions are inconsistent with the policy set forth in the Executive Order to protect and strengthen the ACA and make high-quality healthcare accessible and affordable for every American. As another example of recent healthcare legislative changes, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, or CAA, effective as of December 27, 2021, contains provisions impacting group health plans, including protections for plan participants from surprise medical bills and ensuring health plan price transparency. 
​
Several items pertain to disclosure. The CAA prohibits plans from entering into services agreements that directly or indirectly restrict the plans from disclosing provider-specific costs and quality of care information. It also requires disclosure by health insurance brokers and consultants to plan sponsors regarding reasonably expected direct and indirect compensation for referral of services to group health plans. Additionally, the CAA requires plans to submit reports to the DOL or HHS and the Internal Revenue Services, or the IRS, with certain information on pharmacy benefits and drug costs for participants and beneficiaries and the application of in-network rates to out of network services. The CAA also requires certain service providers for health plans to comply with certain ERISA fee disclosure rules. In addition, effective January 1, 2022, the No Surprises Act (enacted as part of the CAA) provides protection against surprise medical bills by prohibiting plans and providers from balance billing patients for emergency care performed by out-of-network providers as well as non-emergency and ancillary services performed by out-of-network providers at in-network facilities, subject to certain notice and consent exceptions for non-emergency and ancillary services. The new law also grants additional patient protections, including requiring providers to send a good faith estimate of the expected charges for furnishing items or services to an insured patient’s health plan (or directly to an uninsured patient) before such items or services are delivered (including items or services reasonably expected to be provided in conjunction with scheduled items or services or that are reasonably expected to be delivered by another provider). The No Surprises Act also provides a dispute resolution process in the event the actual charges for such items and services are substantially higher than the plan’s estimate, and prohibits providers from charging patients an amount beyond the in-network cost sharing amount for services rendered by out-of-network providers, subject to certain exceptions. Many states have also enacted comprehensive balance billing or surprise billing laws and the CAA defers to existing state requirements with respect to state-established payment amounts. Such state laws vary in their approach, resulting in different impacts on the healthcare system as a whole.
We are unable to predict how these changes to the ACA and other healthcare reform initiatives from new legislation, regulation, judicial action and/or executive action, including the CAA and No Surprises Act and state laws, will ultimately impact the healthcare industry and what the potential impact may be on our business and on our relationships with current and future clients, insurance carriers, and healthcare providers.
Licensing and Other Legal Requirements
Many states have licensure or registration requirements for entities providing third-party administrator, or TPA, or pharmacy benefit management, or PBM, services. Given the nature and scope of the solutions and services that we provide, we are required to maintain TPA and/or PBM licenses and registrations in certain jurisdictions and to ensure that such licenses and registrations are in good standing on an annual basis. These licenses require us to comply with the rules and regulations of the governmental bodies that issued such licenses, including maintaining certain solvency or bond requirements. Our failure to comply with such rules and regulations could result in administrative penalties, the suspension of a license, or the loss of a license, all of which could negatively impact our business.

17




Separately, states impose licensing requirements on insurers, risk-bearing entities, and insurance agents, as well as those entities that provide utilization review services. We do not believe that our services require us to be licensed under these state laws. We are unable to predict, however, how our services may be viewed by regulators over time, how these laws and regulations will be interpreted, or the full extent of their application. If a regulatory authority in any state determines that the nature of our business requires that we be licensed under such state laws, we may need to restructure our business to comply with any related requirements.
Fraud and Abuse Laws. Many of our clients, insurance carriers, and network healthcare providers are impacted directly and indirectly by certain fraud and abuse laws, including the federal anti-kickback and false claims laws. Because the solutions we provide are not reimbursed by government healthcare payors, such fraud and abuse laws generally do not directly apply to our business. However, many states have similar laws and regulations that may differ from each other and federal law in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. For example, certain states have anti-kickback and false claims laws that may be broader in scope than analogous federal laws and may apply regardless of payor.
ERISA. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA, regulates certain aspects of employee health benefits plans, which includes both insured and self-funded health plans sponsored by our clients, with which we have agreements to provide TPA services. Although health plans and their fiduciaries are subject to the fiduciary obligations of ERISA, we believe that we are not fiduciaries in the conduct of our business vis-a-vis these plans. However, there can be no assurance the DOL, which is the agency that enforces ERISA, would not in the future assert that the fiduciary obligations imposed by ERISA apply to certain aspects of our operations or courts would not reach such a ruling in private ERISA litigation. 
ERISA also imposes civil and criminal liability on service providers and certain other persons with relationships to health plans subject to ERISA if certain forms of illegal or prohibited remuneration are made or received by such service providers or other persons. These provisions of ERISA are similar, but not identical, to the healthcare anti-kickback laws described above, although ERISA lacks the statutory and regulatory “safe harbor” exceptions incorporated into the healthcare anti-kickback laws. Like the healthcare anti-kickback laws, the corresponding provisions of ERISA are broadly written and their application to particular cases can be uncertain. 
Employee benefits plans subject to ERISA are subject to certain rules, published by the DOL, including certain reporting requirements for direct and indirect compensation received by plan service providers. Finally, although ERISA has broad preemptive effect with respect to certain state laws that “relate” to benefit plans, it does not preempt state laws imposing transparency requirements on PBMs. 
Prompt Pay Laws. Certain states have laws regulating the amount of time that may elapse from when a third-party payor receives a claim for services rendered to when those services are paid. Many of these state laws do not apply to our business as these laws are preempted by ERISA or otherwise exempt entities like us that provide TPA-only services.
Network Adequacy and Access. Certain states and government programs have laws regulating healthcare provider networks in order to ensure adequacy and access for beneficiaries and providers. These laws may affect us and our payor clients in network design and management. If we do not comply, we could face enforcement action or other penalties.
Requirements Regarding the Privacy and Security of Personal Information
HIPAA Privacy and Security Requirements. Regulations promulgated pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or collectively referred to as HIPAA, establish privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of certain individually identifiable health information (known as “protected health information”) and require the implementation of administrative, physical and technological organizational safeguards to protect the privacy of protected health information and ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic protected health information.
As a provider of services to entities subject to HIPAA, we are directly subject to certain provisions of the regulations as a “Business Associate.” When acting as a Business Associate under HIPAA, we are permitted to use and disclose protected health information to perform our services and for other limited purposes, but other uses and 

18




disclosures, such as marketing communications, require written authorization from the patient or must meet an exception specified under the privacy regulations.
Other Privacy and Security Requirements. In addition to HIPAA, there are various federal and state laws that govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to and confidentiality of personal information, some of which may be applicable to our business. Certain federal and state laws protect types of personal information that may be viewed as particularly sensitive. For example, New York’s Public Health Law, Article 27-F protects information that could reveal confidential HIV-related information about an individual. State laws are contributing to increased enforcement activity and may also be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities. Further, California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which went into operation on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act, or the CPRA, recently passed in California. The CPRA will impose additional data protection obligations on covered businesses, including additional consumer rights processes, limitations of data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It will also create a new California data protection agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement. The majority of the provisions will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and additional compliance investment and potential business process changes may be required. Similar laws have passed in Virginia and Colorado, and have been proposed in other states and at the federal level, reflecting a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States. The majority of these laws have express exemptions relating to any data handled pursuant to HIPAA, so many of these state laws do not supersede or conflict with any rules and requirements of HIPAA. However, the enactment of some state laws could still have potentially conflicting requirements that would make compliance challenging.
Data Protection and Breaches. Laws in all 50 states require businesses to provide notice to clients whose personally identifiable information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. Most states require holders of personal information to maintain safeguards and take certain actions in response to a data breach, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals or the state’s attorney general. A non-permitted use or disclosure of protected health information is presumed to be a breach under HIPAA unless the Covered Entity or Business Associate establishes that there is a low probability the information has been compromised consistent with requirements enumerated in HIPAA. As a Business Associate under HIPAA, we are required to report breaches of unsecured protected health information to Covered Entities within 60 days of discovery of the breach or such shorter period as set forth in the applicable Business Associate Agreement.
HIPAA Transaction and Identifier Standards. HIPAA and its implementing regulations mandate format and data content standards and provider identifier standards (known as the National Provider Identifier) that must be used in certain electronic transactions, such as claims, payment advice and eligibility inquiries. HHS now requires the use of updated standard code sets for diagnoses and procedures known as the ICD-10 code sets. Enforcement of compliance with these standards falls under HHS and is carried out by CMS. In the event new requirements are imposed, we will be required to modify our systems and processes to accommodate these changes.
Consumer Protection Laws. Federal and state consumer protection laws are being applied increasingly by the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, and states’ attorneys general to regulate the collection, use, storage and disclosure of personal or health information, through websites or otherwise, and to regulate the presentation of website content. Courts may also adopt the standards for fair information practices promulgated by the FTC, which concern consumer notice, choice, security and access. Consumer protection laws require us to publish statements to our members that describe how we handle personal information and choices members may have about the way we handle personal information. If such information that we publish is considered untrue, we may be subject to government claims of unfair or deceptive trade practices, which could lead to significant liabilities and consequences.
Restrictions on Communication. Communications with our members increasingly may be subject to and restricted by laws and regulations governing communications via telephone, fax, text, and email. We also use email and social media platforms as marketing tools. For example, we maintain social media accounts. As laws and regulations, including FTC enforcement, rapidly evolve to govern the use of these platforms and devices, the failure by us, our employees or third parties acting at our direction to abide by applicable laws and regulations in the use of these 

19




platforms and devices could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations or subject us to fines or other penalties.
Intellectual Property
We rely on trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as our relationships with providers and clients, unique benefits model, ability to track outcomes and creation of resources for all constituents, along with the skills and ingenuity of our employees, are larger contributors to our success our company. Other than the trademark Progyny (and design), Smart Cycle and UnPack It, which are not subject to any known rights of others, including any impairments, assignments or pledges, we do not believe our business is dependent to a material degree on trademarks, patents, copyrights or trade secrets.
Seasonality
Given that the majority of our clients contract with us for a January 1st benefits plan start date, the first quarter has historically been the strongest in terms of sequential quarterly growth. We have in the past and expect in the future to experience seasonal fluctuations in our revenue as more members choose to start their fertility journey while also seeking to minimize their out-of-pocket costs as the calendar year progresses. 
Employees and Human Capital 
              As of December 31, 2021, we had 313 employees, of which 311 are full-time. Our employees are our most important asset and our culture is a key to our success. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes designed to ensure the safety and well-being of our employees as well as the communities in which we operate. For instance, we implemented a remote working policy for all of our employees. We have recently re-opened our corporate offices to employees on a hybrid basis, while implementing additional safety measures and protocols. We are committed to creating and maintaining a healthy and safe workplace for our employees. We have not furloughed or laid off any employees due to the ongoing pandemic. 
​
We are united around our mission and committed to our shared values of Passion, Collaboration, Innovation, Integrity and Growth. Our people strategy is focused on employee culture and engagement, competitive compensation and development, diversity, equity and inclusion, and community outreach and support. 
​

● | Culture and Engagement. Our benefits are designed to help employees and their families stay healthy, meet their financial goals, protect their income and help them balance their work and personal lives. These include access to mental health services, life and financial planning workshops, wellness initiatives, employee assistance programs, and new parent and return to work benefits. We also measure employee engagement on an ongoing basis, including through broad employee satisfaction surveys and pulse surveys on specific issues, intended to assess our success in promoting an environment where employees are engaged, satisfied, productive and possess a strong understanding of our business goals. The results from engagement surveys are used to implement programs and processes designed to enhance employee engagement and improve the employee experience or modify existing programs and benefits offerings.

​

● | Competitive Compensation and Development. We invest in our workforce by offering competitive salaries, attractive incentives and innovative benefits. We focus on creating opportunities for employee growth, development and training, including opportunities to cultivate talent and identify candidates for new roles from within the company, management and leadership development programs, technical skill building initiatives and mentoring programs. We include the Progyny benefit in our own health plan, allowing Progyny employees to realize their dreams of parenthood. We offer paid parental leave for new parents and offer a pregnancy loss leave benefit as an enhancement to our bereavement leave policy, explicitly recognizing the physical, emotional, and mental health impact of a pregnancy loss, or failed adoption or surrogacy, for any employee. We also offer additional paid leave to all employees to support other family health and care challenges. Additionally, we expanded our mental health resources to assist our employees with managing the stresses and uncertainties associated with COVID-19.

● | Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. We believe diversity, equity and inclusion results in business growth and encourages increased innovation, retention of talent and a more engaged workforce. We strive to create a workplace where all individuals feel valued, empowered and welcomed. Our key initiatives focus on recruiting outreach, internal resource groups representing employees and allies from historically underrepresented and/or marginalized communities, mentoring programs and career development ladders. We published our first corporate sustainability report on our website, which further highlights our approach to diversity and inclusion, and we also publish EEO-1 reports on our website. Nothing on our website shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

​

● | Community Outreach and Support. We believe it is important to give back and promote community outreach and support through corporate giving, charitable matching, and employee volunteerism in the communities in which we live and work. We allow flexible work hours to accommodate employee volunteer opportunities, provide corporate sponsored charitable events and have designed initiatives in the fertility and maternal health space to include corporate matching of employee charitable donations.
