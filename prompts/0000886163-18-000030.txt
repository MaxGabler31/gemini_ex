Item 1. | Business

Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and acquiring technologies that help pharmaceutical companies discover and develop medicines. Over our more than 30 year history, we have employed research technologies such as nuclear receptor assays, high throughput computer screening, formulation science, liver targeted pro-drug technologies and antibody discovery technologies to assist companies in their work toward securing prescription drug approvals. We currently have partnerships and license agreements with over 95 pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and over 165 different programs under license with us are currently in various stages of commercialization and development. We have contributed novel research and technologies for approved medicines that treat cancer, osteoporosis, fungal infections and low blood platelets, among others. Our partners have programs currently in clinical development targeting seizure, coma, cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, muscle wasting, liver disease, and kidney disease, among others. We have over 800 issued patents worldwide.
We have assembled our large portfolio of fully-funded programs either by licensing our own proprietary drug development programs, licensing our platform technologies such as Captisol or OmniAb to partners for use with their proprietary programs, or acquiring existing partnered programs from other companies. Fully-funded programs are those for which our partners pay all of the development and commercialization costs. For our internal programs, we generally plan to advance drug candidates through early-stage drug development or clinical proof-of-concept.
Our business model creates value for stockholders by providing a diversified portfolio of biotech and pharmaceutical product revenue streams that are supported by an efficient and low corporate cost structure. Our goal is to offer investors an opportunity to participate in the promise of the biotech industry in a profitable, diversified and lower-risk business than a typical biotech company. Our business model is based on doing what we do best: drug discovery, early-stage drug development, product reformulation and partnering. We partner with other pharmaceutical companies to leverage what they do best (late-stage development, regulatory management and commercialization) to ultimately generate our revenue. We believe that focusing on discovery and early-stage drug development while benefiting from our partners’ development and commercialization expertise will reduce our internal expenses and allow us to have a larger number of drug candidates progress to later stages of drug development.
Our revenue consists of three primary elements: royalties from commercialized products, license and milestone payments and sale of Captisol material. In addition to discovering and developing our own proprietary drugs, we selectively pursue acquisitions to bring in new assets, pipelines, and technologies to aid in generating additional potential new revenue streams.

4

OmniAb Technologies
Our OmniAb technology includes our OmniRat, OmniMouse, OmniFlic and OmniChicken technology platforms for use in discovering fully human antibodies. These platforms consist of genetically-engineered transgenic rodents that produce a broadly diversified repertoire of antibodies and enable novel fully-human antibody drug discovery and development by our OmniAb partners. Fully-human OmniAb antibodies provide advantages to our partners in that fully-human antibodies have reduced immunogenicity, streamline development timelines and costs, and accelerate novel antibody discovery. The OmniChicken platform consists of genetically-engineered transgenic chickens which enable the generation of novel antibodies against targets that are not immunogenic in mammals like mice and rats, the core species of Ligand’s existing OmniAb platform. Currently, more than 30 partners are utilizing OmniAb animals in their drug discovery and development efforts. incoLigand acquired these technologies through the acquisition of OMT in January 2016 and Crystal in October 2017
Captisol Technology
Captisol is Ligand’s patented, uniquely-modified cyclodextrin that is specifically designed to maximize safety, while improving the solubility, stability and bioavailability of APIs. Captisol can enable faster and more efficient development paths for our partners, given its known regulatory acceptance. Ligand maintains both Type IV and Type V DMFs with the FDA. These DMFs contain manufacturing and safety information relating to Captisol that our licensees can reference when developing Captisol-enabled drugs. Ligand also filed a DMF in Japan in 2015. Captisol-enabled drugs are marketed in more than 60 countries, and over 45 partners have Captisol-enabled drugs in development.
LTP Technology Platform
The LTP Technology platform is a novel prodrug technology designed to selectively deliver a broad range of pharmaceutical agents to the liver. A prodrug is a biologically inactive compound that can be metabolized in the body to produce an active drug. The LTP Technology works by chemically modifying biologically active molecules into an inactive prodrug, which will be administered to a patient and later activated by specific enzymes in the liver. The technology can be used to improve the safety and/or activity of existing drugs, develop new agents to treat certain liver-related diseases, and treat diseases caused by imbalances of circulating molecules that are controlled by the liver. The technology is especially applicable to metabolic and cardiovascular indications, among others. Currently 3 partners are utilizing the LTP Technology or related platform(s).
SUREtechnology Platform (owned by Selexis)
Ligand acquired economic rights to over 30 SUREtechnology Platform programs from Selexis in two separate transactions in 2013 and 2015, granting Ligand rights to downstream economics on novel biologics and biosimilars programs. The SUREtechnology Platform, developed and owned by Selexis, is a novel technology that improves the way that cells are utilized in the development and manufacturing of recombinant proteins and drugs. The technology is based on novel DNA-based elements that control the dynamic organization of chromatin within mammalian cells and allow for higher and more stable expression of recombinant proteins. The technology creates advantages over traditional approaches including accelerated development and manufacturing times, high yields and increased compound stability.

Selected Commercial Programs
We have multiple programs under license with other companies that have products that are already being commercialized. The following programs represent components of our current portfolio of revenue-generating assets and potential for near-term growth in royalty and other revenue. For information about the royalties owed to Ligand for these programs, see “Royalties” later in this business section.
8

Promacta (Novartis)
We are party to a license agreement with Novartis related to Promacta, which is an oral medicine that increases the number of platelets in the blood. Platelets are one of the three components of blood and facilitate clotting in the blood. Individuals with low platelets can be at significant risk of bleeding or death. Because of the importance of having a sufficient number of platelets, Promacta has broad potential applicability to a number of medical situations where low platelets exist.
Promacta is currently approved for three indications: (1) the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult and pediatric patients 1 year and older with ITP who have had an insufficient response to corticosteroids, immunoglobulins or splenectomy; (2) thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic hepatitis C to allow the initiation and maintenance of interferon-based therapy; and (3) patients with SAA who have had an insufficient response to immunosuppressive therapy.  Promacta was initially approved in 2008, and the product has been generating royalty revenue for Ligand since 2009.  Promacta is known as Revolade in the EU and other non-US markets.
Novartis has been and continues to pursue globalization of the brand and currently markets Promacta in multiple countries for the three approved indications. Specifically, ITP is currently approved in more than 100 countries, the Hepatitis C-related indication is currently approved in more than 50 countries, and the SAA indication is approved in more than 45 counties.
Beyond the currently-approved indications, Novartis is also performing or supporting development activities to expand the brand into new indications, including first-line use in SAA and oncology-related indications.  As of February 2018, there are 24 open clinical trials related to Promacta (listed as recruiting or open, and not yet recruiting) on the clinicaltrials.gov website.
We are entitled to receive royalties related to Promacta during the life of the relevant patents or following patent expiry, at a reduced rate for ten years from the first commercial sale, whichever is longer, on a country-by-country basis. Novartis has listed a patent in the FDA’s, Orange Book for Promacta with an expiration date in 2029, and absent early termination for bankruptcy or material breach, the term of the agreement expires upon expiration of the obligation to pay royalties. There are no remaining milestones to be paid under the agreement.
Kyprolis (Amgen)
Ligand supplies Captisol to Amgen for use with carfilzomib, and granted Amgen an exclusive product-specific license under our patent rights with respect to Captisol. Kyprolis is formulated with Ligand’s Captisol technology and is approved in the U.S. for the following:

• | In combination with dexamethasone or with lenalidomide plus dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received one to three lines of therapy.


• | As a single agent for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received one or more lines of therapy.

Kyprolis is also approved in multiple countries outside the U.S. and Amgen continues to invest significantly in Kyprolis to further expand its label and geography. Amgen’s obligation to pay royalties does not expire until four years after the expiration of the last-to-expire patent covering Captisol. Our patents and applications relating to the Captisol component of Kyprolis are not expected to expire until 2033. Our agreement with Amgen may be terminated by either party in the event of material breach or bankruptcy, or unilaterally by Amgen with prior written notice, subject to certain surviving obligations. Absent early termination, the agreement will terminate upon expiration of the obligation to pay royalties. Under this agreement, we are entitled to receive remaining milestones of up to $2 million, revenue from clinical and commercial Captisol material sales and royalties on annual net sales of Kyprolis.
Evomela (Spectrum)
Ligand supplies Captisol to Spectrum for use with Evomela, which is a Captisol-enabled melphalan IV formulation. The FDA approved Evomela for use in two indications:

• | A high-dose conditioning treatment prior to ASCT in patients with multiple myeloma


• | For the palliative treatment of patients with multiple myeloma for whom oral therapy is not appropriate

9

Evomela has been granted Orphan Designation by the FDA for use as a high-dose conditioning regimen for patients with multiple myeloma undergoing ASCT. The Evomela formulation avoids the use of propylene glycol, which has been reported to cause renal and cardiac side-effects that limit the ability to deliver higher quantities of therapeutic compounds. The use of the Captisol technology to reformulate melphalan is anticipated to allow for longer administration durations and slower infusion rates, potentially enabling clinicians to safely achieve a higher dose intensity of pre-transplant chemotherapy.
Under the terms of the license agreement, we granted an exclusive license to Spectrum under our patent rights to Captisol relating to the product. We are eligible to receive over $50 million in potential milestone payments under this agreement and royalties on future net sales of the Captisol-enabled melphalan product. Spectrum’s obligation to pay royalties will expire at the end of the life of the relevant patents or when a competing product is launched, whichever is earlier, but in no event within ten years of the commercial launch. Our patents and applications relating to the Captisol component of melphalan are not expected to expire until 2033. Absent early termination, the agreement will terminate upon expiration of the obligation to pay royalties. The agreement may be terminated by either party for an uncured material breach or unilaterally by Spectrum by prior written notice.
Baxdela (Melinta)
Melinta’s Baxdela is a Captisol-enabled delafloxacin-IV that was approved by the FDA in June 2017 for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections. Delafloxacin is a novel hospital-focused fluoroquinolone antibiotic candidate with potency against a variety of disease-causing bacteria-gram-positives, gram-negatives, atypicals and anaerobes, including quinolone-resistant MRSA. Under the terms of the agreement, we may be entitled to regulatory milestones, as well as a royalty on potential future sales by Melinta, and revenue from Captisol material sales. 
Nexterone (Baxter)
 We have a license agreement with Baxter, related to Baxter's Nexterone, a Captisol-enabled formulation of amiodarone, which is marketed in the United States and Canada. We supply Captisol to Baxter for use in accordance with the terms of the license agreement under a separate supply agreement. Under the terms of the license agreement we will continue to earn milestone payments, royalties, and revenue from Captisol material sales. We are entitled to earn royalties on sales of Nexterone through early 2033.
Noxafil-IV (Merck)
We have a supply agreement with Merck related to Merck’s NOXAFIL-IV, a Captisol-enabled formulation of posaconazole for IV use. NOXAFIL-IV is marketed in the United States, EU and Canada. We receive our commercial compensation for this program through the sale of Captisol, and we do not receive a royalty on this program.
Carnexiv (Lundbeck)
Lundbeck's Carnexiv is a Captisol-enabled carbamazepine-IV that was approved by the FDA in October 2016. Carnexiv is indicated as replacement therapy for oral carbamazepine formulations, when oral administration is temporarily no feasible, in adults with certain seizure types. Under the terms of our agreement with Lundbeck, we may be entitled to development and regulatory milestones, royalties on potential future sales by Lundbeck and revenue from Captisol material sales. Lundbeck is responsible for all development costs related to the program.
Duavee or Duavive (bazedoxifene/conjugated estrogens) and Viviant/Conbriza (Pfizer)
Pfizer is marketing bazedoxifene under the brand names Viviant and Conbriza in various territories for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Pfizer is responsible for the registration and worldwide marketing of bazedoxifene, a synthetic drug specifically designed to reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures while also protecting uterine tissue. Pfizer has combined bazedoxifene with the active ingredient in Premarin to create a combination therapy for the treatment of post-menopausal symptoms in women. Pfizer is marketing the combination treatment under the brand names Duavee and Duavive in various territories. Net royalties on annual net sales of Viviant/Conbriza and Duavee/Duavive are each payable to us through the life of the relevant patents or ten years from the first commercial sale, whichever is longer, on a country by country basis.

We are eligible to receive milestone payments and royalties off of these programs. This list does not include all of our partnered programs. For information about the royalties owed to Ligand for these programs, see “Royalties” later in this business section. In the case of Captisol-related programs, we are also eligible to receive revenue for the sale of Captisol material supply.
Brexanolone-SAGE-547 (SAGE)
Our partner, SAGE, is developing novel medicines to treat life altering central nervous system disorders. In November 2017 SAGE announced positive top-line results from two Phase 3 clinical trials with its proprietary IV formulation of brexanolone (formerly SAGE-547); Study 202B in severe PPD and Study 202C in moderate PPD. SAGE believes these data will be sufficient to support submissions of regulatory applications seeking approval of brexanolone for PPD. SAGE has received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA and PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) designation by the EMA for SAGE-547 in PPD, which are intended to offer a potentially expedited development path and review for promising drug candidates. This includes increased interaction and guidance from the FDA and EMA. SAGE plans to file a NDA with the FDA in 2018. Ligand has the potential to receive milestone payments, royalties and revenue from Captisol material sales for Captisol-enabled programs. SAGE is responsible for all development costs related to the program.
Sparsentan (Retrophin) 
Our partner, Retrophin, is developing sparsentan for orphan indications of severe kidney diseases, and has completed a Phase 2 clinical trial of sparsentan for the treatment of FSGS. Retrophin announced plans to initiate a single Phase 3 clinical trial to enable an NDA filing for sparsentan fo the treatment of FSGS. The trial will include an interim analysis of proteinura as a surrogate endpoint to serve as the basis for an NDA filing for Subpart H accelerated approval of sparsentan. Certain patient groups with severely compromised renal function, including those with FSGS, exhibit extreme proteinuria resulting in progression to dialysis and a high mortality rate. Sparsentan, with its unique dual blockade of angiotensin and endothelin receptors, is expected to provide meaningful clinical benefits in mitigating proteinuria in indications where there are no approved therapies.
Under our license agreement with Retrophin we are entitled to receive potential net milestones of over $75 million in the future and net royalties on future worldwide sales by Retrophin.

Primary Internal Development Program - Glucagon Receptor Antagonist Program
We are currently developing a small molecule glucagon receptor antagonist for the treatment of T2 DM. Compounds that block the action of glucagon may reduce the hyperglycemia that is characteristic of the disease. Glucagon stimulates the production of glucose by the liver and its release into the blood stream. In diabetic patients, glucagon secretion is abnormally elevated and contributes to hyperglycemia in these patients. We announced results in 2016 from two Phase 1 clinical trials which demonstrated favorable safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics in normal healthy volunteers and in subjects with T2 DM. The trial results also demonstrate a robust, dose-dependent reduction of fasting plasma glucose. In September 2017, we presented positive top-line results from a Phase 2 clinical study evaluating the efficacy and safety of LGD-6972, as an adjunct to diet and exercise, in subjects with T2DM inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy. LGD-6972 was safe and well tolerated, with no drug-related serious adverse events and no dose dependent changes in lipids, body weight or blood pressure after 12 weeks of treatment.

Manufacturing
We contract with a third party manufacturer, Hovione, for Captisol production.  Hovione is a global supplier with over 50 years of experience in the development and manufacture of APIs and Drug Product Intermediates. Hovione operates FDA-inspected sites in the United States, Macau, Ireland and Portugal.   Manufacturing operations for Captisol are currently performed at two sites, in both of Hovione's Portugal and Ireland facilities with distribution operations also performed from Hovione's Portugal and Ireland sites.  Additionally, we also store and distribute Captisol from a subterranean warehouse controlled by Ligand and located in Kansas.  We believe we maintain adequate inventory of Captisol to meet our current and future partner needs.
In the event of a Captisol supply interruption, we are permitted to designate and, with Hovione’s assistance, qualify one or more alternate suppliers.   If the supply interruption continues beyond a designated period, we may terminate the agreement.   In addition, if Hovione cannot supply our requirements of Captisol due to an uncured force majeure event, we may also obtain Captisol from a third party and have previously identified such parties.
The current term of the agreement with Hovione is through December 2024. The agreement will automatically renew for successive two year renewal terms unless either party gives written notice of its intention to terminate the agreement no less than two years prior to the expiration of the initial term or renewal term. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement for the uncured material breach or bankruptcy of the other party or an extended force majeure event. We may terminate the agreement for extended supply interruption, regulatory action related to Captisol or other specified events. We have ongoing minimum purchase commitments under the agreement.
For further discussion of these items, see below under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Competition
Some of the drugs we and our licensees and partners are developing may compete with existing therapies or other drugs in development by other companies. Furthermore, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competing products or technologies and may establish collaborative arrangements with our competitors.
Our Captisol business may face competition from other suppliers of similar cyclodextrin excipients or other technologies that are aimed to increase solubility or stability of APIs. Our OmniAb antibody technology faces competition from suppliers of other transgenic animal systems that are also available for antibody drug discovery.
Our competitive position also depends upon our ability to obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes. For a discussion of the risks associated with competition, see below under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
16

Government Regulation
The research and development, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States and other countries.  We and our partners, depending on specific activities performed, are subject to these regulations. In the United States, pharmaceuticals are subject to regulation by both federal and various state authorities, including the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act govern the testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of pharmaceutical products and there are often comparable regulations that apply at the state level.  There are similar regulations in other countries as well. For both currently marketed and products in development, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can, among other things, result in delays, the suspension of regulatory approvals, as well as possible civil and criminal sanctions. In addition, changes in existing regulations could have a material adverse effect on us or our partners. For a discussion of the risks associated with government regulations, see below under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Patents and Proprietary Rights
We believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. Our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements to our inventions that are considered important to the development of our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position.
