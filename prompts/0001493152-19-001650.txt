History
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 5, 2005 under the name Premier Platform Holding Company, Inc. The Company changed its name to Paolo Nevada Enterprises, Inc. on February 4, 2005. On August 18, 2006, the Company completed a merger with Premier Platform Holding Company, Inc., a Colorado corporation, where Paolo Nevada Enterprises, Inc. was the surviving entity. On November 1, 2006, the Company changed its name to the David Loren Corporation. On July 5, 2013, More Superannuation Fund, an Australian entity (“More”), obtained control of the Company from Beachwood Capital, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company. On August 23, 2013, the Company changed its name to Kibush Capital Corporation.
 
On May 26, 2014, we became an initial subscriber to Aqua Mining Limited, a Papua New Guinea limited company (“Aqua Mining”) resulting in a 49% interest, subsequently increasing to 90%. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, Aqua Mining had revenues of $75,664, $151,158 in assets and $896,538 in liabilities, of which $793,658 are loans from Kibush Corp. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, Aqua Mining had revenues of $81,042, $118,424 in assets and $1,177,679 in liabilities, of which $1,090,938 are loans from Kibush Corp.
 
The Company is an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”).
 
Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that our auditors believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated any significant revenues from our current business. In addition, we have sustained losses for the past two years and have a negative working capital at September 30, 2018. We must raise cash from sources other than operations. Our only other source for cash at this time is investments by others in our company. We must raise cash to continue our mining exploration activities and business development.
 
Our Business
 
Our business is comprised of timber logging and mining exploration through our subsidiary Aqua Mining. Our primary office is located at 7 Sarah Crescent, Templestowe, Victoria 3106, Australia. The Company is an exploration stage company and there is no assurance that a commercially viable mineral deposit exists on any of our properties. Further exploration will be required before a final evaluation as to the economic and legal feasibility is determined.
Aqua Mining
 
Logging:
 
The Company, through its subsidiary Aqua Mining, was successful in obtaining Government approval for the commercialization of timber resources at Kubuna and Rigo, Papua New Guinea. The area that we have agreements with the landowners cover at Kubuna 40,000 hectares and Rigo 25,000 hectares. We have commenced logging during the December quarter 2016, at Rigo and expect to commence at Kubuna during 2019. Both sites are excellent resources covering many species of wood, mainly hardwoods kwila and rosewood, there are a number of exotic wood types. It has taken us some time to establish the infrastructure at Rigo, but we have now completed the access road works and established a base camp for 38 on-site workers.
Market
 
Mining:
 
The primary product is Gold and our market price based on the London Metals Exchange Daily Rate. This rate determines a market price for all material sold within the Refinery Market. Outside of that market competition dictates the price available, and that competition has effectively no difference in the quality of the material as it based on a gold percentage. A higher price can be obtained by selling to the spot traders who can distribute the material at lower volumes to industry consumers.
Timber:
 
Initially, we are focusing on the domestic market in Papua New Guinea, where there are a number of major suppliers to the retail market place. As our capacity increases, we will look to export timber to the nearby Australian and Asian markets where demand is greater than supply.

Marketing and Distribution:
 
As the principal material is gold, the options are to sell either to a refinery and be paid the daily spot rate, or to sell to the jewelry wholesale market. Both of these options exist internally within PNG however the wholesale market is quite small. There are several options when the material is exported from PNG, again it could be to any refinery within the region and that rate again would be the daily spot rate. The wholesale market outside the country would be significant and there are many opportunities within Australia to sell at a higher than spot rate to that market. There may also be parties that would take up the material on a contractual basis.
 
The timber products will be marketed and distributed from our Timber Yard at Laloki (30 minutes North East from Port Moresby PNG). This facility is within easy reach of trade customers and gives quick access to our wholesale customers. In addition, it provides an opportunity for retail sales to be made direct to end consumers. We have developed marketing and distribution strategies based upon our experience working with the Paradise Gardens customer base over the last 12 months.
 
Competition
 
The mining industry is acutely competitive in all of its phases. We face strong competition from other mining companies in connection with the acquisition of exploration stage properties or properties containing gold, jade and other mineral reserves. Many of these companies have greater financial resources, operational experience and technical capabilities than us. It is our goal to find undervalued properties and team up with local joint venture partners to streamline our time to market and costs. In PNG in particular we are finding a number of such properties, as the enforcement of the Mining Act has forced traditional landowners to comply with the relevant requirements of the act. Their ability to do so is limited as they do not have the financial, or management resources to comply.
 
The logging industry is very competitive in Papua New Guinea. We believe that our policy of working with the landowners and providing direct employment to the local villagers appears to provide us with a competitive advantage of greater acceptance of our activities by government officials, local businesses and local Papua New Guineans.
 
Raw Materials, Principal Suppliers and Customers
 
We are not dependent on any principal suppliers and our raw materials are produced principally through our own mining activities. Our principal customers for our mining activities are refineries based in PNG.
 
We are not dependent on any principal suppliers and our timber materials are produced principally through our logging activities. There are number of principal customers that we are focused on with the domestic market in PNG. We have established that customer base over the last 12 months and the company is now concentrating on formalizing supply agreements to those customers.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Intellectual property is not a large part of our current business model as we are selling non-unique materials through primarily conventional channels. One or more brands may yet be developed if we determine branding will benefit the Company.
Government Regulations
 
Our products and services are subject to foreign, federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations concerning business activities in general, including the laws of Papua New Guinea and Australia. Our operations will be affected from time to time in varying degrees by domestic and foreign political developments, foreign, federal and state laws.
