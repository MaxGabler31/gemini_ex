Overview
 

● | Todos Medical Ltd. (“Todos Medical,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” “us”), is an in vitro diagnostics company focused on distributing comprehensive solutions for COVID-19 screening and diagnosis and developing blood tests for the early detection of cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Todos has entered into distribution agreements with companies to distribute certain novel coronavirus (COVID-19) test kits. The agreements cover multiple international suppliers of PCR testing kits and related materials and supplies, as well as antibody testing kits from multiple manufacturers after completing validation of said testing kits and supplies in its partner CLIA/CAP certified laboratory in the United States. Todos has combined the PCR testing kits with automated lab equipment to create lab workflows capable of performing up to 40,000 PCR tests per day. Todos has entered into supply agreements with CLIA/CAP certified laboratories in the United States to deploy these PCR workflows. Todos has formed strategic partnerships with Meridian Health and other strategic partners to deploy COVID-19 antigen and antibody testing in the United States. Additionally, the Company is developing a lab-based COVID-19 3CL protease test to determine whether a COVID-19 positive patient remains contagious after quarantine is complete and is further developing point-of-care-based embodiments of the lab test for use in screening programs worldwide. 
● | In December 2020, Todos announced the commercial launch of its proprietary 3CL protease inhibitor dietary supplement Tollovid™ at The Alchemist’s Kitchen in SoHo district in Manhattan, New York. Tollovid, a mix of botanical extracts, is being targeted to support healthy immune function against circulating coronaviruses. Tollovid’s mechanism of action is to inhibit the activity of the 3CL protease, a key protease required for the intracellular replication of coronaviruses. Tollovid was granted a Certificate of Free Sale by the US Food & Drug Administration in August 2020, allowing its commercial sale anywhere in the United States. 
● | On March 11, 2022, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with 3CL Sciences Ltd. (“3CL”) and NLC Pharma Ltd. (“NLC”), pursuant to which we will acquire 52% of the issued and outstanding shares of 3CL and NLC will acquire 48% of the issued and outstanding shares of 3CL (the “Share Purchase Agreement”). Immediately prior to entering into the Share Purchase Agreement, NLC conveyed to 3CL all of the therapeutic, diagnostic, dietary supplement and pharmaceutical assets from NLC that relate to 3CL protease biology (which is used in the development, manufacture, sale and distribution of Tollovid™ and Tollovir™). 
● | Additionally, the Company’s patented Todos Biochemical Infrared Analyses (TBIA) is a cancer-screening technology using peripheral blood analysis that deploys deep examination into cancer’s influence on the immune system, looking for biochemical changes in blood mononuclear cells and plasma. Todos’ two internally developed cancer-screening tests, TMB-1 and TMB-2 have received a CE mark in Europe. Todos is a party to an exclusive option agreement to acquire U.S.-based medical diagnostics company Provista Diagnostics, Inc. to gain rights to its Alpharetta, Georgia-based CLIA/CAP certified lab and Provista’s proprietary commercial-stage Videssa® breast cancer blood test. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021. 
● | Todos is also developing blood tests for the early detection of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease. 
● | In July 2020, Todos completed the acquisition of Breakthrough Diagnostics, Inc., the owner of the LymPro Test intellectual property, from Amarantus Bioscience Holdings, Inc.

● | Through 3CL Sciences Ltd. (“3CL”), we are in the development phase of our own antiviral, Tollovir™, a potent 3CL protease inhibitor for the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, which is currently undergoing a Phase 2 clinical trial in Israel with plans to expand the clinical development program to India. We believe that government recognition of the need for antivirals to treat COVID-19 will provide a significant tailwind for the development of our Tollovir™ anti-viral that is currently undergoing a Phase 2 clinical trial in Israel with plans progressing rapidly to expand the clinical development program to India. As part of the ongoing scientific effort to further elucidate the mechanisms that have enabled Tollovir to achieve its very positive early clinical results, NLC Pharma identified an anti-inflammatory mechanism of action of Tollovir to complement its 3CL protease inhibiting mechanism. This dual mechanism of action helps explain the significant reduction in symptoms and the biomarker C Reactive Protein (CRP) that was documented in the earliest clinical COVID-19 data sets produced in Israel, which could not be explained by a reduction in viral load alone likely caused by Tollovir’s 3CL protease inhibiting mechanism. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The Company’s 3CL protease inhibitor botanical product, Tollovid, is a dietary supplement that helps to support and maintain healthy immune function. This technology will potentially have a significant impact for the development of virus targeting therapeutic development strategies, as well as clearance for return to life activities post-infection. We are very pleased that the Company’s dietary supplement Tollovid, which provides immune support as a protease inhibitor, received FDA authorization for a new 5-day dosing regimen in April 2021. We believe this authorization underscores the emerging need in the marketplace for immune support supplements supported by strong scientific and safety data, as well as provides international regulatory authorities with a high degree of comfort of Tollovid’s safety profile. 
● | Our two most advanced blood tests for cancer are for the screening and diagnosis of breast cancer. TM-B1 is our breast cancer test for the screening and diagnosis of breast cancer in all women, and TM-B2 is our breast cancer test for the screening and diagnosis of breast cancer in women who have ‘dense breasts.’ Dense breasts, medically categorized as BI-RADS 3 and BI-RADS 4, make mammograms largely ineffective because the biophysical structure of the breast does not allow high enough resolution on the mammogram X-ray to determine whether or not a tumor is present, leading to potentially unnecessary additional imaging tests and breast biopsies in women who have dense breasts. 
● | Additionally, our TMC blood test is for the screening and diagnosis of colon cancer. 
● | The Lymphocyte Proliferation Test (LymPro Test™) is a diagnostic blood test that determines the ability of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and monocytes to withstand an exogenous mitogenic stimulation that induces them to enter the cell cycle. It is believed that certain diseases, most notably Alzheimer’s disease, are the result of compromised cellular machinery that leads to aberrant cell cycle re-entry by neurons, which then leads to apoptosis. LymPro is novel in the use of peripheral blood lymphocytes as a surrogate for neuronal cell function, suggesting a common relationship between PBLs and neurons in the brain.

Recent Developments
 
3CL Acquisition
 
On March 11, 2022, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with 3CL Sciences Ltd. (“3CL”) and NLC Pharma Ltd. (“NLC”), pursuant to which we will acquire 52% of the issued and outstanding shares of 3CL and NLC will acquire 48% of the issued and outstanding shares of 3CL (the “Share Purchase Agreement”). Immediately prior to entering into the Share Purchase Agreement, NLC conveyed to 3CL all of the therapeutic, diagnostic, dietary supplement and pharmaceutical assets from NLC that relate to 3CL protease biology (which is used in the development, manufacture, sale and distribution of Tollovid™ and Tollovir™).
 
In consideration of the 3CL shares being issued to us, we undertook to raise $10,000,000 for 3CL and committed to issue to NLC $3,800,000 worth of our ordinary shares, based upon the closing price for our ordinary shares the day before the closing of the Share Purchase Agreement. The Company and NLC agreed to identify a seasoned biopharmaceutical CEO to run 3CL going forward. The board of directors of 3CL Sciences will be made up of five (5) individuals: three (3) appointed by the Company and two (2) appointed by NLC. We anticipate that the Share Purchase Agreement will close during the second quarter of 2022.
 
Provista Acquisition
 
On April 19, 2021, the Company entered into an Agreement to Purchase Provista Diagnostics, Inc. (“Agreement to Purchase”) with Strategic Investment Holdings, LLC (“SIH”), Ascenda BioSciences LLC (“Ascenda”) and Provista Diagnostics, Inc. (“Provista”). Ascenda was the sole owner of the outstanding securities of Provista and SIH is the sole owner of all the outstanding securities of Ascenda.
 
Pursuant to the Agreement to Purchase, the Company acquired Provista from Ascenda and SIH for an aggregate purchase price of $7.5 million consisting of an initial cash payment of $1.25 million, the issuance of $1.5 million in Ordinary Shares priced at $0.0512 per share, the issuance to SIH of a $3.5 million convertible promissory note dated April 19, 2021 (the “Note”) and the payment on for before July 1, 2021 of $1.25 million in cash (the “July Payment”), which payment the Company had the right to, and did, extend to July 15, 2021. The Provista shares acquired by the Company remained in an escrow account until the July Payment was made.
 
The Note has a maturity date of April 8, 2025, and is convertible beginning on October 20, 2021, into Ordinary Shares of the Company at a conversion price equal to the lesser of $0.05 or the volume weighted average price of the last 20 trading days for the Ordinary Shares prior to the date of conversion. In the event SIH delivers a Notice of Conversion to the Company at a per share price less than $0.05 ($0.05), the Company has the right to immediately notify SIH of its intention to pay the conversion amount in cash within three (3) business days of receipt of the Notice of Conversion (i.e., before SIH would take possession of shares converted under the Notice of Conversion). If, at any time between October 20, 2021 and April 20, 2022, the average of the lowest bid and closing sale price at 4:00:00 p.m., New York time (or such other time as such market publicly announces is the official close of trading) is below ($0.05), the Company has the option to buy out all or any portion of the Note (the “Buyback Option”). In the event the Company exercises the Buyback Option for an amount equal to or greater than one million, one hundred seventy thousand dollars ($1,170,000) (the “Buyback Amount”), SIH may not submit any conversions below five cents ($0.05) for ninety (90) days from receipt of the Buyback Amount (“90 Day Period”).
 
In the event that the Company uplists its Ordinary Shares to a national securities exchange, the Note shall automatically be exchanged into Series B preferred stock with a conversion price equal to the lesser of (a) $0.05, (b) the opening price on the day of the uplisting provides there is no transaction associated with the uplisting or (c) the deal price of an uplisting transaction.
 
As of the date of this annual report on Form 10-K, SIH has not submitted a Conversion Notice.

On July 22, 2021, the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) granted a new Certificate of Free Sale for Tollovid Daily™, the newest member of the Company’s Tollovid™ dietary supplement product line.
 
The Certificate of Free Sale is for a twice-daily dosing regimen and, critically, a 3CL protease inhibitor claim. Each 60-pill bottle of Tollovid Daily can help support and maintain healthy immune function for 30 days. The Company intends to establish a monthly subscription model as part of its marketing launch campaign for Tollovid Daily immune system support. Tollovid™ and Tollovid Daily are both 3CL protease inhibitor products developed under a joint venture with NLC Pharma.
 
On April 8, 2021, we received a notice of allowance (‘Letter of Intent to Grant a Patent’) from the European Patent Office covering the use of the Company’s proprietary Total Biochemical Infrared Analysis (‘TBIA’) method that uses blood (plasma and/or peripheral blood mononuclear cells ‘PBMCs’) to distinguish between patients with benign tumors vs. malignant tumors vs. no tumors (healthy controls).
 
The patent application specifically covers methods for capturing consistent data from infrared spectroscopy readers, as well as the application of various artificial intelligence algorithm development methods to the data. The ability of TBIA to make a diagnosis of cancer has first been applied to the detection of breast and colon cancers, where Todos has received CE Marks in Europe paving the way for commercialization initially focused on TMB-2 (dense breast / inconclusive mammogram secondary screening) and TMB-1 (general breast cancer screening) cancer detection tests.
 
Financing and Fundraising
 
On June 19, 2020, the Company and its subsidiaries, Todos Medical USA and Corona Diagnostics, LLC (“Corona”) entered into a Receivables Financing Agreement with Toledo Advisors, LLC (“Toledo”) for up to $25,000,000 in a revolving receivables financing facility (the “Facility”). The availability of the Facility shall terminate on the earlier of June 19, 2025 and the date on which more than $25,000,000 has been advanced. The financing is secured by all of the assets of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary Todos Medical USA, Inc. In addition, Todos Medical USA pledged all of the outstanding equity of Corona to the Lender. The initial draw under the Facility was on June 19, 2020 for $165,000 which was due on the earlier to occur of (i) ninety days following the date the draw was made by the Lender and (ii) the date the receivable, for which the draw was made, is paid. The Facility has since been repaid.
 
In November 2020, the parties agreed to amend the Facility to reduce the cost of funding to Todos Medical USA, and to make the relationship between Corona and Toledo nonexclusive in exchange for Toledo being granted a percentage of Corona’s revenues from diagnostic testing.
 
On January 7, 2022, Toledo filed a complaint against Corona, Todos Medical USA, and the Company (the “Todos Defendants”), seeking unspecified damages for breach of the aforesaid agreements and claiming that at least $139,000 is due under the royalty agreement. The Todos Defendants filed an answer and counterclaim on February 9, 2022, wherein various affirmative defenses were asserted, the allegations of the complaint were denied, and the Company asserted counterclaims for breach of contract and other relief. This dispute is only in its initial legal stages.
 
On January 22, 2021, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with Yozma Global Genomic Fund (the “Purchaser”) pursuant to which on January 29, 2021, the Company issued a promissory convertible note (the “Note”) to the Purchaser in the principal amount of $4,857,142.86 for proceeds of $3,400,000 (the “Transaction”).

Reverse Split
 
At an extraordinary general meeting of our shareholders held on July 26, 2021, our shareholders voted to approve a reverse share split of the Company’s ordinary shares within a range of 1:2 to 1:500, to be effective at the ratio and on a date to be determined by the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Reverse Split”). Although our shareholders approved the Reverse Split, all per share amounts and calculations in this annual report on Form 10-K and the accompanying financial statements do not reflect the effects of the Reverse Split, as the Board of Directors has not determined the ratio or the effective date of the Reverse Split. At its next general meeting, Todos’ shareholders will be asked to approve an extension of the deadline for the Reverse Split.
The Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park
 
On August 4, 2020, we entered into a purchase agreement (the “LPC Purchase Agreement”) with Lincoln Park Capital, LLC (“Lincoln Park”), pursuant to which Lincoln Park agreed to purchase from us up to an aggregate of $10,275,000 of our ordinary shares (subject to certain limitations) from time to time over the term of the LPC Purchase Agreement. Also on August 4, 2020, we entered into a registration rights agreement with Lincoln Park, pursuant to which on August 11, 2020, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, a registration statement (the “LPC Registration Statement”) to register for resale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, the ordinary shares that have been or may be issued to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement. That registration statement became effective on August 18, 2020.

-


The LPC Registration Statement covers the resale by Lincoln Park of up to 50,000,000 ordinary shares, comprised of: (i) 5,812,500 ordinary shares that we issued to Lincoln Park as a fee for making its irrevocable commitment to purchase our ordinary shares under the Purchase Agreement, which we refer to in this annual report on Form 10-K as the Commitment Shares, (ii) 3,437,500 ordinary shares that we sold to Lincoln Park on August 5, 2020 for a total purchase price of $275,000 in an initial purchase under the Purchase Agreement the (“Initial Purchase Shares”), and (iii) up to an additional 40,750,000 ordinary shares that we have reserved for sale to Lincoln Park under the LPC Purchase Agreement from time to time after the date of the LPC Registration Statement, if and when we determine to sell additional ordinary shares to Lincoln Park under the LPC Purchase Agreement. Since August 18, 2020, Lincoln Park has purchased 37,977,388 of our ordinary shares under the Purchase Agreement, at prices ranging from $ 0.038 per share to $ 0.115 per share. The Company does not currently expect to sell any more shares to Lincoln Park under the LPC Purchase Agreement.
 
The Purchase Agreement prohibits us from directing Lincoln Park to purchase any ordinary shares if those ordinary shares, when aggregated with all other ordinary shares then beneficially owned by Lincoln Park and its affiliates, would result in Lincoln Park having beneficial ownership, at any single point in time, of more than 4.99% of the then total outstanding ordinary shares, as calculated pursuant to Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and Rule 13d-3 thereunder, which limitation we refer to as the Beneficial Ownership Cap.
 
Issuances of our ordinary shares to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement will not affect the rights or privileges of our existing shareholders, except that the economic and voting interests of each of our existing shareholders will be diluted as a result of any such issuance. Although the number of ordinary shares that our existing shareholders own will not decrease, the ordinary shares owned by our existing shareholders will represent a smaller percentage of our total outstanding ordinary shares after any such issuance of ordinary shares to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement.
 
SARS-nCoV-2 Related Business
 
With the onset of COVID-19, Todos sought to apply its expertise in developing blood tests for the early detection of cancer and Alzheimer’s disease to distributing and then developing screening tests for the pandemic.
 
On March 23, 2021, we announced that we have entered into an automation and reagent supply agreement with MAJL Diagnostics (“MAJL”). Under the terms of the agreement, Todos will implement its automation solution, including Tecan™ liquid handlers, automated RNA extraction machines, as well as a 384-well PCR machine capable of conducting COVID, cancer genetics and pharmacogenomics testing, in order to become the provider of all COVID-19 PCR testing reagents and supplies.

We anticipate that the Share Purchase Agreement will close during the second quarter of 2022.
 
On April 19, 2021, the Company entered into an Agreement to Purchase Provista Diagnostics, Inc. (“Agreement to Purchase”) with Strategic Investment Holdings, LLC (“SIH”), Ascenda BioSciences LLC (“Ascenda”) and Provista Diagnostics, Inc. (“Provista”). Ascenda was the sole owner of the outstanding securities of Provista and SIH is the sole owner of all the outstanding securities of Ascenda.
 
Pursuant to the Agreement to Purchase, the Company acquired Provista from Ascenda and SIH for an aggregate purchase price of $7.5 million consisting of an initial cash payment of $1.25 million, the issuance of $1.5 million in Ordinary Shares priced at $0.0512 per share, the issuance to SIH of a $3.5 million convertible promissory note dated April 19, 2021 (the “Note”) and the payment on for before July 1, 2021 of $1.25 million in cash (the “July Payment”), which payment the Company had the right to, and did, extend to July 15, 2021. The Provista shares acquired by the Company remained in an escrow account until the July Payment was made.
 
The Note has a maturity date of April 8, 2025, and is convertible beginning on October 20, 2021, into Ordinary Shares of the Company at a conversion price equal to the lesser of $0.05 or the volume weighted average price of the last 20 trading days for the Ordinary Shares prior to the date of conversion. In the event SIH delivers a Notice of Conversion to the Company at a per share price less than $0.05 ($0.05), the Company has the right to immediately notify SIH of its intention to pay the conversion amount in cash within three (3) business days of receipt of the Notice of Conversion (i.e., before SIH would take possession of shares converted under the Notice of Conversion). If, at any time between October 20, 2021 and April 20, 2022, the average of the lowest bid and closing sale price at 4:00:00 p.m., New York time (or such other time as such market publicly announces is the official close of trading) is below ($0.05), the Company has the option to buy out all or any portion of the Note (the “Buyback Option”). In the event the Company exercises the Buyback Option for an amount equal to or greater than one million, one hundred seventy thousand dollars ($1,170,000) (the “Buyback Amount”), SIH may not submit any conversions below five cents ($0.05) for ninety (90) days from receipt of the Buyback Amount (“90 Day Period”).
 
In the event that the Company uplists its Ordinary Shares to a national securities exchange, the Note shall automatically be exchanged into Series B preferred stock with a conversion price equal to the lesser of (a) $0.05, (b) the opening price on the day of the uplisting provides there is no transaction associated with the uplisting or (c) the deal price of an uplisting transaction.
 
As of the date of this annual report on Form 10-K, SIH has not submitted a Conversion Notice.
 
During 2021, the Company recognized approximately $12,277,000 in revenue related to its COVID-19 business, and in January and February of 2022, the Company recognized approximately $540,000 in such revenue. There is no assurance that the Company will generate any additional revenues in the future pursuant to any of these arrangements.
 
Employees and Consultants
 
During 2021, the Company hired 23 new employees, including management and staffing of laboratory, sales and marketing and general administrative staffing.
