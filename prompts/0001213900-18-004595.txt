Item 1. | Business.
--------+----------

 
We are principally engaged in the fertilizer and forage grass processing and distribution business in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”).
 
Through our patented technology, we process crop straw (including corn, rice, wheat, cotton, and other crops) into high quality organic nutritious fertilizer rich in small molecules, easily absorbed by crops in 3 hours. Straws are common agricultural by-product. In PRC, farmers usually burn the straw down to remove the straws efficiently in order to continue farming on the same land. This activities have resulted in serious air pollution and damage the surface structure of the soil. We change waste into treasure by recycling the straws into organic fertilizer, and effectively reduced air pollution. The straw organic fertilizer we produce does not contain the heavy metals, antibiotics, and harmful bacteria that is common in the traditional manure fertilizer. The organic matter content in our organic fertilizer is also much higher than the national standard. It can effectively reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and reduce the penetration of large chemical fertilizers and pesticides into the soil and thus avoid water pollution. Therefore, our fertilizer can effectively improve soil, improve soil fertility, and improve the quality and safety of agricultural products.
 
We also grow and produce a high-protein forage. Its output is very high, at 20-30 tons/mu (one mu equals to about 0.16 acres). In addition to its high yield, the forage is rich in nutrients, crude protein content (about 20%), calcium, zinc, iron, potassium and other elements. In particular, lysine content in amino acids is extremely high. Unsaturated fatty acids in fat reach more than 70%. Our forage grass as feed can reduce or even replaced the use of additives and antibiotics. The key is to better protect the safety of the meat. The forage grass can not only be used as a feed, but also as food for human beings’ consumption. It has potential in food and health product market. The company is currently researching and developing to use the grass extract to make plant protein powder and protein beverages.
 
We are committed to ensuring the quality and safety of agricultural products as the center of the company’s industry. Therefore, we are actively evaluating and operating the sales of high-quality and safe agricultural products (food) while providing high-quality and safe straw organic fertilizer and high-quality protein forage for agricultural production. And has cooperated with the Ministry of Science and Technology of China, the Ministry of Agriculture, the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine, and other relevant departments of the state wisdom of large agriculture cooperation, operating and sales of national wisdom large agriculture certified quality traceable agricultural products (food), and plans to establish only sales quality can be guaranteed And agricultural products (food) electronic trading platform with safe shell traceability.
 
In addition, in 2014, we rented 350 mu (about 57.66 acres) of mountainous land as apple farm and use our own fertilizer, to demonstrate the advantages of our straw organic fertilizer. We have revenue of $6,501 for the year ended December 31, 2017 and haven’t had any revenue on the apple orchard for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 because our apple trees will not become commercially productive until 2019.
 
Currently, all of our production takes place in Weihai City, Shandong Province, PRC, including two completed new fertilizer plants, which have been in operations since August 2015. This new facilit was designed with 2 production lines, with total contractual payment of approximately $4.6 million or RMB 28 million. All of our fertilizer plants in Weihai City produced the straw organic fertilizer, which is our main product currently and in the future. We decided to make technological improvement for our existing straw organic fertilizer production lines in the following aspects: (1) adopt more advanced automatic control technology for raw material feed to shorten the feeding time of raw material, and (2) manufacture powdery organic fertilizer instead of granular organic fertilizer production in order to avoid the drying and cooling process. We estimated we would be able to increase our production capacity significantly through the technical improvement.
 
We also have fertilizer facility and new fertilizer plants in suburb of Shanghai City. The new plant located in Shanghai was completed in June 2016. This facility was designed with 4 production lines, with total contractual payment of approximately $11 million or RMB 67.7 million. While this facility has not been put in operations since its completion, part of the plant was rent to Huayu Sandian Automobile Air Conditioner Co. Ltd as warehouse from June 1, 2016 to May 31, 2017, with a total rent of $235,705. As we are not using the fertilizer plants in Shanghai City to manufacture straw organic fertilizer, we decided to rent all of the plants to Yu Shuai (Shanghai) Industrial Development Co., Ltd. as office and warehouse from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2017 with rent of $320,631 for the first year. The rent will increase by 10% every three years according to the agreement.
 
On October 16, 2017, we rent the land use right, located in Shanghai City, to China Huaxi Limited Company, from November 21, 2017 to November 20, 2027 with an area of 15 mu. The rent was $97,980 for the first year.
 
Our products are sold under our brand names “Zongbao,” “Fukang,” and “Muliang.” Our customers are mainly located in provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shandong.
