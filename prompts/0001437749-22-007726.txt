Our Business - Innovator and Solution Provider
 
BioLargo, Inc. invents, develops, and commercializes innovative platform technologies to solve challenging environmental problems like PFAS contamination, advanced water and wastewater treatment, industrial odor and VOC control, air quality control, infection control, and myriad environmental remediation challenges. Having conducted continual and extensive research and development, BioLargo holds a wide array of issued patents, maintains a robust pipeline of products, and provides full-service environmental engineering. We invent or acquire novel technologies and develop them to maturity through our operating subsidiaries using cutting-edge scientific and engineering methodologies. With a keen emphasis on partnerships with academic, government, and commercial organizations and associations, BioLargo has proven itself by executing on challenging environmental engineering projects, demonstrating its powerful technologies through pilots, trials, and early commercial adoption, publishing high-impact academic and industry publications, and winning over 80 grants. We monetize our innovations through direct sales, recurring service contracts, licensing agreements, strategic joint venture formation and/or the sale of the IP.

The past year held a shift in focus at BioLargo toward the development and commercial execution of several key business initiatives with the potential to generate significant organizational and revenue growth for the company. Three of these projects in particular represent the dominant catalysts for near-term monetization of our core technologies and engineering services. Those are: 1) the advancement of our PFAS removal system, the Aqueous Electrostatic Concentrator (AEC), toward commercial trials with leading customers in the industry (including the federal government) most notably by the in-house piloting of the technology with client-provided water sources in preparation for commercial field trials which are organizing now, 2) the design, manufacture, pre-trial testing, and preparation for field trials with first customers of a novel “minimal liquid discharge” wastewater treatment system in partnership with Garratt-Callahan, the largest privately held water treatment company in America with more than 100 years history, and 3) the manufacture and successful launch of a new pet odor control product based on BioLargo’s intellectual properly launched by our partners at Ikigai Marketing Works, LLC, a venture aimed at building a nationally-branded disruptive new pet odor control brand for ultimate distribution into big-box retailers and sale to a national consumer products company.
 
Three main factors differentiate 2021 from the years that preceded it for BioLargo. First, we have built our credibility as cleantech technology innovators and environmental engineering service providers to the point where industry stakeholders, clients, and prospective partners rightfully view us as an effective and reliable means to solve their challenges. This has resulted in partners like Garratt-Callahan, Ikigai, and more approaching BioLargo for high-value projects. This “critical mass” of credibility as a cleantech solutions provider is a result of our investments in our talented team of engineers and scientists, our history of developing creative and powerful new technologies, and our track record of executing complex engineering projects. Secondly, in 2021 our core patented water treatment technologies, the BioLargo Advanced Oxidation System (AOS) and Aqueous Electrostatic Concentrator (AEC), were demonstrated in successful pilot projects, either on-site at a prospective client’s facility, or in-house with client-provided contaminated waters. Both of these technologies are now primed for commercialization and monetization. Third, our balance sheet continued to improve throughout 2021, with the near-elimination of debt to the point where only one $50,000 convertible note due in 2023 and $464,000 of covid-related low-interest U.S. Small Business Administration loans are owed, in addition to the elimination of debt owed by our partially owned subsidiary Clyra Medical Technologies.

Talent
 
We have steadily grown our team to 27 team members and numerous other part-time consultants, including highly qualified PhDs, engineers, MDs and medical professionals, construction professionals, field service technicians, innovators, sales marketing specialists, entrepreneurial and executive leadership.
Purpose
 
Our mission to make life better drives us to serve others with integrity, knowledge, technology, and solutions that protect the environment, improve quality of life, and protect lives. All our technologies were developed from the ground-up to be sustainable, practical solutions to significant global challenges. We are unique in our ability to tailor our offerings to serve our customers with proven expertise, proven technology and, if needed, we often have the ability to develop new technical solutions to meet our customer’s needs.
 
Combating the PFAS Crisis – the AEC
 
Our engineers have developed a novel water treatment system, called the AEC (Aqueous Electrostatic Concentrator), that removes per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from water at a fraction of the cost of the most commonly used solutions (carbon filtration and reverse osmosis). PFAS chemicals have been linked to cancer, immune disorders, liver dysfunction, and multiple other health problems, are present in a vast range of manufactured goods, common household products (e.g., cleaning products, cookware), and electronics, and contaminate drinking water in unsafe levels all over the globe. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that 20% of privately-owned water wells and 60% of publicly owned wells in the United States are contaminated with PFAS chemicals. In Orange County, California, where our corporate offices are located, more than 60 drinking water wells have been taken out of service due to PFAS contamination, and county officials estimate that treating the wells using existing technologies will cost more than $200 million in capital costs and more than $400 million in maintenance and operating costs (which include disposal of PFAS-laden filters or media), with a total cost over 30 years of more than $1 billion. Our technology can significantly reduce these costs, as it concentrates the PFAS chemicals onto special membranes, resulting in lower disposal costs because our technology generates approximately 1/1000 the amount of PFAS-laden waste by weight.
 
    2 

  

Governments and industry are actively seeking less expensive and/or more effective technologies and processes to eliminate PFAS from groundwater and drinking water. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has made finding an economical solution a priority, announcing in February 2021 final regulatory determinations on the safe maximum levels of PFAS in drinking water, paving the way for regulating the chemicals through the Safe Drinking Water Act and creating a regulatory environment where municipalities will be required to install technologies that help remove PFAS from their drinking water supplies prior to distribution. In March 2021, a bipartisan group in the House of Representatives introduced a bill to regulate PFAS titled the PFAS Action Act of 2021; on July 21, 2021, the House passed the bill and sent it to the Senate, where it is still awaiting a final vote. As passed by the House, the proposed legislation would establish a national drinking water standard for select PFAS chemicals under the Safe Drinking Water Act, limit industrial discharges under the Clean Water Act, and provide $200 million annually to assist water utilities and treatment facilities to remove PFAS chemicals from their water. The bill would also restrict incineration of PFAS-containing wastes under the Clean Air Act, which could significantly limit the use of the most common treatment strategy: carbon filtration followed by carbon incineration. When PFAS-laden carbon is incinerated, not only does it produce vast volumes of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, but evidence suggests volatile fluorochemicals like carbon tetrafluoride, hexafluoroethane, and hydrogen fluoride are released into the air which may have serious human health impacts on adjacent communities. Our technology can be disposed of ways other than incineration, and when it is incinerated, it is incinerated in a fraction of the volume of carbon filtration equivalents.
 
In October 2021, the EPA released its PFAS Strategic Roadmap, outlining the agency’s multifaceted strategy to regulate and remediate PFAS over the next three years and beyond. As part of their roadmap, the EPA announced their intent to regulate certain PFAS compounds as hazardous substances regulated under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), an action that would 1) make PFAS-contaminated sites eligible for Superfund funding, and 2) create more stringent disposal and handling requirements for PFAS compounds and PFAS-laden waste, such as that produced by certain water treatment technologies in the process of treatment. BioLargo anticipates that this regulatory action will have a disproportionately beneficial effect on the relative value proposition of our technology, which produces less PFAS-laden waste than other technologies. Also in October, the EPA began the process of creating rules that designate four of the worst-offending PFAS compounds as hazardous chemicals under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), an action intended to empower the EPA to mandate the cleanup of sites found to be contaminated with those PFAS compounds.
 
There are three main markets for PFAS water treatment in the U.S., each of which we intend to address in the coming years. The first is municipal water treatment – that is water which needs treatment for PFAS before it can be distributed to the public or water that must be treated from a wastewater treatment plant. Southern California, Michigan and Wisconsin may be hotbeds for this market, as those states have adopted stringent regulations on PFAS limits in drinking water and wastewater, and municipalities in those states have been moving to adopt new PFAS treatment technologies more quickly than in other states. The second market is military bases, where the use of PFAS-containing fire-fighting foam has contaminated the soil and groundwater across the country. The third market is treatment for water intake or outfalls of industrial facilities that use PFAS compounds in manufacturing and other industrial processes. As our engineers are already providing environmental engineering services on U.S. Air Force bases, we believe that work may lead to sales in that arena. Estimates for the size of the overall PFAS water treatment market vary wildly, due largely to the fact that it is an emerging market, but most estimates place its size over the next ten years in the billions of dollars per year.
 
Selection and integration of new water and wastewater treatment equipment at a municipal facility, including for PFAS treatment, is often a multi-million-dollar decision with wide-ranging and long-lasting consequences. Our customer acquisition process for the AEC is therefore comprehensive and has the goal of assuring municipal or government decision-makers that the AEC is the right choice for their treatment needs, and that it will perform as-advertised over the course of its lifespan. To do this, our customer onboarding process is as follows: (1) off-site treatment of client-supplied water to quantify PFAS treatment by the AEC with their specific water chemistry, (2) on-site pilot treatment at client location to verify the AEC’s efficacy in real-world conditions, and (3) full-scale operation. The first step involves receiving contaminated water from potential clients, evaluate the properties of the water in order to ensure optimization of our equipment, treat the water with the AEC, and then send the water to an independent laboratory for analysis to confirm the PFAS molecules have been removed in accordance with Federal, State or client specifications. The first phase serves as a “proof of concept” to give the client confidence in moving to the next phase – installation of on-site pilot-level equipment to remove PFAS contaminates in real-world client setting. Once piloting is complete, BioLargo would offer customized commercial-scale systems to each client. Once our systems are operational at a customer location, we would then deliver ongoing maintenance and service as well as a disposal and component replacement program for the collected PFAS.

Testing of water provided by our first prospective PFAS treatment client, a large municipality in Southern California, has proven that BioLargo’s PFAS treatment technology can remove all PFAS compounds of regulatory interest to below their limits of quantification (i.e., “elimination”) while operating under acceptable parameters of flow rate and energy consumption. BioLargo’s engineers are finalizing a techno-economic report for the client that will be integral for establishing in-field trials at the client’s facilities, as well as at other prospective customers’ sites. Testing of water from a second prospective client, an agency of the Federal government, has also been done successfully, although the company is still awaiting final analytical data from the University of Tennessee to validate the results. In both cases, the in-house testing on client-provided waters is a key step in the client onboarding process for this technology, and management is confident that in-field piloting and commercial trials will follow.

We are currently working with a number of potential customers to analyze the cost/benefit of our AEC system as an alternative to competing solutions. We also are negotiating with two channel partners as well as a number of independent manufacturer’s representatives to develop a comprehensive selling and distribution network. We expect these efforts to accelerate as we demonstrate success in our early commercial projects.
 
ONM Environmental – Industrial Odor and VOC Solutions
 
ONM Environmental, Inc. is BioLargo’s subsidiary that delivers robust and comprehensive products and services to control and mitigate odor and volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”) emitted from a variety of industrial activities, including landfills and other waste handling facilities. Its flagship product, CupriDyne® Clean, reduces and eliminates tough odors and VOCs in various industrial settings. CupriDyne Clean is delivered through misting systems, sprayers, water trucks and similar water delivery systems designed, manufactured and installed by ONM. We believe the product is the number-one performing odor-control product in the market, and that it offers substantial savings to our customers compared with competing products. In response to customer demand for expanded services, ONM Environmental now holds General, Electrical, Plumbing and Low Voltage contractor licenses issued by the California Contractors State License Board, and offers a menu of services to landfills, transfer stations, wastewater treatment facilities as well as facilities in non-waste related industries. These services include engineering design, construction, installation, ongoing maintenance and on-site support services to assist our clients in the implementation and continued use of the various systems that deliver our liquid products in the field (such as misting systems). 
 
ONM Environmental offers a deodorizing and sanitizing technology, called EcoMist®, that can be installed directly onto waste collection vehicles and automatically sprays odor control products and/or sanitizer into refuse bins or dumpsters during the waste collection process. EcoMist® is an “out-of-the-box” product, allowing customers to install the system themselves, and will thus not require a significant investment in logistics and servicing to support sales. ONM Environmental is focusing on selling the product to its current customers and garbage truck manufacturers.
 
We have been and expect to continue selling product to the largest solid waste handling companies in the country, with a significant portion of chemistry product sales resulting from national purchasing agreements (NPAs) with large waste handling companies. In the past quarter, ONM Environmental was awarded an exclusive three-year supply contract with a large municipality in Southern California for the delivery of CupriDyne Clean, which will provide a steady source of chemistry supply revenue for the company over the next three years.
 
In addition to growing its revenues organically through the sale of odor and VOC control chemistry and air quality control systems to its primary market segment (municipal solid waste handling in California), ONM Environmental aims to accelerate its growth through development of new sales and distribution channels. Some of these, including our partnership with Ikigai Marketing Works, LLC (see Consumer Products below) and our joint venture with BKT Co. Ltd. in South Korea (see South Korean Joint Venture) are already actively advancing toward their end-goal, which is to foster new distribution opportunities for our patented odor and VOC control chemistry without being limited by our own sales and distribution infrastructure. Additional new opportunities for distribution channels are presently being developed, including in new vertical market segments such as pulp and paper, wastewater, oil and gas, construction, and the auto industry, as well as in new geographical markets including South and Central America. Company management will provide more information on each of these emerging partnerships as they each become finalized.

Consumer Products
 
Ikigai Marketing Works, LLC, which was founded by accomplished industry executives from the consumer-packaged goods industry who have executed successful launches of at least five blockbuster products, has licensed from us a CupriDyne-based household pet odor removal product and a laundry additive for pet related odors. After development of television commercials and a successful test marketing campaign, they are beginning a national advertising campaign, and plan to launch the products in major retailers in the United States (e.g., Walmart, Target, etc.).
South Korean Joint Venture
 
On February 12, 2020, we executed a “Joint Venture Framework Agreement” with a leading wastewater treatment solution provider based in South Korea (BKT Co. Ltd., “BKT”), to create a South Korean entity that would manufacture odor and VOC control products based on our CupriDyne Clean products. We own 40% of the joint venture. Although the joint venture established manufacturing and is marketing the product, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the expected growth of the company, and continues to do so as the country of South Korea continues implementing measures to reduce infections. Management at Odin reports that while initial sales have required extraordinary efforts, continued testing and trial success has reinforced its confidence in continued expansion of sales for the future.
Full Service Environmental Engineering
 
Our subsidiary BioLargo Engineering, Science & Technologies, LLC (“BLEST”) offers full service environmental engineering to third parties and provides engineering support services to our internal teams to accelerate the commercialization of our technologies. Its website is found at www.BioLargoEngineering.com.
 BLEST focuses its efforts in three areas:
 

● | providing engineering services to third-party clients;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | supporting internal product development and business units’ services to customers (e.g., the AOS); and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | advancing their own technical innovations such as the AEC PFAS treatment technology
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The subsidiary is located in Oak Ridge (a suburb of Knoxville, Tennessee), and employs seven scientists and engineers who collectively worked together for almost 30 years and experience in diverse engineering fields. The team is led by Randall Moore, who served as Manager of Operations for Consulting and Engineering for the Knoxville office of CB&I Environmental & Infrastructure and was formerly a leader at The Shaw Group, Inc., a Fortune 500 global engineering firm. The other team members are also former employees of CB&I and Shaw. The team is highly experienced across multiple industries and they are considered experts in their respective fields, including chemical engineering, wastewater treatment (including design, operations, data gathering and data evaluation), process safety, energy efficiency, air pollution, design and control, technology evaluation, technology integration, air quality management & testing, engineering management, permitting, industrial hygiene, applied research and development, air testing, environmental permitting, HAZOP review, chemical processing, thermal design, computational fluid dynamics, mechanical engineering, mechanical design, NEPDES permitting, RCRA/TSCA compliance and permitting,  project management, storm water design & permitting, computer assisted design (CAD), bench chemistry, continuous emission monitoring system operator, data handling and evaluation and decommissioning and decontamination of radiological and chemical contaminated facilities. The engineering team also has developed an extended network of trusted engineering subcontractors that assist in serving specific client projects as needed, from time to time.

In association with Garratt-Callahan, a national industrial water treatment company, BLEST is developing a “minimal liquid discharge” wastewater treatment system based on Garratt-Callahan proprietary technology that would industrial wastewater discharge and therefore reduce wastewater discharge fees for customers. Garratt-Callahan plans to begin selling the new systems in early 2022. BLEST will serve as the manufacturing partner and Garratt Callahan will serve as the selling distributor to leverage their national sales force and over one hundred years of providing services and products to customers. In the past quarter, BioLargo’s engineers finished building the first full-scale prototype of this new technology and tested it with Garratt-Callahan client provided water, with Garratt-Callahan technical staff present on-site at BLEST’s facility. In this “factory acceptance” testing, the system removed over 98% of the target contaminants from water provided by a Garratt-Callahan client in continuous operation, in line with results achieved by Garratt-Callahan’s original bench-scale and batch processing tests. This factory acceptance testing was a necessary step before commercial trials with Garratt-Callahan customers can begin. The first customer has already been identified, and the first on-site field trial for that customer is currently being planned, starting with the design of a mobile treatment unit that will be installed at their facility. This work is underway.
 
In the second quarter of 2021, BLEST was notified of several important contract awards of significance that have the potential to increase the company’s operating cash flow and support the subsidiary’s role of commercializing BioLargo’s patented technologies. The new contract wins are for work with 1) a resin manufacturing facility, 2) a dairy farm, 3) a new project at Picatinny Arsenal, one of the company’s long-time customers, 4) a potato processing plant, and 5) a US Air Force base, adding to the other seven bases already served by the company. Together, the new contracts are worth more than $1.2 million in revenue. To-date, BLEST has completed the majority of these projects, with one of the larger projects having been delayed several months, now expected to complete in mid-2022.
 Throughout 2021, BLEST’s revenues from contracts executed for external clients rose significantly, with both the third quarter and fourth quarters setting consecutive revenue records. This is largely a result of the large backlog of service contracts the subsidiary had built since the subsidiary’s inception, and the fact that the company has employed a larger number of 1099 contractors in 2021 to expand its engineering services capacity and execute backlogged projects.
 
New Technology – Mineral Extraction
 
BLEST developed a proprietary and patent-pending process to extract valuable minerals from certain types of industrial waste. A substantial long-term project for a client is in the planning stages, and we are working with the client in their efforts to secure project financing.  If the project becomes financed, we are contracted to support the project as engineer/operator with a minority equity stake and also a profit sharing arrangement as we serve as the long term project manager.  We believe our technology may have application to other similarly situated industrial waste sites which we intend to explore, although at this time, we have not dedicated budget or resources to pursue such opportunities.
 
BioLargo Water and the Advanced Oxidation System – AOS
 
BioLargo Water is our wholly owned subsidiary located in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, that developed and is attempting to commercialize our Advanced Oxidation water treatment system (AOS). The AOS is our patented water treatment device that generates highly oxidative and energetic species of iodine and other molecules which allow it to rapidly and effectively eliminate pathogenic organisms and organic contaminants as water passes through the device. The key value proposition of the AOS is its ability to reduce or eliminate a wide variety of waterborne contaminants with high performance while using very little electricity and input chemicals. This is made possible by the highly oxidative iodine compounds and reactive oxygen species generated within the AOS reactor as well as the unique and proprietary physical constitution and geometry of the reactor. Our proof-of-concept studies and on-site pilot projects have generated results that project the AOS will be more cost- and energy-efficient than commonly used advanced water treatment technologies such as UV, electro-chlorination, and ozonation. Furthermore, our technology has been proven capable of removing hard-to-treat organic micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals from water more quickly and energy-efficiently than other technologies. Together, these characteristics make the AOS an economical and versatile tool to enable wastewater treatment and reuse in the face of emerging water contaminants and increasing regulatory scrutiny on industrial wastewater discharge.
 
    6 

  

BioLargo’s AOS water treatment technology has completed several pre-commercial demonstration pilots, including one at a poultry farm in Alberta, one at a microbrewery in Southern California, and another in Southern California where stormwater was treated by the AOS. It has an ongoing pilot near Montreal to treat municipal wastewater. It is our belief that once these pre-commercial pilots have concluded with the AOS, our ability to entice major water industry players to partner with BioLargo Water to accelerate market adoption of the AOS will be increased dramatically. Our team in Canada is in discussions with other potential early adopters in the agriculture space, and provincial grant funding which was committed to the Sunworks farm project has been allowed to be allocated toward a different prospective customer site.
 
Capabilities and characteristics of the BioLargo AOS have been published in peer-reviewed academic papers. In early 2021, the laboratory of Dr. Greg Goss, one of the company’s academic partners, published a paper about the technology’s ability to effectively remove micropollutants from wastewater and abrogate the negative biological effects of those micropollutants on aquatic life. The paper concluded that the AOS is “a promising and environmentally friendly technology for wastewater treatment, remediation, and management”. In June of 2021, the laboratory of Dr. Kimura-Hara published a paper about the safety of water treated by the AOS, specifically with regards to the low levels of disinfection by-products (DBPs) generated by the technology. The paper concluded that the levels of DBPs generated by the AOS were comparable to those found in ordinary tap water. Another recent and important peer-reviewed scientific paper was published confirming that AOS generates highly energetic iodine molecules, establishing the foundational scientific principles about why the AOS is a powerful, efficient, and novel water treatment technology. The company is actively working to publish additional peer-reviewed scientific papers, as these are crucial tools in marketing emerging water treatment technologies and aid decision-makers at customer and partner organizations in recognizing the technical and scientific merits of the technology relative to incumbents in the field.
 
Municipal Wastewater Treatment Pilot – Montreal
 
Our commercial-scale AOS demonstration pilot (run in partnership with acclaimed water experts at the Centre des Technologies de L’Eau) at a municipal wastewater treatment plant near Montreal, Quebec, is ongoing and providing important data that shows the AOS is removing five target pharmaceuticals from the wastewater faster and using less electricity than the ultraviolet disinfections system used in the facility. Notably, the pilot project also showed that the AOS was able to also remove total coliforms (bacteria) from the municipal wastewater more effectively than the UV disinfection system currently in use at the facility. Recently, a NSERC grant has extended the project to allow for use of a higher flow-rate AOS system, as well as removal of PFAS chemicals through the installation of a pilot AEC system.
Clyra Medical Technologies
 
Clyra Medical Technologies, Inc. is our partially owned subsidiary creating medical products based on our technology. It is launching a product to be used by surgeons generally, with a first target market aimed toward orthopedic surgeons for use as a wound irrigation solution and to help manage patient care and outcomes. Clyra has secured its first two hospital customers for the product, established a robust quality control system for FDA compliance, recruited a national director of sales, and is negotiating with three separate channel partners to form a commercial alliance. Its other product designs are on hold until such time as it is able to secure the capital and resources to complete any final development and support additional inventory, technical support and sales for these products. In March 2022, Clyra and BioLargo entered into an agreement with Scion Solutions, LLC, whereby the intellectual property (primarily, the SkinDisc) acquired in September 2018 was returned to Scion, and in exchange Scion forgave the outstanding principal and interest due on the promissory note owed by Clyra with an outstanding principal amount of $1,007,000, returned all its shares of Clyra common stock, and its two principals forgave $305,000 in accounts payable owed to them. In addition to the SkinDisc intellectual property, Scion received 2,000,000 of the 5,000,000 shares it had earned from the September 2018 sale of SkinDisc to Clyra/BioLargo.

Other Developing Relationships
 
We signed a “memorandum of understanding” which was later modified to a Referral Agreement with Aquaco Resources, Inc., a newly formed water company with a mission to provide agricultural property owners with a property action plan to reduce the risks of drought and climate change by managing water with water reserves and reuse and discharge compliance. The current agreements contemplate the sale of BioLargo products and engineering services to future Aquaco customers. We are presently engaged in project evaluations and are preparing for delivery our first commercial bid to supply a water treatment solution to a client that developed by Aquaco.
 
EPA Registration of CupriDyne Plus
 
CupriDyne Plus has the potential to offer a safer, more environmentally friendly alternative to bleach and other common antimicrobials for applications like hard surface disinfection, sanitization of non-porous non-food contact surfaces, disinfection of air, textiles, and more. Based on our extensive scientific work, we are confident it meets the minimum performance requirements for EPA registration as a disinfectant and/or surface sanitizer.
 
We have met with and presented data to officials at the EPA for the purpose of refining our product and determining additional data requirements, and have retained a firm specializing in EPA registration work to help us through the process. Recently, we received a communication from the EPA providing clarity on an important factor in the EPA registration process – the number of “active ingredients” in our CupriDyne Plus formula we would be required to claim on our EPA application. Our regulatory consultant has been tasked to help determine the cost and time required to achieve an EPA registration for our CupriDyne Plus product.
 
Conclusion
 
BioLargo has advanced its technologies and infrastructure to achieve a critical mass to capitalize on its commercial efforts and have a positive impact around the world with clean water, clean air, and infection control solutions. The company presents a scalable business model that targets high-impact cleantech market opportunities. We leverage our considerable scientific, engineering, and entrepreneurial talent to monetize our technologies and ensure high-quality customer service and increased revenue potential. We seek to unlock the value of our portfolio of disruptive technologies to advance our mission to “make life better” and continue creating shareholder value.
Intellectual Property
 
We have 21 patents issued, including 19 in the United States, and multiple pending. We believe these patents provide a foundation from which to continue building our patent portfolio, and we believe that our technology is sufficiently useful and novel that we have a reasonable basis upon which to rely on our patent protections. We also rely on trade secrets and technical know-how to establish and maintain additional protection of our intellectual property. As our capital resources permit, we expect to expand our patent protection as we continue to refine our inventions as well as make new discoveries. See the detailed discussion below of our patent portfolio.
 
We regard our intellectual property as critical to our ultimate success. Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products and technologies in geographic areas of commercial interest and to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information through laws and contractual arrangements.
 
Our Chief Science Officer, Mr. Kenneth R. Code, has been involved in the research and development of the technology since 1997. He has participated in the Canadian Federal Scientific Research and Experimental Development program, and he was instrumental in the discovery, preparation and filing of the first technology patents. He has worked with manufacturers, distributors and suppliers in a wide variety of industries to gain a full appreciation of the potential applications and the methodologies applicable to our technology for their manufacture and performance. He continues to research methods and applications to continue to expand the potential uses of our technology as well as work to uncover new discoveries that may provide additional commercial applications to help solve real world problems in the field of disinfection.

Pending Patent Applications
 
Subject to adequate financing, we intend to continue to expand and enhance our suite of intellectual property through ongoing focus on product development, new intellectual property development and patent applications, and further third-party testing and validations for specific areas of focus for commercial exploitation. We currently anticipate that additional patent applications will be filed during the next 12 months with the USPTO and the PCT, although we are uncertain of the cost of such patent filings, which will depend upon the number of such applications prepared and filed. The expense associated with seeking patent rights in multiple foreign countries is expensive and will require substantial ongoing capital resources. However, we cannot give any assurance that adequate capital will be available. Without adequate capital resources, we will be forced to abandon patent applications and irrevocably lose rights to our technologies.
