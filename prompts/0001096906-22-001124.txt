Item 1. Business
Overview
 
We own and operate CNP Operating, a leading cannabidiol, or CBD, manufacturer vertically integrated with a 360 degree approach to the processing of high quality CBD products designed for growers, pharmaceutical, wellness providers, and retailers’ needs, and a cannabis industry focused sponsored content and marketing business, or the CFN Business. Our ongoing operations currently consist primarily of CNP Operating and the CFN Business and we will continue to pursue strategic transactions and opportunities. We are currently in the process of launching an e-commerce network focused on the sale of general wellness CBD products.
 
CNP Operating provides toll processing services which includes extraction, distillation, remediation, isolation and chromatography. CNP Operating has a professional, organized and dedicated team with 30 years of combined experience. CNP Operating’s state of the art facility has 30,000 square feet filled with proprietary technology distillation equipment, in house lab testing, distribution warehouse and white labelling product formulation and design.
 
The CFN Business generates revenue through sponsored content, including articles, press releases, videos, podcasts, advertisements and other media, email advertisements and other marketing campaigns run on behalf of public and private companies in the cannabis industry, helping them reach accredited, retail and institutional investors. Most revenue is generated through contracts involving a monthly cash payment.
 
The CFN Business’ primary expenses come from advertising on platforms like Twitter and Facebook and from employee salaries and contractor fees. The CFN Business’ content is primarily produced by a team of freelance writers and video content is produced through various vendors. The CFN Business also incurs hosting and development costs associated with maintaining and improving its website, web applications, and mobile applications. The CFN Business operates several media platforms, including CannabisFN.com, the CannabisFN iOS app, the CFN Media YouTube channel, the CFN Media podcast, and other venues. These properties are designed to educate and inform investors interested in the cannabis industry, as well as provide a platform for the clients of the CFN Business to reach investors. The CFN Business distributes content across numerous online platforms, including the CannabisFN.com website, press releases, financial news syndicates, search engines, YouTube, iTunes, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, and others.
 
The CFN Business targets the legal cannabis industry. According to Grand View Research, the global cannabis industry is expected to reach $146.4 billion by 2025, driven by the legalization of medical and adult-use cannabis across a growing number of jurisdictions. According to the Marijuana Index, there are approximately 400 public companies involved in the cannabis industry, which represents the primary target market of the CFN Business. The CFN Business’ services are designed to help private companies prepare to go public and public companies grow their shareholder base through sponsored content and marketing outreach. The success of the CFN Business depends on the legal status of cannabis, investor demand for cannabis investments, and numerous other external factors.
 
The CFN Business competes with other public relations firms for clients, as well as online publishers for investors. Public relations competition includes investor awareness firms like Stockhouse Publishing, Catalyst Xchange, Stonebridge Partners and Midan Ventures. Online publisher competition includes firms like New Cannabis Ventures, Leafly and High Times. The CFN Business is regulated by rules established by the SEC, FINRA, and certain federal and state cannabis regulations.

CNP Operating Business
 
On December 20, 2018, the President of the United States signed the United States of the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018, commonly known as the “Farm Bill,” into law. Among other things, this new law changed certain federal authorities relating to the production and marketing of hemp, defined as cannabis (Cannabis sativa L.), and hemp products containing less than 0.3 percent delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, including removing hemp and derivatives of hemp from the Controlled Substance Act. January 15, 2021 the USDA issued its final rule regarding the Establishment of a Domestic Hemp Production Program which authorized hemp to be grown and processed legally in the United States and made it legal to transport in interstate commerce.
 
The Farm Bill recognizes hemp as distinct from its genetic cousin, marijuana, and specifically industrial hemp has been excluded from U.S. drug laws. The Farm Bill allows for each individual state to regulate industrial hemp and industrial hemp-based products or accept the USDA rules. Although no longer a controlled substance under federal law, cannabinoids derived from industrial hemp (other than THC) are still subject to a patchwork of state regulations. We are actively monitoring the regulations and proposed regulations in each state to ensure our operations are compliant.

In conjunction with the enactment of the Farm Bill, the FDA released a statement about the status of CBD and the agency’s actions in the short term with regards to CBD will guide the industry. The statement noted that the Farm Bill explicitly preserved the FDA’s authority to regulate products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds under the FDCA and Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. This authority allows the FDA to continue enforcing the law to protect patients and the public while also providing potential regulatory pathways for products containing cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds. The statement also noted the growing public interest in cannabis and cannabis-derived products, including CBD, and informed the public that the FDA will treat products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds as it does any other FDA-regulated products — meaning the products will be subject to the same authorities and requirements as FDA-regulated products containing any other substance, regardless of the source of the substance, including whether the substance is derived from a plant that is classified as hemp under the Farm Bill.
 
As of the date of this annual report, and based upon publicly available information, to our knowledge the FDA has not taken any enforcement actions against CBD companies. The FDA, however, has sent warning letters to companies demanding they cease and desist from the production, distribution, or advertising of CBD products, only relating to instances that such CBD companies have made misleading and unapproved label claims. We will continue to monitor the FDA’s position on CBD. In December 2020, the FTC announced it was going to seek penalties against companies making deceptive marketing claims and named 6 companies which it had targeted for making egregious and unsupported health claims. On March 5, 2021the FTC approved the final administrative consent orders with all 6 companies. We are unaware of any further actions and we will continue to monitor the FTC’s position with regards to deceptive marketing claims.
 
We are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws, including laws protecting the privacy of customer non-public information and the handling of customer complaints and regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices. The growth and demand for online commerce has and may continue to result in more stringent consumer protection laws that impose additional compliance burdens on online companies. These laws may cover issues such as user privacy, spyware and the tracking of consumer activities, marketing e-mails and communications, other advertising and promotional practices, money transfers, pricing, product safety, content and quality of products and services, taxation, electronic contracts and other communications and information security.
 
There is also great uncertainty over whether or how existing laws governing issues such as sales and other taxes, auctions, libel, and personal privacy apply to the internet and commercial online services. These issues may take years to resolve. For example, tax authorities in a number of states, as well as a Congressional advisory commission, are currently reviewing the appropriate tax treatment of companies engaged in online commerce, and new state tax regulations may subject us to additional state sales and income taxes. New legislation or regulation, the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business or the application of existing laws and regulations to the internet and commercial online services could result in significant additional taxes or regulatory restrictions on our business. These taxes or restrictions could have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and overall financial condition. Furthermore, there is a possibility that we may be subject to significant fines or other payments for any past failures to comply with these requirements.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 14 full-time employees, including all of our executive officers. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we believe our relationships with our employees to be good.
