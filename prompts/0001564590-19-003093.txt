General
 Rudolph Technologies, Inc. is a worldwide leader in the design, development, manufacture and support of process control tools that perform macro defect inspections and metrology, lithography systems, and process control analytical software used by semiconductor and advanced packaging device manufacturers. Rudolph’s proprietary products offer comprehensive solutions for all phases/segments of the semiconductor fabrication process. Our products that provide critical yield-enhancing information, which is used by microelectronic device manufacturers to drive down costs and to decrease the time to market of their devices. We provide process and yield management solutions used in bare silicon wafer production and wafer processing facilities, often referred to as “front-end” manufacturing and device packaging and test facilities, (or “back-end” manufacturing), respectively through a portfolio of standalone systems for macro-defect inspection, packaging lithography, probe card test and analysis, as well as transparent and opaque thin film measurements. All Rudolph systems feature sophisticated software and production-worthy automation. In addition, our advanced process control software portfolio includes powerful solutions for standalone tools, groups of tools, factory-wide, and enterprise-wide suites to enhance productivity and achieve significant cost savings. Rudolph’s systems are backed by worldwide customer service and applications support.
 Rudolph continues to drive the technological innovation of its inspection and metrology products to deliver solutions that address the demanding needs across the front-end and back-end processes of semiconductor manufacturing. In 2018, Rudolph introduced two newly configured macro defect inspection tools, the second generation Dragonfly™G2 system and the NovusEdge™ tool for bare wafer inspection. The Dragonfly G2 systems use high-resolution, two-dimensional (2D) inspection technology for front-end and back-end applications as well as high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) inspection and metrology. Rudolph’s Clearfind™ technology is a patented option available for enhancing the detection of defects that often escape conventional illumination techniques by revealing organic materials, thereby reducing a source of yield-robbing interconnect failures that can occur within advanced packages.  The Dragonfly G2 system is a high-speed multi-dimensional tool that also features TrueBump™ technology to accurately measure the height of millions of micro bumps that may be deposited on a wafer in order to make electrical connections. This critical dimension must be accurately controlled to assure that eventual connections are reliably created. The new NovusEdge system provides macro level quality measurements for manufacturers of bare silicon wafers that are supplied to semiconductor manufacturers for subsequent processing. Certain defects, such as backside particles and hairline cracks on the edge of the wafer, were previously considered minor flaws.  However, the latest extreme ultra-violet (“EUV”) lithography systems are extremely sensitive to backside particles and manufacturing of large integrated circuit chips can have significant yield losses when edge cracks propagate into the chips near the wafer’s edge. The NovusEdge system is able to detect and classify wafers so that the wafer suppliers can assure their customers of the proper quality levels needed for subsequent processing and chip type.
 These newly released products supplement Rudolph’s established product portfolio of extensive 2D and 3D process control solutions for a variety of device types of advanced packaging, such as second generation high bandwidth memory (“HBM2”) devices, double data rate Dynamic Random Access Memory (“DRAM”) (DDR4 and DDR5), 3D Not And (“NAND”) memory, advanced packaging for radio frequency (“RF”) modules, Complimentary Metaloxide Semiconductor (“CMOS”) image sensors, Microelectromechanical Systems (“MEMs”), etc. that are used in smartphones, wearable devices, tablets and personal computers, automotive, Internet of Things (“IoT”) and others. The need for more process monitoring and control continues to increase for semiconductor and related industries as the required levels of quality and reliability continue to rise. Predictive analytics can lower maintenance costs, rate of scrap wafers, unscheduled tool downtime and material costs. Rudolph’s established fault detection and classification software, which is also incorporated into tools manufactured by others companies, allows customers to seamlessly turn equipment data into actionable operational information. This collaboration is designed to enhance etch and deposition tool performance.

Industry Trends
 Advanced Packaging refers to a variety of technologies that enable the miniaturization of electronic products, such as portable consumer devices, including smartphones, watches, and tablets. In electronics manufacturing, integrated circuit packaging is the final stage of semiconductor device fabrication, in which a single circuit made from semiconducting material (a die or chip) is encased in a molded package that provides external connections to a printed circuit board and also prevents physical damage to the chip and corrosion.  Advanced Packaging refers loosely to the conductors and other structures that often interconnect multiple die, feed them with electric power and create signal paths to and from the PC board, dissipate their heat, and protect them from damage.  Today, the drive to pack more functions into a small space and reduce their power requirements demands that chip packages do much more than ever before to combine multiple functions into a single molded package. 
 One example of the technology used in Advanced Packaging is the 3D integration of semiconductors and other devices. The technology involves stacking individual die in one integrated package. Through-silicon vias (“TSVs”) are vertical copper interconnects that are embedded from the bottom surface of a die to the top surface, which allows power and communication to be shared among the individually stacked components. This offers the advantages of shorter signal paths and, in turn, reduced power consumption, enhanced bandwidths, integration of heterogeneous components such as memory and logic chips, and smaller surface area. The processes required for 3D integration vary from one manufacturer to another and many continue to be optimized for yield and to ensure the functioning of individual stacked chips.
 Fan-out wafer level packages are another advanced packaging technology using copper pillars/bumps to vertically connect a wide variety of stacked die for 2.5D, and 3D integration techniques and are considered the next disruptive technology for several reasons. First, fan-out wafer level packages significantly reduce the space needed inside an electronic device, such as a smartphone, by combining multiple chips/functions into a single package, often called a system in a package (“SIP”). Next, it improves the system’s performance by reducing power and signal conductor lengths, which previously were routed from package to package through a printed circuit (“PC”) board. Using thin redistribution layers to “fan out” power and signal connections to the larger contacts on the PC board eliminates the need for a ceramic or laminated substrate, which accounts for 35 percent of the packaging cost. Lastly, the technology is currently considered the preferred vehicle for next generation uses, such as system in package, and package on package formats.  As a result of the small overall form factor, fan-out wafer level packages provide the functionality needed in high-end mobile and wearable products.
 The current and projected adoption of smart mobile devices with designed-in capability to enable multiple functions in a single device continues to grow. In reality, there are no longer single function devices, but instead, a combined single device provides multiple functions such as phone, GPS, camera, and internet browser.  Aided by a myriad of available “apps,” the potential uses seem endless. As a result, these added functions in mobile products are driving semiconductor advanced packaging and display manufacturers to implement next-generation technologies, such as 5G communications, to meet these requirements. These technology shifts encompass multiple high-value process steps that are creating opportunities for Rudolph solutions.
 Panel Manufacturing. The current process to manufacture advanced packaging involves attaching known good die to a 300mm wafer, used as a temporary carrier when adding components such as redistribution layers (“RDLs”) and copper pillars.  SIP packages can often contain side-by-side die, meaning the package can be large and limit the number of packages being placed on a reconstituted wafer. In order to meet the growing demand at reduced average selling prices, manufacturers are looking to scalable technology. Advanced packaging facilities looking to improve Cost of Ownership (“COOs”) and increase productivity are transitioning from 300mm wafers to large rectangular panels, which can be as large as 600mm x 600mm. This larger size enables companies manufacturing large area packages to increase the number of devices being processed at each step as they are no longer limited to operating within the constraints of a round wafer. By responding to market opportunities and addressing the stringent demands of customers’ technical roadmaps, we believe that Rudolph is optimally positioned to capitalize on the emerging market of high volume panel manufacturing.  For example, the JetStep® S lithography system, having emerged from the flat panel display market, is readily capable of processing RDLs on both glass and organic laminate panels in the semiconductor advanced packaging market. The Firefly™S Series, designed for high

resolution inspection, can provide location information to the JetStep S tool for each die, which greatly improves lithography throughput using Rudolph’s exclusive StepFast™ process. It also delivers a combination of defect detection and substrate flexibility in a single platform. It reduces capital investment requirements and provides a reliable pathway to transition from wafer to panel-based processes.
 
Technology
 We believe that our expertise in engineering and our continued investment in research and development enable us to rapidly develop new technologies and products in order to quickly respond to emerging industry trends and competitive challenges. The breadth of our technology enables us to offer a diverse combination of process and process control solutions. Unique features have been designed into our lithography systems to meet our customers’ changing process requirements. Our metrology and inspection technologies provide process control for the majority of wafers processed today in a semiconductor wafer fab. In front-end processes, thin film metrology and defect detection and classification technologies allow yield enhancement for critical processes such as photolithography, diffusion, etch, CMP and outgoing quality control. Within the final manufacturing (back-end) processes, our 2D/3D advanced macro defect inspection provides our customers with critical quality assurance and process information. Defects may be created during probing, bumping, dicing, assembly processes (RDLs, TSVs, copper pillars, etc.) or general handling and can have a major impact on device and process quality. Lastly, we turn all of the data gathered into useful knowledge for our customers to make yield-enhancing decisions, which lower their cost of goods sold (“COGS”) and improve their margins.
Process Control Business
 Macro Defect Inspection. Chip manufacturers deploy advanced macro defect inspection throughout the production line to monitor key process steps, gather process-enhancing information and ultimately, lower manufacturing costs. Field-established tools such as the F30™ and NSX® inspection systems are found in the wafer fab (front-end) and packaging (back-end) facilities around the world. These high-speed tools incorporate features such as wafer-less recipe creation, tool-to-tool correlation and multiple inspection resolutions. In addition to wafer frontside inspection, Rudolph’s NovusEdge system allows wafer edge and backside inspection in one integrated platform to enhance productivity and continuously improve fab yield. Using Discover® yield management software, the vast amounts of data gathered through automated inspection can be analyzed and classified to determine trends and locate root causes that directly affect yield.
 All-Surface Inspection. All-surface refers to inspection of the wafer frontside, edge, and backside as well as back-end die. The edge inspection process focuses on the area near the wafer edge, an area that poses difficulty for traditional wafer frontside inspection technology due to its varied topography and process variation. Edge bevel inspection looks for defects on the side edge of a wafer. Edge bead removal and edge exclusion metrology involve a topside surface measurement required exclusively in the photolithography process, primarily to determine if wafers have been properly aligned for the edge exclusion region. The primary reason for wafer backside inspection is to determine if contamination has been created that may spread throughout the wafer fab. For instance, it is critical that the wafer backside be free of defects prior to the photolithography process to prevent focus and exposure problems on the wafer frontside.
 Residue Detection. Residue is difficult or impossible to see with conventional bright field or dark field imaging techniques using white light. Residue contaminants, such as residual photo resist, are often the root cause of field failures, which occur after the material has been exposed to normal operating conditions for extended periods. Rudolph’s established Clearfind™ technology highlights residue on bumps and bond pads or RDL vias so that they are easy to detect. On metals, it eliminates the high-contrast graininess seen under conventional illumination, resulting in an obvious defect signal against a featureless background. This same graininess in conventional imaging can also cause false positives, which are especially costly at this stage of the process where secondary inspections must be initiated to verify real defects and allow the false defects to continue through packaging. Finally, Clearfind technology readily detects shorts and opens in metal lines when inspected with an underlying organic layer.

 Automated Defect Classification and Pattern Analysis. Automating the defect detection and classification process is best done by a system that can mimic, or even extend, the response of the human eye, but at a much higher speed, with higher resolution and more consistency. To do this, our systems capture full-color whole wafer images using simultaneous dark and bright field illumination. The resulting bright and dark field images are compared to those from an “ideal” wafer having no defects. When a difference is detected, its image is broken down into mathematical vectors that allow rapid and accurate comparison with a library of known classified defects stored in the tool’s database. Patented and proprietary enhancements of this approach enable very fast and highly repeatable image classification. The system is pre-programmed with an extensive library of local, global, and color defects and can also store a virtually unlimited amount of new defect classes. This allows customers to define defects based on their existing defect classification system, provides more reliable automated rework decisions and enables more accurate statistical process control data. Reviewing defects off-line enables automated inspection systems to maintain their utilization for high throughput inspection. Using defect image files captured by automated inspection systems, operators are able to view high-resolution defect images to determine defects that cause catastrophic failure of a device, known as killer defects. Combining the review process with classifying defects enables faster analysis by grouping defects found together as one larger defect, a scratch for example, and defects of similar types across a wafer lot to be grouped based on size, repeating defects, and other user-defined specifications.
  Yield Analysis. Using wafer maps, charts and graphs, the massive amounts of data gathered through automated inspection can be analyzed to determine trends across bumps, die, wafers and lots. This analysis may determine where a process variation or deviation has occurred, allowing process engineers to make corrections or enhancements to increase yields. Defect data analysis is performed to identify, analyze and locate the source of defects and other manufacturing process excursions. Using either a single wafer map or a composite map created from multiple wafer maps, this analysis enables identification of defect patterns and distribution. When combined with inspection data from strategically-placed inspection points, this analysis may pinpoint the source of the defects so corrective action can be taken.
 Optical Acoustic Metrology. Optical acoustic metrology involves the use of ultra-fast laser induced sonar for metal and opaque thin film measurement. This technology sends ultrasonic waves into multi-layer opaque films and then analyzes the resulting reflected acoustic waves (echoes) to simultaneously determine the thickness of each individual layer in complex multi-layer metal film stacks. The reflected signal’s amplitude and phase can be used to detect film properties, missing layers and interlayer problems. Since different phenomena affect amplitude and phase uniquely, a variety of process critical interlayer problems can be detected in a single measurement. The use of optical acoustics to measure multi-layer metal and opaque films was pioneered by scientists at Brown University (“Brown”) in collaboration with engineers at Rudolph. The proprietary optical acoustic technology in our PULSE Technology™ systems measures the thickness of single or multi-layer opaque films, with a huge range of less than 40 Angstroms to greater than five microns. It provides these measurements at a rate of up to 70 wafers per hour within one to two percent accuracy and typically greater than 99 percent repeatability. This range of thicknesses covers the majority of thick and thin metal films projected by the International Roadmap for Semiconductors. Our non-contact, non-destructive optical acoustic technology and small spot size enable our PULSE Technology systems to measure film properties directly on product wafers.
 Opaque Film Metrology. The MetaPULSE® systems allow customers to simultaneously measure the thickness and other properties of up to six metal or non-metallic opaque film layers without physically contacting product wafers in a non-destructive manner. PULSE Technology uses an ultra-fast laser to generate acoustic waves that pass down through a stack of opaque films such as those used in copper or aluminum interconnect processes, as well as the hard mask layer in 3D NAND chips, sending back to the surface a reflected signal (echo) that indicates film thickness, density, and other process critical parameters. We believe we are a leader in providing systems that can measure opaque thin-film stacks non-destructively with the speed and accuracy semiconductor device manufacturers demand in order to achieve high yields with the latest fabrication processes. The technology is ideal for characterizing copper interconnect structures. The MetaPULSE systems, used initially for fast and accurate measurements of metal interconnect in front-end wafer fabs, have now been chosen by back-end manufacturers to perform system measurements in new process applications such as RF filters and modules, driven by the need for on-product metrology as feature sizes decrease and pattern densities increase.

Ellipsometry. Ellipsometry is a non-contact, non-destructive optical technique for transparent thin film measurement. We have been an industry leader in ellipsometry technology for the last three decades. We hold patents on several ellipsometry technologies, including our proprietary technique that uses four lasers for multiple-angle of incidence, multiple wavelength ellipsometry. Laser ellipsometry technology enables our transparent film systems to provide the increasingly higher level of accuracy needed as thinner films and newer materials are introduced for future generations of semiconductor devices. We extended this same optical technology to characterize the scatterometry signal from patterned surfaces, allowing measurement of critical dimensions.
 Reflectometry. For applications requiring broader spectral coverage, some of our ellipsometry tools are also equipped with a reflectometer. Reflectometry uses a white or ultraviolet light source to determine the properties of transparent thin films by analyzing the wavelength and intensity of light reflected from the surface of a wafer. This optical information is processed with software algorithms to determine film thickness and other material properties. By combining data from both the laser ellipsometer and broad spectrum reflectometer, it is possible to characterize films and film stacks that cannot be adequately analyzed by either method individually.
 Transparent Film Metrology. Rudolph’s patented transparent film technology uses up to four lasers operating simultaneously at multiple angles and multiple wavelengths, providing powerful analysis and measurement capabilities. Unlike the white-light sources used in spectroscopic ellipsometers, laser light sources make our metrology tools inherently stable, increase measurement speed and accuracy, and reduce maintenance costs by minimizing the time required to re-qualify a light source when it is replaced. Rudolph’s S3000SX™ System is targeted for transparent films in advanced semiconductor fabrication applications at the 28nm node and below. The S3000™ product family uses Rudolph’s proprietary Focused Beam Ellipsometry (“FBE”) and newly-designed Small Site Measurement Optics (“SSMO”) to measure the thickness of single layer and multi-layer films on product wafers, including device area at site sizes as small as 30x30 nanometers. 
 Probe Card Test and Analysis. The combination of fast 3D-OCM (optical comparative metrology) technology with improved testing accuracy and repeatability is designed to reduce total test time for even the most advanced large area probe cards. The 3D capabilities enable users to analyze probe marks and probe tips in a rapid and information-rich format.
Lithography Business
 Step and Repeat Technology. Rudolph steppers use projection optics to expose circuit patterns from a mask or reticle onto a substrate to expose images with optimal fidelity. These systems employ light from a mercury arc lamp that is transmitted through a mask or reticle containing display circuit patterns. Substrates are aligned on the system and the mask is imaged through a projection lens onto photoresist material coated on the substrate. The substrate is then moved, or “stepped,” to a second position to expose an adjacent area. Images can be “stitched” together precisely to form larger circuit patterns without any noticeable change in circuit performance. The system repeats the step and exposure process until the entire substrate is patterned. Once the exposure process has been completed, the substrate is developed with an alkali solution to reveal the underlying material. The imaged photoresist serves as a stencil barrier that allows for the processing of the underlying metal or insulating layers.  The substrates then continue through the etching, stripping and deposition processes until multi-layer circuits are completed.
 Advanced Packaging Lithography Systems. In order to deal with increased input/output (“I/O”) resulting from devices with enhanced functionality, power distribution efficiency, and higher frequency, integrated device manufacturers (“IDMs”) and outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (“OSATs”) facilities must incorporate lithography capabilities to create RDLs for their advanced packaging technologies. However, the associated substrates and processes are significantly different than those used in front-end wafer processing. For advanced packaging, the lithography system must perform in a completely different application, with significantly different operating parameters. For example, most packaging is an additive process, while wafer processing is subtractive, and thick films, rather than thin films, are used to enable the creation of features. In order for equipment to effectively function in this environment, it must overcome these challenges. Rudolph’s JetStep Systems have been specifically designed to meet these challenges head on. The JetStep W Series is designed for wafers and

other round substrates while the JetStep S Series is designed for rectangular substrates (panels). Both systems boast a large printable field, which when combined with user-selectable wavelength options, maximizes throughput while not limiting resolution when needed. High-fidelity optics are able to image the fine features required while at the same time achieving superior depth of field to minimize non-flatness that is typical for advanced packaging applications. On-the-fly auto focus and an innovative reticle management system improve yield and utilization. These features result in a revolutionary lithography system specifically designed to meet advanced packaging challenges.
 Flat Panel Display (“FPD”) Lithography. A critical aspect of any leading mobile device is the display. The display serves as the window to the user. Therefore, it must effectively present graphics from a variety of apps, such as detailed maps, high resolution photos, and streaming video in order to provide an enhanced user experience. To accomplish this, the display’s thin film transistor (“TFT”) backplane, which controls the individual pixels, must operate at a high frequency and not limit the pixel resolution.  As a result, the transistors must have high mobility and only use a small portion of the pixel aperture. The backplane is manufactured on a sheet of glass; like the packaging substrate, it is non-flat and tends to distort further during processing. Additionally, the displays are getting larger. Manufacturers are looking to utilize larger glass substrates, making throughput a challenge for the lithography equipment.  To overcome this, Rudolph’s JetStep G Series uses high-fidelity optics and the largest printable stepper field available, enabling more displays per exposure. This feature, combined with on-the-fly auto-focus and magnification compensation, maximizes throughput and yield.  Finally, our patented grid stage allows the system to be easily configurable to meet the customer desired substrate size.
Integrated Software Solutions
 Process Control Software. We provide a wide range of advanced process control solutions, all designed to improve factory profitability, including run-to-run control, fault detection, classification and tool automation. Rudolph is a leading provider of Process Control Software in the semiconductor industry. Advanced process control (“APC”) employs software to automatically detect or predict tool failure (fault detection) as well as calculate recipe settings for a process that will drive the yielded output to meet and exceed the target, despite variations in the incoming material and minor instabilities within the process equipment.  Process control software enables the factory to increase capacity and yield while decreasing rework and scrap. It enables reduced production costs by lowering consumables, process engineering time and manufacturing cycle time.
 Yield Management Software. Semiconductor manufacturers use yield management software (“YMS”) to obtain valuable process yield and equipment productivity information. The data necessary to generate productivity information comes from many different sources throughout the wafer fab: inspection and metrology systems, tool sensors, tool recipes, electrical tests and the fab environment. As the complexity and cost of manufacturing processes increase, the value of faster, better analysis to support critical manufacturing decisions grows. As a result, customers are demanding robust yield management systems that can analyze large, complex data sets quickly and effectively. Rudolph’s fully-integrated YMS are designed to analyze data from disparate sources and multiple sites to maximize productivity across the entire value chain.

Manufacturing
 Our principal manufacturing activities include assembly, final test and calibration. These activities are conducted in our manufacturing facilities in Bloomington, Minnesota and Wilmington, Massachusetts.  Our core manufacturing competencies include electrical, optical and mechanical assembly and testing, as well as the management of new product transitions. While we use standard components and subassemblies wherever possible, most mechanical parts, metal fabrications and critical components used in our products are engineered and manufactured to our specifications. We continue to rely on subcontractors and turnkey suppliers to fabricate components, build assemblies and perform other non-core activities in a cost-effective manner.  As of December 31, 2018, we employed 94 manufacturing personnel.
 We rely on a number of limited source suppliers for certain parts and subassemblies. This reliance creates a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components, and reduced control over pricing and time of delivery of components. An inability to obtain adequate supplies would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or might require us to redesign our systems to accommodate different components or subassemblies. To date, we have not experienced any significant delivery delays. However, if we were forced to seek alternative sources of supply, manufacture such components or subassemblies internally, or redesign our products, this could prevent us from shipping our products to our customers on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
 Intellectual Property
 We have a policy of seeking patents on inventions governing new products or technologies as part of our ongoing research, development, and manufacturing activities. As of December 31, 2018, we have been granted, or hold exclusive licenses to, 276 U.S. and foreign patents. The patents we own, jointly own or exclusively license have expiration dates ranging from 2019 to 2036. We also have 56 pending regular and provisional applications in the U.S. and other countries. Our patents and applications principally cover various aspects of macro-defect detection and classification, transparent thin film measurement, altered material characterization, lithography techniques and automation. 
 We have been granted patent licenses by organizations such as Brown and the University of Colorado.  These licenses are subject to rights retained by these organizations and, where applicable the United States government, for their own non-commercial uses. These patents relate to opto-acoustic metrology technology that underlies our opaque film products such as the MetaPULSE product family. The terms of these licenses are equal to the lives of the patents. We pay royalties to Brown and the University of Colorado based upon a percentage of our revenue from the sale of systems that incorporate the licensed technology. We continue to work with Brown and the University of Colorado on the development of advancements in relevant technical areas. We also continue to pursue intellectual property protection, including exclusive licenses to this technology. Note that third party licensees may terminate a license if we fail to pay royalties or if we materially breach our license agreements with those third parties.
 Our pending patents may never be issued, and even if they are, these patents, our existing patents and the patents we license may not provide sufficiently broad protection to protect our proprietary rights, or they may prove to be unenforceable. To protect our proprietary rights, we also rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, contractual provisions and licenses. There can be no assurance that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage.
 The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same degree as do the laws of the United States, and many U.S. companies have encountered substantial infringement problems in protecting their proprietary rights against infringement in such countries, some of which are countries in which we have sold and continue to sell products. There is a risk that our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate. For example, our competitors may independently develop similar technology or duplicate our products. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, it would be easier for our competitors to sell competing products.
 Competition
 The market for semiconductor capital equipment is highly competitive. We face substantial competition from established companies in each of the markets that we serve. We principally compete with KLA Corporation, Camtek and Veeco Instruments.  We compete to a lesser extent with companies such as Nanometrics, Nova Measuring Instruments and Nikon.  Each of our products also competes with products that use different metrology and inspection techniques. Some of our competitors have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources, broader product offerings and service capabilities and larger installed customer bases than we do.

Significant competitive factors in the market for inspection and metrology systems include system performance, ease of use, reliability, cost of ownership, technical support and customer relationships. We believe that, while price and delivery are important competitive factors, the customers’ overriding requirement is for a product that meets their technical capabilities. To remain competitive, we believe we will need to maintain a high level of investment in research and development and process applications. No assurances can be given that we will continue to be competitive in the future.
 Backlog
 We schedule production of our systems based upon order backlog and informal customer forecasts. We use the term “backlog” to refer to only those orders to which the customer has been assigned a purchase order number and for which delivery is anticipated within 12 months. Because shipment dates may be changed and customers may cancel or delay orders with little or no penalty, our backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period. At December 31, 2018, we had a backlog of approximately $62.7 million compared with a backlog of approximately $87.8 million at December 31, 2017.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 651 employees. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreements, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe our employee relations are good.
