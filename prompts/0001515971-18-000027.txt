BUSINESS

General Business and Products Description

International Isotopes Inc. (the Company, we, us and our) was formed as a Texas corporation in 1995. Our wholly-owned subsidiaries are International Isotopes Idaho Inc., a Texas corporation; International Isotopes Fluorine Products, Inc., an Idaho corporation; and International Isotopes Transportation Services, Inc., an Idaho corporation. Our core business consists of six reportable segments which include: Nuclear Medicine Standards, Cobalt Products, Radiochemical Products, Fluorine Products, Radiological Services, and Transportation.

During 2017, we focused our efforts on achieving profitability in each of our core business segments and reached several significant goals. During 2017, we:

·
 Continued research into the expansion of radiochemical products and performed follow-up work with regard to the 2016 submission of an abbreviated New Drug Application (aNDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a new generic sodium iodide drug;

·
 Maintained improved production methods in our nuclear medicine segment and achieved continued and significant reduction in waste and scrapped material as a result of these efforts;

·
 Became a managing member of RadQual, LLC (RadQual), as a result of a change in ownership of RadQual by affiliates of the Company, which we believe will strengthen our ability to develop and market our nuclear medicine products;

·
 Contracted with an alternate supplier of cobalt-60 for the purchase of cobalt material to meet near term customer contract obligations;

·
 Awarded several radiological services jobs through the U.S. Department of Energys (DOE) Orphan Source Recovery Program (OSRP) and through the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in which we were able to use our mobile hot cell both domestically and abroad; and

·
 Maintained our relationships in Lea County, New Mexico (location of our proposed de-conversion facility) and continued to pursue opportunities to obtain additional contracts for depleted uranium de-conversion services related to our proposed de-conversion project.

1

In 2018, we plan to continue efforts to further expand and improve upon our operations in our core business segments. We intend to continue to invest in these segments and work to pursue product development, reduce production costs and expand sales in each of them. The following paragraphs provide a brief description of each of our business segments. Certain financial information with respect to each of our business segments, including revenues from external customers, a measure of profit or loss, and total assets, is set forth in Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements which begin on page F-6.

Nuclear Medicine Standards

This segment consists of the manufacture of sources and standards associated with Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) imaging, patient positioning, and calibration or operational testing of dose measuring equipment for the nuclear pharmacy industry. Our nuclear medicine standards products include flood sources, dose calibrators, rod sources, flexible and rigid rulers, spot markers, pen point markers, and a host of specialty design items. These products are manufactured through an exclusive manufacturing agreement with RadQual, of which we own a 24.5% interest. In August 2017, affiliates of the Company purchased 75.5% of RadQual and at that time the Company was named as one of two managing members of RadQual. As a result of this ownership change the Company will have significant influence in management decisions with regard to RadQuals business operations. The Company has a manufacturing agreement with RadQual, that will remain in place and provides that we will manufacture sources exclusively for RadQual and will not manufacture products that would directly compete with RadQual sources. 

There are over 5,000 nuclear medicine centers in the United States (U.S.) that require nuclear medicine products on a regular repeat basis. We have been manufacturing these products for RadQual since 2001. The majority of nuclear medicine product sales are to U.S. customers; however, in recent years we have seen an increase in foreign sales. All of these products contain radioactive isotopes that decay at a predictable rate. Therefore, customers are required to periodically replace most of these products when they reach the end of their useful lives. The useful life of these products varies depending on the isotope used in manufacture, but in most cases averages 18 months to two years. The isotopes used in manufacturing these nuclear medicine products are available from various sources world-wide and we are not dependent on a single supplier. In addition to the products themselves, we have developed a complete line of specialty packaging for the safe transportation and handling of these products.

RadQual has numerous distributors for direct sales of its products. Formerly, the largest distributor was Technology Imaging Services Inc. (TIS). In December 2010, we formed a 50/50 joint venture with RadQual to acquire the assets of TIS, and those assets were used to create TI Services, LLC (TI Services). This joint venture has provided sales opportunities in existing and future RadQual product lines both domestically and internationally as a marketer for RadQual products. 

Cobalt Products

Our cobalt products segment includes the production of bulk cobalt (cobalt-60), fabrication of cobalt capsules for radiation therapy or various industrial applications, and recycling of expended cobalt sources.

Although historically bulk cobalt sales have accounted for a significant amount of the total revenue from this business segment, as further described below, during the past several years we have not had any bulk sales because of an interruption in cobalt production in the DOEs Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) located in Idaho. However, through continued work with the DOE, a new cobalt target was designed and in October 2014, we entered into a ten-year agreement with the DOE for the irradiation of the new target design which should increase our supply of cobalt material from the ATR in late 2018. Subsequent to completing the agreement with the DOE, we began putting commercial sales agreements in place with some customers. In accordance with those agreements, we began receiving pre-payments from customers on future cobalt shipments which we have recorded as unearned revenue. We expect to recognize significant sales of our cobalt-60 material in late 2018. In the meantime, we have identified a secondary supplier of cobalt-60 material to fulfill customer needs and will also rely on obtaining recycled material for the manufacture of some sources.

The year-over-year demand for cobalt products has remained strong as a result of the introduction of several new types of cobalt therapy units and we have continued to see demand for cobalt-manufactured products for those devices. On an ongoing basis we explore opportunities to further develop cobalt products and sales. The production, use, transport, and import/export of these products are all heavily regulated, but we have developed an experienced staff of technicians, drivers, and supervisors to comply with the regulations and support cost effective and timely delivery of these products.

We also own older cobalt targets that are stored at the ATR. We are currently working with the DOE on determining a feasible transfer and shipping method for these targets. The older targets continue to hold significant market value to us provided we are able to transport them to our facility for processing. In December of 2016 we brought in two targets from the ATR which were used to build calibration sources for the DOE. We did not pull any additional older cobalt target material out of the ATR during 2017, however, some material could be transferred and sold during 2018. We will reevaluate the remaining value of this older material at the end of 2018 and either make additional impairments to value or schedule future shipments in 2019.

Radiochemical Products

This segment includes production and distribution of various isotopically pure radiochemicals for medical, industrial, and research applications. These products are either directly produced by us or are purchased in bulk from other producers and distributed by us in customized packages and chemical forms tailored to meet customer and market demands. Sodium Iodide (Iodine-131) radiochemical product accounts for the largest portion of sales within this segment. The bulk of our Iodine-131 is supplied to us through an agreement with NTP Radioisotopes (Pty) Ltd. (NTP) in South Africa and is imported as a radiochemical intended for medical applications. In November 2017, we renewed our agreement with NTP for the supply of Iodine-131 that allows us to purchase iodine at a mutually agreeable pre-determined price through December 2019. Either party may terminate the agreement by giving three months notice prior to the expiration of the term. We have identified additional suppliers of sodium iodide from whom we have purchased material during 2017 and will likely continue this relationship into the future.

Perhaps the most significant business development for the Company during 2016 was our submittal of an abbreviated New Drug Application (aNDA) to the FDA for sodium iodide I-131. During 2017, we continued support and follow-up work with the FDA that such a submission typically requires and will continue these efforts during 2018. Generally, Iodine-131 is used in the treatment and diagnosis of various diseases of the thyroid gland such as Graves disease, thyroid cancer and hyperthyroidism. This is the first generic application for a sodium iodide product in the U.S. and after FDA approval sales of the product in the U.S. are expected to have a significant and beneficial impact to overall Company revenue and profitability. Other less significant sales of radiochemical in this segment consist of sales of isotopes such as Cobalt-57 (Co-57), Cesium-137 (Cs-137), Germanium  68 (Ge-68), Sodium-22 (Na-22), and Barium-133 (Ba-133). 

Radiological Services

This segment includes a wide variety of services such as decommissioning disused irradiation units, performing sealed source exchanges in irradiation and therapy units, and processing gemstones. In May 2004, we entered into an exclusive contract with Quali-Tech, Inc., for gemstone processing and, historically, this contract has accounted for the majority of sales in this segment. In May 2012, we modified and renewed the contract, which remains in effect until either party gives a minimum of six months notice to the other that it does not intend to continue the contract. In November 2016, we made an additional modification to the contract to increase the gemstone processing charge on March 1st of each year thereafter beginning on March 1, 2018. The adjustment to the charge will be based on data provided by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Historical Consumer Price Index. All other provisions of the agreement remain unchanged. The contract provides that we will act as the exclusive processor of gemstones for Quali-Tech, Inc., for the term of the contract and two years beyond.

We are licensed through the Nuclear Regulatory commission (NRC) to perform certain field service activities in connection with the DOEs Orphan Source Recovery Program (OSRP). These activities include services to support recovery of disused sources under the DOEs OSRP and installation or removal of certain cobalt therapy units. We designed and built a mobile hot cell unit to use in this field service work and during 2017 and 2016 used the unit to perform numerous OSRP field service jobs. The unique design of our mobile hot cell allows us to modify the hot cells components to perform customized source removal. This type of field service work is expected to generate the majority of revenue within this business segment in the coming years and has expanded to include similar international contract opportunities through the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 

Transportation

We established this segment in 2006 through our subsidiary, International Isotopes Transportation Services (IITS), to provide transportation of our products (such as cobalt sources) and to offer for hire transportation services of hazardous and non-hazardous cargo materials. A major factor in our decision to establish this subsidiary and business segment was the high cost of third-party transportation services and high volume of regulations involving the security and tracking of shipments of cobalt. IITS provides us with considerable savings for the transportation of our own products and produces a small revenue stream through the transportation of products for other companies. Because our transportation services have historically operated in support of our radiological field services work and other business segments, beginning in 2018, management has decided to eliminate transportation services as a separate reporting segment and will include future transportation service activity within the other business segments for which the service is performed.
Fluorine Products and the Planned Uranium De-conversion Facility

In 2004, we began a major undertaking to construct the first commercial uranium de-conversion facility in the U.S. At that time, we believed that such an undertaking would provide an excellent commercial opportunity to us in the future. 

3

We established the fluorine products business segment in 2004 to support production and sale of the gases produced using our Fluorine Extraction Process (FEP) that we intended to use in conjunction with the operation of the proposed depleted uranium de-conversion facility in Lea County, New Mexico. The FEP is a process that produces ultra-high-purity fluoride gas products through a solid-to-solid reaction between depleted uranium tetrafluoride (DUF4) and various solid metal oxides such as silicon. High-purity fluoride gases are in high demand for processes such as ion-implantation and chemical vapor deposition and also for the manufacture of organic complexes used in a host of industrial applications and manufacturing processes. The FEP products have very high purity, which makes them ideally suited to these specialty applications.

We acquired seven patents for the FEP in January 2004 and built a pilot production facility in Idaho that began operation in 2006. In 2010, we were granted an additional process patent on FEP based upon information gained through the operation of the pilot facility. Our pilot facility was not used for commercial gas production but instead focused upon production of high-purity products and examined methods of scaling up the size of the production operations in support of the proposed de-conversion facility in New Mexico. By the end of 2012, we had completed our testing of individual components and analytical processes and in April 2013, we shut down the pilot facility and terminated our lease on that property.

DUF6 is the waste by-product of uranium enrichment and any uranium enrichment facility will create very large quantities of DUF6. Our intended plant design would process DUF6 into DUF4 and then use the DUF4 in the FEP process, thereby, creating a business model in which the Company is paid to process the DUF6 and then is able to sell the fluoride products produced from the DUF4.

We were able to put an agreement in place with URENCO in 2010 to process some of their DUF6 waste. In October 2012, we received the NRC construction and operating license for the planned de-conversion facility. This is a forty (40) year operating license and is the first commercial license of this type issued in the U.S. There are no other companies with a similar license application under review by the NRC and the license does not require us to begin construction of the project by any specific date. Therefore, the NRC license represents a significant competitive barrier and we believe that it provides us with a very valuable asset now and in the future when we are ready to resume formal design and engineering work on the plant.

Due to changes in the nuclear industry near the end of 2013, we placed further engineering work on the proposed uranium de-conversion facility on hold. The changes to market conditions were the result of changes in the outlook for growth in the nuclear industry. When we began pursuing this project, there were several companies planning for construction of new commercial uranium enrichment plants in the U.S. The de-conversion service agreement we had put in place with URENCO USA (UUSA), would have used approximately 50% of the installed processing capacity of our proposed de-conversion facility. Plans to obtain additional contracts with the other enrichment companies that would commit the remaining capacity of the planned facility have continued to be delayed because of the general slowdown in nuclear industry growth.

Further activity within this segment will be deferred until market and industry conditions change and justify resuming design and construction of the facility. In the meantime, we expect to continue to incur some costs associated with the maintenance of licenses, property agreements, and other project investments. Meanwhile, however, the facility operated by UUSA continues to produce and stockpile depleted uranium tails and, therefore, we believe there is still an opportunity to provide commercial depleted uranium de-conversion services at some point in the future. We were also made aware in 2015 that the DOE may have a need for DUF4 material and we are continuing to monitor that additional opportunity. We expect that, either DOE needs for DUF4 material or commercial enrichment needs to process DUF6 waste, will eventually dictate the appropriate time to resume this project.

In connection with the proposed de-conversion facility, Lea County, New Mexico transferred property to the Company under the provisions of the New Mexico Local Economic Development Act, Project Participation Agreement (PPA) as a location for construction of the facility. Under the original agreement, the Company was obligated to meet certain performance objectives. The Company did not meet these objectives, however, in July 2015, the Company executed an amendment to the PPA that extended the due date of the Phase I construction to December 31, 2016, and Phase I completion and hiring at least 75 employees to December 31, 2016. The Company did not meet the December 31, 2016 deadline and management is working with Lea County to execute an additional modification to the agreement to further extend these dates to at least 2020. If the Company does not succeed in extending the commitment dates or in reaching performance dates set forth in a modified agreement then it may either purchase or re-convey the property to Lea County, New Mexico. In addition, if Lea County does not agree to that modification and the Company does not retain title to the property, it could have a material adverse impact on our planned de-conversion and FEP project since another location would need to be selected and evaluated for environmental compliance.

Industry Overview, Target Markets, and Competition

The industries and markets that require or involve the use of radioactive material are diverse. Our current core business operations involve products that are used in a wide variety of applications and in various markets. The following provides an explanation of the markets and competitive factors affecting our current business segments.

4

Nuclear Medicine Standards

Calibration and reference standards are required for the daily operational checks and calibration of the measurement of SPECT imaging devices frequently used in nuclear medicine. Calibration and quality assurance testing is required as a routine part of the normal operations of this equipment to ensure its reliability and accuracy. We exclusively manufacture many of these reference standard products for one customer, RadQual, which in turn has many distributors who make direct sales around the U.S. and internationally. We directly ship these products to all 50 states and many overseas locations. There is only one other producer of these products in the world that directly competes with us for these products. Most of the products manufactured by our competitor are similar in design to our products because all must meet Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) dimensional and performance standards. However, we attempt to differentiate our products from our competitors products through increased levels of quality control and customer service. We are certified under ISO-9001:2008 and ISO-13485-2003 quality programs that have allowed us to start selling these products into several foreign countries that require this additional quality certification for manufacturers. We use a small number of suppliers for the isotopes and other materials used in manufacturing these nuclear medicine products, but if we were to lose any of these suppliers, others would be available.
Cobalt Products

Historically, we sold high-activity bulk cobalt to one customer that used it to fabricate several models of sealed sources for medical and industrial applications.  In June 2012, a leak of a cobalt target at the ATR belonging to another commercial business resulted in the curtailment of all further cobalt handling and production activities at the ATR pending completion of several corrective actions. Due to this issue, we were forced to discontinue the irradiation of that cobalt target design. Aside from a few shipments in 2014 and 2016 we have not been able to process this old material due to the lack of a suitable transportation container. Therefore, we have not recorded any bulk cobalt sales for the past several years. With some residual high activity cobalt material that we held at our facility and bulk cobalt purchased from another supplier, we were able to manufacture some sealed source products through 2017 and anticipate continued manufacture into 2018 using this alternate cobalt supply.

In 2014, we entered into a new 10-year agreement with the DOE utilizing a new cobalt target design. Because of the lengthy irradiation time required we anticipate that cobalt shipments to customers will resume in late 2018. Our cobalt products are used in applications such as radiation therapy, security devices, radiography examination and in some commercial applications. While there are other technologies available to provide external radiation therapy, there are several new devices just gaining market approval that still depend on cobalt sources for their specialized applications. There are currently no other producers of high specific activity cobalt in the U.S., however, there is one producer of medium specific activity material and there are at least three significant producers of high specific activity material in Canada and other parts of the world. In addition to us, there is only one other company in the U.S. currently licensed to handle large quantities of cobalt.

We manufacture cobalt sources as well as recycle used cobalt sources by recovering the cobalt for re-use in the manufacture of new sealed sources for teletherapy devices, irradiators, and other source applications. We are the only company in the U.S. that provides this unique service. There has been a significant increase in regulation by the NRC in recent years that has created a significant barrier to new entrants to this market. We expect steady demand for cobalt sealed source products over the next several years but are currently dependent upon our contract relationship with the DOE for access to its ATR in Idaho for the majority of our cobalt production activities. The interruption to cobalt production experienced in 2012 had a significant negative impact on our cobalt products business segment, and although we currently have a ten-year irradiation contract in place with the DOE, future interruptions in the operation of the ATR could have a negative impact on our cobalt products business segment. With our new cobalt production contract in place with the DOE we anticipate our market position in this business segment will remain strong in future years.

Radiochemical Products

We typically supply radiochemical products in bulk form. The markets for most radiochemicals are highly competitive. The target markets for these products are customers who (1) incorporate them into finished industrial or medical devices; (2) use radioisotope products in clinical trials for various medical applications; or (3) further process and include the radioisotope products into a pharmaceutical product FDA approved therapy or imaging.

In November 2016, we submitted an aNDA to the FDA for a sodium iodide (I-131) radiopharmaceutical product. The FDA has responded to our submission with various inquiries which will require continued effort and refinement of our submission. We will respond to the FDAs comments and continue the efforts towards FDA approval of this radiopharmaceutical product during 2018.

Fluorine Products and the Planned Depleted Uranium De-conversion Facility

Our Fluorine Products segment was developed in conjunction with uranium de-conversion in order to take advantage of the anticipated need for depleted uranium de-conversion services. Our FEP patents provide a unique opportunity to provide certain high-purity fluoride compounds while also offering a for fee de-conversion service to the uranium enrichment industry. Although during 2013 we curtailed the formal engineering work on the de-conversion facility, we believe that in the future there will be a resumption of nuclear growth, driven by recent interest in Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), that could positively impact the front end of the nuclear fuel cycle (i.e. uranium enrichment). Once that occurs the ground work we have completed on the depleted uranium de-conversion and fluorine extraction project should put us in an excellent position to take advantage of our position in the industry and should serve to justify the financial investment in this uranium de-conversion project in the future. We have also seen some interest by the DOE for a possible future supply of DUF4. We intend to continue to monitor these opportunities and maintain our licenses and other necessary project investments so that the project activities can be resumed when market conditions improve.
Radiological Services

Historically, most of our radiological services have been performed in support of gemstone processing for Quali-Tech, Inc. Gemstone processing has fluctuated in recent years but has recently gained traction and has remained a significant contributor to this segments revenue.

In the past several years, we have seen increased opportunities for radiological field service activities involving installation or decommissioning of radiation devices in hospitals, research institutions, and various other commercial facilities. In 2012, we obtained our first amendment to our NRC license to permit certain field service activities and since that time radiological field service work has become a significant contributor to revenue within the segment. During 2017 and 2016 we were awarded several contracts for field service activities in connection with the DOEs OSRP project as well as contracts through the IAEA. We designed and built a mobile hot cell unit for use in this field service work and in 2014 and 2015 we were granted additional amendments to our NRC license that have allowed us to expand the types of services we can provide. The design of our mobile hot cell allows us to adapt it to work in various source removal situations that would not otherwise be possible. We will continue to use the mobile hot cell to support these expanded services both domestically and internationally. While there are other companies that compete with us for field services work, we believe our mobile hot cell gives us a unique competitive advantage in some of these opportunities. In 2017, we worked to further increase these field service opportunities in the U.S. and abroad and expect that, in future years, field services will be the major source of revenue within this business segment.

Transportation

IITS was formed to support transportation of our own products and to provide for hire transportation services. IITS has specialized in the transportation of hazardous, radioactive materials including large cobalt shipments. These types of shipments face a significant amount of regulation and enhanced security requirements and IITS has been well suited in meeting those requirements. IITS has specially trained drivers and specially equipped vehicles intended to meet the standards for transportation of large cobalt shipments. Over the years the business activities in this segment have been primarily derived from the Companys radiological services and cobalt products business segments. Because of this, Company management believes that combining the transportation services financial reporting within these other segments would provide more qualitative reporting and will begin such reporting in the first period of 2018.
Government Regulation

Licensing

We currently operate under two NRC licenses, one for broad scope operations and another for exempt distribution. Our broad scope license covers calibration and reference standard manufacturing and distribution, radioisotope processing and distribution, large scale cobalt processing and recycle operations, radioactive gemstone processing, environmental sample analysis, certain field service activities, and research and development. The exempt distribution license permits the release and distribution of irradiated gemstones to unlicensed entities in the U.S. All of our existing licenses and permits are adequate to allow current business operations. We do not handle special nuclear materials (i.e. nuclear fuels and weapons grade uranium, thorium or plutonium); therefore, our facility is not designated as a nuclear facility that would require additional licensing.

As a condition of our NRC licenses in Idaho, we are required to provide financial assurance for decommissioning activities. We fulfill this license requirement with a surety bond which names the NRC as beneficiary and is supported by a restricted cash account held in trust by a third party. In January 2018, we re-evaluated the financial assurance needed to support decommissioning and will be increasing the bond amount and the restricted cash amount during the first quarter of 2018. Similar financial assurances will be required to fund the decommissioning of the proposed de-conversion facility.

6

In October 2012, we were granted a 40-year construction and operating license by the NRC for our planned depleted uranium de-conversion and fluorine extraction processing facility (the de-conversion facility). The de-conversion facility, is planned to be located in Lea County, New Mexico, and is proposed to initially de-convert up to approximately 11 million pounds of depleted uranium hexafluoride (DUF6) annually into fluoride products and depleted uranium oxides (DUO). Further engineering work on the proposed de-conversion facility was placed on hold in 2013 until additional contracts for utilization could be obtained. There is no specific timeline required by the NRC for the start of construction on this project. The majority of the pre-construction design, licensing and state permitting has already been completed for the project and a ground water permit from the state of New Mexico remains to be obtained before the plant could begin operation.

Regulation of Radioisotope Production Waste

All of our manufacturing processes generate some radioactive waste. We must handle this waste pursuant to the Low Level Radioactive Waste (LLRW) Policy Act (LLRW Act), which requires the safe disposal of mildly radioactive materials. The estimated costs for storage and disposal of these materials have been included in the manufacturing and sales price of our products. However, actual disposal costs are subject to change at the discretion of the disposal site and are ultimately applied at the time of disposal. We have obtained all necessary permits and approvals for the disposal of our waste materials and we do not anticipate any negative changes in capacity or regulatory conditions that would limit or restrict our waste disposal capabilities.

The planned de-conversion facility will produce large quantities of depleted uranium oxide waste. Disposal of depleted uranium waste will be the responsibility of the customers suppling DUF6 to the company for de-conversion. There are proposed changes to some of the regulations for low level radioactive waste disposal that could impact the rules surrounding disposal of large quantities of depleted uranium. The Company will continue to monitor any changes in the regulatory framework that could impact the de-conversion facility project.

Nuclear Regulatory Commission Oversight

We operate under two NRC licenses and are subject to NRC oversight and periodic inspections of our operations.

Other Regulations

We are registered as a medical device manufacturer through the FDA for several of our nuclear medicine reference and calibration standards. We are registered with the U.S. Department of Transportation for the shipment of radioactive materials. We also have an NRC license for the import and export of radioactive materials. Because of increasing security controls and regulations, it is likely that we may encounter additional regulations affecting transportation, storage, sale, and import/export of radioactive materials.

We are also subject to inspection by the FDA to be in compliance with cGMP for our sodium iodide product and are registered with the FDA as an Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient manufacturer and a manufacturing facility. In November 2016, we submitted an aNDA for our sodium iodide product. Once approved the facility will thereafter be subject to periodic and random inspections by the FDA for the continued manufacture of this drug product.

We are subject to government regulation and intervention both in the U.S. and in all foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and operating costs and changes to current regulations with which we must comply can necessitate further capital expenditures and increases in operating costs to enable continued compliance.

Employees

As of December 31, 2017, we had 30 total employees including 28 full-time employees.

Distribution Methods for Products

We sell our products directly to our customers who, in some cases, are both end users and distributors. We use common commercial carriers and our own transportation vehicles and personnel for delivery of our products. For smaller quantities of material, and overnight and next-day delivery, we utilize other commercial carriers. For our products that involve large quantities of radioactive material, most commonly cobalt-60, and that invoke certain special transportation requirements, we use our own specially trained transportation employees.

Dependence on Customers

Historically, we have been dependent on one customer, RadQual, of which we own 24.5%, for a significant amount of our gross revenue. In August 2017, several affiliates of the Company purchased the remaining 75.5% and at that time, the Company was named as a managing member of RadQual. Our sales to RadQual prior to August 2017 accounted for approximately 17% of total gross revenue for 2017.

Combined sales, on which we are dependent, to our three largest customers, accounted for 31% of our total gross revenues in 2017 and accounted for 43% of our total gross revenues in 2016. We are making efforts to reduce our dependency on a small number of customers by expanding sales in both domestic and foreign markets and through our establishment of the joint venture, TI Services, to expand distribution of products. The change in ownership of RadQual, and naming the Company as a managing member of RadQual business operations, has significantly reduced any risk associated with RadQual as a single major customer to the Company.

Patents, Trademarks, Licenses and Royalty Agreements

In 2004, we obtained certain patents related to the FEP. In 2010, the Company was granted an additional process patent on the FEP process and during 2011 the Company started the process to file for international protections of this patent in South Africa, Japan, Russia, China, Canada, and the European Union. During 2012, the Company was granted additional process patents for the FEP process in the United States. In 2013, the FEP process patent was granted in Russia and in 2014 the FEP process patent was granted in South Africa. In 2015, the FEP process patents in China and Japan were abandoned and in 2017 the process patent in Canada was abandoned. The applications in the other countries are still in process.
Research and Development

In 2017, we had research and development expenses totaling $376,698, compared with $511,283 in 2016. These expenses were primarily associated with current product development activities related to our sodium iodide product.
