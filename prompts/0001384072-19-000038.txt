ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
We are an independent exploration and production company focused on the production and development of oil and natural gas properties in the United States. Through our operating subsidiaries, as of December 31, 2018, we own properties and oil and natural gas reserves primarily located in nine operating basins:

• | the Green River Basin in Wyoming;


• | the Piceance Basin in Colorado;


• | the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico;


• | the Arkoma Basin in Oklahoma;


• | the Gulf Coast Basin in Texas, Louisiana and Alabama;


• | the Big Horn Basin in Wyoming and Montana;


• | the Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma and North Texas;


• | the Wind River Basin in Wyoming; and


• | the Powder River Basin in Wyoming.

The Predecessor was formed in October 2006 as a Delaware limited liability company named Vanguard Natural Resources, LLC and completed its initial public offering in October 2007. On August 1, 2017, we emerged from bankruptcy and reorganized as a Delaware corporation named Vanguard Natural Resources, Inc. Please read “Emergence from Voluntary Reorganization under Chapter 11 Proceedings” included under Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report for additional information. 
Following the completion of the financial restructuring on August 1, 2017 (Notes 2, 14 and 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report), the Company had 20.1 million shares of its common stock outstanding. The Company’s shares of common stock and two series of warrants are traded and quoted on the OTC Pink marketplace (the “OTC Pink”), which is operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc., under the symbols VNRRQ, VNRVQ and VNRWQ, respectively. 
On April 1, 2019, we received notice from the OTC Markets Group Inc. notifying us that, effective April 2, 2019, it was removing the shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 (“Common Stock”), and two series of outstanding warrants from the OTCQX U.S. tier of the OTC Markets and downgrading them to the OTC Pink in light of the 2019 Bankruptcy Petitions. The OTC Pink is a more limited market than the OTCQX U.S. tier, and the quotation of our Common Stock on the OTC Pink may result in a less liquid market available for existing and potential stockholders to trade our Common Stock and could further depress the trading price of our Common Stock. There can be no assurance that any public market for our Common Stock will exist in the future or that the Company or its successor will be able to participate again in the OTCQX U.S. tier.
Recent Developments
Going Concern Assessment and Management’s Plans
As discussed further in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors”, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, and Note 1 to our Financial Statements, we have concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, and the report of the independent registered public accounting firm that accompanies the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains an explanatory paragraph regarding substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern due to the filing of the 2019 Chapter 11 Cases (as described under “Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Debt and Credit Facilities”).

Bankruptcy Proceedings under Chapter 11
Commencement of Bankruptcy Cases 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company’s liquidity and ability to maintain compliance with debt covenants have been negatively impacted by borrowing base redeterminations under the Successor Credit Facility (as defined herein), lower-than-expected proceeds from asset divestitures, low realized commodity prices due to the Company's hedges and lower-than-expected economic returns from capital expenditures.
On March 31, 2019, the Company and certain subsidiaries (such subsidiaries, together with the Company, the “2019 Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions for relief (collectively, the “2019 Bankruptcy Petitions” and, the cases commenced thereby, the “2019 Chapter 11 Cases”) under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the “Bankruptcy Court”). The 2019 Debtors have filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court seeking to jointly administer the 2019 Chapter 11 Cases under the caption “In re: Vanguard Natural Resources, Inc., et al.” 
The subsidiary Debtors in the 2019 Chapter 11 Cases are VNG, VNRH, VO, EOC, EAC, ERAC, ERUD, ERAP, ERAC II, ERUD II and ERAP II.
No trustee has been appointed and the Company continues to manage itself and its affiliates and operate their businesses as “debtors-in-possession” subject to the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and the orders of the Bankruptcy Court. The Company expects to continue its operations without interruption during the pendency of the 2019 Chapter 11 Cases. To assure ordinary course operations, the Debtors secured orders from the Bankruptcy Court approving a variety of “first day” motions, including motions that authorize the Debtors to maintain their existing cash management system, to secure debtor-in-possession financing and other customary relief. These motions are designed primarily to minimize the effect of bankruptcy on the Company’s operations, customers and employees.
Debtor-in-Possession Financing
In connection with the 2019 Chapter 11 Cases, on March 31, 2019 (the “2019 Petition Date”), the Debtors filed a motion (the “DIP Motion”) seeking, among other things, interim and final approval of the 2019 Debtors’ use of cash collateral and debtor-in-possession financing on terms and conditions set forth in a proposed Debtor-in-Possession Credit Agreement (the “DIP Credit Agreement”) among VNG (the “DIP Borrower”), the financial institutions or other entities from time to time parties thereto, as lenders, Citibank N.A., as administrative agent (the “DIP Agent”) and as issuing bank. The initial lender under the DIP Credit Agreement is Citibank N.A. The DIP Credit Agreement contains the following terms: 

• | a super-priority senior secured revolving credit facility in the aggregate amount of up to $65.0 million (the “New Money Facility”), of which $20.0 million was drawn on April 4, 2019;


• | a “roll up” of $65.0 million of the outstanding principal amount of the revolving loans under the Successor Credit Facility (the “Roll-Up”, and, together with the New Money Facility, collectively, the “DIP Facility”);


• | proceeds of the New Money Facility may be used by the DIP Borrower to (i) pay certain costs and expenses related to the 2019 Chapter 11 Cases, (ii) make payments provided for in the DIP Motion, including in respect of certain “adequate protection” obligations and (iii) fund working capital needs, capital improvements and other general corporate purposes of the DIP Borrower and its subsidiaries, in all cases subject to the terms of the DIP Credit Agreement and applicable orders of the Bankruptcy Court;


• | the maturity date of the DIP Credit Agreement is expected to be the earliest to occur of (a) nine months after the 2019 Petition Date, (b) 35 days after the entry of the interim DIP order, if the Bankruptcy Court has not entered the final DIP order on or prior to such date, (c) the consummation of a sale of all or substantially all of the equity and/or assets of the DIP Borrower and its subsidiaries, (d) the occurrence of an Event of Default (subject to any cure periods), and (e) the effective date of a plan of reorganization in the 2019 Chapter 11 Cases;


• | interest will accrue at a rate per year equal to the LIBOR rate plus 5.50%, or the adjusted base rate plus 4.50% per annum;


• | in addition to fees to be paid to the DIP Agent, the DIP Borrower is required to pay to the DIP Agent for the account of the lenders under the DIP Credit Agreement, an unused commitment fee equal to 1.0% of the daily average of each lender’s

2

unused commitment under the New Money Facility, which is payable in arrears on the last day of each calendar month and on the termination date for the facility for any period for which the unused commitment fee has not previously been paid;

• | the obligations and liabilities of the DIP Borrower and its subsidiaries owed to the DIP Agent and lenders under the DIP Credit Agreement and related loan documents will be entitled to joint and several super-priority administrative expense claims against each of the DIP Borrower and its subsidiaries in their respective 2019 Chapter 11 Cases subject to limited exceptions provided for in the DIP Motion, and will be secured by (i) a first priority, priming security interest and lien on all encumbered property of the DIP Borrower and its subsidiaries, subject to limited exceptions provided for in the DIP Motion, (ii) a first priority security interest and lien on all unencumbered property of the DIP Borrower and its subsidiaries, subject to limited exceptions provided for in the DIP Motion and (iii) a junior security interest and lien on all property of the DIP Borrower and its subsidiaries that is subject to (a) a valid, perfected and non-avoidable lien as of the petition date (other than the first priority and second priority prepetition liens) or (b) a valid and non-avoidable lien that is perfected subsequent to the petition date, in each case subject to limited exceptions provided for in the DIP Motion;


• | the DIP Credit Agreement is subject to customary covenants, including a requirement that the Company maintain a minimum liquidity (as defined in the DIP Credit Agreement) of $10.0 million, prepayment events, events of default and other provisions; and


• | generally, any undrawn commitments on the New Money Facility as of the effective date of a plan of reorganization are contemplated to be converted into an exit RBL facility and the Roll-Up is contemplated to be converted into an exit term loan as of such date.

The DIP Credit Agreement is subject to final approval by the Bankruptcy Court, which has not been obtained at this time and the Roll-Up is subject to the entry of the Final Dip Order by the Bankruptcy Court. We can provide no assurances that the DIP Motion will be granted.
Acceleration of Debt Obligations
The commencement of the 2019 Chapter 11 Cases described above is an event of default that accelerated the Debtors’ obligations under the following debt instruments (the “Debt Instruments”). Any efforts to enforce such obligations under the Debt Documents are stayed automatically as a result of the filing of the 2019 Bankruptcy Petitions and the holders’ rights of enforcement in respect of the Debt Documents are subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.

• | $677.7 million in unpaid principal with respect to the Revolving Loan (as defined herein), $123.4 million in unpaid principal with respect to the Term Loan (as defined herein), and approximately $11.6 million of interest, fees, and other expenses arising under or in connection with the Successor Credit Facility.


• | $80.7 million in unpaid principal, plus interest, fees, and other expenses, arising in connection with the New Notes issued pursuant to that certain Amended and Restated Indenture, dated as of August 2, 2017, among Vanguard Natural Resources, Inc., the guarantors named therein and Delaware Trust Company, as trustee and collateral trustee (the “Amended and Restated Indenture”).

Emergence from Voluntary Reorganization under 2017 Chapter 11 Proceedings
On February 1, 2017, the Predecessor and certain of its subsidiaries (the “2017 Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions (collectively, the “2017 Bankruptcy Petitions” and, the cases commenced thereby, the “2017 Chapter 11 Cases”) for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the “2017 Bankruptcy Court”). The 2017 Chapter 11 Cases were administered under the caption “In re Vanguard Natural Resources, LLC, et al.” On July 18, 2017, the 2017 Bankruptcy Court entered the Order Confirming Debtors’ Modified Second Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, which approved and confirmed the 2017 Debtors’ Modified Second Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the “Final Plan”). The Company emerged from bankruptcy effective August 1, 2017. 
Upon emergence from bankruptcy, we made multiple changes to our accounting policies including the application of fresh-start accounting. Please read Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates included under Part II, Item 7 for a discussion of fresh-start accounting and other accounting policy changes.
Proved Reserves
3

Our total estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2018 were 1,077.5 Bcfe, of which approximately 19% were oil reserves, 64% were natural gas reserves and 17% were NGLs reserves. Of these total estimated proved reserves, approximately 100% were classified as proved developed.  As of December 31, 2018, we have removed all proved undeveloped reserves from our total estimated proved reserves due to uncertainty regarding our ability to continue as a going concern and the availability of capital that would be required to develop the proved undeveloped reserves. For information regarding such removal of our proved undeveloped reserves, please read “Oil, Natural Gas and NGLs Data - Proved Undeveloped Reserves.” At December 31, 2018, estimated future cash inflows from estimated future production of proved reserves were computed in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) rules using the average oil, natural gas and NGLs price based upon the 12-month unweighted average of first-day-of-the-month price (the “12-month average price”) of $65.66 per barrel of crude oil, $3.10 per MMBtu for natural gas, and $26.57 per barrel of NGLs, as described under “Oil, Natural Gas and NGLs Data - Estimated Proved Reserves.”
At December 31, 2018, we owned working interests in 10,330 gross (3,620 net) productive wells. Our operated wells accounted for approximately 60% of our total estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2018. Our average net daily production was 346,128 Mcfe/day for the year ended December 31, 2018 and was 324,478 Mcfe/day for the fourth quarter of 2018. Our average proved reserves-to-production ratio, or average reserve life, is approximately eight years based on our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2018 and our fourth quarter 2018 annualized production. 
Oil and Natural Gas Properties

As of December 31, 2018, through certain of our subsidiaries, we own interests in oil and natural gas properties located in nine operating basins. The following table presents the production for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the estimated proved developed reserves for each operating area:

(b) | Present Value of Future Net Reserves (“PV-10”) is the present value of estimated future net revenues to be generated from the production of proved reserves, calculated net of estimated production costs and future development costs, using prices based on the 12-month unweighted average of first-day-of-the-month price, the “12-month average price”), and without giving effect to non-property related expenses such as selling, general and administrative expenses and debt service, future income tax expense or to depreciation, depletion, amortization, and accretion and discounted using an annual discount rate of 10%. PV-10 is not a measure of financial or operating performance under GAAP, nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. We believe the PV-10 Value is a useful supplemental disclosure to the Standardized Measure because the PV-10 Value is a widely used measure within the industry and is commonly used by analysts, banks and credit rating agencies to evaluate the value of proved reserves on a comparative basis across companies or specific properties without regard to the owner's income tax position. We use the PV-10 Value for comparison against our debt balances, to evaluate properties that are bought and sold and to assess the potential return on investment from our oil and natural gas properties. For our presentation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, please see “Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Information” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. 

The following is a description of our properties by operating basin: 
Green River Basin Properties
Our Green River Basin properties are primarily comprised of assets in the Pinedale and Jonah fields of southwestern Wyoming. Production in these fields is dominated by natural gas and NGLs from tight sands formations. The Pinedale field lies at depths anywhere between 11,000 to 14,000 feet with similar depths in the adjacent Jonah field. As of December 31, 2018, our Green River Basin properties consisted of 89,000 gross (14,132 net) leasehold acres. During 2018, the Green River Basin properties produced approximately 43,503 MMcfe of which 86% was natural gas. At December 31, 2018, the properties had total proved reserves of approximately 293,658 MMcfe or 27% of our total estimated proved reserves at year end, of which 100% were proved developed and 87% were natural gas. In March 2018, we completed the sale of certain oil and natural gas properties in the Green River Basin. Net cash proceeds received from the sale were approximately $4.5 million, net of transaction costs and subject to customary post-closing adjustments. The net cash proceeds were used to pay down outstanding debt under the Successor Credit Facility. 
Piceance Basin Properties
The Piceance Basin is located in northwestern Colorado. Our Piceance Basin properties, which we operate, are located in the Gibson Gulch. The Gibson Gulch area is a basin-centered gas play along the north end of the Divide Creek anticline near the eastern limits of the Piceance Basin’s productive Mesaverde (Williams Fork) trend at depths of approximately 6,000 to 8,000 feet. As of December 31, 2018, our Piceance Basin properties consisted of 25,320 gross (17,355 net) leasehold acres. During 2018, our properties in the Piceance Basin produced approximately 26,011 MMcfe, of which 67% was natural gas. At December 31, 2018, the Piceance Basin properties accounted for approximately 259,434 MMcfe or 24% of our total estimated proved reserves at year end, of which 100% were proved developed and 66% were natural gas.
Permian Basin Properties
The Permian Basin is one of the largest and most prolific oil and natural gas producing basins in the United States extending over West Texas and southeast New Mexico. The Permian Basin is characterized by oil and natural gas fields with long production histories and multiple producing formations. Our Permian Basin properties are located in several counties that extend from Eddy County, New Mexico to Val Verde County, Texas and encompass hundreds of fields with multiple producing intervals. The majority of our producing wells in the Permian Basin are mature oil wells that also produce high-Btu casinghead gas with significant NGLs content. These properties primarily produce at depths ranging from 2,000 feet to 12,000 feet. As of December 31, 2018, our Permian Basin properties consisted of 335,118 gross (230,837 net) leasehold acres. During 2018, our Permian Basin operations produced approximately 15,907 MMcfe, of which 62% was oil, condensate and NGLs. At December 31, 2018, these properties accounted for approximately 148,985 MMcfe or 14% of our total estimated proved reserves at year end, of which 100% were proved developed and 65% were oil, condensate and NGLs. 
Arkoma Basin Properties
Our Arkoma Basin properties include properties in the Woodford Shale located in eastern Oklahoma, as well as royalty interests and non-operated working interests in the state. As of December 31, 2018, our Arkoma Basin properties consisted of 186,272 gross (78,149 net) leasehold acres. During 2018, the Arkoma Basin properties produced approximately 14,629 MMcfe, 
5

of which 93% was natural gas. At December 31, 2018, the properties had total proved reserves of approximately 119,761 MMcfe or 11% of our total estimated proved reserves at year end, of which 100% were proved developed and 91% were natural gas. 
Gulf Coast Basin Properties
Our Gulf Coast Basin properties include properties in the onshore Gulf Coast area, North Louisiana, Alabama, East Texas and South Texas.
Production from our North Louisiana properties comes from the East Haynesville and Cotton Valley fields. These properties include multiple productive zones including Cotton Valley, James Lime, Pettet, Haynesville, Smackover and Hosston. East Haynesville is located in Claiborne Parish, Louisiana and lies at a depth of approximately 9,000 to 11,000 feet. The Cotton Valley field is located in Webster Parish, Louisiana and produces from an average depth of 11,000 feet. 
Our Alabaman properties include the Big Escambia Creek, Flomaton and Fanny Church fields located in Escambia County, Alabama. These fields produce from either the Smackover or Norphlet formations at depths ranging from approximately 15,000 to 16,000 feet. The Fanny Church field is located two miles east of Big Escambia Creek. The Flomaton field is adjacent to and partially underlies the Big Escambia Creek field and produces from the Norphlet formation at depths from approximately 15,000 to 16,000 feet. The Smackover and Norphlet reservoirs are sour gas condensate reservoirs that produce gas and fluids containing a high percentage of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide. These impurities are extracted at the Company-operated Big Escambia Creek Treating facility and the effluent gas is further processed for the removal of natural gas liquids in the Big Escambia Creek Gas Processing facility. The operation of the wells and the facility is closely connected, and we are the largest owner and operator of the combined assets. In addition to selling condensate, natural gas, and NGLs, we also market elemental sulfur.
Our East Texas producing properties include the Fairway (James Lime Unit) field in Henderson and Anderson counties and produces from an average depth of 10,000 feet.
Our South Texas properties primarily are located in Hidalgo, LaSalle, Live Oak and Webb Counties. Most of the production is high Btu gas that is produced from the Vicksburg, Wilcox, Olmos and Escondido sand formations from a depth ranging from 7,500 to 17,000 feet. 
As of December 31, 2018, our Gulf Coast Basin properties consisted of 148,653 gross (63,287 net) leasehold acres. During 2018, the Gulf Coast Basin properties produced approximately 10,203 MMcfe, of which 54% were oil, condensate and NGLs. At December 31, 2018, these properties accounted for approximately 98,407 MMcfe or 9% of our total estimated proved reserves at year end, of which 100% were proved developed and 45% were natural gas. 
Big Horn Basin Properties
The Big Horn Basin is a prolific basin that is characterized by oil and natural gas fields with long production histories and multiple producing formations.
Our Elk Basin field is located in Park County, Wyoming and Carbon County, Montana. We operate all of our properties in the Elk Basin area, which includes the Embar-Tensleep, Madison and Frontier formations as discussed below.
Embar-Tensleep Formation. Production in the Embar-Tensleep formation is being enhanced through a tertiary recovery technique involving effluent gas, or flue gas, from a natural gas processing facility located in the Elk Basin field. From 1949 to 1974, flue gas was injected into the Embar-Tensleep formation to increase pressure and improve production of resident hydrocarbons. Currently, we still use flue gas injection to maintain and improve production within this formation and have recently initiated a fresh water injection pilot on top of the structure. Our wells in the Embar-Tensleep formation of the Elk Basin field are drilled to a depth of 5,100 to 6,600 feet.

Madison Formation.  We continue to operate an active water injection program that is used to enhance production in the Madison formation. The wells in the Madison formation of the Elk Basin field are drilled to a depth of 4,400 to 7,000 feet.
Frontier Formation.  The Frontier formation is being produced through primary recovery techniques. The wells in the Frontier formation of the Elk Basin field are typically drilled to a depth of 1,400 to 2,700 feet.

We operate and own a 62% interest in the Elk Basin natural gas processing plant near Powell, Wyoming, which was first placed into operation in the 1940s. ExxonMobil Corporation (“Exxon”) owns a 34% interest in this processing plant, and other parties own the remaining 4% interest. This plant is a refrigeration natural gas processing plant that receives natural gas supplies through a natural gas gathering system from Elk Basin fields.
We also operate and own the Wildhorse pipeline system, which is an approximately 6-mile natural gas gathering system that transports approximately 0.5 MMcf/day of low-sulfur natural gas from the South Elk Basin fields to the Elk Basin natural gas processing plant.
Our Big Horn Basin properties are comprised of assets in Wyoming and the Elk Basin field in south central Montana. We own working interests ranging from 25% to 100% in our Big Horn Basin properties, which consisted of 24,512 gross (15,632 net) leasehold acres as of December 31, 2018. During 2018, our properties in the Big Horn Basin produced approximately 5,578 MMcfe, of which 86% was oil. At December 31, 2018, the Big Horn Basin properties accounted for approximately 90,845 MMcfe, or 8% of our total estimated proved reserves at year end, of which 100% were proved developed and 96% were oil, condensate and NGLs.
Anadarko Basin Properties
The Anadarko Basin consists of operated and non-operated properties in the Verden field and other fields located in the Anadarko Basin of western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle. Within the Anadarko Basin, our assets can generally be characterized by stratigraphic plays with multiple, stacked pay zones and more complex geology than our other operating areas. Properties in the Anadarko Basin include mature fields with long production histories.
As of December 31, 2018, our Anadarko Basin properties consisted of 99,805 gross (26,673 net) leasehold acres. During 2018, the Anadarko Basin properties produced approximately 2,407 MMcfe, of which 61% was natural gas. At December 31, 2018, these properties accounted for approximately 26,089 MMcfe, or 2% of our total estimated proved reserves at year end, of which 100% were proved developed and 66% were natural gas. 
Wind River Basin Properties
The Wind River Basin is located in central Wyoming. Our activities are concentrated primarily in the eastern Wind River Basin, along the greater Waltman Arch. Our natural gas production in this basin is gathered through our own gathering systems and delivered to markets through pipelines owned by Tallgrass Interstate Gas Transmission and Colorado Interstate Gas (“CIG”). As of December 31, 2018, our Wind River Basin properties consisted of 71,296 gross (46,789 net) leasehold acres. During 2018, our Wind River Basin properties produced approximately 2,581 MMcfe, of which 85% was natural gas. At December 31, 2018, the properties had total proved reserves of approximately 23,676 MMcfe, or 2% of our total estimated proved reserves, of which 100% were proved developed and 84% were natural gas.
Powder River Basin Properties
The Powder River Basin is primarily located in northeastern Wyoming. Our development operations are conducted in our coalbed methane (“CBM”) fields. CBM wells are drilled to 1,500 feet on average, targeting the Big George Coals, typically producing water in a process called dewatering. This process lowers reservoir pressure, allowing the gas to desorb from the coal and flow to the well bore. As the reservoir pressure declines, the wells begin producing methane gas at an increasing rate. As the wells mature, the production peaks, stabilizes and then begins declining. The average life of a CBM well can range from five to eleven years depending on the coal seam. Our natural gas production in this basin is gathered through gathering and pipeline systems owned by Powder River Midstream, Fort Union Gas Gathering, LLC and Thunder Creek Gas Services, LLC. As of December 31, 2018, our Powder River Basin properties consisted of 114,287 gross (66,866 net) leasehold acres. During 2018, the properties produced approximately 5,480 MMcfe, which was 100% natural gas. At December 31, 2018, the properties had total proved reserves of approximately 16,609 MMcfe or 2% of our total estimated proved reserves at year end, of which 100% were proved developed and 100% were natural gas.

Oil, Natural Gas and NGLs Prices
We analyze the prices we realize from sales of our oil, natural gas and NGLs production and the impact on those prices of differences in market-based index prices and the effects of our derivative activities. We market our oil and natural gas production to a variety of purchasers based on regional pricing. Our natural gas production is primarily sold under market sensitive contracts that are typically priced at a differential to the New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) price or the published natural gas index price for the producing area due to the natural gas quality and the proximity to major consuming markets. The West Texas Intermediate Cushing (“WTI”) price of crude oil is a widely used benchmark in the pricing of domestic and imported oil in the United States. The relative value of crude oil is mainly determined by its quality and location. In the case of WTI pricing, the crude oil is light and sweet, meaning that it has a higher specific gravity (lightness) measured in degrees of API (“American Petroleum Institute”) gravity and low sulfur content, and is priced for delivery at Cushing, Oklahoma. In general, higher quality crude oils (lighter and sweeter) with fewer transportation requirements result in higher realized pricing for producers. 
Certain of our natural gas marketing contracts determine the price that we are paid based on the value of the dry gas sold plus a portion of the value of NGLs extracted.  Because title of the natural gas sold under these contracts passes at the outlet of the processing plant, we report residue volumes of natural gas in Mcf as production. 
The average realized prices described below include deductions for gathering, transportation and processing fees; however, these prices do not include the impact of our hedges.
Production in the Green River Basin is predominantly natural gas and is processed for the recovery of NGLs. The processed natural gas in the Pinedale field is subject to a processing agreement with Western Gas Resources in their Granger Plant facility where we take our residue natural gas in-kind for sales and NGLs are taken in-kind and sold pursuant to a liquids purchase agreement. During 2017, we were able to renegotiate this processing agreement, lowering our fees significantly. We market our Green River Basin residue natural gas into the Rockies market through the use of multiple pipeline connections. During 2018, we received the average NYMEX price less $0.81 per Mcf of natural gas in the Green River Basin. Through our renegotiated processing agreement in the Pinedale field, we are given the opportunity to work directly with the plant to decide whether or not it is best to reject or recover ethane (C2). As of December 31, 2018, we expect to continue ethane rejection in Pinedale through 2019.
Production in the Piceance Basin is predominantly natural gas and is processed for the recovery of NGLs. The processed gas is subject to a processing agreement with Enterprise Gas Processing LLC in their Meeker Plant facility. We market our natural gas production into the Rockies market at the Northwest Rockies index pricing. During 2018, we received the average NYMEX price less $1.09 per Mcf of natural gas in the Piceance Basin.
In the Permian Basin, most of our natural gas production is casinghead natural gas produced in conjunction with our oil production. Casinghead gas typically has a high Btu content and requires processing prior to sale to third parties. We have a number of processing agreements in place with gatherers/processors of our casinghead natural gas, and we share in the revenues associated with the sale of NGLs resulting from such processing, depending on the terms of the various agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we received the average NYMEX price less $1.79 per Mcf of natural gas in the Permian Basin. Our oil production is sold under month-to-month sales contracts with purchasers that take delivery of the oil volumes at the tank batteries adjacent to the producing wells. We sell oil production from our operated Permian Basin properties at the wellhead to third party gathering and marketing companies. During 2018, we received the average NYMEX price less $13.05 per barrel of crude oil in the Permian Basin.
Our Arkoma Basin production in the southeastern Oklahoma Woodford Shale consists predominately of natural gas with a mix of high Btu processed natural gas and unprocessed lean natural gas. The natural gas production is gathered by multiple third party entities with the processed natural gas ultimately delivered to the Targa Resources, Inc. natural gas processing complex. The processed natural gas is subject to a processing agreement with Targa Resources, Inc., where we take our residue natural gas in-kind for sales, and NGLs are sold pursuant to the terms of that processing agreement. We are contractually provided the ability to make an election to recover or reject ethane (C2) in order to improve product economics. During 2018, we elected to reject ethane, and expect to continue ethane rejection through 2019. The lean natural gas is primarily delivered directly to market. The natural gas was marketed at an Enable East index. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we received the average NYMEX price less $1.17 per Mcf of natural gas.
In the Gulf Coast Basin, our natural gas production has a high Btu content and requires processing prior to sale to third parties. Our proportionate share of the natural gas volumes are sold at the tailgate of the processing plant at the Houston Ship 
8

Channel and Waha Gas index pricing that typically results in a discount to NYMEX prices. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we received the average NYMEX price plus $0.13 per Mcf of natural gas.
The marketing of heavy sour crude oil production from our Big Horn Basin properties is done through our Clearfork pipeline, which transports the crude oil to local and other refiners through connections with other pipelines.  Our Big Horn Basin sweet crude oil production is transported from the field by a third-party trucking company that delivers the crude oil to a centralized facility connected to a common carrier pipeline with delivery points accessible to local refiners in the Salt Lake City, Utah and Guernsey, Wyoming market centers. During 2018, we received the average NYMEX price less $20.80 per barrel of crude oil in the Big Horn Basin. 
Our Anadarko Basin production in Oklahoma consists predominately of natural gas with a mix of high Btu processed natural gas and unprocessed lean natural gas. The natural gas production is gathered by multiple third parties. The lean natural gas is gathered by Enable Gathering & Processing LLC and sold to market at Enable Oklahoma Intrastate Transmission LLC’s West pool at the Panhandle, TX-Okla. index pricing. The high Btu gas is sold at the wellhead to various third parties. The majority is sold to Oneok Field Services Company LLC and DCP Midstream LP under gas purchase contracts subject to percent of proceeds pricing for all products. During 2018, we received the average NYMEX price less $1.47 per Mcf of natural gas in the Anadarko Basin. 
Our Wind River Basin properties are predominantly natural gas plays with approximately two-thirds of the production being processed at natural gas plants for the extraction of NGLs at our election. Our residue natural gas is sold into the Rockies market at the CIG index price while the NGLs are sold to a third-party natural gas processor pursuant to a processing agreement. 
Our Powder River natural gas production is classified as CBM gas and, as it is a very dry gas, is sold directly into the market upon being handled with conventional separation, treating and transportation. In 2017, we were able to renegotiate our current gathering agreement to allow for lower rates, effective December 1, 2017. The CBM gas is sold into the Rockies market at the CIG index price as well. During 2018, we received the average NYMEX price less $1.17 per Mcf of natural gas in the Wind River Basin while we received the average NYMEX price less $2.00 per Mcf of natural gas in the Powder River Basin.

(1) | PV-10 is the present value of estimated future net revenues to be generated from the production of proved reserves, calculated net of estimated production costs and future development costs, using prices based on the 12-month unweighted average of first-day-of-the-month price, the “12-month average price”, and without giving effect to non-property related expenses such as selling, general and administrative expenses and debt service, future income tax expense or to depreciation, depletion, amortization, and accretion and discounted using an annual discount rate of 10%. PV-10 is not a measure of financial or operating performance under GAAP, nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows.


(2) | Standardized Measure is the present value of estimated future net revenues to be generated from the production of proved reserves, determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) (using the 12-month unweighted average of first-day-of-the-month price, the “12-month average price”) and calculated net of the estimated future costs incurred in developing, producing and abandoning the proved reserves. Future income taxes are calculated by applying the statutory federal and state income tax rate to pre-tax future net cash flows, net of the tax basis of the properties involved and utilization of available tax carryforwards related to oil and natural gas operations. Standardized Measure does not give effect to derivative transactions. For a description of our derivative transactions, please read “Item 1. Business—Operations—Price Risk Management Activities” and “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.” For an explanation of Standardized Measure, please see “Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Information” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report.


(3) | Oil and natural gas prices are based on spot prices per Bbl and MMBtu, respectively, calculated using the 12-month average price for January through December 2018, with these representative prices adjusted by field for quality, transportation fees and regional price differentials to arrive at the appropriate net price. NGLs prices were calculated using differentials to the 12-month average price of oil per Bbl of $65.66. As of April 1, 2019, the WTI crude oil price per barrel was $61.59 and the Henry Hub natural gas spot price per MMBtu was $2.73.

(1) | PV-10 is the present value of estimated future net revenues to be generated from the production of proved reserves, calculated net of estimated production costs and future development costs, using prices based on the 12-month unweighted average of first-day-of-the-month price, the “12-month average price”, and without giving effect to non-property related expenses such as selling, general and administrative expenses and debt service, future income tax expense or to depreciation, depletion, amortization, and accretion and discounted using an annual discount rate of 10%. PV-10 is not a measure of financial or operating performance under GAAP, nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. For our presentation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, please see “Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Information” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. 

The data in the above table represents estimates only. Oil, natural gas and NGLs reservoir engineering is inherently a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil, natural gas and NGLs that cannot be measured in an exact manner, and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. The quantities of oil, natural gas and NGLs that are ultimately recovered, production and operating costs, the amount and timing of future development expenditures and future sales prices may differ from those assumed in these estimates. Please read “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

Our internal reservoir engineers’ estimates of future net revenues from our properties, and the PV-10 and standardized measure thereof, were determined to be economically producible under existing economic conditions using the unweighted arithmetic average first day of the month prices for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2018 for each product.
Future prices received for production and costs may vary, perhaps significantly, from the prices and costs assumed for purposes of these estimates. The PV-10 and standardized measure disclosed in this Annual Report should not be construed as the current market value of the reserves. The 10% discount factor used to calculate present value, which is required by Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) ASC, is not necessarily the most appropriate discount rate. The present value, no matter what discount rate is used, is materially affected by assumptions as to the timing of future production, which may prove to be inaccurate.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves
 As of December 31, 2018, the Company has removed all proved undeveloped reserves from its total proved reserve estimate due to uncertainty regarding its ability to continue as a going concern and the availability of capital that would be required to develop the proved undeveloped reserves. The following table represents a summary of our proved undeveloped reserves activity during the year ended December 31, 2018. This activity includes updates to prior proved undeveloped 
11

reserves, and the impact of changes in economic conditions, including changes in commodity prices and the uncertainty regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.

Proved Undeveloped Reserves reclassified to contingent resources | (526.8 | )
Proved Undeveloped Reserves at December 31, 2018 | — | 

Divestitures. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our proved undeveloped reserves decreased due to divestitures of oil and gas properties including 1.0 Bcfe of our total proved undeveloped reserves booked as of December 31, 2017.
Conversions. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we developed approximately 68.4 Bcfe of our total proved undeveloped reserves booked as of December 31, 2017 through the drilling of 142 gross (34.1 net) wells. 
Revisions/Reclassifications: At December 31, 2018, we reclassified 526.8 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves to the contingent resource category. Contingent resources are resources that are potentially recoverable, but not yet considered mature enough for development due to technological or capital restraints. Because substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern, in determining year-end 2018 reserves amounts, we concluded we lacked the required degree of certainty about our ability to fund a development drilling program and the availability of capital resources that would be required to develop proved undeveloped reserves. As a result of our inability to meet the reasonable certainty criteria for recording these proved undeveloped reserves as prescribed by the SEC, we did not record any proved undeveloped locations in the December 31, 2018 reserve report.
This year, because substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern, we can no longer support our proved undeveloped reserves, due to uncertainty that we have the ability to fund a development plan. Therefore, as of December 31, 2018, we reclassified all of our proved undeveloped reserves to contingent resources.
Reserve Estimation Process
Estimates of proved reserves at December 31, 2018 disclosed in this Annual Report, including proved reserve volumes, PV-10 and the standardized measure of future net cash flows, were based on studies performed by our internal reservoir engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the SEC. Our reserve estimation process is a collaborative effort coordinated by our reservoir engineers in compliance with our internal controls for such process. Reserve information as well as models used to estimate such reserves are stored on secured databases. Non-technical inputs used in reserve estimation models, including crude oil, natural gas and NGLs prices, production costs, future capital expenditures and our net ownership percentages are obtained from other departments within the Company. Our internal reservoir engineers perform review procedures with respect to such non-technical inputs. Reserve variances are discussed among the internal reservoir engineers and the Vice President of Subsurface and Development.
We use technologies to establish proved reserves that have been demonstrated to provide consistent results capable of repetition. The technologies and economic data being used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, production data, well test data, geologic maps, electrical logs and radioactivity logs. The estimated reserves of wells with sufficient production history are estimated using appropriate decline curves. Estimated reserves of producing wells with limited production history and for undeveloped locations are estimated using performance data from analogous wells in the area. These wells are considered analogous based on production performance from the same formation and with similar completion techniques.
Our reservoir engineering group is directly responsible for our reserve evaluation process and consists of six professionals, three of whom hold, at a minimum, bachelor’s degrees in engineering. Within our Company, our Vice President of Subsurface and Development and our Reservoir Engineering Manager are the technical people primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserve estimates. Our Vice President of Subsurface and Development has over 28 years of experience and graduated from University of Wyoming with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Petroleum Engineering. Our Reservoir Engineering Manager has over 30 years of experience and graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee with a Master of Science Degree in Geology/Geophysics.

The technical persons responsible for preparing the reserve estimates presented herein meet the requirements regarding qualifications, independence, objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers.
Independent Audit of Reserves
We engage independent petroleum engineers to audit our reserve estimates. Our internal policies and procedures require the independent engineers to prepare their own estimates of proved reserves for properties comprising at least 80% of our year-end proved reserves. The Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) requires that the independent petroleum engineers’ estimate of reserve quantities for the properties audited by the independent petroleum engineers are within 10% of our internal estimate. Once completed, our internally prepared year-end reserve estimates are presented to senior management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer for approval.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, we engaged Miller and Lents, an independent petroleum engineering firm, to perform reserve audit services. The opinion by Miller and Lents for the year ended December 31, 2018 covered producing areas containing 100% of our proved reserves on a net-equivalent-barrel-of-oil basis. Miller and Lents’ opinion indicates that the estimates of proved reserves related to our oil and natural gas properties prepared by our internal reservoir engineers and reviewed by Miller and Lents, when compared in total on a net-gas-equivalent basis, do not differ materially from the estimates prepared by Miller and Lents. Such estimates by Miller and Lents in the aggregate were within our 10% variation tolerance when compared to those prepared by our reservoir engineering group. The report prepared by Miller and Lents was developed utilizing geological and engineering data that we provided. The report of Miller and Lents dated March 5, 2019, which contains further discussion of the reserve estimates and evaluations prepared by Miller and Lents, as well as the qualifications of Miller and Lents’ technical person primarily responsible for overseeing such estimates and evaluations, is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report and incorporated herein by reference. 
Within Miller and Lents, the lead technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the audit of our reserves is Ms. Leslie A. Fallon. Ms. Fallon is a Senior Vice President with Miller and Lents and has over 30 years of experience in oil and gas reservoir studies and reserves evaluations. She graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 1983 with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Mechanical Engineering and is a licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas. Ms. Fallon meets or exceeds the education, training and experience requirements set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers and is proficient in applying industry standard practices to engineering and geoscience evaluations as well as applying SEC and other industry reserves definitions and guidelines.
During 2018, we paid fees of approximately $0.4 million to independent petroleum engineers for all reserve and economic evaluations.

(3) | A gross acre is an acre in which a working interest is owned. The number of gross acres is the total number of acres in which a working interest is owned.


(4) | A net acre is deemed to exist when the sum of the fractional ownership workings interests in gross acres equals one. The number of net acres is the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross acres expressed as whole numbers and fractions thereof.

Substantially all of our developed and undeveloped leasehold acreage is held by production, which means that as long as our wells on the acreage continue to produce, we will continue to hold the leases. The leases in which we hold an interest that is not held by production are not material to us because these leases have no proved undeveloped reserves assigned.

Drilling Activity
The following is a description of the Company’s drilling and completion activities during the year ended December 31, 2018.
In the Green River Basin, we participated in the drilling of 145 gross wells (19.4 net) and the completion of 131 gross wells (17.8 net) in Sublette County in southwestern Wyoming. These wells are directionally drilled from pads but are vertical through the 5,000 feet pay section. The average well depth is approximately 14,000 feet and is typically completed with 14 to 20 frac stages. 
In the Piceance Basin, we drilled and completed 14 gross (13.9 net) operated wells in the Mamm Creek field in Garfield County, Colorado. These wells are directionally drilled from pads but are vertical through the 2,500 feet pay section. The average well depth is approximately 8,000 feet and is typically completed with 8 frac stages. 
In the Permian Basin, we participated in the drilling and completion of 13 gross horizontal wells (0.2 net) in Eddy County, New Mexico. We also participated in the drilling and completion of one horizontal well in Yoakum County, Texas with an 8% working interest. The horizontal wells were drilled to vertical depths of 7,000 to 9,000 feet and extended with horizontal lateral lengths of approximately 7,000 to 10,000 feet.
In the Arkoma Basin, we participated in the drilling of 14 gross (1.8 net) wells and the completion of 12 gross (0.7 net) wells in Coal, Pittsburg and Hughes counties in Oklahoma. These wells were drilled to vertical depths of 7,000 to 10,000 feet and extended with horizontal lateral lengths of approximately 5,000 to 10,000 feet. 
In the Gulf Coast Basin, we drilled and completed one operated vertical well with a 100% working interest in Claiborne County, Louisiana. We also participated in the drilling of five (0.5 net) wells and completed one (0.3 net) well in Webster and De Soto Counties, Louisiana. Three of these wells are directionally drilled from pads but are vertical through the 500 to 1,000 feet pay section. The average well depth is approximately 10,000 feet and is typically completed with 2 to 3 frac stages. The remaining three wells are horizontally drilled to vertical depths of 10,000 feet to 13,000 feet and extended with horizontal lateral lengths of approximately 8,000 feet to 10,000 feet.
In the Big Horn Basin, we drilled and completed one gross (0.6 net) operated well in Carbon County, Montana. The well is directionally drilled from a pad but is vertical through the 400 feet pay section. The average well depth is approximately 6,500 feet and is typically completed with 2 frac stages. 
In the Anadarko Basin, we participated in the drilling of five gross (0.2 net) horizontal wells and the completion of four gross (0.1 net) horizontal wells in the Cleveland field in Ellis and Dewey counties in Oklahoma. These wells were drilled to vertical depths of 8,000 to 13,000 feet and extended with horizontal lateral lengths of approximately 5,000 to 7,000 feet. 
In the Powder River Basin, we drilled and completed six gross (6.0 net) operated vertical wells in Campbell and Johnson counties in Wyoming. These wells were drilled to vertical depths of 1,000 to 2,000 feet. 
The Board approved, subject to the approval of the DIP Agent and the agent under the Successor Credit Facility, a capital expenditures budget for 2019 of approximately $53.0 million compared to the $124.9 million we spent in 2018. Our 2019 capital expenditures budget includes approximately $24.0 million of drilling and completion capital focused on the core growth assets of the Green River and Arkoma Basins. If our 2019 capital expenditure budget is approved by the DIP Agent and the agent under the Successor Credit Facility, we expect to spend approximately $15.0 million of the drilling capital budget in the Arkoma Basin where we will participate as a non-operated partner in the drilling and completion of horizontal wells targeting the Woodford and Mayes formations. This program is a continuation of our 2018 one rig program with Newfield Exploration Company, (“Newfield”). The acquisition of Newfield by Encana Corporation has delayed the completion of the program. However, we anticipate further evaluation of the scope and timing of this project to recommence later this fiscal year. Furthermore, we expect to spend approximately $9.0 million in the Green River Basin at the Pinedale field where we participate as a non-operated partner in the drilling of vertical natural gas wells with Ultra Petroleum Corporation and Pinedale Energy Partners. In addition to our drilling and completion programs, we expect to spend approximately $8.0 million on other uplift projects, primarily in the Permian New Mexico Red Lake field, where we will expand on our successful 2018 operated Yeso recompletion and commingle program. The remaining $21.0 million of the capital program will be spent on maintenance and land projects that include safety and environmental compliance, compressor overhauls, facility work, returning wells to production that go offline during the year and other capital required to maintain reserves and operations.

The following table sets forth information with respect to wells completed during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Our drilling activity during these periods has consisted entirely of drilling development wells. We have not drilled any exploratory wells during these periods. The information should not be considered indicative of future performance, nor should it be assumed that there is necessarily any correlation between the number of productive wells drilled, quantities of reserves found or economic value. Productive wells are those that produce commercial quantities of oil, natural gas, and NGLs regardless of whether they produce a reasonable rate of return.

Operations

Principal Customers
For the year ended December 31, 2018, sales of oil, natural gas and NGLs to Mieco Inc., Exxon, Plains Marketing, L.P., Macquarie Energy and ConocoPhillips accounted for approximately 14%, 7%, 6%, 6% and 5%, respectively, of our oil, natural gas and NGLs revenues. Our top five purchasers during the year ended December 31, 2018 therefore accounted for 38% of our total revenues. To the extent these and other customers reduce the volumes of oil, natural gas and NGLs that they purchase from us and they are not replaced in a timely manner with a new customer, our revenues and cash flows from operations could decline. However, if we were to lose a customer, we believe a substitute purchaser could be identified in a timely manner and upon similar terms and conditions.

Delivery Commitments and Marketing Arrangements
Our oil and natural gas production is principally sold to marketers, processors, refiners and other purchasers that have access to nearby pipeline, processing and gathering facilities. In areas where there is no practical access to pipelines, oil is trucked to central storage facilities where it is aggregated and sold to various markets and downstream purchasers. Our production sales agreements generally contain customary terms and conditions for the oil and natural gas industry, provide for sales based on prevailing market prices in the area and generally are month-to-month or have terms of one year or less. 
We generally sell our natural gas production from our operated properties on the spot market or under market-sensitive, short-term agreements with credit-worthy purchasers, including independent marketing companies, gas processing companies and other purchasers who have the ability to pay the highest price for the natural gas production and move the natural gas under the most efficient and effective transportation agreements. Because all of our natural gas production from our operated properties is sold under market-priced agreements, we are positioned to take advantage of future increases in natural gas prices, but we are also subject to any future price declines, subject to the impact of derivatives. We do market our own natural gas on some of our non-operated properties. 
The marketing of heavy sour crude oil production from our Big Horn Basin properties is done through our Clearfork pipeline, which transports the crude oil to local and other refiners through connections to other export pipelines. Our Big Horn Basin sweet crude oil production is transported from the field by a third-party trucking company that delivers the crude oil to a centralized facility connected to a common carrier pipeline with delivery points accessible to local refiners in the Salt Lake City, Utah and Guernsey, Wyoming market centers. We sell oil production from our operated Permian Basin properties at the wellhead to third-party gathering and marketing companies.
Our natural gas is transported through our own and third-party gathering systems and pipelines, and we incur processing, gathering and transportation expenses to move our natural gas from the wellhead to a specified delivery point. These expenses vary based on the volume and distance shipped, and the fee charged by the third-party gatherer, processor or transporter. Capacity on these gathering systems and pipelines is occasionally limited and at times unavailable because of repairs or improvements or as a result of priority transportation agreements with other gas shippers. While our ability to market our natural gas has been only infrequently limited or delayed, if transportation space is restricted or is unavailable, our cash flow from the affected properties could be adversely affected. In certain instances, we may enter into firm transportation agreements to provide for pipeline capacity to flow and sell a portion of our gas volumes. Currently, a majority of our existing firm transportation agreements were assumed in connection with acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties. These agreements have term delivery commitments of fixed and determinable quantities of natural gas. Please read “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Commitments and Contractual Obligations” for additional information regarding our long-term firm transportation contracts.
The following table sets forth information about material long-term firm transportation contracts for pipeline capacity, which typically require a demand charge. We source the gas to meet these commitments from our producing properties. We have certain commitments that we assumed as part of our acquisitions of oil and gas properties where the production from the acquired properties and the production of joint interest owners that we market were not adequate to meet the commitments resulting in us paying the set demand charge relating to the maximum daily quantity outlined in the contract. For further information related to these demand charges, please read “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Commitments and Contractual Obligations” and Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. During the year ending December 31, 2019, our firm transportation contract obligates us to deliver 25,000 MMBtu of natural gas per day.

Price Risk Management Activities
We routinely enter into derivative transactions in the form of hedging arrangements to reduce the impact of oil, natural gas and NGLs price volatility on our cash flow from operations. Currently, we primarily use fixed-price swaps and collars to hedge oil and natural gas prices. By removing the price volatility from a significant portion of our oil and natural gas production, we are able to mitigate for a period of time, but not eliminate, the potential effects of fluctuation in oil and natural gas prices on our cash flow from operations. For a description of our derivative positions, please read “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”
18

Competition

The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We encounter strong competition from other independent operators and from major oil companies in acquiring properties, leasing acreage, contracting for drilling equipment and securing trained personnel. Many of these competitors have financial and technical resources and staff substantially larger than ours or a different business model. As a result, our competitors may be able to pay more for desirable leases, or to evaluate, bid for, purchase, or develop a greater number of properties or prospects than our financial, technical or personnel resources will permit.

We are also affected by competition for drilling rigs and the availability of related equipment. In the past, the oil and natural gas industry has experienced shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, pipe and personnel, which has delayed development drilling and has caused significant price increases. We are unable to predict when, or if, such shortages may occur or how they would affect our development program.

Competition is also strong for attractive oil and natural gas producing properties, undeveloped leases and drilling rights, and we cannot assure stockholders that we will be able to compete satisfactorily when attempting to make future acquisitions.

Title to Properties
As is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we initially conduct only a cursory review of the title to our properties on which we do not have proved reserves. Prior to the commencement of drilling operations on those properties, however, we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects. To the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties, we are typically responsible for curing any title defects at our expense. We will generally not commence drilling operations on a property until we believe we have cured any material title defects on such property. Prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and natural gas leases, we perform title reviews on the most significant leases and, depending on the materiality of properties, we may obtain a title opinion or review previously obtained title opinions. As a result, we have obtained title opinions on a significant portion of our oil and natural gas properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry. Although title to these properties is subject to encumbrances in some cases, such as customary interests generally retained in connection with acquisition of real property, customary royalty interests, contract terms and restrictions, liens under operating agreements, liens related to environmental liabilities associated with historical operations, liens for taxes not yet payable and other burdens, restrictions and minor encumbrances customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we believe that none of these liens, restrictions, easements, burdens and encumbrances will materially detract from the value of these properties or from our interest in these properties, or will materially interfere with our use of these properties in the operation of our business.
Natural Gas Gathering
We own and operate a network of natural gas gathering systems in the Gulf Coast Basin, Piceance Basin and Big Horn Basin. These systems gather and transport our natural gas and a small amount of third-party natural gas to larger gathering systems and intrastate, interstate and local distribution pipelines. Our network of natural gas gathering systems permits us to transport production from our wells with fewer interruptions and also minimizes any delays associated with a gathering company extending its lines to our wells. Our ownership and control of these lines enables us to:

• | realize faster connection of newly drilled wells to the existing system;


• | control pipeline operating pressures and capacity to maximize production;


• | control compression costs and fuel use;


• | maintain system integrity;


• | control the monthly nominations on the receiving pipelines to prevent imbalances and penalties; and


• | track sales volumes and receipts closely to assure all production values are realized.

Seasonal Nature of Business
Seasonal weather conditions, severe weather events, and lease stipulations can limit our drilling and producing activities and other operations in some of our operating areas. These seasonal anomalies can pose challenges for meeting our well drilling objectives and increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel, which could lead to shortages and increased costs or delay our operations. Generally, but not always, oil is typically in higher demand in the late summer due to the summer driving season, which results in increased gasoline and diesel usage and natural gas is in higher demand in the winter for heating. Seasonal anomalies such as hot summers or mild winters, which are unpredictable, sometimes impact this fluctuation. In 
19

addition, certain natural gas consumers utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer. This can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations.

Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Matters
General.   Our business involving the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas properties is subject to extensive and stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection and the health and safety of employees. Our operations are subject to the same environmental, health and safety laws and regulations as other similarly situated companies in the oil and natural gas industry. These laws and regulations may:

• | require the acquisition of permits before commencing drilling or other regulated activities;


• | require the installation of expensive pollution control equipment and performance of costly remedial measures to mitigate or prevent pollution from historical and ongoing operations, such as pit closure and plugging of abandoned wells;


• | restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities;


• | limit or prohibit drilling activities on lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas;


• | impose specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection;


• | impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations; and


• | require preparation of a Resource Management Plan, an Environmental Assessment, and/or an Environmental Impact Statement for operations affecting federal lands or leases.

Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of significant sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of remedial obligations, and the issuance of orders enjoining some or all of our operations deemed in non-compliance. Moreover, these laws and regulations may restrict our ability to produce oil, natural gas and NGLs by, among other things, limiting production from our wells, limiting the number of wells we are allowed to drill or limiting the locations at which we may conduct our drilling operations. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business and consequently affects profitability. Additionally, changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly well drilling, construction, completion and water management activities, or waste handling, disposal and clean-up requirements for the oil and natural gas industry could have a significant impact on our operating costs. We believe that operation of our wells is in substantial compliance with all current applicable environmental laws and regulations and that our continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. However, we cannot provide any assurance that we will not incur substantial costs in the future related to revised or additional environmental regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we did not incur any material capital expenditures for performance of remediation or installation of pollution control equipment at any of our facilities; however, we did incur capital expenditures in the ordinary course of business to comply with pollution control requirements. As of the date of this Annual Report, we are not aware of any environmental issues or claims that will likely require material capital expenditures during 2019 or that will otherwise have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations.

The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and occupational health and safety laws to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our operations as well as the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry in general.

Waste Handling.  The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or “RCRA,” and comparable state laws, regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of “hazardous wastes” as well as the disposal of non-hazardous wastes. Under the auspices of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or the “U.S. EPA,” individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent state requirements. Drilling fluids, produced waters, and many other wastes associated with the exploitation, development, and production of crude oil, natural gas, or geothermal energy are currently regulated under RCRA’s less stringent non-hazardous waste provisions. However, the U.S. EPA has assessed whether to amend the existing RCRA regulations to re-classify certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes as hazardous wastes. Any such change could increase our costs to manage and dispose of such generated wastes, 
20

which cost increase could be significant. In the course of our operations, we generate some amounts of ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents and waste oils that may be regulated as RCRA hazardous wastes.

 Hazardous Substance Releases.   The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, also known as “CERCLA,” or “Superfund,” and analogous state laws, impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and companies that transported or disposed or arranged for the transportation or disposal of the hazardous substance found at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. While materials are generated in the course of operation of our wells that may be regulated as hazardous substances, we have not received any pending notifications that we may be potentially responsible for cleanup costs under CERCLA.

We currently own, lease, or have a non-operating interest in numerous properties that have been used for oil and natural gas production for many years. Although we believe that operating and waste disposal practices used on these properties in the past were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes, or petroleum hydrocarbons may have been released on or under the properties owned or leased by us, or on or under other locations, including off-site locations, where these substances, wastes and hydrocarbons have been taken for treatment or disposal. In addition, some of these properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons was not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes, remediate contaminated property, or perform remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination.
As of December 31, 2018, we have recorded $4.5 million for future remedial costs and abandonment liability for decommissioning the Big Escambia Creek, Elk Basin, and Fairway natural gas processing plants.

• | Our Elk Basin assets include a natural gas processing plant. Previous environmental investigations identified historical soil and groundwater contamination by hydrocarbons and the presence of asbestos-containing material at the site. The extent of the hydrocarbon contamination is not known and, therefore, the potential liability for remediating this contamination may be significant. In the event we cease operating the gas plant, the cost of decommissioning it and addressing the previously identified environmental conditions and other conditions, such as waste disposal, could be significant. We do not anticipate ceasing operations at the Elk Basin natural gas processing plant in the near future nor a need to commence remedial activities at this time. However, a regulatory agency could require us to investigate and remediate any hydrocarbon contamination even while the gas plant remains in operation.


• | In addition, we own and operate the Fairway natural gas processing plant in the Gulf Coast Basin, for which we have reserved abandonment costs.


• | We continue to operate a groundwater remediation project at our Big Escambia Creek gas plant. This release occurred when a prior owner operated the Big Escambia Creek gas plant. We operate our pump and treat system to treat groundwater under the supervision of the Alabama Department of Environmental Management. 

Our estimates of the future remediation cost are subject to change, and the actual cost of these items could vary significantly from the above estimates. Due to the significant uncertainty associated with the known environmental liabilities at the gas plants, our estimate of the future abandonment liability includes a reserve.
Pipeline Safety.  The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) regulates safety of oil and natural gas pipelines, including, with some specific exceptions, oil and natural gas gathering lines. From time to time, PHMSA, state agencies, the courts, or Congress may make determinations that affect PHMSA’s regulations or their applicability to the Company’s pipelines. These determinations may affect the costs the Company incurs in complying with applicable safety regulations.
Water Discharges.  The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, or “Clean Water Act,” and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls on the discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other oil and natural gas wastes, into state waters as well as waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by U.S. EPA or the relevant state with delegated authority. The Clean 
21

Water Act also prohibits the discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. The EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released a rule to revise the definition of “waters of the United States,” or WOTUS, for all Clean Water Act programs, which went into effect in August 2015. The EPA has instituted rulemakings to both delay the effective date of this rule and repeal the rule. Federal district court decisions have preserved the stay in a majority of states, which remain subject to pre-2015 regulated waters regulations, whereas the stay has been enjoined in a minority of states. Litigation surrounding this rule is ongoing. More recently, on December 11, 2018, the EPA and the Corps released a proposal to revise the 2015 Clean Water Rule so as to narrow the regulatory definition of waters of the United States; the revised rule has not yet been finalized. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure, or “SPCC,” requirements of federal laws require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters by an oil spill or release. If an oil spill or release were to occur as a result of our operations, we expect that it would be contained and remediated in accordance with our SPCC plan together with the assistance of trained first responders and any oil spill response contractor that we may have engaged to address such spills and releases. The Clean Water Act and analogous state laws can impose substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance including spills and other non-authorized discharges.
Fluids associated with oil and natural gas production, consisting primarily of salt water, are disposed by injection in below ground disposal wells. These disposal wells are regulated pursuant to the Underground Injection Control, or UIC, program established under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, or SDWA, and analogous state laws. The UIC program requires permits from U.S. EPA or an analogous state agency for the construction and operation of disposal wells, establishes minimum standards for disposal well operations, and restricts the types and quantities of fluids that may be disposed. While we believe that our disposal well operations substantially comply with requirements under the UIC program, a change in disposal well regulations or the inability to obtain permits for new disposal wells in the future may affect our ability to dispose of salt water and ultimately increase the cost of our operations. For example, there exists a growing concern that the injection of saltwater and other fluids into below ground disposal wells triggers seismic activity in certain areas, including Texas, where we operate. In response to these concerns, in October 2014, the Texas Railroad Commission, or TRC, published a final rule governing permitting or re-permitting of disposal wells that would require, among other things, the submission of information on seismic events occurring within a specified radius of the disposal well location, as well as logs, geologic cross sections and structure maps relating to the disposal area in question. If the permittee or an applicant of a disposal well permit fails to demonstrate that the injected fluids are confined to the disposal zone or if scientific data indicates such a disposal well is likely to be or determined to be contributing to seismic activity, then the TRC may deny, modify, suspend or terminate the permit application or existing operating permit for that well. These seismic permitting requirements applicable to disposal wells impose more stringent permitting requirements and likely to result in added costs to comply or, perhaps, may require alternative methods of disposing of salt water and other fluids, which could delay production schedules and also result in increased costs.
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended, or “OPA,” amends the Clean Water Act and sets minimum standards for prevention, containment and cleanup of oil spills. OPA applies to vessels, offshore facilities, and onshore facilities, including exploration and production facilities that are the site of a release of oil into waters of the United States. Under OPA, responsible parties, including owners and operators of onshore facilities, may be held strictly liable for oil cleanup costs and natural resource damages as well as a variety of public and private damages that may result from oil spills. 
Hydraulic Fracturing.  Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand, and chemicals under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We commonly use hydraulic fracturing as part of our operations. 
While hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, and other similar state agencies, increased federal interest has arisen in recent years. From time to time Congress has considered adopting legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. Although the U.S. EPA and the federal Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) have taken several steps to federalize regulation of hydraulic fracturing, more recently under the current Administration, the U.S. EPA and BLM have limited such steps. For example, the U.S. EPA issued Clean Air Act rules governing performance standards, including standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing, but the effective date of which was delayed and a proposed rule to reconsider was issued in September 2018. In June 2016, U.S. EPA issued final rules establishing effluent limit guidelines that wastewater from shale gas extraction operations must meet before discharging to a treatment plant, although the effective date of which has also recently been delayed and the rule is subject to legal challenge. Separately, in March 2015, BLM issued a final rule that imposes requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities on federal and Indian lands, including new requirements relating to public disclosure, wellbore integrity and handling of flowback water. BLM rescinded this rule in December 2017. In January 24, 2018, California and a coalition of 
22

environmental groups each filed lawsuits in the Northern District of California to challenge BLM’s rescission of the 2015 rule. This litigation is pending.
Some states in which the Company operates, including Montana, Texas and Wyoming, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure, or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. States could elect to prohibit hydraulic fracturing altogether, as the State of New York announced in December 2014 with regard to fracturing activities in New York. Also, local government may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. We believe that we follow applicable standard industry practices and legal requirements for groundwater protection in our hydraulic fracturing activities. Nonetheless, if new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.

To our knowledge, there have been no citations, suits, or contamination of potable drinking water arising from our fracturing operations. We do not have insurance policies in effect that are intended to provide coverage for losses solely related to hydraulic fracturing operations; however, we believe our general liability and excess liability and control of well insurance policies would cover third-party claims related to hydraulic fracturing operations and associated legal expenses in accordance with, and subject to, the terms of such policies.
Air Emissions.   The Clean Air Act, as amended, and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from sources through air emissions permitting programs and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws and their implementing regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to result in the emission of new or increased existing air pollutants, obtain and strictly comply with air permit requirements containing various emissions and operational limitations, or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants. The need to obtain permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. To date, we believe that no significant difficulties have been encountered in obtaining air permits. Oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for emissions of pollutants. For example, in October 2015, U.S. EPA issued a final rule that strengthened the National Ambient Air Quality Standard, or “NAAQS,” for ozone from 75 parts per billion, or “ppb,” to 70 ppb for both the 8-hour primary and secondary standards. The U.S. EPA finalized revising the designation of attainment and non-attainment air quality control regions based on the new ozone standard. If regions reclassified as non-attainment under the lower ozone standard begin implementing new, more stringent regulations, those regulations could apply to our or our customers’ operations. Generally, it will take the states several years to develop compliance plans for their non-attainment areas. Compliance with this or other new regulations could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of our equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase our capital expenditures and operating costs, which could adversely impact our business.
Activities on Federal Lands.  Oil and natural gas exploitation and production activities on federal lands are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, as amended, or “NEPA.” NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of Interior, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will typically prepare an Environmental Assessment to assess the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement that may be made available for public review and comment. Our current production activities, as well as proposed development plans, on federal lands require governmental permits or similar authorizations that are subject to the requirements of NEPA. This process has the potential to delay, limit or increase the cost of developing oil and natural gas projects. Authorizations under NEPA are also subject to protest, appeal or litigation, any or all of which may delay, limit, or halt projects.
Climate Change.  In response to findings made by U.S. EPA that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases, or “GHGs,” present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gasses are contributing to the warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes, U.S. EPA has adopted regulations under the Clean Air Act that establish Title V operation and Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or “PSD,” construction permitting reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that already are potential major sources of certain principal, or criteria, pollutant emissions. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet “best available control technology” standards, which typically will be established by the states. These U.S. EPA rulemakings could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified facilities. In addition, U.S. EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from certain sources including, among others, onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities in the United States on an annual basis, which include certain of our operations. We are conducting monitoring of GHG emissions from our operations in accordance with the 
23

GHG emissions reporting rule and we believe that our monitoring and reporting activities are in substantial compliance with applicable reporting obligations. In October 2015, the EPA finalized the Clean Power Plan, which imposes additional obligations on the power generation sector to reduce GHG emissions. However, on February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed implementation of the Clean Power Plan pending resolution of legal challenges to the rule, and in October 2017 the EPA proposed to repeal the rule before proposing a replacement rule, the Affordable Clean Energy Rule, which would scale back the obligations of the Clean Power Plan. 
While from time to time Congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce GHG emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of GHG emissions to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. Internationally, in 2015, the United States participated in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement, which was signed by the United States in April 2016, requires countries to review and “represent a progression” in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set greenhouse gas emission reduction goals, every five years beginning in 2020. In June 2017, the Trump administration announced its intention for the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Paris Agreement, the earliest date the United States can withdraw is November 2020. The adoption of any legislation or regulations that requires reporting of GHGs or otherwise restricts emissions of GHGs from our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations or could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce. For example, on June 3, 2016, U.S. EPA published a Methane Rule aimed at reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by up to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025. However, on June 16, 2017, U.S. EPA proposed to delay the Methane Rule’s effectiveness for two years from the final rule’s publication. In September 2018, the U.S. EPA issued a proposed rule that would reconsider limits on methane emissions set by the June 2016 standards and reduce inspection and repair requirements.
Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our operations. 
Endangered Species Act Considerations.  Various federal and state statutes prohibit certain actions that adversely affect endangered or threatened species and their habitats, wetlands and natural resources. These statutes include the Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) and the Clean Water Act. 
If endangered or threatened species are located in areas of the underlying properties where we wish to conduct seismic surveys, development activities or abandonment operations, such work could be prohibited or delayed or expensive mitigation may be required. If we were to cause harm to species or damages to wetlands, habitat or natural resources as a result of our operations, government entities or, at times, private parties could seek to prevent oil and gas exploration or development activities or seek damages for harm to species, habitat or natural resources resulting from drilling or construction or releases of oil, wastes, hazardous substances or other regulated materials, and, in some cases, the government could seek criminal penalties. The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where underlying property operations are conducted could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce reserves. 
While some of our facilities or leased acreage may be located in areas that are designated as habitat for endangered or threatened species, we believe our operations are in substantial compliance with the ESA.
Occupational Safety and Health.  We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, or “OSHA,” and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, U.S. EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA and similar state statutes require that we maintain and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and citizens. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety.

Other Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry
The oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal, state and local authorities. Legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden. Also, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue rules, 
24

orders and regulations binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. For example, on July 1, 2014, the North Dakota Industrial Commission adopted Order No. 24665, or the “July 2014 Order,” pursuant to which the agency adopted legally enforceable “gas capture percentage goals” targeting the capture of 74% of natural gas produced in the State by October 1, 2014, 77% percent of such gas by January 1, 2015, 85% of such gas by January 1, 2016 and 90% of such gas by October 1, 2020. The July 2014 Order establishes an enforcement mechanism for policy recommendations that were previously adopted by the North Dakota Industrial Commission in March 2014. Those recommendations required all exploration and production operators applying for new drilling permits in the state after June 1, 2014 to develop Gas Capture Plans that provide measures for reducing the amount of natural gas flared by those operators so as to be consistent with the agency’s now-implemented gas capture percentage goals. In particular, the July 2014 Order provides that after an initial 90-day period, wells must meet or exceed the North Dakota Industrial Commission’s gas capture percentage goals on a per-well, per-field, county, or statewide basis. Failure to comply with the gas capture percentage goals will result in an operator having to restrict its production to 200 barrels of oil per day if at least 60% of the monthly volume of associated natural gas produced from the well is captured, or 100 barrels of oil per day if less than 60% of such monthly volume of natural gas is captured. While we believe that we were in compliance with these requirements as of December 31, 2018 and expect to remain in compliance in the future, there is no assurance that we will be able to remain in compliance in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operational results. Although the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and, consequently, affects our profitability, these burdens generally do not affect us any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the industry with similar types, quantities and locations of production.

Drilling and Production.   Our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. These types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. Most states, and some counties and municipalities, in which we operate also regulate one or more of the following:


• | the location of wells;


• | the method of drilling and casing wells;


• | the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled;


• | the plugging and abandoning of wells; and


• | notice to surface owners and other third parties.

State laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and natural gas properties. Some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploitation while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In some instances, forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce our interest in the unitized properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production. These laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs we can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs within its jurisdiction.

Regulation of Transportation and Sales.   The availability, terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of oil, natural gas and NGLs. The interstate transportation of natural gas is subject to federal regulation primarily by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or “FERC,” under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, or “NGA.”  FERC regulates interstate natural gas pipeline transportation rates and service conditions, which may affect the marketing and sales of natural gas.  FERC requires interstate pipelines to offer available firm transportation capacity on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis to all natural gas shippers.  FERC frequently reviews and modifies its regulations regarding the transportation of natural gas with the stated goal of fostering competition within all phases of the natural gas industry.  State laws and regulations generally govern the gathering and intrastate transportation of natural gas. Natural gas gathering systems in the states in which we operate are generally required to offer services on a non-discriminatory basis and are subject to state ratable take and common purchaser statutes.  Ratable take statutes generally require gatherers to take, without undue discrimination, natural gas production that may be tendered to the gatherer for handling.  Similarly, common purchaser statutes generally require gatherers to purchase without discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer or one source of supply over another source of supply.
The ability to transport oil and NGLs is generally dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to FERC jurisdiction under the Interstate Commerce Act, or subject to regulation by the particular state in which such 
25

transportation takes place.  Laws and regulation applicable to pipeline transportation of oil largely require pipelines to charge just and reasonable rates published in agency-approved tariffs and require pipelines to provide non-discriminatory access and terms and conditions of service. The justness and reasonableness of interstate oil and natural gas liquid pipeline rates can be challenged at FERC through a protest or a complaint and, if such a protest or complaint results in a lower rate than that on file, pipeline shippers may be eligible to receive refunds or, in the case of a complaining shipper, reparations for the two-year period prior to the filing of the complaint. Certain regulations imposed by FERC, by the United States Department of Transportation and by other regulatory authorities on pipeline transporters in recent years could result in an increase in the cost of pipeline transportation service.  We do not believe, however, that these regulations affect us any differently than other producers.
Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, or “EPAct 2005,” Congress made it unlawful for any entity, as defined in the EPAct 2005, including otherwise non-jurisdictional producers such as us, to use any deceptive or manipulative device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services regulated by the FERC that violates the FERC’s rules. FERC’s rules implementing EPAct 2005 make it unlawful for any entity, directly or indirectly, to use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC. EPAct 2005 also gives the FERC authority to impose civil penalties for violations of the NGA and the Natural Gas Policy Act up to $1,000,000 per day per violation. Pursuant to authority granted to FERC by EPAct 2005, FERC has also put in place additional regulations intended to prevent market manipulation and to promote price transparency.  For example, FERC has imposed rules discussed below requiring wholesale purchasers and sellers of natural gas to report to FERC certain aggregated volume and other purchase and sales data for the previous calendar year. While EPAct 2005 reflects a significant expansion of the FERC’s enforcement authority, we do not anticipate that we will be affected by EPAct 2005 any differently than energy industry participants.
In 2007, FERC issued a final rule on the annual natural gas transaction reporting requirements, as amended by subsequent orders on rehearing (“Order 704”). Under Order 704, wholesale buyers and sellers of more than 2.2 million MMBtu of physical natural gas in the previous calendar year, including interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines, natural gas gatherers, natural gas processors and natural gas marketers are now required to report on Form No. 552, on May 1 of each year, aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to, or may contribute to the formation of price indices. It is the responsibility of the reporting entity to determine which individual transactions should be reported based on the guidance of Order 704. Pursuant to Order 704, we may be required to annually report to FERC, starting May 1 of each year, information regarding natural gas purchase and sale transactions depending on the volume of natural gas transacted during the prior calendar year. In recent years, FERC has also issued rules prohibiting anticompetitive behavior by multiple affiliates of the same entity in the natural gas capacity release market, issued a policy statement providing natural gas pipelines a cost-recovery mechanism to recoup capital expenditures made to modernize pipeline infrastructure, and issued a rule adopting reforms to its scheduling rules to improve coordination between the natural gas and electric markets.
On August 6, 2009, the Federal Trade Commission, or “FTC,” issued a Final Rule prohibiting manipulative and deceptive conduct in the wholesale petroleum markets. The Final Rule applies to transactions in crude oil, gasoline, and petroleum distillates. The FTC promulgated the Final Rule pursuant to Section 811 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, or “EISA,” which makes it unlawful for anyone, in connection with the wholesale purchase or sale of crude oil, gasoline or petroleum distillates, to use any “manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance, in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Federal Trade Commission may prescribe.” The Final Rule prohibits any person, directly or indirectly, in connection with the purchase or sale of crude oil, gasoline or petroleum distillates at wholesale, from: (a) knowingly engaging in any act, practice, or course of business – including making any untrue statement of material fact that operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person; or (b) intentionally failing to state a material fact that under the circumstances renders a statement made by such person misleading, provided that such omission distorts or is likely to distort market conditions for any such product.
Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before Congress, FERC and the courts. We cannot predict the ultimate impact of these or the above regulatory changes to our natural gas operations. We do not believe that we would be affected by any such FERC action materially differently than other natural gas companies with whom we compete.
The price at which we buy and sell natural gas is currently not subject to federal rate regulation and, for the most part, is not subject to state regulation. Sales of condensate and NGLs are not currently regulated and are made at market prices. However, with regard to our physical purchases and sales of these energy commodities, and any related hedging activities that we undertake, we are required to observe anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by FERC and/or the 
26

Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or “CFTC.” Should we violate the anti-market manipulation laws and regulations, we could also be subject to related third-party damage claims by, among others, market participants, sellers, royalty owners and taxing authorities. 
Although natural gas and oil prices are currently unregulated, Congress historically has been active in the area of natural gas regulation. We cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate natural gas might be proposed, what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures, and what effect, if any, the proposals might have on the operations of the underlying properties.
State Regulation.  The various states regulate the drilling for, and the production, gathering and sale of, oil, natural gas and NGLs, including imposing severance and other production-related taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits. Reduced rates or credits may apply to certain types of wells and production methods. 
States also regulate the method of developing new fields, the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of natural gas resources. States may regulate rates of production and may establish maximum daily production allowables from oil and natural gas wells based on market demand or resource conservation, or both. States do not currently regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation, but there can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future. The effect of these regulations may be to limit the amounts of oil, natural gas and NGLs that may be produced from our wells, to increase our cost of production, to limit the number of wells or locations we can drill and to limit the availability of pipeline capacity to bring our products to market.
In addition to production taxes, Texas, Oklahoma and Montana each impose ad valorem taxes on oil and natural gas properties and production equipment. Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico impose an ad valorem tax on the gross value of oil and natural gas production in lieu of an ad valorem tax on the underlying oil and natural gas properties. Wyoming also imposes an ad valorem tax on production equipment.
The petroleum industry participants are also subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws. Some of these regulations and those laws relate to occupational safety, resource conservation and equal employment opportunity. We do not believe that compliance with these regulations and laws will have a material adverse effect upon the unitholders.
Federal, State or Native American Leases.  Our operations on federal, state, or Native American oil and natural gas leases are subject to numerous restrictions, including nondiscrimination statutes. Such operations must be conducted pursuant to certain on-site security regulations and other permits and authorizations issued by the BLM and other agencies. 
Operating Hazards and Insurance
The oil and natural gas business involves a variety of operating risks, including fires, explosions, blowouts, environmental hazards and other potential events that can adversely affect our ability to conduct operations and cause us to incur substantial losses. Such losses could reduce or eliminate the funds available for exploration, exploitation or leasehold acquisitions or result in loss of properties.
In accordance with industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, potential risks and losses. VNR carries business interruption insurance for the Big Escambia Creek, Flomaton, Fairway James, Elk Basin and XTO Cotton Valley processing facilities. VNR also carries contingent business interruption coverage to protect against upstream shut-ins of our Pinedale, Piceance, Permian, Haynesville, and Wind River productions. We insure any cumulative value of owned property over a certain threshold, and carry control of well and pollution coverage for all VNR wells (including new drills and workovers), and re-drill coverage for those that are economically viable. We may not obtain insurance for certain risks if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable at a reasonable cost.  If a significant accident or other event occurs that is not fully covered by insurance, it could adversely affect us.
Employees
As of April 8, 2019, we had 290 full-time employees. We also contract for the services of independent consultants involved in land, regulatory, tax, accounting, financial and other disciplines as needed. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.
