Item 1. Business
Overview
​
Skillsoft is a global leader in corporate digital learning, serving more than 75% of the Fortune 1000, customers in over 160 countries, and a community of learners of more than 90 million globally. Skillsoft’s primary learning solutions include: (i) Percipio, an intelligent and immersive digital learning platform; (ii) Global Knowledge, a global provider of authorized information technology & development training and professional skills; (iii) Codecademy, an online learning platform for technical skills that uses an innovative, scalable approach to online coding education; (iv) Pluma, which offers individualized coaching through a digital platform that provides executive-quality coaching that is personal yet scalable; and (v) SumTotal, a SaaS-based Human Capital Management (“HCM”) solution with a leading Talent Development platform.
​
The Company provides enterprise learning solutions designed to prepare organizations for the future of work, enable them to overcome critical skill gaps, drive demonstrable behavior-change, and unlock the potential in one of their most important assets: their people. The Company’s award-winning, AI-driven, immersive learning platform, Percipio, is purpose built to make learning easier, more accessible, and more effective. Percipio is an open, modern and extensible platform designed to meet all of the needs of the enterprise customer. Skillsoft offers a comprehensive suite of premium, original, and authorized partner content, including one of the broadest and deepest libraries of leadership & business, technology & developer, and compliance curricula. With access to a broad spectrum of learning options (including video, audio, books, bootcamps, live events, practice labs and individualized coaching), organizations can meaningfully increase learner engagement and retention. In addition, we believe our recent acquisition of Codecademy will further strengthen our content library, enhance the Percipio platform, broaden our customer reach and create significant cross selling opportunities, positioning us for faster growth.
​
The corporate digital learning industry is rapidly growing, driven by significant tailwinds as organizations focus on upskilling, reskilling, and future-proofing their workforces and the accelerated shift from in-person training to digital training due, in part, to the significant and likely permanent shift to largely remote and distributed workforces triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic and increased emphasis on talent driven by the “great resignation.” The war for talent, labor shortages, wage inflation, hybrid work, early retirements, and burnout among those who stay behind all contribute to this growing demand. According to McKinsey, 87% of companies worldwide either currently have skills gaps or believe they will within the next few years, and core skills are changing at an unprecedented pace. In a recent survey conducted by Deloitte, the vast majority of CEO’s cited labor and skills shortages as the number one threat to their business in the coming year – ahead of the pandemic, supply chain disruption, inflation and market instability, cybersecurity, and political instability. According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, technology will radically transform 1.1 billion jobs by 2030. CEOs, Chief People Officers, and the companies they and their teams lead need to transform their current workforce into one adapted for tomorrow’s demands. We believe these factors present a significant market opportunity for our solutions.
​
​
Our Industry
The corporate learning and human capital management markets are large, growing, and fragmented.
The global corporate learning market is large and growing. We estimate the market size of the global professional learning industry to be approximately $300 billion. We estimate that the total addressable market for global professional digital learning — the segment served by Skillsoft — was approximately $28 billion in 2021, with many favorable characteristics:

● | The global professional digital learning market is anticipated to grow at approximately a 10% compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) through 2025, similar to recent years, providing a strong foundation for organic growth;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ​While the market is competitive, it remains highly fragmented and includes pure-play training companies, in-house training teams, direct-to-consumer technology providers and integrators, business consulting firms, and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

numerous free and fee-based online providers. The market lacks a single dominant player serving all customer market segments;
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ​We hold a strong competitive position in the market, reinforced through the acquisition of Global Knowledge. The majority of our competitors are smaller, consumer-focused content providers that lack our revenue, depth of content, and the platform capabilities offered by Percipio. This dynamic offers both a favorable competitive environment and an opportunity for expansion via inorganic growth; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ​Through our traditional offering and through the acquisition of Global Knowledge, we have a history of longevity, establishing long-term relationships with Fortune 500 and other customers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
HCM applications and services, an approximately $17.6 billion global market, help organizations manage and maintain their workforce via efficient management, performance management, compensation management and succession planning. Learning Management Systems (“LMS”), SumTotal’s core market, is a critical component of the HCM space, representing approximately 17% of the overall size, based on our estimates. Both the HCM and LMS markets exhibit favorable characteristics:

● | We expect the global HCM market to grow at an approximately 7% CAGR in the near future due to the increased demand in automated recruiting processes and centralized administration of digital human resources activities.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We expect the corporate LMS market to grow at approximately a 5% CAGR in the near future, consistent with recent years. As digital learning continues to play a larger role in corporate talent development initiatives, LMS are consistently tasked with providing more robust analytics and managing workflow and content delivery needs, particularly in large global enterprises.

​
Corporate learning is increasingly important to rapidly innovating industries.
Industries around the world are increasingly moving towards new business models oriented around big data, cloud, cybersecurity, mobility, and digital commerce, creating demand for new job roles and associated certifications. This rapid innovation requires professionals to enhance their skills to remain current on technologies. These shifts have increased the value of corporate training and staff development for multinational corporations in a highly competitive marketplace, further amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. In connection with this, businesses are also facing increased expectations that ongoing training and skills development programs will be available as a fundamental employee benefit and hence critical to employee retention.
​
The corporate training market transformation, from in-person training to digital learning, is accelerating.
While there is a role for in-person training, we have been observing a long-term market transformation from in-person training to digital learning platforms. Employers are increasingly spending corporate training budgets on digital learning, which can provide a more cost-effective, flexible, and comprehensive solution as compared to legacy in-person training formats. We have also observed factors that may contribute to the acceleration of digital learning adoption, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which has given rise to hybrid and remote work, resulted in restrictions on travel and in-person meetings, and increased reliance on digital tools for connection and collaboration. More significantly, technological advancements over the past decade, including mobile technology, video on demand, micro-learning, and artificial intelligence have significantly increased digital adoption, learner engagement, and efficacy of digital learning.
​
Modern learners expect a more personalized learning experience.
While learners in the past have generally focused on content quality, expectations related to content delivery and the learning environment are increasing. Today’s learners are often looking for a more personalized learning journey, with an ability to choose where, when, and how to learn. This has led to the rise of cloud-based, multi-modal offerings such as ebooks, audiobooks, videos, and courses, which can be consumed on smart devices. Furthermore, employees view training platforms not only as a means of honing existing skills needed today, but also as opportunities to learn new skills needed for tomorrow.
​
Professionals believe that additional training is critical to remain competent and prepare for the jobs of tomorrow.

The increasingly technical nature of today’s job requirements and rapid pace of digital transformation are contributing to a growing need for continuous training. 
​
Our Offerings
We operate in three segments, Content, Global Knowledge, and SumTotal.
​
Content
​
Skillsoft Percipio, our advanced, award-winning, and highly engaging intelligent learning experience platform.
Skillsoft Percipio provides AI-driven personalization and content recommendations for each learner to enhance their connection with the content and improve their level of engagement. In addition, Percipio’s data tracking capabilities support the platform’s ability to inform best practices for our customers and deliver insights for product enhancement. We believe our findings have validated that user engagement drives customer retention. Select platform capabilities include:

● | Open Platform: Business administrators can upload their own proprietary content alongside Skillsoft original content and other third-party learning assets into channels that are unique for their business. Learners then access content via search, assignments, and recommendations within the platform. In addition, Percipio has the functionality to consolidate and deliver content from other providers, and we partner with numerous content developers to enhance our course offerings.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ​Custom Channels and Journeys: Percipio combines content from various sources into learning journeys. We offer more than 700 skill-based learning paths on a wide range of topics. Additionally, for learners focused on career aspirations, we offer nearly 100 Aspire Journeys, which are offerings that deliver curated learning paths for specific competencies that can also include live instruction capabilities, offering a unique blended learning experience.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ​Administrator-Promoted Content and Flexible Assignments: Employers can facilitate the assignment of online training with one-time-only or recurring options. Assignments can be set to recur by last completion date or due date, with intervals determined by the administrator.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ​Powerful Tracking and In-Depth Reporting: Employers can utilize comprehensive filtering, data export options, and individual and group reporting to view status and training progress. Administrators can also create and save customized reports and configure automatic emails, with training results sent to line managers or supervisors to help drive training completions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ​Training Groups: Employers can assign training to individual users or defined user groups. Administrators can create user groups, or “audiences,” based on demographics such as job role, corporate division, or geographic location.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ​Records Management: Employers can track users’ access to and completion of assigned courses, while maintaining a complete training history for each user. Users and administrators can access a comprehensive view of an individual’s training history, including recurring assignments.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
The platform’s broad capabilities are complemented by the impact the platform has on the learner. The platform facilitates an efficient, learner-focused learning environment, supported by content discovery tools that allow the learner to identify content that fit best with their learning objectives and schedules. In addition, the platform’s interactive interface displays personalized activity feeds, showing recent activity and training assignments to ensure the learner is apprised of both developmental progress and expectations. Since the platform’s inception, we have deployed many value-additive features to further drive learner engagement, including AI-driven email campaigns as well as personalized mobile device notifications.
​
Percipio’s efficacy is supported by customer performance. As compared to customers on our legacy platform, Skillport, customers on Percipio have performed better since January 2020 across a variety of key performance indicators, such as number of active learners, learning hours per user, and number of content launches, among others. This has translated into improved renewal rates for Percipio as compared to our legacy Skillport platform.

​
In March 2022, Percipio received Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (“FedRAMP”) authorization. As a FedRAMP authorized product, Percipio will be added to the federal government’s online portal of approved cloud service offerings. In addition to benefitting government agencies seeking to address critical skills gaps, the FedRAMP comprehensive security authorization underscores the security of the Percipio platform.
​
Migrating customers from Skillport to Percipio is one of our key areas of focus and we anticipate completing the migration to Percipio during our fiscal year ended January 31, 2023. As of January 31, 2022, approximately 90% of the content segment annual recurring revenue base has contracted for Percipio. Our approach to the migration process has been both focused and customer-centric. To support Skillport customers as they migrate, we have entered into agreements to provide both continued access to that platform while offering new access to Percipio (“Dual Deployment”). 
​
Pluma
On June 30, 2021, we acquired Pluma, Inc. The acquisition enhances our leadership development portfolio product, adds a new modality to our blended learning model, and allows the Company to now offer a premium individualized experience that provides executive-quality coaching that is personal yet scalable.
​
Content Library
Our nearly 700 skill-based learning paths support today’s highly sought-after competencies in leadership and business skills, IT, software and application development, data science as well as workforce safety and compliance. Our robust content library of 200,000+ content assets, which include videos, digital books, book summaries, audiobooks, labs, job aids, and other learning resources is segmented into the following three customer markets: (i) Leadership and Business, (ii) Technology and Developer, and (iii) Compliance.
We actively invest in and refresh our content offerings, providing learners with access to the latest insights and knowledge to facilitate an engaging and effective learning environment; such investment ensures our products incorporate relevant, thought-leading content and helps us drive greater learner engagement and deliver measurable outcomes for the learner and for their companies. The key content verticals in our library include:

● | Leadership and Business: With approximately 2,500 courses across 40 subjects, our Leadership and Business training addresses the personal and business technical skills at the intersection of digital business strategy, leadership practice, and managerial effectiveness. Select offerings from our library include the Skillsoft Leadership Development Program (“SLDP”), which focuses on digital leader competencies, and our Leader camps a suite of live streaming events and virtual workshops that provide access to best-selling authors and thought leaders.

Our portfolio is comprehensive and flexible, offering micro-learning video courses, digital books, audiobooks, and virtual coding labs as well as more than 20,000 learner skills assessments. We further enhanced our capabilities in this area through the recent acquisition of Codecademy. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ​Compliance: With approximately 3,500 courses across 40 subjects, our Compliance offering supports over 500 critical risk topics to address an increasingly global workforce. We offer a catalogue of environmental health and safety and legal compliance courseware to suit organizations in a wide variety of industries, in particular, those with heavy regulatory burdens.

Global Knowledge
​

Through Global Knowledge we are able to further assist customers throughout their lifelong technology learning journey by offering relevant and up-to-date skills training through instructor-led (in-person “classroom” or online “virtual”) and self-paced (“on-demand”), vendor certified, and other proprietary offerings. Global Knowledge’s vendors include the world’s largest technology providers who partner with Global Knowledge to help develop the skills that drive consumption of their products in their customer accounts. In addition, certification authorities from around the globe trust Global Knowledge to equip organizations around the world with skills. In instances such as these, Global Knowledge’s partners’ growth and the adoption of their products are materially supported by having a skilled installed base of employees. Global Knowledge also offers a wide breadth of training topics and delivery modalities (classroom, virtual, on-demand) both on a subscription and transactional basis, driving customer retention and growth. We believe that Global Knowledge’s wide breadth of training topics and delivery modalities will assist us in expanding our product offering and will act as a key driver for existing customer retention and new business growth given customer demand for a fulsome multi-modal offering.
​
Global Knowledge’s focus is to offer key technology and business skills content with flexibility on format. This allows Global Knowledge to address multiple segments, from just-in-time on-demand content for individuals, to team-oriented online training, or alternatively, customized training programs that simulate both the individual and team in a client environment. Global Knowledge currently offers over 2,500 courses annually across a range of subject areas, including over 750 on-demand courses and over 2,000 instructor-led virtual courses. Through these courses, Global Knowledge provides training to over 210,000 corporate professionals across 25,000 sessions per annum with a blue-chip customer base.
​
We believe Global Knowledge’s ability to provide training for both authorized and other content across multiple modalities is superior compared to many of its peers and provides Global Knowledge a significant competitive advantage in the areas that it serves. In addition, Global Knowledge’s flexible delivery model provides superior learning retention, choice, and convenience for its customers and is a defining characteristic when customers select Global Knowledge’s product and services.

Our Strategy
Our vision is to be the most highly valued provider of learning solutions, preparing the workforce of today with the skills of tomorrow. When we say valuable, we mean to our customers, our leaners, our communities, our team members, and our shareholders. We believe we can achieve this vision by demonstrating leadership in the following areas:
​
Platform – Learners benefit from an open-source, immersive, AI-driven platform delivering seamless, engaging experiences.
​
Content – Our customers demand breadth and quality of content in the enterprise-critical segments of Leadership and Business, Technology and Developer, and Compliance. Our ability to offer content in each of these segments through a common platform is a key differentiator of our offerings that leads to higher retention rates.
​
Go-to-Market – Enterprise sales & marketing capabilities supported by a strong brand will ensure our industry-leading solutions are understood by our target audiences.
​
Key enablers for us to execute our strategy include the following:
​

● | Culture of Leadership and Learning – Central to our strategy is a high performing and inclusive organization and an environment where all team members are able to do their best work. We intend to transform the culture of Skillsoft into one built upon an inspiring purpose, vision and values. Our objective is to be recognized as a role model of learning and development powered by the use of our own products. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Operational Excellence – We will seek to reduce cost and enhance quality through a number of important initiatives intended to both support revenue growth and improve margins. With recent and future acquisitions, we intend to​ standardize, upgrade and integrate back-office systems and processes to realize efficiencies while also improving employee and customer experiences.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Disciplined M&A and Strategic Partnerships – We intend to grow our business through acquisitions and strategic partnerships that enhance our content offerings, add capability to our Percipio platform, and enable us to deliver more value to customers and expand into new vertical markets and geographies. Importantly, we believe our platform and our large sales force and customer base position us to effectively integrate acquisitions in a highly accretive fashion. In addition, the open architecture of Percipio allows us to quickly deploy content and technology solutions available from third-parties that are complimentary to our propriety offerings, which is attractive to potential third-party partners who wish to access our strong base of enterprise customers, allowing us to improve the value proposition to our customers while participating in incremental revenue opportunities.

​
Our Human Capital 
We believe we have assembled a word-class management team that will differentiate us from our competitors and guide Skillsoft through its next phase of growth. Our leadership team is led by CEO Jeffrey Tarr. Mr. Tarr is an experienced public company CEO with a track record of transforming tech-enabled content companies into industry leaders and creating value for shareowners. In addition to Mr. Tarr, we are led by an executive team with deep and highly relevant expertise at companies such as SAP, IBM, Dell, and IHS Markit among others.
​
As of January 31, 2022, we had 2,943 regular, full-time employees. Global Knowledge also deploys a network of over 600 instructors, of which approximately 100 are in-house employees, most of which have been training students with Global Knowledge over 15 years. Those investments are focused on talent transformation and optimization through strategic and inclusive talent acquisition, talent development, and cultural enablement. To identify and attract top talent and motivate and retain our people, we continue to evolve our human capital systems, processes, and programs. Our organization’s objectives include identifying and attracting top talent to fill open positions and incentivizing, developing,

and retaining our people. Further, recent diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives designed to support systemic, programmatic, and sustainable change have also been introduced.
​
Our Customers
As a leading provider in the corporate digital learning business, we serve more than 75% of the Fortune 1000, customers in over 160 countries, and a community of learners of more than 90 million globally. We partner with more than 12,000 corporate customers and help them achieve their learning and development needs.

No single customer represented more than 2% of revenue for the year ended January 31, 2022.
​
Our Competition
​
The corporate digital learning market is large and fragmented. Many of our peers are much smaller than us and do not have the long history we have of serving our customers. The market is highly competitive and we expect the market to remain competitive in the future due to its highly attractive qualities such as: (i) continued demand for high quality, deep, and broad digital content solutions, (ii) the market’s whitespace opportunity, which we believe is material given the estimated size of the total addressable market and the size of our peers, and (iii) the increased importance of digital learning, in part due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has accelerated the need for enterprises to adopt digital training solutions. Our direct and indirect competitors include, among others:

● | Within our Leadership and Business customer market, vendors such as LinkedIn Learning, CrossKnowledge, and Harvard ManageMentor, as well as OpenSesame;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ​Within our Technology and Developer customer market, vendors such as Pluralsight and Udemy, as well as Safari (O’Reilly), Coursera, and Udacity; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ​Within our Compliance customer market, vendors such as Navex Global as well as LRN, SAI Global, J.J. Keller, and UL-PURESafety.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
The market for talent management software is competitive, comprised of leading enterprise players and smaller peers. This market faces evolving customer needs and frequent disruptions driven by new technologies, products, and services. Our sales opportunities are competitive and often involve requests for proposals. SumTotal’s direct and indirect competitors include, among others:

● | LMS vendors, including Cornerstone OnDemand and Workday; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | Other competitors including ADP, Docebo, Kronos, Oracle, and SAP SuccessFactors.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
​
Our Intellectual Property
​
Our success is contingent upon the protection of our rights in intellectual property. We rely upon a combination of copyright and trademark laws as well as license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, and employee invention assignment agreements to protect our proprietary rights. In certain cases, we have also entered into, and will continue to enter into, confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties to protect the distribution of confidential information. We believe our intellectual property rights are a crucial component of our business. 
​
As of January 31, 2022, we did not have any patents and pending patent applications in the United States or abroad. We have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names and product names, taglines, and logos in the United States and other countries to the extent we deem appropriate. We also have common law rights in some unregistered trademarks that were established over years of use.

​
​
Seasonality
Our business is subject to significant seasonality in bookings and billings, with the fourth quarter representing about 40% of annual volume. Our Content business experiences the most seasonality, with the fourth quarter representing about 50% of annual volume. We generally recognize revenue from subscription fees ratably over the term of the contract; thus, while our billings are seasonal, revenue recognition is not subject to significant seasonality. However, accounts receivable and deferred revenue balances as well as cash flow are impacted significantly by our seasonality.
​
​
Recent Developments
On December 22, 2021, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Codecademy (the “Codecademy Merger”), a leading online learning platform for technical skills. Codecademy is an innovative and popular learning platform providing high-demand technical skills to approximately 40 million registered learners in nearly every country worldwide. The platform offers interactive, self-paced courses and hands-on learning in 14 programming languages across multiple domains such as application development, data science, cloud and cybersecurity. We believe the Codecademy acquisition will further enhance our Technology and Developer offerings and differentiate us from our competitors. The Codecademy Merger closed on April 4, 2022 for total consideration of approximately $390.3 million, consisting of the issuance of 30,374,427 million common shares and a cash payment of $207.6 million. The cash portion of the consideration was funded through the combination of the issuance of $160.0 million of term loans under our existing term loan facility and cash on hand.
