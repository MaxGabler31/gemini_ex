ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS. 
 
DH Enchantment, Inc. (f/k/a Energy Management International Inc.) is a Nevada holding company with no operations of its own. DH Enchantment, Inc. conducts its operations through its Hong Kong subsidiary, Ho Shun Yi Limited (“HSY”). HSY was organized as a private limited liability company on December 5, 2019, in Hong Kong and is a wholly owned subsidiary of DH Investment Group Limited (“DHIG”). We acquired DHIG on July 26, 2021. HSY is engaged primarily in the sale and distribution of COVID-19 rapid antigen tester sets produced by third parties. HSY commenced operations in Hong Kong in October 2020 and sell its products primarily in Hong Kong.
 
Our investors will hold common stock of DH Enchantment, Inc., the Nevada holding company that has no operations of its own, and not in HSY, the Hong Kong operating company. This holding company structure presents unique risks as our investors may never directly hold equity interests in our Hong Kong subsidiary. Holding indirect equity interests in HSY, our Hong Kong subsidiary, is not as effective as holding a direct ownership interest as DH Enchantment, Inc. will be dependent upon contributions from our subsidiaries to finance the cash flow needs of DH Enchantment, Inc. DH Enchantment, Inc.’s ability to obtain contributions from its subsidiaries are significantly affected by regulations promulgated by Hong Kong authorities. Any limitation on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer cash or assets to us could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct business. As a result, any change in the interpretation of existing rules and regulations or the promulgation of new rules and regulations that adversely affects our ability to transfer cash or assets may adversely affect our operations and or the value of our securities, including causing the value of our securities to significantly decline or become worthless. For a detailed description of the risks facing the Company associated with our structure, please refer to “Risk Factors- Our Hong Kong subsidiary may be subject to restrictions on paying dividends or making other payments to us, which may restrict its ability to satisfy liquidity requirements, conduct business and pay dividends to holders of DH Enchantment, Inc.’s common stock.” and more generally, “Risk Factors – Risk Relating to Doing Business in Hong Kong.”
 
DH Enchantment, Inc. and HSY, our Hong Kong subsidiary, are not required to obtain permission from Hong Kong or Chinese authorities including the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or CSRC, or Cybersecurity Administration Committee, or CAC, to operate or to issue securities to foreign investors. In making this determination, we relied on the opinion of Ravenscroft & Schmierer which is attached as Exhibit 5 to the Amendment No. 6 to the Registration Statement on Form 10 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June __, 2022. DH Enchantment, Inc. and HSY are not subject to permission requirements from any other governmental agencies to approve HSY’s operations. HSY has received all requisite permissions to operate its business. The business of HSY until now is not subject to cybersecurity review with the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC, given that: (i) HSY’s products and services are offered not directly to individual users but through institutional customers; (ii) HSY does not possess a large amount of personal information in its business operations. In addition, we believe that HSY is not subject to merger control review by China’s anti-monopoly enforcement agency due to the level of our revenues and the fact that we currently do not expect to propose or implement any acquisition of control of, or decisive influence over, any company with revenues within China of more than RMB400 million. Currently, these statements and regulatory actions have had no impact on HSY’s daily business operation, our ability to accept foreign investments and the ability of DH Enchantment, Inc. to list its securities on an U.S. or other foreign exchange. However, in light of the recent statements and regulatory actions by the PRC and Hong Kong government, such as those related to Hong Kong’s national security, the promulgation of regulations prohibiting foreign ownership of Chinese companies operating in certain industries, which are constantly evolving, and anti-monopoly concerns, we may be subject to the risks of uncertainty of any future actions of the PRC government in this regard. For example, if DH Enchantment, Inc. or HSY inadvertently concludes that such approvals are not required, or if applicable laws, regulations or interpretations change such that we are required to obtain approvals in the future, or if the PRC government disallows our holding company structure, these actions would likely result in a material change in our operations, including our ability to continue our existing holding company structure, carry on HSY’s current business, accept foreign investments, and offer or continue to offer securities of DH Enchantment, Inc. to its investors. These adverse actions would likely cause the value of DH Enchantment, Inc.’s common stock to significantly decline or become worthless. We may also be subject to penalties and sanctions imposed by the PRC regulatory agencies, including the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission, if we fail to comply with such rules and regulations, which would likely adversely affect the ability of DH Enchantment, Inc.’s securities to continue to trade on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, which would likely cause the value of its securities to significantly decline or become worthless. For a detailed description of the risks facing the Company and HSY’s operations in Hong Kong, please refer to “Risk Factors – Risk Factors Relating to Doing Business in Hong Kong.”

Our corporate organization chart is below.
 


There are prominent legal and operational risks associated with our operations being based in Hong Kong which could result in a material change in our operations and the value of DH Enchantment, Inc.’s securities. We are subject to risks arising from the legal system in China where there are risks and uncertainties regarding the enforcement of laws including where the Chinese government can change the rules and regulations in China and Hong Kong, including the enforcement and interpretation thereof, at any time with little to no advance notice and can intervene at any time with little to no advance notice. By way of example, the PRC government initiated a series of regulatory actions and statements to regulate business operations in China with little advance notice, including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, enhancing supervision over China-based companies listed overseas using variable interest entity structure, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding the efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement. While these regulatory actions and statements currently do not impact our business or our ability to accept foreign investments or list our securities on a U.S. or foreign exchange, the Chinese government can change its rules and regulations and the enforcement and interpretation thereof with little to no advance notice. Such changes in Chinese internal regulatory mandates, such as the M&A rules, Anti-Monopoly Law, and the Data Security Law, may target the Company's corporate structure and negatively impact our ability to conduct business in Hong Kong, accept foreign investments, or list on an U.S. or other foreign exchange. These risks may significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. Please see “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Doing Business in Hong Kong.”
 
The recent joint statement by the SEC and PCAOB, and the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCAA) all call for additional and more stringent criteria to be applied to emerging market companies upon assessing the qualification of their auditors, especially the non-U.S. auditors who are not inspected by the PCAOB. Trading in our securities may be prohibited under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act and the Accelerating the Holding Foreign Companies Account Act if the PCAOB determines that it cannot inspect or investigate completely our auditor, and that as a result an exchange may determine to delist our securities. On June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act which would reduce the number of consecutive non-inspection years required for triggering the prohibitions under the HFCAA from three years to two thus reducing the time before our securities may be prohibited from trading or being delisted. Our auditor is not subject to the determinations announced by the PCAOB on December 16, 2021. However, in the event the Malaysian authorities subsequently take a position disallowing the PCAOB to inspect our auditor, then we would need to change our auditor to avoid having our securities delisted. Please see “Risk Factors- The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act requires the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) to be permitted to inspect the issuer's public accounting firm within three years. This three- year period will be shortened to two years if the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act is enacted. There are uncertainties under the PRC Securities Law relating to the procedures and requisite timing for the U.S. securities regulatory agencies to conduct investigations and collect evidence within the territory of the PRC. If the U.S. securities regulatory agencies are unable to conduct such investigations, they may suspend or de-register DH Enchantment, Inc.’s registration with the SEC and delist its securities from applicable trading market within the US.”

We are organized under the laws of the State of Nevada as a holding company that conducts its business through a number of subsidiaries organized under the laws of foreign jurisdictions such as Hong Kong and the British Virgin Islands. This may have an adverse impact on the ability of U.S. investors to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. Courts against these entities, or to effect service of process on the officers and directors managing the foreign subsidiaries.
 
We reported a net loss of $442,982 and net income of $8,700 for the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We had current assets of $121,433 and current liabilities of $479,067 as of March 31, 2022. As of March 31, 2021, our current assets and current liabilities were $74,360 and $65,670, respectively. We have prepared our financial statements for the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 assuming that we will continue as a going concern. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon the continuing financial support from our stockholders. Our sources of capital in the past have included the sale of equity securities, which include common stock sold in private transactions and short-term and long-term debts.
 
Our sources of capital in the past have included the sale of equity securities, which include common stock sold in private transactions to our executive officers or existing shareholders, capital leases and short-term and long-term debts. We expect to finance future acquisitions through a combination of the foregoing. While we believe that existing shareholders and our officers and directors will continue to provide the additional cash to make acquisitions and to meet our obligations as they become due or that we will obtain external financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such additional capital resources on satisfactory terms. We believe that our current cash and other sources of liquidity discussed below are adequate to support operations for at least the next 12 months.
 
History
 
DH Enchantment, Inc. was incorporated in the state of Nevada on July 9, 2004, under the name Amerivestors, Inc. On March 3, 2009, we changed our name to Gust Engineering & Speed Production, Inc. and on October 27, 2009, we changed our name to Energy Management International, Inc. On August 11, 2012, we changed our name to DH Enchantment, Inc., our current name.
 
Since inception to 2018, the Company posted periodic reports on the OTCMarkets website under the alternative reporting standard with the 12/31/2010 Quarterly Report being the last report. Thereafter, the Company ceased reporting and failed to file its Annual list due July 31, 2019 with the Nevada Secretary of State. This resulted in the revocation of the Company’s corporate charter.
 
In November, 2020, Barbara McIntyre Bauman in her capacity as a stockholder of the Company applied for custodianship of the Company with the District Court sitting in Clark County, Nevada (the “Court”) to revive the Company. Ms. Bauman was ultimately appointed by the Court to serve as custodian of the Company on January 11, 2021. Ms. Bauman served as the custodian until April 19, 2021, when Ms. Bauman’s motion to terminate custodianship of the Company was granted by the Court. A copy of the court records relating to the application and termination of custodianship of the Company are attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto.
 
In connection with serving as the custodian, Ms. Bauman was appointed to serve as the sole executive officer and director of the Company effective January 11, 2021. Ms. Bauman subsequently returned the Company to Good Standing Status with the Nevada Secretary of State and caused the Company to re-commence posting periodic reports on the OTC Markets website under the alternative reporting standard. On March 2, 2021, the Company issued to Ms. Bauman 400,000,000 shares of common stock for repayment of related party debt totaling $6,610. On February 22, 2021, the Company issued to Ms. Bauman 3,500,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, for repayment of the related party debt totaling $4,403. These debts were incurred in connection with reviving and maintaining the Company.
 
On May 13, 2021, Ms. Bauman sold 400,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock and 3,500,000 shares of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock to Sally Kin Yi LO and Daily Success Development Ltd. for aggregate consideration of Three Hundred Forty Thousand Dollars ($340,000). In connection with the acquisition, Ms. Bauman resigned from her positions as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer and Sally Kin Yi LO was appointed to serve as our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and director. It is our understanding that the purchasers are not U.S. Persons within the meaning of Regulations S. Accordingly, the Shares are being sold pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Regulation D and Regulation S promulgated thereunder.

Effective July 1, 2021, Daily Success Development Limited converted 520,000 shares of its Series A Preferred Stock into 41,600,000 shares of Common Stock. As a result, Daily Success Development Limited holds 468,000,000 Common Shares (56.30%) and 1,755,000 Series A Preferred Shares (56.30%).
 
Effective July 1, 2021, Sally Lo converted 280,000 shares of its Series A Preferred Stock into 22,400,000 shares of Common Stock. As a result, Sally Lo holds 252,000,000 Common Shares (30.31%) and 945,000 Series A Preferred Shares (30.29%).
 
Acquisition of DH Investment Group Limited (“DHIG”), Our Testing Business
 
On July 26, 2021, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of DH Investment Group Limited, a limited liability company organized under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (“DHIG”), from its shareholders Sally Lo and Daily Success Development Limited in exchange for 100,000 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock. DHIG operates its COVID-19 antigen testing business through its wholly owned subsidiary Ho Shun Yi Limited, a limited liability company organized under the laws of Hong Kong. In connection with the acquisition, each of Sally Lo and Daily Success Development Limited received 35,000 and 65,000 shares of our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, respectively. Each one (1) shares of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible ten (10) shares of our Common Stock. The Company relied on the exemption from registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of, and Regulation D and/or Regulation S promulgated under the Act in selling the Company’s securities to the shareholders of DHIG.
 
Prior to the Share Exchange, the Company was considered as a shell company due to its nominal assets and limited operation. The transaction will be treated as a recapitalization of the Company.
 
The Share Exchange between the Company and DHIC on July 26, 2021, is deemed a merger of entities under common control for which Miss Sally Kin Yi LO is the common director and shareholder of both the Company and DHIG. Under the guidance in ASC 805 for transactions between entities under common control, the assets, liabilities and results of operations, are recognized at their carrying amounts on the date of the Share Transfer, which required the retrospective combination of the Company and DHIG for all periods presented.
 
As a result of our acquisition of DHIG, we entered into the COVID-19 antigen testing business. We intend to make additional acquisitions in the same industry and hope to expand into other territories such as China. We also hope to make opportunistic acquisitions in other industries in the future, regardless of whether such industries relate to the COVID-19 antigen testing business.
 
On June 29, 2021, our Board of Directors authorized and approved the amendment and restatement of our Articles of Incorporation to: (i) change our name to DH Enchantment Inc.; and (ii) amend the powers, rights and designation of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock; and (iii) effectuate a 5:1 reverse split, all of which are subject to final authorization by FINRA. The Board of Directors of the Company also approved the designation of 10,000,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock which took effect immediately.
 
Market Overview
 
Ho Shun Yi Limited’s Business
 
Our operating subsidiary, Ho Shun Yi Limited (“HSY”) is engaged primarily in the sale and distribution of COVID-19 rapid antigen tester sets. HSY is one of the authorized commercial distributors of the INDICAID COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Test in the Hong Kong market. HSY commenced operations in Hong Kong in October 2020 and sells its tester sets primarily in Hong Kong. HSY is a wholly owned subsidiary of DH Investment Group Limited (“DHIG”).
 
The INDICAID COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Test is developed and manufactured in Hong Kong. We believe that HSY’s INDICAID product constitutes approximately 90% of the rapid antigen tests used in Hong Kong. The INDICAID product can provide a COVID-19 testing result in approximately 20 minutes. The INDICAID product does not replace the formal nucleic acid testing, but we believe HSY’s quick pre-screening product may provide officials with the information necessary to decrease the time of community closure, while lowering the risk of virus spread.

We are actively seeking partnerships with distributors in other countries to expand the INDICAID product into additional markets. Since the INDICAID product is considered a hygienic product, we believe that HSY’s product will be subject to much simpler import regulations. We also hope to make opportunistic acquisitions in other industries in the future, regardless of whether such industries relate to the COVID-19 antigen testing business.
 
Our sources of capital in the past have included the sale of equity securities, which include common stock sold in private transactions to our executive officers or existing shareholders, capital leases and short-term and long-term debts. We expect to finance future acquisitions through a combination of the foregoing. While we believe that existing shareholders and our officers and directors will continue to provide the additional cash to make acquisitions and to meet our obligations as they become due or that we will obtain external financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such additional capital resources on satisfactory terms. We believe that our current cash and other sources of liquidity discussed below are adequate to support operations for at least the next 12 months.
 
Product
 
Images of HSY’s product are shown below:
 
Sales and Marketing.
 
HSY’s main customers are major distributors of personal hygiene products into the market. The distributors handle all retail market channels, which minimize our sales and marketing costs. Similar model will be applied when expanding to other overseas markets.
Major Customers. 
 
All of HSY’s major customers are located in Hong Kong. During the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, the following customer accounted for 10% or more of our total net revenues:

 | Year ended March 31, 2022 | | March 31, 2022 
---------------------+---------------------------+--------+-----------------------
Customer | Revenues | | Percentage of revenues | | Accounts receivable
Uni-Alliance Limited | $ | 97,515 | | 18% | | $ | 5,618


 | Year ended March 31, 2021 | | March 31, 2021 
---------------------+---------------------------+---------+-----------------------
Customer | Revenues | | Percentage of revenues | | Accounts receivable
Uni-Alliance Limited | $ | 172,879 | | 82% | | $ | 1,592

 
Generally, HSY is not a party to any long-term agreements with its customers. From time to time, HSY may enter into long term contracts with major customers and subcontract the performance of the contract to corresponding network partner according to the price and area.

Major Vendors.
 
For the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, the following vendor represented more than 10% of the Company’s cost of revenues.
 

Vendor name | Year ended March 31, 2022 | | March 31, 2022 
---------------------------------------+---------------------------+---------+-------------------------------
 | Cost of revenues | | Percentage of cost of revenues | | Accounts payable
Phase Scientific International Limited | $ | 403,568 | | 92% | | $ | –


Vendor name | Year ended March 31, 2021 | | March 31, 2021 
---------------------------------------+---------------------------+---------+-------------------------------
 | Cost of revenues | | Percentage of cost of revenues | | Accounts payable
Phase Scientific International Limited | $ | 165,956 | | 100% | | $ | 1,397

Seasonality.
 
HSY’s business is highly dependent upon the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong and China. In Hong Kong and China, we expect the needs for COVID-19 screening and testing will continue for at least two more years. More demands of pre-screening is expected when the China and Hong Kong borders are re-opened for travelers, while a more efficient screening test is required to prevent another community breakout and spread of the virus.
CORPORATE INFORMATION
 
Our principal executive and registered offices are located at Unit A, 13/F, Gee Luen Factory Building, 316-318 Kwun Tong Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong, telephone number +852 2621 3288. Our website it located at https://indicaid-hoshunyi.com/.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PATENTS
 
We expect to rely on, trade secrets, copyrights, know-how, trademarks, license agreements and contractual provisions to establish our intellectual property rights and protect our brand and services. These legal means, however, afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention.
 
In addition, the laws of Hong Kong and the PRC may not protect our brand and services and intellectual property to the same extent as U.S. laws, if at all. We may be unable to fully protect our intellectual property rights in these countries.
 


6
-

 

We intend to seek the widest possible protection for significant product and process developments in our major markets through a combination of trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights and patents, if applicable. We anticipate that the form of protection will vary depending upon the level of protection afforded by the particular jurisdiction. We expect that our revenue will be derived principally from our operations in Hong Kong and China where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce. In such instances, we may seek protection of our intellectual property through measures taken to increase the confidentiality of our findings.
 
We intend to register trademarks as a means of protecting the brand names of our companies and products. We intend protect our trademarks against infringement and also seek to register design protection where appropriate.
 
We rely on trade secrets and unpatentable know-how that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements. We expect that, where applicable, we will require our employees to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment with us. We expect these agreements to provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual's relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific limited circumstances. The agreements will also provide that all inventions conceived by the individual while rendering services to us shall be assigned to us as the exclusive property of our company. There can be no assurance, however, that all persons who we desire to sign such agreements will sign, or if they do, that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets or unpatentable know-how will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.  
 
COMPETITION
 
HSY’s INDICAID product has been endorsed and used by the Hong Kong government and is currently well established with user communities. As such HSY’s competition in the COVID-19 rapid antigen test market is currently limited. HSY’s competitive landscape may be significantly altered if new testing technology is introduced into the market by third parties. HSY may face some prospective competitors when it expands to overseas markets, that have greater financial resources, broader product and service offerings, longer operating histories, larger customer base and greater brand recognition, or if they are controlled or subsidized by foreign governments, which will enable them to raise capital and enter into strategic relationships more easily. We believe that HSY competes on the basis of a number of factors, including business model, operational capabilities, pricing and service quality.
EMPLOYEES AND CONSULTANTS
 
HSY has the following full time employees and consultants located at Hong Kong as set forth below:
 

Executive officers | 1
---------------------+--
Operation | –
Sale and marketing | 2
Administration Staff | –
Total | 3

 
HSY is required to contribute to the pension fund for all eligible employees in Hong Kong between the ages of eighteen and sixty five. HSY is required to contribute a specified percentage of the participant’s income based on his or her age and wage level. For the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, the pension contributions by HSY were $2,504 and $387, respectively. HSY has not experienced any significant labor disputes or any difficulties in recruiting staff for its operations.
 
GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY REGULATIONS
 
Through HSY, our business is located in Hong Kong and is subject to the laws and regulations of Hong Kong governing businesses concerning, in particular labor, occupational safety and health, contracts, tort and intellectual property. Furthermore, HSY needs to comply with the rules and regulations of Hong Kong governing the data usage and regular terms of service applicable to its potential customers or clients. As the information of HSY’s potential customers or clients is preserved in Hong Kong, HSY needs to comply with the Hong Kong Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance.

-

 

If PRC authorities reinterpret PRC laws to apply to Hong Kong companies, HSY may become subject to the laws and regulations of China governing businesses in general, including labor, occupational safety and health, contracts, tort and intellectual property. We may also become subject to foreign exchange regulations might limit our ability to convert foreign currency into Renminbi or Hong Kong Dollars, acquire any other PRC companies, establish VIEs in the PRC, or make dividend payments from any future WFOEs to us.
 
Hong Kong
 
The INDICAID COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Test product is endorsed by the Hong Kong government and is used by all government tests, but since the product is still consider new, accuracy of the product may still be challenged and may face future regulatory requirements.
 
The Employment Ordinance is the main piece of legislation governing conditions of employment in Hong Kong since 1968. It covers a comprehensive range of employment protection and benefits for employees, including Wage Protection, Rest Days, Holidays with Pay, Paid Annual Leave, Sickness Allowance, Maternity Protection, Statutory Paternity Leave, Severance Payment, Long Service Payment, Employment Protection, Termination of Employment Contract, Protection Against Anti-Union Discrimination. In addition, every employer must take out employees’ compensation insurance to protect the claims made by employees in respect of accidents occurred during the course of their employment.
 
An employer must also comply with all legal obligations under the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance, (CAP485). These include enrolling all qualifying employees in MPF schemes and making MPF contributions for them. Except for exempt persons, employer should enroll both full-time and part-time employees who are at least 18 but under 65 years of age in an MPF scheme within the first 60 days of employment. The 60-day employment rule does not apply to casual employees in the construction and catering industries. Pursuant to the said Ordinance, we are required to make MPF contributions for our Hong Kong employees once every contribution period (generally the wage period within 1 month). Employers and employees are each required to make regular mandatory contributions of 5% of the employee’s relevant income to an MPF scheme, subject to the minimum and maximum relevant income levels. For a monthly-paid employee, the minimum and maximum relevant income levels are $1,547 and $3,846, respectively.
 
China
 
Recently, China has increased scrutiny and oversight of PRC companies seeking foreign investment or to list their securities overseas. The PRC has also been deepening their reach influence on Hong Kong to more closely align Hong Kong with the policies and governance of the PRC. Depending upon the political climate, HSY may also in the future become subject to the laws and regulations of China governing businesses in general, including labor, occupational safety and health, contracts, tort and intellectual property. We may also become subject to foreign exchange regulations might limit our ability to convert foreign currency into Renminbi, acquire PRC companies, or limit the ability of HSY to make dividend payments to DH Enchantment, Inc.
Regulations on Tax
 
PRC Corporate Income Tax
 
The PRC corporate income tax, or CIT, is calculated based on the taxable income determined under the applicable CIT Law and its implementation rules, which became effective on January 1, 2008 and amended on February 24, 2017 and December 29, 2018 respectively. The CIT Law imposes a uniform corporate income tax rate of 25% on all resident enterprises in China, including foreign-invested enterprises.

-

 

Uncertainties exist with respect to how the CIT Law applies to the tax residence status of the Company and our offshore subsidiaries. Under the CIT Law, an enterprise established outside of China with a “de facto management body” within China is considered a “resident enterprise,” which means that it is treated in a manner similar to a Chinese enterprise for corporate income tax purposes. Although the implementation rules of the CIT Law define “de facto management body” as a managing body that exercises substantive and overall management and control over the production and business, personnel, accounting books and assets of an enterprise, the only official guidance for this definition currently available is set forth in Circular 82 issued by the State Administration of Taxation, which provides guidance on the determination of the tax residence status of a Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise, defined as an enterprise that is incorporated under the laws of a foreign country or territory and that has a PRC enterprise or enterprise group as its primary controlling shareholder. Although the Company does not have a PRC enterprise or enterprise group as our primary controlling shareholder and is therefore not a Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise within the meaning of Circular 82, in the absence of guidance specifically applicable to us, we have made reference to the guidance set forth in Circular 82 to evaluate the tax residence status of the Company and our subsidiaries organized outside the PRC.
 
According to Circular 82, a Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise will be regarded as a PRC tax resident by virtue of having a “de facto management body” in China and will be subject to PRC corporate income tax on its worldwide income only if all of the following criteria are met:
 

· | the primary location of the day-to-day operational management is in the PRC; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | decisions relating to the enterprise’s financial and human resource matters are made or are subject to approval by organizations or personnel in the PRC; 
· | the enterprise’s primary assets, accounting books and records, company seals, and board and shareholders meeting minutes are located or maintained in the PRC; and
· | 50% or more of voting board members or senior executives habitually reside in the PRC. 

 
Currently, our Hong Kong entities are not considered entities inside China and therefore not deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes as defined above. However, the tax resident status of an enterprise is subject to determination by the PRC tax authorities and uncertainties remain with respect to the interpretation of the term “de facto management body.” As all of our management members are based in Hong Kong, it remains unclear how the tax residency rule will apply to our case. If the PRC tax authorities determine that DH Enchantment, Inc. or any of its subsidiaries outside of China is a PRC resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, then DH Enchantment, Inc. or such subsidiary could be subject to PRC tax at a rate of 25% on its world-wide income, thus materially reducing our net income. In addition, we will also be subject to PRC enterprise income tax reporting obligations. Furthermore, if the PRC tax authorities determine that we are a PRC resident enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes, gains realized on the sale or other disposition of our ordinary shares may be subject to PRC tax, at a rate of 10% in the case of non-PRC enterprises or 20% in the case of non-PRC individuals (in each case, subject to the provisions of any applicable tax treaty), if such gains are deemed to be from PRC sources. It is unclear whether non-PRC shareholders of DH Enchantment, Inc. would be able to claim the benefits of any tax treaties between their country of tax residence and the PRC in the event that we are treated as a PRC resident enterprise.

Value-Added Tax and Business Tax
 
The Provisional Regulations of the PRC on Value-added Tax (“VAT”) were promulgated by the State Council on December 13, 1993 and came into effect on January 1, 1994 which were subsequently amended on November 10, 2008, February 6, 2016 and November 19, 2017. The Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Regulations of the PRC on Value-added Tax (Revised in 2011) were promulgated by the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation (“SAT”) on 28 October 2011 and came into effect on November 1, 2011 (collectively, the “VAT Law”). According to the VAT Law, all enterprises and individuals engaged in the sale of goods, the provision of processing, repair and replacement services, and the importation of goods within the territory of the PRC must pay value-added tax. For general VAT taxpayers selling or importing goods other than those specifically listed in the VAT Law, the VAT rate is 17%. Starting from April 1, 2019, the VAT rate for revenue generated from providing products was changed from 16% into 13%. VAT is reported as a deduction of revenue when incurred. Entities that are VAT general taxpayers are allowed to offset qualified input VAT paid to suppliers against their output VAT liabilities. Net VAT balance between input VAT and output VAT is recorded in taxes payable.
 
On March 23, 2016, the Ministry of Finance and the SAT jointly issued the Circular on Full Implementation of Business Tax to Value-added Tax Reform which has been partially repealed on July 1, 2017 and January 1, 2018, confirms that business tax would be completely replaced by VAT from May 1, 2016.

Regulations Relating to Foreign Exchange and Dividend Distribution
 
Foreign Exchange Regulations
 
The principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in China are the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations. Under the PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, such as profit distributions and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, may be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”) by complying with certain procedural requirements. By contrast, approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of foreign currency-denominated loans or foreign currency is to be remitted into China under the capital account, such as a capital increase or foreign currency loans to PRC subsidiaries. Our operating currency is the Hong Kong Dollar. If PRC authorities reinterpret foreign exchange regulations to include the Hong Kong Dollar, then we may become subject to the regulations affecting foreign exchange and dividend distributions as set forth herein.
 
In November 2012, SAFE promulgated the Circular of Further Improving and Adjusting Foreign Exchange Administration Policies on Foreign Direct Investment. Pursuant to this circular, the opening of various special purpose foreign exchange accounts, such as pre-establishment expense accounts, foreign exchange capital accounts and guarantee accounts, the reinvestment of RMB proceeds by foreign investors in the PRC, and remittance of foreign exchange profits and dividends by a foreign-invested enterprise to its foreign shareholders no longer require the approval or verification of SAFE, and multiple capital accounts for the same entity may be opened in different provinces, which was not possible previously. In addition, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Printing and Distributing the Provisions on Foreign Exchange Administration over Domestic Direct Investment by Foreign Investors and the Supporting Documents in May 2013, which specifies that the administration by SAFE or its local branches over direct investment by foreign investors in the PRC shall be conducted by way of registration and banks shall process foreign exchange business relating to the direct investment in the PRC based on the registration information provided by SAFE and its branches.
 
Additionally, pursuant to the Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Further Simplifying and Improving the Direct Investment related Foreign Exchange Administration Policies (“SAFE Notice No. 13”), which was promulgated on February 13, 2015 and became effective on June 1, 2015, the foreign exchange registration in relation to foreign direct investment shall be directly reviewed and handled by qualified banks in accordance with SAFE Notice No. 13, and SAFE and its branches shall perform indirect regulation over the foreign exchange registration via qualified banks.
 
We typically do not need to use our offshore foreign currency to fund HSY’s Hong Kong operations. In the event we need to do so, we may be required to apply to obtain the relevant approvals of, registration or filing with SAFE and other PRC government authorities as necessary.
 
On August 29, 2008, SAFE issued the Circular on the Relevant Operating Issues Concerning the Improvement of the Administration of the Payment and Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular 142. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 142, RMB resulting from the settlement of foreign currency capital of a foreign-invested enterprise must be used within the business scope as approved by the applicable government authority and cannot be used for domestic equity investment, unless it is otherwise approved. Documents certifying the purposes of the settlement of foreign currency capital into RMB, including a business contract, must also be submitted for the settlement of the foreign currency. In addition, SAFE strengthened its oversight of the flow and use of RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of a foreign-invested company. The use of such RMB capital may not be altered without SAFE’s approval, and such RMB capital may not be used to repay RMB loans if such loans have not been used. Violations of SAFE Circular 142 could result in severe monetary fines or penalties. There are no costs associated with applying for registration or approval of loans or capital contributions with or from relevant PRC governmental authorities, other than nominal processing charges. Under PRC laws and regulations, the PRC governmental authorities are required to process such approvals or registrations or deny our application within a prescribed time period, which is usually less than 90 days. The actual time taken, however, may be longer due to administrative delays. If we are required to obtain these registrations or approvals, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to HSY’s operations in Hong Kong. If we fail to receive such registrations or approvals, our ability to use the proceeds from our funds to capitalize HSY’s Hong Kong operations may be negatively affected, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and ability to fund and expand our business.

SAFE Circular 37
 
SAFE promulgated the Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents’ Offshore Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 37, on July 4, 2014, which replaced the former circular commonly known as “SAFE Circular 75” promulgated by SAFE on October 21, 2005. SAFE Circular 37 requires PRC residents to register with local branches of SAFE in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, for the purpose of overseas investment and financing, with such PRC residents’ legally owned assets or equity interests in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests, referred to in SAFE Circular 37 as a “special purpose vehicle.” SAFE Circular 37 further requires amendment to the registration in the event of any significant changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as increase or decrease of capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material event. In the event that a PRC shareholder holding interests in a special purpose vehicle fails to fulfill the required SAFE registration, the PRC subsidiaries of that special purpose vehicle may be prohibited from making profit distributions to the offshore parent and from carrying out subsequent cross-border foreign exchange activities, and the special purpose vehicle may be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital into its PRC subsidiary. Furthermore, failure to comply with the various SAFE registration requirements described above could result in liability under PRC law for evasion of foreign exchange controls. On February 13, 2015, SAFE Notice No. 13 was promulgated, pursuant to which the aforementioned registration shall be conducted with and handled by qualified banks.
 
We have notified substantial beneficial owners of our ordinary shares who we know are PRC residents of their filing obligation, and to the best of our knowledge, those shareholders whom we know are PRC residents have completed the registration or will carry out the registration as required under SAFE Circular 37. However, we may not be aware of the identities of all our beneficial owners who are PRC residents. In addition, we do not have control over our beneficial owners and cannot assure you that all of our PRC resident beneficial owners will comply with SAFE Circular 37. The failure of our beneficial owners who are PRC residents to register or amend their SAFE registrations in a timely manner pursuant to SAFE Circular 37 or the failure of future beneficial owners of our company who are PRC residents to comply with the registration procedures set forth in SAFE Circular 37 may subject such beneficial owners or our PRC subsidiaries to fines and legal sanctions. Failure to register or amend the registration may also limit our ability to contribute additional capital to any PRC subsidiaries or receive dividends or other distributions from PRC subsidiaries or other proceeds from disposal of any PRC subsidiaries, or we may be penalized by SAFE.
 
Share Option Rules
 
Under the Administration Measures on Individual Foreign Exchange Control issued by the PBOC on December 25, 2006, all foreign exchange matters involved in employee share ownership plans and share option plans in which PRC citizens participate require approval from SAFE or its authorized branch. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 37, PRC residents who participate in share incentive plans in overseas non-publicly-listed companies may submit applications to SAFE or its local branches for the foreign exchange registration with respect to offshore special purpose companies. In addition, under the Notices on Issues concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Share Incentive Plans of Overseas Publicly-Listed Companies, or the Share Option Rules, issued by SAFE on February 15, 2012, PRC residents who are granted shares or share options by companies listed on overseas stock exchanges under share incentive plans are required to (i) register with SAFE or its local branches, (ii) retain a qualified PRC agent, which may be a PRC subsidiary of the overseas listed company or another qualified institution selected by the PRC subsidiary, to conduct the SAFE registration and other procedures with respect to the share incentive plans on behalf of the participants, and (iii) retain an overseas institution to handle matters in connection with their exercise of share options, purchase and sale of shares or interests and funds transfers.
Regulation of Dividend Distributions
 
The principal laws, rules and regulations governing dividend distributions by foreign-invested enterprises in the PRC are the Company Law of the PRC, as amended, the Wholly Foreign-owned Enterprise Law and its implementation regulations, the Chinese-foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Law and its implementation regulations, and the Chinese-foreign Equity Joint Venture Law and its implementation regulations. Under these laws, rules and regulations, foreign-invested enterprises may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profit, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Both PRC domestic companies and wholly-foreign owned PRC enterprises are required to set aside a general reserve of at least 10% of their after-tax profit, until the cumulative amount of such reserve reaches 50% of their registered capital. A PRC company is not permitted to distribute any profits until any losses from prior fiscal years have been offset. Profits retained from prior fiscal years may be distributed together with distributable profits from the current fiscal year.

Near-Term Requirements For Additional Capital
 
We believe that we will require approximately $1-2 millions over the next 12 months and approximately $1 million for the twelve month period beyond such initial 12 month period to implement our business plan. For the immediate future, we intend to finance our business expansion efforts through loans from existing shareholders or financial institutions.
