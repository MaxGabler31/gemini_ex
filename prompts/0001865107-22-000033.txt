ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Vision
To be the global leader in direct-to-consumer fashion for the next generation of consumers through a dynamic platform of digitally native brands.
Who We Are
a.k.a. is a brand accelerator of direct-to-consumer (DTC) fashion brands for the next-generation. Beginning with the acquisition of Princess Polly in 2018, we created a portfolio of complementary brands with our subsequent acquisitions of Petal & Pup and Rebdolls in 2019 and Culture Kings and mnml in 2021. We target high-potential brands that we believe are at a pivotal point in their growth trajectory that we can integrate into our platform and accelerate their growth. Leveraging our proven track-record, industry expertise and operational synergies, we believe our brands can grow faster, reach broader audiences, achieve greater scale and enhance their profitability. We believe we are disrupting the status quo and pioneering a new approach to fashion. 
Through our portfolio of high-growth, digitally-focused global brands, we reach a broad audience across accessible price points and varied styles. Our current brands all share a common focus on Millennial and Gen Z consumers who seek fashion inspiration on social media and primarily shop online. Nimble by design, our innovative brands are launched and fueled on social media channels. They are customer-centric and have authentic and engaging relationships with their target audiences through highly relevant social content and other digital marketing strategies. Leveraging innovative, data-driven insights, our brands introduce fresh content and high-quality merchandise daily. Our platform accelerates the growth and profitability of our existing brands, and we aim to continue expanding our portfolio. Simply put, our brands are better together.
While we have owned Princess Polly, Petal & Pup and Rebdolls from before 2020, information presented hereafter on an “across a.k.a. Brands” basis assumes we also owned Culture Kings for all periods presented.
We Efficiently Acquire Customers Through Inspiring, Digital Content
Our brands engage with customers by releasing a stream of inspiring digital content at high frequency. We believe our content-rich narrative and authentic brand messaging drives organic traffic to our websites, efficiently generating demand, enhancing connectivity with customers and amplifying our brand communities. Our brands maintain relationships with approximately 17,000 influencers globally and utilize them to test and launch new products, gather customer feedback, increase brand awareness and acquire new customers in a cost-effective manner. In 2021, across a.k.a. Brands, we inspired more than 8.7 million followers on social media and served more than 3.7 million active customers.
We Leverage Data-Driven Insights to Curate High-Quality, Affordable Fashion
Our brands aim to deliver constant newness and excitement by creating and curating on-trend and affordable fashion styles that customers love. We utilize real-time data and consumer insights to identify the latest trends and work with our global sourcing network and brand partners to quickly bring new, high-quality products to market. Our agile “test-and-repeat” merchandising model enables the flexibility to quickly react to customer demand and test product appeal without taking large initial inventory positions, yet still capture in-season demand. This model ensures that our merchandise is always on-trend and customer-led because we only replenish the styles that our customers show us that they like. 
Our Brands Offer a High Mix of Exclusive Styles to Drive Loyalty
Our brands’ compelling merchandising strategy is anchored by a high proportion of exclusive styles that cannot be found elsewhere. More than 47% of our revenue is derived from products exclusive to a.k.a. Brands, which increases both demand and customer loyalty. Our customers’ satisfaction with the fit, quality, affordability and exclusivity of our styles is further reflected in our sales return rates across our brands, which was well below industry average in 2021 at approximately 14%.
Our Platform Creates Value by Driving Synergies Across the Portfolio
Deep Industry Expertise
Our brands have access to our highly-skilled leadership team, each of whom has a proven track-record and decades of experience building and scaling successful eCommerce businesses. We have deep expertise in the business of fashion, and we support our brands so they can focus on customer-facing priorities such as branding, merchandising and maintaining an authentic connection with customers.
Innovation Hub and Knowledge Sharing
Our platform enables and encourages a network of cross-brand learnings to advance innovation and promote best practices – what accelerates profitable growth for one brand can accelerate profitable growth for others. Across our brands, we test and learn digital innovation and facilitate knowledge sharing and benchmarking of key performance metrics to improve growth, operational efficiency and profitability.
Flexible Technology Stack and Operations
Our platform leverages a broad network of third-party service and technology providers, which allows us to implement the latest capabilities with limited upfront investment and quickly adopt innovations in the market. We utilize a combination of owned and third-party logistics and fulfillment assets and third-party technology partners, creating flexibility to support our high-growth brands. We customize our approach for each brand to allow for optimization and tailored growth tools, which sets us apart from other centralized platforms. For example, while we maintain a network of proven vendors across the portfolio, we allow our brands to take a custom approach to which vendors they use. Therefore, there is minimal operational disruption when we acquire new brands given our flexible operations approach. Additionally, through our a.k.a. platform and the scale it provides, we negotiate favorable rates with our vendors, providing our brands with attractive terms and enhancing overall profitability.
We Promote Diversity and Practice Responsible Fashion
Our brands reflect the diversity and beauty of our customers and we continuously seek ways to expand the diversity in our brands, products and marketing. We believe diversity and sustainability align with our core values and drive better results. We operate responsibly and are committed to responsible fashion and sustainability through prioritization of transparency, fair labor practices and reduced waste.
Our Powerful Economic Model
We believe our platform is differentiated by its unique ability to attract and retain a wide range of Millennial and Gen Z consumers through authentic brand messaging and curated, on-trend fashion. In 2021, across a.k.a. Brands, we:
•attracted approximately 289 million site visits, with 61% from unpaid sources
•grew our active customer base by 61% from 2020, who placed 48% more orders at 7% higher average order value compared to 2020
•had a low sales return ratio of approximately 14%
We believe our robust growth and profitability validate our platform approach and asset-light business model. We grew revenue by 160% from 2020 to 2021 and achieved $562.2 million in net sales, while our adjusted EBITDA increased by 2.1 times from 2020 to 2021.
Industry Overview
Large and Growing Global Apparel, Footwear and Accessories Industry
We primarily operate in the large and growing global apparel, footwear and accessories industry. According to Euromonitor, a consumer market research company, the industry grew to an annual spend of $1.7 trillion in retail sales in 2021 from $1.3 trillion in 2010, representing a CAGR of 2.7% over this time period. Although 2021 retail sales were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the industry is projected to grow at a 8.1% CAGR from 2020 to 2025. Though we ship our products globally, we operate primarily in two geographies, the U.S. and Australia. The U.S. apparel, footwear and accessories market grew to $370 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a 8.9% CAGR from 2020 to 2025. The Australian apparel, footwear and accessories market grew to $18.7 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a 6.5% CAGR from 2020 to 2025. We believe the key factors driving growth within the global apparel, footwear and accessories industry include favorable demographic trends and desire for constant newness.
Apparel, Footwear and Accessories Shopping has Been Rapidly Shifting Online
Consumers are increasingly turning to online channels to make purchases, driven by the growing Millennial and Gen Z populations and the increasing influence of social and digital media channels. According to Euromonitor, the global online apparel, footwear and accessories market was valued at approximately $300 billion in 2019, and is expected to reach $543 billion by 2025, representing a 10.3% CAGR, with online outpacing the growth of the overall market.
In the U.S., online spend was $94 billion in 2019 and is expected to reach $192 billion by 2025, representing a 12.7% CAGR. Online penetration of apparel, footwear and accessories in the U.S. has increased from 7.4% to 35.0% from 2010 to 2021, and Euromonitor expects online penetration to reach approximately 43% in the U.S. by 2025. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated digital adoption across retail with online penetration of apparel, footwear and accessories expanding approximately 1,136 basis points in the U.S. during 2020.
Digital-Savvy Millennial and Gen Z Consumers Seeking the Next-Generation Shopping Experience
According to data from the United Nations, Millennial and Gen Z consumers, our primary target demographic today, account for 32% and 23% of the global population, respectively, making them a large and growing demographic group with significant economic influence. The U.S. Millennial and Gen Z population is also very diverse, collectively accounting for approximately 60% of the U.S. minority population. This growing, diverse base of young consumers is shaping the evolving retail landscape and differs from other generations given a focus on the following:
•Aspire to express their individual style through fashion and desire for constant newness
•Seek an emotional connection with brands through frequent interaction and shared values
•Shop and explore content online more than older generations
•Engage with social media and digital content from influencers as a primary source of inspiration and discovery to inform their purchasing decisions
•Creative Agency Composed found in November 2019 that approximately 60% of U.S. Gen Z shoppers utilize Instagram to discover new brands and products
•According to the Global Web Index, Millennials and Gen Z worldwide spend approximately 4 hours daily on average on social media
•Demand a higher accountability for brands and seek to purchase from companies that align with their values, including a focus on social responsibility, sustainability, diversity and inclusion.
•5WPR’s 2020 Consumer Culture Report found in November 2019 that approximately 83% of Millennials want to buy from companies that align with their belief and values
Changing Landscape of Brands
Over the last decade, the retail landscape has transformed, as mall-based stores, including department stores and specialty retailers, rapidly shrank their footprints or closed all together. According to IBISWorld, department store locations in the U.S. declined by approximately 30% to 6,000 in 2020 from 8,600 in 2011. In addition to department store closures, we believe many specialty retailers also experienced similar declines during the same time period. Offline retailers, as a whole, did not keep up with changing consumer preferences, such as the shift to online shopping, and carry high fixed costs associated with their large store footprints which become increasingly less profitable. These pressures led to store closures in recent years that we believe creates available market share for new, primarily digital competitors.
As consumers moved to online shopping platforms and as social media increasingly captured consumers’ time, a new generation of brands began building direct relationships with their customers through their own branded eCommerce sites, a limited number of owned stores and social media platforms. These direct channels allow brands to engage directly with consumers and build unique brand identities to appeal to specific target demographics. These factors, combined with Millennial and Gen Z consumers seeking brands that are unique and offer an emotional connection, gave rise to a fragmented landscape of digital and direct-to-consumer brands. Additionally, direct to consumer brands are not tied to a traditional wholesale development calendar, so they have greater merchandising flexibility and can get trends to customers faster.
The Attractive Streetwear Industry
With our recent acquisitions of Culture Kings and mnml, we entered the growing, global streetwear market, which was estimated to be $185 billion in 2019. Streetwear, which is primarily comprised of footwear, T-shirts and other apparel and accessory items, has gained an almost cult-like following among consumers. This is particularly true for Gen Z, which is estimated to be the largest group of streetwear shoppers, with approximately 60% of shoppers under the age of 25.
Growing demand for streetwear is driven by product exclusivity and versatility, as well the broader casualization of fashion. The anticipation of limited opportunity to buy drives scarcity value, offering a unique avenue for self-expression among consumers. These unique attributes of streetwear give it a cache or “cool” factor among consumers which is driving outsized industry growth.
Our Competitive Strengths
Diversified Portfolio of Global Brands Targets Distinct Audiences and Expands Reach
We strategically acquired a portfolio of brands with strong followings from Millennial and Gen Z customers. The collective reach of our brands is diversified across age, gender, geography and life stage. Yet, each brand targets a distinct customer segment. The typical customer is a 15-25 year old woman for Princess Polly, a 25-40 year old woman for Petal & Pup, an 18-34 year old plus-sized diverse woman for Rebdolls, an 18-35 year old male for Culture Kings and a 18-35 year old male for mnml. Each of our brands maintains their own identities and tailors brand messaging and products to their unique customer bases, creating authentic connections and driving strong loyalty. Additionally, our global footprint and portfolio of brands allows us to diversify from potential risks associated with a single brand or a single market, enhancing platform level returns.
Demand-led, Data-driven Merchandising Drives Speed to Market and Full Price Sell Through
Our brands utilize a data-driven approach to merchandising, identifying consumer demand trends and introducing relevant products with rapid speed-to-market. Princess Polly pioneered the “test-and-repeat” product buying model, and now our other brands have learned the strategy from being a part of the a.k.a. platform and are employing it as well. The brands make initial purchases of a wide variety of new products in small quantities, releasing a steady stream of new arrivals as frequently as daily and observe early signals on transaction and browsing patterns to quickly validate consumer appeal. This customer feedback loop allows our brands to rapidly replenish successful styles and scale-back on less successful products. Our on-trend offerings and short product cycle are designed to generate constant newness, encourage product discovery, drive online traffic and full price sell through. In 2021, the average order value across our brands increased by 7%.
Additionally, our presence in the U.S. and Australia allows us to monitor seasonal trends across markets months and even seasons in advance. We leverage these data-driven demand insights from one hemisphere to inform purchasing decisions for the following season in the other hemisphere. We can also ship end of season merchandise to the other hemisphere to avoid costly end of season markdowns. 
The value proposition of our brands is further enhanced through a high mix of exclusive products that cannot be found elsewhere. In 2021, more than 80% of merchandise sold at Princess Polly was proprietary. In 2021, approximately 38% of products sold at Culture Kings were exclusive via owned brands, licensed brands, limited editions and brand collaborations. We believe the high portion of exclusive offerings generates excitement, anticipation and loyalty among customers, fuels traffic and demand, and differentiates us competitively. The strong margin profile of our proprietary assortment further improves overall profitability. Additionally, our brands standardize the sizing of their proprietary products and provide customers with better sizing guides, inspiring consumer confidence in quality and fit. In 2021, the sales return rate across a.k.a. Brands was 14%, which is significantly lower than industry average.
Inspirational Content Propels Customer Engagement and Efficient Marketing
Our brands drive continuous engagement with customers through inspiring digital content. We believe the quality and quantity of our content differentiates us from our competitors and seamlessly delivers each brand’s core messaging and lifestyle positioning. We release fresh content as often as hourly across a variety of digital mediums. Our brands have built a community of over 8.7 million brand loyalists and enthusiasts across multiple social media channels, including Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and TikTok, and our brands constantly evolve their customer engagement strategy.
Our brands partner with an extensive network of approximately 17,000 influencers, focusing on those with small to medium, but loyal, followings. We believe these micro-influencers have a strong emotional connection with our brands and feature our products in a highly authentic way that resonates with customers. Our focus on micro-influencers is intended to create a more authentic relationship with customers, mitigate the risk from individual celebrity or macro influencer endorsements and achieve higher returns on our marketing investment. Our strong value proposition combined with our efficient marketing tactics results in low customer acquisition costs and high customer lifetime value.
Additionally, Culture Kings operates eight experiential concept stores in major cities in Australia and New Zealand that serve as powerful customer acquisition tools, and provide customers a unique and immersive brand experience. The stores are one-of-a-kind retail experiences, with celebrity events, activations and in-store gamification. Culture Kings captures compelling content from their stores and events and promotes it on their digital channels, driving increased brand awareness. Culture Kings is the only brand in our current portfolio with stores.
Powerful Platform Accelerates Profitable Growth
Our brands operate independently but have access to resources, guidance and vendors at the a.k.a. level. We believe this model balances scale-enabled cost savings with operational flexibility, facilitates low-risk innovation and accommodates the needs of our brands at various stages of growth. Our platform is designed to provide collective advantages and accelerate profitable growth in both existing and new markets and allows us to manage the brands at a portfolio level.
•Asset-light, third party approach drives operational synergies while maintaining flexibility. We maintain a wide network of third-party technology vendors and suppliers across our sourcing, distribution, technology and back-office functions. We utilize common providers across brands where possible and leverage our scale to negotiate collectively to drive cost and operating synergies. As a result, our brands are able to focus on customer engagement, brand building and marketing, while benefiting from operational services at scaled pricing that the brands would be unlikely to obtain on a stand-alone basis. For instance, we have optimized our logistics and fulfillment capacity by utilizing a combination of owned assets and a network of third-party vendors, allowing for the flexibility to make real-time operational adjustments to accommodate the needs of our high-growth brands.
Our flexible and asset light approach to technology allows us to stay at the forefront of innovation in order to better serve our customers and enhance profitability. We aim to stay on the forefront of digital innovation by experimenting with emerging capabilities that enable our brands to enhance the customer experience in a cost-effective manner. Additionally, we are often early adopters of the latest innovations and are viewed as an attractive partner for leading technology platforms. We consider the nimbleness enabled by our third-party technology a compelling advantage over our competitors who maintain proprietary technology platforms that require significant initial investment, ongoing maintenance costs and generally creates long lead times to deploy and leverage.
•Testing of innovative solutions and shared best practices. While our brands have broad autonomy to experiment with new operational solutions, at the platform level we identify best practices and facilitate the sharing of this knowledge across our brands. For instance, the “test-and-repeat” model first deployed by Princess Polly has been subsequently adopted by Petal & Pup. We also standardized operational and financial performance metrics so that our brands can benchmark against each other.
•Highly experienced management team. We assembled a highly experienced executive leadership team with deep and diversified eCommerce and fashion experience that spans from start-ups to Fortune 500 companies. Our a.k.a. Brands executive team complements our brand management teams by providing significant experience in scaling digital businesses over the last 20 years.
•Next generation culture. While each of our brands celebrates its own unique culture and brand values, we collectively embrace a next generation mindset:
•We are customer-led; focusing relentlessly on delivering a high-quality customer experience,
•We move fast; executing on innovative ideas swiftly,
•We are data driven; using data and analytics to make smarter decisions every day,
•We are growth minded; testing and learning continuously in and across our brands,
•We are diverse; celebrating and expanding the diversity of our customers and teams,
•We act with integrity and practice responsible fashion; when in doubt, we resort to the high standard.
Our Growth Strategies
We believe our global direct-to-consumer fashion brands are disrupting categories with strong fundamental growth and capitalizing on long-term global secular tailwinds. We intend to execute the following strategies to expand our platform and gain market share:
Grow our Brands Organically in our Existing Markets
•Grow Brand Awareness and Acquire New Customers. We believe our brands are underpenetrated in the markets in which they operate. We think there is a significant opportunity to grow awareness of our brands due to the continued secular shift to eCommerce, as well as the strength of our highly efficient, data-driven marketing model. We intend to efficiently acquire new customers through continued investment in our content creation and social media capabilities, as well as through our network of approximately 17,000 influencers. Through continued investment in these initiatives, we believe we will be able to further appeal to our core demographic of Millennial and Gen Z consumers and increase our market share.
•Expand Product Categories and Offerings. We believe our brands are well positioned to grow by expanding product styles and entering new categories that are complementary to our brands’ current offerings. Our brands aim to identify trends and evaluate opportunities leveraging digital capabilities, data-driven insights and a test-and-repeat merchandising model. We believe our brands have a significant opportunity to expand product ranges, increase average order value and broaden customer reach. We intend to continue to increase our mix of owned brands and exclusive offerings, which we believe generate significantly higher margins and drive traffic to our websites.
•Continue to Increase Loyalty and Wallet Share. We intend to deepen customer relationships to improve customer retention and increase wallet share. We aim to achieve this by enhancing our user experience, improving engagement, refining our customer segmentation, increasing personalization, launching loyalty programs across our brands and constantly introducing new styles, designer collaborations and exclusive items. Our authentic content and steady stream of new styles encourages deep connections with new and existing customers, driving customer retention rate of 66% in 2021 across a.k.a. Brands, and resulting in an attractive customer lifetime value.
Grow through Acquisitions
Acquiring new brands is core to our strategy and an important driver of our future growth. Since our inception in 2018, we successfully acquired and integrated five brands onto our platform. We employ a corporate development team dedicated to the identification, evaluation and acquisition of brands, and we maintain a strong pipeline of potential targets which typically includes multiple acquisition opportunities at differing stages of evaluation.
We seek brands that diversify our portfolio through new demographics, markets or fashion tastes, which allows us to grow without cannibalizing our current brands. We seek direct-to-consumer brands with strong customer followings and a proven track record of operating profitably but need help scaling to further accelerate their growth. We look for talented and passionate teams who have proven abilities to leverage data, technology and content to grow. We seek asset-light brands that have the potential to benefit from the a.k.a. platform, expertise and resources. We look for brands with similar operating and financial characteristics as our existing brands. We are continuously evaluating opportunities for such acquisitions
We believe our demonstrated ability to provide infrastructure, expertise and capital to scale brands and create significant value make us an attractive partner which provides us a competitive advantage in acquiring new brands.
Grow Internationally
We intend to leverage the strength of our brands and our ability to connect with customers to expand into new international markets beyond our core U.S. and Australian markets. Net sales to customers outside of the U.S. and Australia was $74 million across 220 countries and territories and represented 13% of total sales in 2021.
We will continue to target markets that demonstrate strong social and digital media usage. We identified several markets in which we believe we can introduce one or more of our brands, such as expanding Culture Kings in Korea and Japan and Princess Polly in Canada, Europe and the U.K. We believe our experience growing the Princess Polly and Petal & Pup brands in the U.S. creates a proven roadmap to help us successfully introduce our brands globally.
Continue to Drive Efficiencies Across Our Platform
As we continue to scale organically and through acquisitions, we aim to improve operational performance across our platform and enhance profitability. We will also look for ways to reduce our input costs by leveraging our collective scale to negotiate improved terms with suppliers and vendors, including for raw materials, freight and shipping. As our brands grow and gain scale, we intend to invest in automation and process improvement within our operations to drive lower variable costs and improved profitability.
Our Brands
The a.k.a. Brands platform consists of five differentiated brands, Princess Polly, Culture Kings, Petal & Pup, mnml and Rebdolls.
Princess Polly: Founded in Australia in 2010, Princess Polly joined the a.k.a. Brands platform in July 2018. With a tagline of “Wear It This Weekend,” Princess Polly focuses on providing fun dresses, tops, shoes and accessories with slim fit, body-confident and trendy fashion designs. The brand operates exclusively online and targets a female customer between the ages of 15 and 25, who value the brand’s high quality assortment, compelling price points and free and fast shipping. Princess Polly customers are inspired by the constant stream of inspirational social media content and the fresh, new and affordable merchandise arriving daily. Since joining the a.k.a. Brands platform, Princess Polly has experienced rapid growth and increasing brand awareness in the United States.
Culture Kings: Founded in Australia in 2008, Culture Kings joined the a.k.a. Brands platform in March 2021. Culture Kings is a premium multi-channel retailer of streetwear apparel, footwear, headwear and accessories. The brand offers its customers a curated assortment from over one hundred leading third-party streetwear brands, as well as a large and growing portfolio of owned brands and exclusive products that embody the relationship between music, sport, art and fashion. The brand targets male consumers between the ages of 18 and 35 who are fashion conscious, highly social and digitally focused. More than 50% of Culture Kings’ products are exclusive and approximately 80% of its sales are made online. Culture Kings engages with customers through a combination of compelling, online and offline marketing strategies that leverage the latest in music, fashion, art and celebrities to create brand hype and product excitement. 
The brand operates eight experiential concept stores in major cities in Australia and New Zealand that serve as a powerful customer acquisition tool, and provide customers a unique and immersive brand experience. The stores feature engaging in-store designs and product displays, store fronts designed by best-in-class graffiti artists, exclusive product releases including promotional products only available in-store, and event-driven in-store activations. The stores host a variety of public events and creative activities designed to instill feelings and emotions of excitement such as sneaker vending machine, basketball shooting competitions, live DJ sessions and appearances of global celebrities and tastemakers, including athletes and on-trend music artists. The brand creates digital content based on the events and activities in-store and publishes them online, generating further hype on social media. The unique in-store experience generates excitement and anticipation, driving demand and traffic online and offline, and creating customer affiliation with the Culture Kings brands, not just the products sold.
Petal & Pup: Founded in Australia in 2015, Petal & Pup joined the a.k.a. Brands platform in August 2019. The brand operates exclusively online and offers an assortment of trendy, flattering, feminine styles and dresses for special occasions. The brand targets female customers typically in their 20s or 30s, with more than half of customers in the 18-34-year-old age bracket. In 2019, Petal & Pup expanded to the United States, which is now its fastest growing geography. 
mnml: Founded in Los Angeles in 2016, mnml joined the a.k.a. Brands platform in October 2021. mnml is a high-growth men’s streetwear brand that designs premier, fashion forward apparel at affordable prices. As an early mover in the DTC streetwear segment, mnml has created powerful brand recognition and is an established destination for modern wardrobe staples, current trends and highly sought-after styles. The brand has developed a data-driven merchandising model to bring quality, on-trend fashion to customers faster and at an accessible price point. mnml’s authentic social media marketing strategy, highlighted by its more than one million followers across social platforms, drives efficient customer acquisition and strong brand loyalty.
Rebdolls: Founded in New Jersey in 2014, Rebdolls joined the a.k.a. Brands platform in December 2019. The brand offers apparel with a full range of sizes from 0 to 32 with an emphasis on size inclusivity. Rebdolls targets the underserved market of diverse, plus-sized women and believes that now more than ever the world needs more diversity in fashion. The typical Rebdolls customer is a diverse woman between the ages of 18 and 34. 
Merchandising
Our brands offer a broad yet curated assortment of clothing, footwear, headwear and accessories. Collectively, we serve both female and male customers who wear our products for a wide range of occasions. A high proportion of our offerings, or over 47% in 2021 across a.k.a. Brands, are proprietary and exclusive. Owned brand offerings represented 71% of total net revenues in 2021 and typically delivers a higher gross margin than that of third-party brands. The range and exclusivity of our offerings serve the diverse needs of our customers, generate excitement and promote loyalty.
Our brands utilize data analytics to inform the development and curation of on-trend fashion offerings. We work with a network of suppliers to achieve rapid speed-to-market. For example, Princess Polly collects and analyzes data on purchasing patterns, conversion rates and social media signals to quickly identify best-selling products and new potential product trends in the market. The brand then makes small initial purchases of inventory and observes market signals before quickly replenishing selective winning styles often “in season” to further capitalize on their popularity. This model has also been adopted by Petal & Pup since 2020 and is being implemented for Culture Kings, mnml and Rebdolls.
In addition, the global and dual-hemisphere presence of our brands allow us the flexibility to leverage the geographic advantages inherent in our platform, including the offsetting seasons across hemispheres. We have the capability to monitor and identify emerging trends in each market and season, and then quickly introduce them across geographies. Additionally, we stock inventory in both Australia and the U.S., which enables us to carry relevant, in-season merchandise. We have the ability to manage end-of-season inventory by shipping across markets where the merchandise is in-season, enhancing our inventory productivity and further encouraging full price sell through.
Sourcing
We source our products from a network of international suppliers. Our supplier base includes approximately 267 suppliers across 8 different countries as of December 31, 2021.
We have strong long-term relationships with our manufacturers, but we do not have any long-term commitments requiring us to purchase minimum volumes from any supplier or manufacturer. We seek to leverage our collective scale and use the same suppliers for our brands, where possible, in order to obtain more favorable terms from our suppliers. Our network of third party suppliers allows us to be capital efficient and nimble, giving us the ability to move new designs we receive from our suppliers into production and then into inventory in as few as 30-45 days, as compared to up to 9 months for traditional apparel brands.
We strategically establish sourcing relationships to ensure a constant supply of high quality, low cost inventory with a number of our suppliers exclusively manufacturing for our brands. Although we have our own design team, a number of suppliers have the capability to produce concepts and designs with no obligation for our brands to purchase. With less seasonal demand for our products, we offer our manufacturing partners predictable and consistent growth in inventory purchases throughout the year.
Customer Experience
A vast majority of our customers shop through our websites and mobile sites. Our websites and native mobile applications are designed to offer convenient navigation and feature editorial product pictures which facilitate product discovery and selection. Our brands’ websites and mobile platforms are based on responsive web design principles, which aim to make web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. These websites and mobile platforms employ technologies to create a compelling, easy-to-use shopping experience for our consumers.
Due to the high proportion of proprietary and exclusive products, we are able to standardize the sizing of our products, thereby providing better size consistency for customers. Our brands offer an interactive sizing tool and fit guides for customers, reducing the need to purchase the same styles in multiple sizes and returning the products that do not fit. Culture Kings and mnml serve customer bases consisting of primarily male customers, who tend to return merchandise less frequently. Across a.k.a. Brands, our return ratio was approximately 14% in fiscal year 2021, compared to the eCommerce average of approximately 30% according to Invesp, a consultancy specializing in conversion rate optimization, driving convenience for customers and cost savings on shipping and logistics for a.k.a.
We foster customer loyalty by offering a convenient customer experience and customer care services throughout the initial transaction, fulfillment, shipping and return processes. We have ten fulfillment centers and warehouses, five in Australia and five in the United States. Our customer service team, who interact with our customers primarily through email or instant-message, addresses questions relating to orders, deliveries and returns, and also answers questions regarding fit, color, size and other style matters to ensure customer satisfaction. Across our five websites, customers can use multiple payment methods and pay in multiple currencies. While we do not extend direct credit to our customers, we do offer third-party payment alternatives that allow our customers to make installment payments. Our inventory tracking system enables our customers to receive real-time updates regarding the status of their orders. We offer excellent customer service, fast shipping and easy returns to all of our customers and our efficient operations allow us to send a high percentage of orders on the same day, subject to certain cut-off times being met. For shipping to and from certain countries, we have worked with our delivery partners to create dedicated “shipping lanes” that have resulted in faster service and lower costs. We are also able to ship to and service customers almost anywhere in the world.
Our Marketing Approach
We grow brand awareness, acquire new customers and drive traffic through a combination of brand and performance marketing strategies which generate traffic through both unpaid and paid sources.
Brand Marketing
Our brands seek to create an authentic voice that resonates with our customers. We update our websites and social channels daily with a consistent flow of fresh and authentic editorial content created by our in-house team and our network of influencers to engage our customers and drive online traffic. We aim to be an early adopter of social media channels that our customers engage with by quickly adapting marketing strategies and producing channel-specific content. To date, we have built a community of over 8.7 million followers across multiple social media channels, including Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and TikTok.
Princess Polly partners with an extensive network of approximately 11,000 influencers globally. The brand focuses on influencers with small and mid-sized followings, who tend to have an emotional connection with our brand and feature our products in an authentic way that resonates with our customers. In some cases, the brand partners with emerging influencers to create dedicated content for them to publish to their audience. The brand monitors the performance and effectiveness of its influencer network. We believe our influencer strategy not only creates a deeper relationship with our customers, but also diversifies the potential risk associated with individual celebrity or macro influencer endorsements. Leveraging learnings from Princess Polly, Culture Kings also began its own social media marketing program recently and has achieved early success.
Core to Culture Kings marketing strategy is their digital content and social media strategy surrounding their eight highly experiential retail stores in Australia and New Zealand. The stores feature a variety of public events and host creative activities that combine music, sports, art and fashion to engage our customers. The digital content created of the in-store events and gamification is piped out over social media, generating buzz and driving online traffic. We believe this event-driven and social media-led strategy cultivates a unique emotional connection and viral hype directly with the Culture Kings brand, not just the products it sells. Based on an internal customer survey conducted in November 2020, approximately 40% of Culture Kings customers in Australia made their first purchase after visiting a retail store.
Our recently introduced VIP and Loyalty programs focus on customer retention and drive increased customer lifetime value. Princess Polly’s loyalty program has already attracted over 1.4 million members since it launched in 2020. Through these programs we communicate directly with our top customers, providing them an exclusive experience with unique discounts, incentives, early product look features and access to events.
Unpaid Marketing
Our unpaid marketing sources can be characterized in two categories, organic and free channels. Organic traffic, which accounts for more than 60% of total traffic, is driven by direct traffic to our brands’ websites as well as customer discovery of our brands through organic search, our social media accounts and word of mouth, including other customers’ unpaid promotion of our brands on their social media accounts. We also generate traffic through other unpaid sources, which we characterize as free marketing, including personalized email marketing, SMS and mobile “push” communications through our apps. In 2021, unpaid traffic accounted for approximately 62% of total traffic.
Performance Marketing
While brand marketing is central to our marketing strategy, approximately 70-75% of our marketing expense is devoted to performance marketing efforts. We acquire and retain customers through retargeting, paid search/product listing ads, affiliate marketing and paid social. At Culture Kings, our Google analytics strategy allows us to efficiently list highly anticipated product drops. This strategy drives customer acquisition while we then largely focus retention efforts through our other marketing channels.
Our Technology Infrastructure
Our next-generation brands are built on a modern, flexible and scalable technology infrastructure which leverages a broad network of best-in-class, third-party technology providers. We then combine that customized presentation layer with the backend engine from Shopify, which is a proven and industry leading eCommerce solution. By pairing our own in-house technology with cloud software, we have been able to create a truly differentiated user experience that we can adjust as necessary while also leveraging engineering talent from some of the best SaaS companies in the world to scale rapidly and efficiently. Our cloud-based, SaaS native strategy allows us to adopt innovative, dynamic technology and capabilities with limited upfront investment and nimbly adopt market-leading technologies as they are introduced. We consider this to be a key differentiating factor compared to traditional retail proprietary technology stacks and for which switching to a more agile cloud-based SaaS solution could be too costly and risky.
Our technology infrastructure integrates seamlessly across our organization, connecting in a way that allows constant iteration and improvement. We leverage highly customizable solutions to provide customers optimal improved experiences, while limiting the costs and time required of custom bespoke solutions. This approach allows us to easily test new capabilities on a limited and low-cost basis, analyze and learn from the results, and then roll out more broadly if successful. We are leveraging our technology infrastructure to accelerate our scale and growth and drive efficiencies in areas spanning marketing, merchandising, customer experience, supply chain, operations and administration.
People & Culture
We promote a holistic approach to building our team and have created a culture that is inclusive, diverse and high performing. We seek out and hire team members who bring specialized, functional expertise while able to collaborate effectively across brands, functions and geographies. Our culture is fast-paced, promotes accountability, empowers team members to drive the business forward daily, stresses a bias toward action and embraces the individuality of each team member.
Attracting, motivating and retaining passionate talent at all levels is vital to continuing our success. We actively look for talented people across multiple geographies and promote a “work from anywhere” approach, which allows us to maintain a lean physical footprint and employ offices as team collaboration hubs. We continuously work to improve the team member experience to drive retention and engagement. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Our culture incents and rewards passionate, creative and results-oriented employees.
As of December 31, 2021, across a.k.a. Brands, we had more than 1,100 full-time employees. The majority of our workforce is located in Australia, with the remaining employees located throughout the United States. On a limited basis, we may use temporary personnel to supplement our workforce as business needs arise.
Competition
The online and offline retail markets generally are highly competitive and rapidly evolving. We face significant competition from eCommerce websites, including apparel- and accessories-oriented eCommerce websites as well as the eCommerce websites of traditional retailers. We also face competition from in-person stores and boutiques, including traditional retailers and fashion boutiques.
We compete based on product selection, differentiation, exclusivity, brand quality and strength of customer relationships, relevance, convenience, ease of use and consumer experience, including order fulfillment and shipping timelines. We believe we compete favorably across these factors taken as a whole.
Seasonality
We typically achieve our largest quarterly revenues in the fourth fiscal quarter. In fiscal year 2021, our net revenues in the first, second, third and fourth quarters represented 12%, 27%, 29% and 32%, respectively, of our total net revenues for the year. In fiscal year 2020, our net revenues in the first, second, third and fourth quarters represented 16%, 22%, 29% and 33%, respectively, of our total net revenues for the year. Revenues are typically higher during the months of November and December driven by higher holiday season spending.
Intellectual Property
We primarily protect our intellectual property through the trademark, copyright and trade secret laws of Australia and the United States. As of December 31, 2021, we owned approximately 470 trademark registrations, approximately 15 trademark applications and approximately 83 Internet domain names. Although we have not sought copyright registration for our technology or works to date, we rely on common law copyright and trade secret protections in relation to our proprietary technology, products and the content displayed on our websites, including our photography and fabric prints that we design. Our trademarks, including domain names, are material to our business and brand identity.
In addition to the protections provided by our intellectual property rights, we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, contractors and business partners. We further control the use of our technology and intellectual property through provisions in both our client terms of use on our website and in our vendor terms and conditions.
Sustainability and Responsible Fashion
a.k.a. Brands promotes sustainable, responsible and inclusive fashion and does so by focusing on four key areas: ethical sourcing, sustainable products, protecting the planet and equality and community.
Ethical sourcing: we aim to promote a safe and respected environment for workers who make our products and protect their human rights. For example, in 2021 Princess Polly became a participant of the United Nations Global Compact, and aligned our Earth Club mission with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Princess Polly’s program is built on 6 dimensions (Human Rights Policy, Code of Conduct, Ethical Sourcing Guidelines, Child and Force Labour Policy, Manufacturing and Packaging Guidelines, and Animal Welfare Policy), and aims to create adherence with suppliers and awareness with customers. Princess Polly requires all suppliers to adhere to its Human Rights Policy and requires all production factories to register with the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange (SEDEX). We work closely with our manufacturing partners to ensure a high standard of working conditions. Currently, 100% of Princess Polly products are produced in factories that have a valid SEDEX Members Ethical Trade audit. Princess Polly is the leader in our portfolio on sustainability, and we will leverage their best practices and apply them to the rest of our portfolio. We are devoted to making continual progress towards our commitments and being transparent along the way.
Sustainable products: we design products that put people, animals and the planet first. To that end, we aim to use sustainable materials for our products. At Princess Polly we use six main materials in all products including polyester, cotton, viscose, metals, nylon and acrylic. We are committed to working with our supply chain to source lower-impact alternatives for each of these materials, and to certify our factories to create lower-impact products. As part of this initiative, in February 2021 we released our first Princess Polly Earth Club Edit made from lower-impact materials, including organically grown cotton and recycled polyurethane. We are aiming to have over 40% of our products made with lower-impact materials by the end of 2022.
Protect the planet: by promoting circularity and improving the environmental impact of our packaging, business operations and factories. Our business model limits waste generation in our supply chain. Our real-time, demand-driven and automated ordering system allows production to track demand as accurately as possible. This high velocity, low wastage strategy allows us to avoid wastefulness.
Equality and community: We are committed to instilling an inclusive culture and promoting diversity across our brands. As such, we aim to represent the diversity of our customers in our marketing and offer the right product to serve their unique demand. Our brands Rebdolls, Culture Kings address the traditionally underserved yet fast-growing markets of plus-size female and men’s fashion, respectively. Rebdolls carries sizes 0 to 32 and approximately 70% of its customers are Black. 56% of Culture Kings’ customers are men.
Government Regulation
Our business is subject to a number of domestic and foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These laws and regulations include federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations (including the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union), which address, among other things, the processing of payments, privacy, data protection, information security, sending of commercial email and other laws regarding unfair and deceptive trade practices. We are also subject to laws and regulations governing the accessibility of our websites, including under the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Our business is also subject to additional laws and regulations, including restrictions on imports from, exports to, and services provided to persons located in certain countries and territories, as well as foreign laws and regulations addressing topics such as advertising and marketing practices, customs duties and taxes and consumer rights, any of which might apply by virtue of our operations in foreign countries and territories or our contacts with consumers in such foreign countries and territories.
In addition, apparel, shoes and accessories sold by us are also subject to regulation by governmental agencies in Australia, New Zealand and the United States, as well as various other federal, state, local and foreign regulatory authorities. These laws and regulations principally relate to the materials, proper labeling, advertising, marketing, manufacture, licensing requirements, flammability testing, safety, shipment and disposal of our products. We are also subject to laws, rules and regulations relating to the operations of our stores and warehouses.
We are also subject to environmental laws, rules and regulations. Similarly, apparel, shoes and accessories sold by us are also subject to import regulations in the United States and other countries concerning the use of wildlife products for commercial and non-commercial trade. We do not estimate any significant capital expenditures for environmental control matters either in the current fiscal year or in the near future.
