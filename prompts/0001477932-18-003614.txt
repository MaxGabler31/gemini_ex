Item 1: Business
 
Background of the Company
 
MMEX Resources Corporation was formed as a Nevada corporation in 2005. The current management team lead an acquisition of the Company (then named Management Energy, Inc.) through a reverse merger completed on September 23, 2010 and changed the Company’s name to MMEX Mining Corporation on February 11, 2011. We previously unsuccessfully pursued mining and coal projects that have since been abandoned. We have never generated any revenues and have accumulated losses of $35,077,288 as of April 30, 2018.
 
The Company was engaged in the exploration, extraction and distribution of coal from September 23, 2010 until April 12, 2016. As of April 12, 2016, the Company changed its business to the exploration, extraction, refining and distribution of oil, gas, petroleum products and electric power. Effective as of April 6, 2016, the Company changed its name from MMEX Mining Corporation to MMEX Resources Corporation to reflect the change in its business plan. 
 
We are a development stage company engaged in the exploration, extraction, refining and distribution of oil, gas, petroleum products and electric power. We plan to focus on the acquisition, development and financing of oil, gas, refining and electric power projects in Texas, Peru, and other countries in Latin America using the expertise of our principals to identify, finance and acquire these projects. 
 
The most significant focus of our current business plan is to build crude oil refining facilities in the Permian Basin in West Texas. We intend to implement our current business plan in two phases, First, through our subsidiary, Pecos Refining, we intend to build and commence operation of a 10,000 bpd crude oil Distillation Unit that will produce a non-transportation grade diesel primarily for sale in the local market for drilling frac fluids, along with naphtha and heavy fuel oil to be sold to other refiners. Second, through a separate subsidiary, we intend to build and commence operation of the Large Refinery with up to 100,000 bpd capacity at the same location in West Texas. These projects will be built on 476 acres located 20 miles northeast of Fort Stockton, Texas, near the Sulfur Junction spur of the Texas Pacifico Railroad.

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
 
Background on Refining
 
Oil refining is the process of separating hydrocarbon molecules present in crude oil and converting them into marketable, finished petroleum products, such as gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, lubricants and petrochemicals. Refining is primarily a margin-based business where both the feedstock (primarily crude oil) and refined petroleum products are commodities with fluctuating prices. Refiners create profit by selling refined petroleum products at prices higher than the costs of acquiring crude oil and other feedstocks, and by managing operating costs. It is important for a refinery to maximize the yields of high value finished products and to minimize the costs of feedstock and operating expenses. Access to robust supply and distribution infrastructure such as pipelines or rail infrastructure that can deliver low-cost crude oil and provide for the delivery of refined products is also a key driver of profitability. 
 
The United States has historically been the largest consumer of petroleum-based products in the world. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (the “EIA”) 2016 Refinery Capacity Report, there were 139 operating oil refineries in the United States in January 2015, with a total refining capacity of approximately 18.2 million bpd. High capital costs, historical excess capacity and environmental regulatory requirements have limited the construction of new refineries in the United States over the past 35 years and reduced the number of refineries from 254 in 1982 to 139 in 2016. Domestic operating refining capacity has increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 0.3% between January 1982 and January 2016, from 16.1 million bpd to 18.2 million bpd, according to the EIA. This net increase in capacity is the result of efficiency measures and expansions at various refineries, partially offset by the closure of more than 115 smaller and less efficient refineries. The Refinery, if built, will be the first fully-new large scale refinery built in the United States in the last 40 years. 
 
Industry Terminology
 
Crack Spreads 
 
Crack spreads are a proxy for refining margins and refer to the margin that would be derived from the simultaneous purchase of crude oil and the sale of refined petroleum products, in each case at the then-prevailing price. The 2-1-1 crack spread assumes two barrels of crude oil will be converted, or “cracked,” into one barrel of gasoline and one barrel of heating oil or diesel fuel. Average 2-1-1 crack spreads vary from region to region throughout the United States, depending on the supply and demand balances of crude oils and refined products. 
 
Actual refinery margins vary from benchmark crack spreads due to the actual crude oils used and products produced, transportation costs, regional differences and the timing of the purchase of the feedstock and sale of light products.

Benchmark Crude Oils 
 
Crude oil pricing is generally quoted in reference to the classification of the crude oil, which is based on certain physical characteristics, the source of its production and the major trading hub with which it is associated. Relevant classifications of crude oil include:

· | West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”). WTI is a grade of crude oil that is described as light because of its relatively low density, and sweet because of its low sulfur content. Cushing, Oklahoma is a major trading hub for WTI and has been the delivery point for crude oil contracts, and therefore the price settlement point, on the NYMEX for over three decades. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Louisiana Light Sweet (“LLS”). LLS is a major benchmark for light, sweet crude oil that is sourced from the Gulf Coast region. It has a slightly higher density and slightly lower sulfur content than WTI. 
· | Brent Crude Oil (“Brent”). Brent is a major trading classification of light, sweet crude oil comprised of Brent, Forties and Oseberg and Ekofisk, which are types of crude oil blends sourced from the North Sea. The Intercontinental Exchange is a major trading hub for Brent. Petroleum suppliers in Europe, Africa and the Middle East often set prices for Brent crude oil according to its value on the Intercontinental Exchange if it is being sold in the Western Hemisphere.

Operating Costs 
 
Major operating costs for refineries include employee labor, maintenance and energy. Employee labor and maintenance are relatively fixed costs that generally increase in proportion to inflation. By far, the predominant variable cost is energy such as natural gas, electricity and refinery fuel gas. 
Refinery Location
 
The Refinery will be located in the Permian Basin of Texas. According to the EIA, between January 2016 and March 2017, oil production in the Permian Basin increased in all but three months, even as domestic crude oil prices fell. As production in other regions fell throughout most of 2015 and 2016, the Permian Basin provided a growing share of U.S. crude oil production. 
 
With rising oil prices over the past year, the Permian Basin continues to be attractive to drillers, as reflected in rising rig counts. According to the EIA, as of April 21, 2017, the number of rigs in the Permian Basin reached 340, or 40% of the 857 total oil- and natural gas-directed rigs operating in the United States. The Permian Basin rig count reached as high as 568 in late 2014 before falling to a low of 134 in spring 2016 and increasing to 340 in April 2017. According to Baker Hughes, the Permian Basin Rig Count as of July 13, 2018 was 476 active rigs.

Recent geological surveys have further explored the resources contained in the Permian Basin. In November 2016, the U.S. Geological Survey (“USGS”) estimated that technically recoverable tight oil and shale gas resources in the Midland Basin portion of Texas’ Permian Basin (specifically the Wolfcamp shale formation) could exceed 20 billion barrels of oil, 16 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and 1.6 billion barrels of hydrocarbon gas liquids. The technically recoverable resource estimate for tight oil in the Midland Basin portion of the Permian Basin is higher than any previous USGS assessment of tight oil resources in any domestic resource basin.

The production from these US shale basins, including the Permian Basin, is predominantly light, sweet crude oil, with gravity in excess of 35 degrees API. As a result, coincident with the growth in crude oil from these shale basins, U.S. imports of light crude oil began declining in 2010.

Access to Domestic Crude Oil Provides Certain Refiners an Input Cost Advantage 
 
Given the price differential between domestic and foreign crude oil over the past several years, refiners that have had access to low-cost domestic crude oil have demonstrated consistently higher margins relative to refiners that did not have access. Until the transportation infrastructure described above was built out, refineries in PADD II (Midwest), PADD III (Gulf Coast) and PADD IV (Rocky Mountain) have had access to these cheaper domestic crude oils via pipeline while refineries in PADD I (East Coast) and PADD V (West Coast) had to rely more heavily on waterborne imports or costly deliveries of domestic crude oil from the Gulf Coast via Jones Act compliant coastal barges and vessels. 
 
This advantage is reflected in comparing the 2-1-1 crack spread using WTI crude oil as the input against the same crack spread using Brent crude oil as the input. According to information from the EIA, for the period from 2011 to mid-2013 the 2-1-1 WTI crack spread ranged from approximately $3 per barrel higher than the Brent crack spread to over $20 per barrel higher. From mid-2013 to 2015, the WTI crack spread over the Brent crack spread narrowed, ranging from a high of approximately $11 per barrel to a low of less than $1. After 2014, the WTI crack spread and Brent crack spread narrowed even further, with the Brent crack spread exceeding the WTI crack spread for brief periods. For the first few months of 2017, the WTI crack spread has exceeded the Brent-WTI crack spread by $2 or less per barrel
 
The United States is Becoming a Larger Exporter of Gasoline and Distillate, Including to Mexico 
 
Coincident with accelerating crude oil production growth in the U.S. shale basins in 2010 and 2011, U.S. refining capacity utilization has increased significantly, as noted above. This has led to the U.S. becoming a net exporter of gasoline and distillate. One of the strongest export markets for US gasoline is Mexico, the market the Company intends to pursue. 
 
The Mexican government is in the process of opening its gasoline and diesel markets to outside competition and replacing government-set prices with market-based prices. Last year, Mexico began allowing entities other than the state-owned company Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex) to import gasoline and diesel and open retail stations. These changes followed previous energy sector reforms that ended Pemex’s upstream monopoly and opened the oil and natural gas sectors to foreign direct investment. According to the EIA, although Mexico is a large crude oil producer, it relies heavily on imports of gasoline from the United States to meet domestic demand. Based on reports from the EIA, the Company expects that these gasoline and diesel market reforms in Mexico will have significant implications for the sale of U.S.-produced gasoline. 
 
The switch to market-based pricing in Mexico is being implemented in phases starting with a series of national price adjustments. The transition began at the start of this year. As reported by the EIA, January retail prices have averaged 14% and 20% higher than in December for regular gasoline and premium gasoline, respectively. 
 
For the past several years, Pemex total gasoline sales, which can be used as an estimate for consumption, averaged around 800,000 bpd. However, gasoline sales increased 2.5% and averaged nearly 820,000 bpd in 2016 (through November). Mexican consumption of gasoline has been significantly greater than refinery production, with the difference increasing over the past three years.

According to the EIA, Mexico’s refineries have historically been running at low utilization rates because they are challenged to produce clean gasoline and distillate fuels from the available marginal barrel of heavy sour crude oil. More recently, outages have hampered Mexico’s six refineries, which had a total output (including non-gasoline products) of 1.1 million bpd through November 2016, down from 1.3 million bpd over the same months in 2015. Mexican refinery output of gasoline fell steeply to 381,000 bpd in 2015 and then fell again to 333,000 bpd in 2016 (through November). Refinery utilization rates in Mexico declined in 2016 from 78% in January to 60% in November, creating a widening gap between domestic supply and demand. 
 
To meet demand, Mexican imports of gasoline have climbed rapidly over the past two years. According to Pemex, Mexico’s motor gasoline imports were 122,000 bpd higher during the first 11 months of 2016 than during the comparable 2014 period. Since 2008, EIA data indicates that Mexico has imported significant quantities of U.S. gasoline. Based on U.S. and Mexican data sets, U.S. gasoline exports accounted for 80% of all Mexican gasoline imports and provided an average of 47% of Mexico’s gasoline consumption during the first 10 months of 2016.
 


According to the EIA and Pemex, the volume of gasoline traded between Mexico and the United States is significant to U.S. refineries. Over the past five years, U.S. exports to Mexico accounted for between 44% (2014) and 54% (first 10 months of 2016) of total U.S. gasoline exports. On a year-over-year basis, U.S. gasoline exports to Mexico increased by 71,000 bpd in 2015, with additional average growth of 75,000 bpd over the first 10 months of 2016, when U.S. exports to Mexico averaged nearly 390,000 bpd.

While the effects of the ambitious reforms now underway in Mexico’s energy sector will only be realized over an extended period of time, the Company believes that the market will be very positive relative to the Company plans to market and sell its gasoline and diesel production in Western Mexico.
 
Outlook for Refining
 
Recent industry and financial research outline that refining industry fundamentals are more favorable than they have been in a number of years. Morgan Stanley in a recent research report states: 
 
“A tectonic shift is underway on how new capital investments in refining are being thought about, as even good margins in past three years have not been able to attract major investments on concerns of competition from alternative fuels. We believe this divergence from earlier cycles primes up the refinery industry for the golden age. An overlay of new environmental norms, rising global miles driven (cars, airlines) and improving EM growth just makes margin on refining look stronger than ever.”

Permian Basin Pipeline Take-away Capacity
 
Today, the take-away capacity of crude pipelines from the Permian Basin to the Texas Gulf Coast is constrained to ship more crude oil. The discount price to WTI posted prices is in the $10 plus per Bbl range. The ability to purchase our feedstock at these discounts adds to our normal “crack spread” and we are pushing to start construction and get into commercial operation as soon as possible to take advantage of this arbitrage. Our decision to locate our refinery on the Texas Pacifico-South Orient Railroad, allowing us to go by rail to the Texas Gulf Coast is now a major strategic advantage and in addition to product distribution we are also being approached for crude oil storage and transportation services as an adjunct to our refining capabilities.

Current Business Operations and Strategy
 
The most significant focus of our current business plan is to build crude oil refining facilities in the Permian Basin in West Texas. We intend to commence operations with a 10,000 bpd Distillation Unit that will produce a non-transportation grade diesel primarily for sale in the local market for drilling mud and frac fluids, along with naphtha and heavy fuel oil to be sold to other refiners. We also anticipate constructing a crude oil refinery with up to a 100,000 bpd capacity at the same location in West Texas. 
 
The Company is focusing on the Distillation Unit first in an effort to build and commence operations, and ultimately generate cash flow, on an expedited basis. The permitting process is significantly shorter for construction of the Distillation Unit and was received by the Company on August 30, 2017. The permitting process for the Large Refinery is expected to be 12-18 months. Additionally, the construction of the Distillation Unit will require significantly less capital than the construction of the Large Refinery. 
 
On March 4, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with Maple Resources, a related party, to acquire Maple Resources’ business plan for the Refinery, cash flow models, an agreement to acquire the land for the Refinery site, potential refinery feed stock supplies, and business relationships for water resources, consulting services, refinery technology and potential railroad transportation agreements. The acquired assets did not include title to the site for the Refinery or any actual right to build the Refinery. The Company agreed to acquire all of these intangible assets in exchange for the issuance of 7,000,000,000 shares of Class B common stock. The shares were to be issued in two tranches, a first tranche of 1,500,000,000 shares issued on March 4, 2017 and a second tranche of 5,500,000,000 shares to be issued after the Company’s articles of incorporation were amended to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock. Following the issuance of the first tranche of 1,500,000 shares, Maple Resources agreed to forego the issuance of the second tranche of shares. Accordingly, no further shares will be issued to Maple Resources as part of this transaction.
 
These projects will be built on 476 acres located 20 miles northeast of Fort Stockton, Texas, near the Sulfur Junction spur of the Texas Pacifico Railroad. If successfully developed, the Refinery would connect to existing railways and pipelines to market diesel, gasoline, liquefied petroleum gas and other refined products within the U.S., with the potential to market these products and crude oil to western Mexico and South America. If completed, the Large Refinery will be one of the first full scale oil refineries built in the United States in more than 40 years. 
 
We are actively considering the inclusion in our Distillation Unit project of a crude oil storage and dispatch facility (RSD). If successful, we would accelerate the build out of the rail trackage, the crude oil storage tanks, and rail and truck loading and unloading capabilities of the Distillation Unit project. We propose to charge a per barrel fee to receive, store and dispatch crude oil to the Texas Gulf Coast markets. We are also in negotiations with an international equipment supplier and its financing affiliate to provide the equipment and separate financing for the RSD. If we are successful in financing and constructing the RSD, this will give us the opportunity to be in commercial operation in 2019 and accelerating the timing of our projected cash flow. However, there can no assurance as to the success of the RSD component of our planned facility. 
 
The Company currently estimates that construction costs for the Distillation Unit, inclusive of the potential RSD facility, will be approximately $69 million. According to a report the Company received from KP Engineering, the cost of a 50,000 bpd refinery is estimated to be approximately $500 million and the cost of a 100,000 bpd refinery is estimated to be approximately $850 million. These estimates are only preliminary estimates and are subject to substantial change when additional engineering is completed. 
 
Constructing the Refinery will require a significant number of governmental permits and approvals. The principal permit for the construction of the Refinery is the air quality permit issued by TCEQ and significant construction will not begin until we have received it. On August 30, 2017, we received approval from the TCEQ for the air quality permit for the Distillation Unit. Trinity Consultants, the Company’s air quality permit advisor, estimates it will take approximately 18 months to obtain the air quality permit for the Large Refinery. According to VFuels Oil & Gas Engineering, construction for the Distillation Unit would take approximately 12 to 15 months. KP Engineering has estimated that the completion of the Large Refinery would take from 15 to 18 months following the receipt of the air quality permit. 
 

10

 
The cost of construction is very significant and we intend to finance 100% of such costs through debt and equity offerings . See “Business—Proposed Organizational Structure.” 
 
We plan on marketing and distributing refined products in the Western areas of the United States and Mexico, and we may export product to Latin America. The diesel produced by the Distillation Unit will be marketed and sold locally, primarily for use in drilling mud and frac fluids, and likely transported by truck or by existing railroad systems. Any other refined products produced from the operation of the Distillation Unit (principally ATBs and naptha) would be shipped to other refineries, primarily in the Houston or Corpus Christi, Texas areas, by pipeline and existing railroad systems for further processing. 
 
The Refinery will be located on the Texas Pacifico Railroad rail route 20 miles Northeast of Fort Stockton, Texas, approximately 1.5 miles from the Sulphur Junction on the Texas Pacifico Railroad. Once needed repairs are finished to the tracks and railway, the Texas Pacifico Railroad will connect to the Ferromex RR in Ojinago, Mexico, giving us access to the western Mexico markets. 
 
The Texas Department of Transportation owns the Texas Pacifico Railroad, which runs from the San Angelo Junction, near Coleman, Texas, to the Texas-Mexico border at Presidio. The Texas Pacifico Railroad entails approximately 371 miles of track and interchanges with BNSF Railway and Fort Worth and Western Railroad. The Texas Pacifico Railroad is operated by Texas Pacifico Transportation LTD, a subsidiary of Grupo Mexico. Our planned Refinery is located on the Texas Pacifico Railroad rail route approximately 20 miles northeast of Fort Stockton, Texas, approximately 1.5 miles from the Sulphur Junction on the Texas Pacifico Railroad. The Texas Pacifico Railroad will connect to the Ferromex Railroad at Ojinaga, Mexico. 
 
We have also commenced initial discussions regarding a solar power project to be located on leased acreage near the Refinery. If successfully financed and completed, we would expect to utilize a portion of the generated power for the Refinery, with the balance to be sold into the Texas grid. There is no assurance that the solar power project will be financed or constructed.
 
Management Expertise in Oil, Gas, Refining and Electric Power Project Development and Project Finance Development

The Board of Directors has decided to focus the Company’s efforts in the oil, gas, refining and electric power business in the U.S. and in Latin America. The principal reasons behind this shift in focus is to capitalize on the experience and expertise of the MMEX management team, its directors and principal stockholders. MMEX management has over 30 years of experience in natural resource project development and project financing in North and South America and the U.K. In addition, MMEX directors and principal stockholders with oil, gas, refining and electric power experience will bring this expertise into the Company.
 
MMEX principals formed Maple Resources Corporation (“Maple Resources”) in 1986 to engage in the evaluation, acquisition and development of oil & gas, refining, power generation, natural gas transmission and processing energy projects in the western United States and Latin America. Maple Resources and its principals have engaged in a number of oil and gas acquisitions and dispositions and ultimately acquired assets that included 10 gas processing plants and approximately 770 miles of natural gas gathering lines and transmission infrastructure. In 1992, Maple Resources sold substantially all of its existing US-based assets and began to pursue energy projects in Latin America, particularly in Peru through its affiliate The Maple Gas Corporation del Peru Ltd (“Maple Peru”). In 1993, Maple Peru began developing the Aguaytía Project, an integrated natural gas and electric power generation and transmission project. This US$273 million project involved the first commercial development of a natural gas field in Peru, as well as the construction and operation of approximately 175 miles of hydrocarbon pipelines, a gas processing plant, a fractionation facility, a 153 MW power plant and the related 392 km of electricity transmission lines. The Aguaytía Project began commercial operation in 1998. Maple Peru also acquired a 4,000 bpd refinery in Pucallpa along with 3 producing oil fields.
 
Jack Hanks, our President and CEO, is no longer engaged in the active business operations of Maple Peru and is able to devote substantially all of his business time to his duties on behalf of the Company. Further, we do not anticipate that Maple Resources will present any conflicts of interest for the MMEX principals in carrying out their responsibilities on behalf of the Company.

Proposed Organizational Structure
 
The Company expects to operate the Distillation Unit through its subsidiary, Pecos Refining, and to operate the Large Refinery through another subsidiary set up for such purpose. Currently, Pecos Refining is wholly-owned by the Company and the Company serves as its sole manager. However, the construction of the Distillation Unit and the Large Refinery will require substantial equity and debt financing, far beyond the expected resources of the Company, and we anticipate that the Subsidiaries will obtain equity and debt financing to finance the cost of construction. To the extent these Subsidiaries raise money through the issuance of equity securities, our ownership in the Subsidiaries will be diluted and our economic ownership of such entities may be a minority interest. As such, we will be entitled to only a portion of any future distributions made by these Subsidiaries. In addition, while intend to retain managerial control of the Subsidiaries, it is possible that equity investors will require representation on the board of managers in connection with their equity investments.
 
We anticipate these Subsidiaries will be able to finance approximately 80% of the total costs of the Distillation Unit and the Large Refinery through debt financing, and the remaining 20% of the total costs would be financed through equity investments. We intend to pursue the required debt financing from banks or other large institutional investors. Traditionally, such debt financing is in the form of project financing, which among other terms will require the Subsidiary borrow to restrict its activities to the operation of the project financed by the lender, to pledge all assets of the project to the lender and to be subject to restrictive financial covenants. Such lenders further typically require engineering, marketing and feasibility studies as a condition precedent to the financing. In order to attract the significant capital necessary to build the Refinery, the Company will have to fund the cost of these reports and studies, likely out of equity raises. We have estimated that such cost will aggregate approximately $400,000. 
 
Location and Logistics
 
The Refinery will be located in the Permian Basin, which holds some of the largest tapped and untapped oil and gas reserves in the world. The Permian Basis is located principally in West Texas. While production in the Permian Basin in the past had been in decline, the development of hydraulic fracturing in shale zones reversed the trend, and the cost of developing oil and gas reserves from shale formations (the driver of recent US increases in production) is lower in the Permian Basin than in other areas of the US. For this reason, the activity in the Permian Basin has recently been expanding and drawing the interest of major oil and gas companies. We believe that the Permian Basin will be the major domestic producing region in the country for decades to come. 
 
The Refinery will be located 20 miles northeast of Fort Stockton, Texas, near the Sulfur Junction spur of the Texas Pacifico Railroad and in the Permian Basin. The Refinery site is 476 acres and the rail line runs through a corner of the property. We do not currently own all of the land on the site near Fort Stockton, Texas at which we intend to build the Refinery. On July 28, 2017, we acquired the 126 acre parcel of the land, which is the site for the planned Distillation Unit, at a purchase price of $550 per acre, or $69,249. We have invested another $212,456 in easements and road construction related to the easements. We are continuing to negotiate with the seller of the property to acquire an additional 381 acre parcel, which is the site for the planned Large Refinery at a price of $550 per acre, or approximately $210,000. We have not yet received any financing commitment for such purchase.
 
There are six refineries in the Permian Basin located at El Paso, Texas; McKee, Texas; Borger, Texas; Big Spring, Texas; and Artesia, New Mexico. The total capacity of these refineries is 640,500 bpd. These refineries are older refineries designed to process historic production from the Permian Basin. As such, these refineries do not take high-API production or discount it significantly, such as the production being produced from the hydraulically-fractured shale zones in which the current increase in production is occurring in the Permian Basin. Moreover, the increasing amount of shale oil production has outpaced these refineries’ ability to process the new crude oil production. For these reasons, much of the new shale production is currently being exported out of the Permian Basin. Significant infrastructure improvements have been developed and announced to move Permian Basin production to the Texas Gulf Coast. According to the EIA, these infrastructure improvements have and will decrease the discount to WTI pricing that has often plagued the sale of Permian Basin shale crude in the recent past. The Company believes that while the construction of crude oil pipelines from the Permian Basin to the significant refining infrastructure in the Texas Gulf Coast might decrease discounts, pipeline companies will charge significant fees to transport the new shale production out of the Permian Basin, resulting, in effect, in a continued discount for such production, compared to the delivered price to the Refinery. 
 

12

 
The Refinery will be located near the major producing shale areas of the Permian Basin in Reeves and Pecos counties. The Company has signed a letter of intent with a significant mid-stream crude oil and pipeline company to supply 50,000 bpd of crude oil production to the Refinery. The Company believes that this arrangement can be expanded to 100,000 bpd should the Company choose to build a 100,000 bpd facility. The arrangement is subject to substantial conditions and there is no assurance that the arrangement can be successfully implemented with this particular company. But, the Company believes there are a number of alternative means of delivering the ever-increasing supply of oil shale production from the Permian Basin to the Refinery site, whether by truck, construction of gathering pipelines by another company or by rail. 
 
The Company’s business plan includes the export of gasoline, diesel and other products produced from the Refinery. The export of gasoline and diesel production is particularly attractive because, as noted above, exported gasoline and diesel does not bear any RIN costs, which is a significant cost of domestic refiners. The export of gasoline and diesel will therefore be a significant way to increase profits of the Refinery. 
 
There are opportunities to sell refined products domestically, and there are significant refined product pipelines throughout the Permian Basin. Indeed, for some of the products produced by the Refinery, such as ATBs, the logical market is other domestic refineries that are designed to use these products as feedstock. The Company has had favorable preliminary discussions with product pipeline companies regarding the transport of the refined products from the Refinery, but there are no arrangements or contracts in place. 
 
Transportation
 
We will likely be transporting refined products primarily by rail. Both the U.S. Department of Transportation and its agency, the Federal Railroad Administration, have issued regulations pertaining to the shipment of crude oil and refined products. In addition, TxDOT has its own set of regulations pertaining to these matters, and Mexico will have additional regulations governing the transport of refined products and crude oil. As part of the construction of the Refinery, we will develop procedures and policies in connection with our shipping partners and buyers to comply with all relevant regulations. 
 
We intend to transport the diesel production from our Distillation Unit by truck or by existing railroad systems within the Permian Basin for use in drilling fracking markets. We intend to transport other of our refined products, principally ATBs and naptha, to other refineries, primarily in the Houston and Corpus Christi, Texas areas, by pipeline and existing railroad systems for further processing. 
 
TxDOT owns the Texas Pacifico Railroad, which runs from the San Angelo Junction, near Coleman, Texas, to the Texas-Mexico border at Presidio. The Texas Pacifico Railroad entails approximately 371 miles of track and interchanges with BNSF Railway and Fort Worth and Western Railroad. The Texas Pacifico Railroad is operated by Texas Pacifico Transportation LTD, a subsidiary of Grupo Mexico. Our planned Refinery is located on the Texas Pacifico Railroad rail route approximately 20 miles northeast of Fort Stockton, Texas, approximately 1.5 miles from the Sulphur Junction on the Texas Pacifico Railroad. The Texas Pacifico Railroad will connect to the Ferromex Railroad at Ojinaga, Mexico. 
 
We plan to transport refined product on the Texas Pacifico Railroad and significant investments are required to upgrade the railroad. TxDOT owns the Texas Pacifico Railroad, which runs from the San Angelo Junction, near Coleman, Texas, to the Texas-Mexico border at Presidio. There are two significant infrastructure improvement projects that TxDOT must be complete before we will be able to use the Texas Pacifico Railroad to transport our production to Mexico as we have planned. 
 
The international railroad bridge, located at the southwestern end of the rail line connecting Presidio, TX to Ojinaga, Mexico burned on two separate occasions, February 29, 2008 and March 1, 2009. TxDOT and Texas Pacifico Transportation LTD, the company that operates the Texas Pacifico Railroad, plan to rebuild the bridge allowing access to Mexico and increased business potential. On August 4, 2017, Tx DOT announced a $7 million federal grant from The U.S. Department of Transportation to strengthen existing rail infrastructure in Permian Basin. As announced on August 4, the funds are expected to help rebuild the Presidio-Ojinaga International Rail Bridge and 72 miles of track on the South Orient Rail Line that run from the Mexico border to near Coleman, Texas owned by the state of Texas but maintained and operated by Texas Pacifico Transportation, Ltd. under a lease with TxDOT. A recent project schedule estimates the completion date to be in 2019.

In addition, the railroad track between Alpine and Presidio may be upgraded as traffic requires through the area. The upgrade capital improvements required on the Texas Pacifico Railroad to transport significant volumes of traffic are estimated by TxDOT to be in the range of $100 million to $150 million. Our business plan to market refined products into Western Mexico and to export refined products to Latin America will depend on the completion of the international bridge at Presidio/Ojinaga and the capital investment on the Texas Pacifico Railroad railroad. There is no assurance that these capital improvements will be made. If these capital improvements are not made, our business prospects and results of operations could be materially negatively impacted.
 
The Company business plan may also include marketing diesel, gasoline and other refined products in the western areas of Mexico and to transport those products along Grupo Mexico’s rail lines to the Mexican port of Topolobampo located on the Gulf of Mexico for export to Latin America. This business plan depends on the completion of the track upgrades and the completion of the bridge at Presidio/Ojinaga. The Company believes that the market exists in Western Mexico and in Latin America for the refined products that it plans to ship, but it has no arrangements in place to market and sell its products in those areas. 
 
Construction of the Refinery
 
The Large Refinery would cover approximately 250 acres of the 476 acre property on which the Company holds an option. Before construction on the Refinery can commence, the Company must obtain all required permits. The Distillation Unit would cover approximately 15 acres of the property. Constructing the Refinery will require a significant number of governmental permits and approvals. The principal permit for the construction of the Refinery is the air quality permit issued by TCEQ and significant construction will not begin until we have received it. On August 30, 2017, we received approval from the TCEQ for the air quality permit for the Distillation Unit. Trinity Consultants, the Company’s air quality permit advisor, estimates it will take approximately 15 to 18 months to obtain the air quality permit for the Large Refinery, once filed. The other principal permits that will be required are the following:

We have not yet filed for any of the foregoing permits.
 
The Company has hired VFuels Oil & Gas Engineering to advise it with respect to the construction of the Distillation Unit. Vfuels has prepared a preliminary report regarding the estimated cost and time-line for construction of the Distillation Unit. VFuels’ estimated cost of a 10,000 bpd facility in December of 2017 has been adjusted upward to $69 million taking into account the current increased costs of cement, steel and labor in the Permian Basin, to add desalter equipment for crude specification flexibility to the Distillation Unit and to increase the rail capacity at the site. We now project the completion of the Refinery in Q3 2019 
 
The Company has hired KP Engineering to advise it with respect to the construction of the Refinery. KP Engineering has prepared a preliminary report regarding the estimated cost and time-line for construction of the Refinery. KP Engineering has estimated the cost of a 50,000 bpd refinery to be approximately $500 million and the cost of a 100,000 bpd refinery to be approximately $850 million. These estimates are only preliminary estimates and are subject to substantial change when additional engineering is completed. KP Engineering has estimated that the completion of the Large Refinery would take from 15 to 18 months following the receipt of the air quality permit. 
 
Building a refinery is a complicated, costly and time-consuming process. The preliminary report from KP Engineering must be followed by other detailed engineering reports. But, these reports are all essential to the financing of the construction and development of the Refinery.
 
Employees

As of April 30, 2018, we had no employees and our executive officer and our two directors had not received any compensation. We contract for all professional services when needed.
Legal Proceedings
 
There are no legal proceedings against the Company.
 
Environmental Regulations Pertaining to Refinery Operations. 
 
The operations of the Refinery will be subject to complex and frequently-changing federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of health and the environment, including laws and regulations that govern the handling and release of crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbon materials. As with the industry generally, compliance with existing and anticipated environmental laws and regulations increases our overall cost of business, including our capital costs to construct, maintain, operate, and upgrade equipment and facilities. While these laws and regulations affect our maintenance, capital expenditures and net income, we do not believe they affect our competitive position, as the operations of our competitors are similarly affected. Violations of environmental laws or regulations can result in the imposition of significant administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties and, in some instances, injunctions banning or delaying certain activities. We will adopt policies and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. However, these laws and regulations are subject to frequent change at the federal, state and local levels, and the legislative and regulatory trend has been to place increasingly stringent limitations on activities that may affect the environment.

15

Clean Air Act. 
 
The environmental laws and regulations applicable to the Refinery include permitting and monitoring activities relating to air emissions under the federal Clean Air Act, and its implementing regulations, as well as comparable state and local statutes and regulations. Failure to comply with these rules can result in severe penalties and potential shut down of facilities. We will be required to develop policies and procedures to comply with all these laws and regulations. 
Greenhouse Gas Emissions. 
 
Various legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane emissions, are in different phases of implementation and discussion. At the federal legislative level, both houses of Congress have considered legislation to reduce GHG emissions, including proposals to: (i) establish a cap-and-trade system, (ii) create a federal renewable or “clean” energy standard requiring electric utilities to provide a certain percentage of power from such sources, and (iii) create enhanced incentives for use of renewable energy and increased energy efficiency in energy supply and use. A number of states, both individually and on a regional basis, have adopted measures to reduce carbon dioxide and other GHG emissions, including statewide GHG inventories and regional GHG cap-and-trade initiatives. The EPA has also begun to regulate GHG emissions under the authority granted to it by the federal Clean Air Act. The EPA has adopted regulations limiting emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles, addressing the permitting of GHG emissions from stationary sources, and requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources, including petroleum refineries. The implementation of EPA regulations could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls on our facilities and (iii) administer and manage any GHG emissions program. Increased costs associated with compliance with any current or future legislation or regulation of GHG emissions, if it occurs, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, climate change legislation and regulations may result in increased costs not only for our business but also for our customers, thereby potentially decreasing demand for our products and services. Decreased demand for our products and services may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
Release of Hazardous Substances. 
 
Environmental laws and regulations affecting our operations also relate to the release of hazardous substances or solid wastes into the soil, groundwater, and surface water, and include measures to control pollution of the environment. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation, and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. They also require corrective action, including investigation and remediation, at a facility where such waste may have been released or disposed. There are risks of accidental releases into the environment associated with our operations, such as releases of crude oil or hazardous substances from our pipelines or storage facilities. To the extent an event is not covered by our insurance policies, accidental releases could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage, and fines or penalties for any related violations of environmental laws or regulations. 
CERCLA. 
 
The Refinery property and any wastes disposed therefrom may be subject to the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and comparable Texas state laws. CERCLA and comparable state laws may impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons regarding the presence or release of a hazardous substance in (or into) the environment, which may include the disposal of wastes generated by the Refinery, even if the wastes are taken from the Refinery by others and disposed by them. We will develop procedures and policies to ensure compliance with these laws. 
 
Our operations may potentially result in the discharge of regulated substances, including crude oil, refined products, or natural gas liquids. The federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of regulated substances into waters of the United States or state waters. We will develop policies and procedures to ensure compliance with these rules.
 

16

Renewable Identification Numbers. 
 
In 2007, the EPA promulgated the Renewable Fuel Standard (“RFS”), which requires refiners to blend “renewable fuels” in with their transportation fuels or purchase renewable fuel credits, known as renewable identification numbers (“RINs”), in lieu of blending. Under the Clean Air Act the EPA is required to determine and publish the applicable annual renewable fuel percentage standards for each compliance year by November 30 of the prior year. However, the EPA has repeatedly missed that deadline. The percentage standards represent the ratio of renewable fuel volume to gasoline and diesel volume. For all domestically-sold gasoline and diesel fuels we produce at the Refinery, we will be required to blend renewable fuels into our gasoline and diesel fuel or purchase RINs in lieu of blending. The Refinery intends to purchase RINs on the open market or waiver credits from the EPA to comply with the RFS. While we cannot predict the future prices of RINs or waiver credits, the price of RINs can be extremely volatile. RINs will constitute a genuinely significant cost of operations for the Refinery relative to domestically-sold gasoline and diesel, which is why we intend to export gasoline and diesel to the fullest extent possible. 
 
If the Refinery’s gasoline or diesel is sold domestically, we and other similarly-situated refiners may become more reliant on the purchase of RINs and waiver credits on the open market to comply with the RFS in the future. The cost of RINs is dependent upon a variety of factors, which include the volume mandates set by EPA, the availability of RINs for purchase, the price at which RINs can be purchased, transportation fuel production levels and the mix of our petroleum products, all of which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. In addition, numerous instances of fraudulent RINs being made available on the market have led EPA to impose penalties on RIN purchasers, even those with no knowledge of the fraudulent nature of the RINs. If we purchase invalid RINs, or fail to properly keep records in accordance with EPA’s rules and regulations, we could be subject to fines and penalties.
 
Safety, Security and Insurance Concerns in Operating Refineries. 
 
The Refinery will be subject to the Department of Homeland Security’s Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards, which are designed to regulate the security of high-risk chemical facilities, and to the Transportation Security Administration’s Pipeline Security Guidelines and Transportation Worker Identification Credential program. We will have to have an internal program of inspection designed to monitor and enforce compliance with all of these requirements, and we will need to develop a Facility Security Plan as required under the relevant law. We will also have to have in place procedures to monitor compliance with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the security of all our facilities.
 
The Refinery will also be subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We will also be subject to OSHA Process Safety Management regulations, which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals. We will take measures to ensure that our operations are in substantial compliance with OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements, and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances.
