ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
 
Bravatek Solutions, Inc., a Colorado corporation (the “Company”), was incorporated on April 19, 2007, as eCrypt Technologies, Inc. Effective October 23, 2015, the Company changed its name to “Bravatek Solutions, Inc.” in order to better reflect the Company's expanding operations and strategy. The Company's business operations are oriented around the marketing and distribution of proprietary and allied security, defense and information security software, hardware and services (including telecom services). Products include software, hardware and services, and span a diverse variety of industries including, but not limited to, email security, user authentication, telecommunications and cyber breach protection. Bravatek is a security platform company offering services, software, tools and systems that it provides, develops, acquires or obtains through strategic marketing or other agreements. The Company began taking pre-orders of Tuitio, a consumer software product (protected by two issued patents and licensed by the Company) in the second quarter of 2018.
Principal Products
 
Bravatek’s primary business focus centers on security, defense, and information security solutions that assist corporate entities, governments and individuals in protecting their organizations and/or critical infrastructure against both physical and cyber­attacks. The Company's business operations are oriented around the marketing and distribution of proprietary and allied security, defense and information security software, tools and systems (including services). To date, the Company has earned limited revenue. The Company believes the majority of its revenues will be derived from sales of proprietary and allied products and services to large enterprises, government, and military customers within the United States (“U.S.”) and abroad.
 
Currently, the Company's primary business operations are focused on establishing a strategic leadership position in cybersecurity email solutions and telecom services within the U.S. and abroad. The Company also has a “Market Alliance Program” (“MAP”) that enables Bravatek to rapidly introduce additional allied software, tools and systems to the worldwide marketplace through “win­win” contracts offering Bravatek, in most cases, exclusive distribution rights in specified markets.
 
Currently, the Company's primary proprietary product development efforts are focused on enhancing its sales released enterprise level information security software appliance called Ecrypt One. It was designed to protect email and attachments in transit and at rest. It incorporates and supports multiple security technologies and techniques, such as encryption, role-based access controls, server rules that enforce security, and multi­factor authentication. It was designed, with our rigorous new product development process, to assist organizations and governments to meet and maintain compliance with information security regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Care Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”).
 
The Company has filed a patent application for multiple attributes and processes contained in Ecrypt One.
 
On June 2, 2015, the Company completed an acquisition of some of the assets of Viking Telecom Services, LLC (“Viking Telecom”), which allowed the Company to provide telecom services under the Viking Telecom brand. Services provided by Viking Telecom include cellular tower mapping and audits, ground audits, civil equipment installation, cellular site decommissioning, 3G/4G/5G installations, project/construction management, battery installation and maintenance, shelter and compound preventative maintenance, site cleanup, and other related services. In January of 2018, the Company acquired HelpComm, Inc., a Virginia corporation engaged in the provision of telecom services (“HelpComm”). On March 12, 2019, the Company and HelpComm entered into a Rescission, Settlement and Confidentiality Agreement with Mutual Releases, whereby the acquisition of HelpComm was fully rescinded as of January 1, 2018.
 
Effective December 21, 2017, the Company entered into a Joint Venture Agreement (the “Agreement”) with DarkPulse Technologies, Inc. (“DarkPulse”), pursuant to which (1) the parties formed a joint venture limited liability company in Delaware to develop, market and sell products and services based on DarkPulse’s patented BOTDA DarkPulse technology (the “Technology”) to be owned 40% by the Company and 60% by Dark Pulse (the “JV”); (2) the Company would fund $10,000 in initial capital to the JV; and (3) and the JV would have a royalty-free non-exclusive license to use the Technology in the North America, Asia and European government, military and CI/KR (Critical Infrastructure / Key Resources) market segments. While DarkPulse has a controlling financial interest in the JV, the Company and DarkPulse jointly managed the JV, and any significant decisions and/or actions of the JV required the mutual consent of both parties. On January 25, 2018, our CEO was appointed to the Board of Directors of DarkPulse, and on February 5, 2018, he was also named Co-CEO of DarkPulse. Dr. Cellucci was terminated as co-CEO and Board Member of DarkPulse as of February 2019, which removes the significant influence aspect of the association with DarkPulse. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company funded $89,450 to the JV and was the only party with a financial risk in the JV. Due to the termination of the relationship between our CEO and DarkPulse in 2019, the company has recorded a loss for these funds in the amount of $89,450. On March 26, 2019, DarkPulse notified the JV that it was terminating the JV’s license to DarkPulse’s technology.

Research and Development
 
Over the next twelve (12) months, Bravatek will continue developing new strategic alliances and strengthening existing strategic alliances. The Company also plans to continue developing enhancement upgrades to its proprietary cybersecurity product, Ecrypt One. The Company released a consumer cybersecurity software product (covered under patents) in Q3 2018. The product has already been fully tested and the Company completed the marketing and sales launch in August 2018. The company is aggressively pursuing a patent related to its Ecrypt One software, as it believes it will be a valuable asset. 
Production
 
Ecrypt One was developed using a proprietary, rigorous new product development process under the supervision of the Company’s CEO, Dr. Thomas A. Cellucci and Vice President of Product Development, Ian Treleaven. Solution testing and evaluation (“T&E”) is routinely conducted by Ian Treleaven and the Company's development consultants using industry standard tools and methods. The Company engages in technical meetings to address feedback from all T&E activities.
Distribution
 
The Company distributes its solutions globally, in accordance with applicable import and export regulations, through a number of distribution channels. The primary method of distribution is through a dedicated in-house sales team with a network of representatives. The Company is also pursuing strategic distribution alliances with data centers, service providers, carrier dealers, consultants, and complementary solution providers to distribute its product.
 
Additionally, the Company has listed its solutions on the General Services Administration (“GSA”) Schedules or other government contract vehicles for acquisition by authorized users. GSA is an independent agency of the United States government that, amongst other responsibilities, supplies products and communications for US government offices. The Company had its software related products and capabilities listed on the SEWP contract vehicle, administered by NASA, useable by many civilian and military agencies in the U.S.
 
Customers and Marketing
 
Customers
 
The Company offers products and services in multiple segments in government, business, and consumer markets. The majority of the allied products and services are targeted at government, military and business markets.
 
The Company will primarily target Fortune 100 and 500 enterprises within the healthcare, financial/legal services, and telecommunications industries, as well as government, military and law enforcement agencies. These organizations have a critical reliance on security, defense, information security and data integrity products and services, and are subject to numerous stringent information security regulations.
 
The Company anticipates that a majority of its customers will be large sized businesses. The Company also anticipates sales of its products and services to U.S. government and military organizations, and allied foreign government and military organizations like NATO.
 
To date, the Company has received and fulfilled orders from corporate customers for Ecrypt One, Viking Telecom services, and partner solutions firms.

Marketing
 
Over the next year, the Company will focus on orders and sales for its products and services. It will also continue to grow its strategic alliance network of allied products and service providers, who will also market Bravatek's products.
 
The Company will focus its marketing efforts on customer acquisitions of Ecrypt One and the provision of telecom services, as well as allied products and services. The Company anticipates that it will continue to market its proprietary and allied products on the Internet, using the Company's websites (www.bravatek.com and www.vikingtelecomservices.com, not incorporated in this filing except as a reference), on social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter, and on industry websites, blogs and forums.
 
The Company also intends to expand its sales capabilities.
 
As of May 23, 2019, Company’s products and services were made available to government customers via i3 Integrative Creative Solutions, LLC’s GSA IT 70 contract vehicle.
 
Competition
 
Ecrypt One, the Company's enterprise level information security server software package, is a very unique offering that faces indirect competition from companies such as: i) Symantec Corporation; ii) Voltage Security; iii) Proofpoint Inc.; iv) Axway Software; v) Watchguard; and, vi) Zix Corporation.
 
All of the aforementioned companies develop and distribute email security servers. Although there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete with these organizations, our foremost advantage over these products is that Ecrypt One unifies multiple technologies and benefits (including email, encryption, anti­virus, anti­malware, no spam and no phishing) into a single solution making its use and administration more effective and efficient.
 
Allied products and services and telecom services have faced competition from a variety of companies, many of which are better capitalized than the Company and, in some cases, have significantly greater market penetration.
 
Although there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete with these organizations, our foremost advantage over competition is our network of potential customers, our ability to access them, and the diversity of high-tech products and services that the Company offers.
 
Intellectual Property and Agreements
 
Patents
 
The Company has filed a patent application for multiple attributes and processes contained in Ecrypt One, and is pursuing the patent (U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 15/246,500).
 
Licenses
 
The research, development and commercialization of cybersecurity software often involve alternative development and optimization routes, which are presented at various stages in the development process. The preferred routes cannot be predicted at the outset of a research and development program because they will depend upon subsequent discoveries and test results. There are numerous third-party patents in our field, and it is possible that to pursue the preferred development route of one or more of our products we will need to obtain a license to a patent, which would decrease the ultimate profitability of the applicable product. If we cannot negotiate a license, we might have to pursue a less desirable development route or terminate the program altogether.

Trade Secrets
 
The Company also relies on trade secrets, proprietary know­how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain a competitive position in our product areas. Bravatek employees, consultants and officers must sign a non­disclosure agreement before they are authorized to discuss particulars of the functionality of the Company's software products. All current employees, consultants and officers of the Company who are privy to confidential information have signed non­disclosure and non­competition agreements with the Company.
Environmental Issues
 
Through the provision of anticipated telecom services, the Company currently assists private sector clients to safely maintain, upgrade and install telecommunication towers, assemblies, and parts to enhance communications and protect the environment.
 
The Company's software products and their production or provision thereof, do not directly impact the environment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company strives to be environmentally friendly in all aspects of its operations.
 
Governmental Regulations
 
Telecom services work is governed by the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”). OSHA is a federal organization (part of the United States Department of Labor) that ensures safe and healthy working conditions for Americans by enforcing standards and providing workplace safety training.
 
Created in response to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, OSHA's main goal is to protect the rights and safety of workers by preventing workplace injuries and deaths and holding employers accountable for safe workplaces. OSHA provides workers and employers with information about hazardous working conditions and they offer free assessment for workplace dangers.
 
There is a strict set of federal safety standards to which all businesses must adhere. These regulations cover things like disposal of hazardous materials, required personal safety equipment such as safety goggles, permitted noise levels and fall protection. OSHA inspects workplaces to ensure they're following all regulations to reduce chances of accident or injury.
 
Cybersecurity Software is classified as a “dual use good,” meaning that it can be used by both the general public and the military. Export of such goods is regulated by the Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual Use Goods and Technologies (the “Wassenaar Arrangement”).
 
The Wassenaar Arrangement was established in order to contribute to regional and international security and stability by promoting transparency and greater responsibility in transfers of conventional arms and dual use goods and technologies, thus preventing destabilizing accumulations. Participating States seek, through their national policies, to ensure that transfers of these items do not contribute to the development or enhancement of military capabilities, which undermine these goals, and are not diverted to support such capabilities.
 
The Participating States of the Wassenaar Arrangement include: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Korea, Romania, Russian Federation, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom and United States.
 
In the United States, the Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) is responsible for implementing and enforcing the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”), which regulate the export and re­export of most commercial items. Encryption software is subject to the EAR and other U.S. law, and may not be exported or re­ exported to certain countries (currently Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Syria) or to persons or entities prohibited from receiving US exports. Because of this, the Company has applied and has received approval for Mass Market Status Export Authorization from the BIS. Mass Market Status is given to encryption products, which have been reviewed and classified by the BIS as exportable under certain rules and regulations, including the mass market encryption rules of the EAR.
 
The procurement and use of commercially available security solutions by government, and military agencies is controlled through various regulations. In order to provide or sell a service or product to a government or military agency, a vendor or provider can be approved by and listed with the United States General Services Administration (“GSA”) or other US government contract vehicles. Additionally, military applications also require that products be certified by the National Security Agency. The Company is pursuing such certifications and accreditations.
