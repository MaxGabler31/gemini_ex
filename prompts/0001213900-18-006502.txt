Item 1. Business.Corporate History and Overview
 
Jerrick Media Holdings, Inc. (“we,” “us,” the “Company,” or “Jerrick Media” or “Jerrick”) (formerly Great Plains Holdings, Inc. or “GTPH”) was incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on December 30, 1999 under the name LILM, Inc. The Company changed its name on December 3, 2013 to Great Plains Holdings, Inc. as part of its plan to diversify its business through the acquisition and operation of commercial real estate, including, but not limited to, self-storage facilities, apartment buildings, 55+ senior manufactured home communities, and other income producing properties. Historically, the Company principally engaged in the manufacture and marketing of the LiL Marc, a plastic boys’ toilet-training device, which we discontinued as of December 31, 2014.


On February 5, 2016 (the “Closing Date”), GTPH, GPH Merger Sub, Inc., a Nevada corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of GTPH (“Merger Sub”), and Jerrick Ventures, Inc., a privately-held Nevada corporation headquartered in New Jersey (“Jerrick”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”) pursuant to which the Merger Sub was merged with and into Jerrick, with Jerrick surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of GTPH (the “Merger”). GTPH acquired, through a reverse triangular merger, all of the outstanding capital stock of Jerrick in exchange for issuing Jerrick’s shareholders (the “Jerrick Shareholders”), pro-rata, a total of 28,500,000 shares of GTPH’s common stock. GTPH assumed 33,415 shares of Jerrick’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Jerrick Series A Preferred”) and 8,064 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Jerrick Series B Preferred”).
 
In connection with the Merger, on the Closing Date, GTPH and Kent Campbell entered into a Spin-Off Agreement (the “Spin-Off Agreement”), pursuant to which Mr. Campbell purchased from GTPH (i) all of GTPH’s interest in Ashland Holdings, LLC, a Florida limited liability company, and (ii) all of GTPH’s interest in Lil Marc, Inc., a Utah corporation, in exchange for the cancellation of 781,818 shares of GTPH’s Common Stock held by Mr. Campbell. In addition, Mr. Campbell assumed all debts, obligations and liabilities of GTPH, including any existing prior to the Merger, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Spin-Off Agreement.
 
Effective February 28, 2016, GTPH entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Statutory Merger Agreement”) with Jerrick, pursuant to which GTPH became the parent company of Jerrick Ventures, LLC, a wholly-owned operating subsidiary of Jerrick (the “Statutory Merger”).
 
Upon closing of the Merger on February 5, 2016, the Company changed its business plan to that of Jerrick Media.
 
On February 28, 2016, GTPH changed its name to Jerrick Media Holdings, Inc. to better reflect its new business strategy.
 
Jerrick Media Business
 
Jerrick Media Holdings Inc. develops technology-based solutions designed to solve for challenges that have resulted from disruption and evolution within the broad digital media and content generation environment. Its flagship product Vocal is a long-form, digital publishing platform focused on supporting content creators with content management tools that are embedded within digital communities. Vocal is architected to enable targeted marketing of branded content and e-commerce opportunities in long-form content. Vocal’s community sites are moderated by a dedicated team with a primary focus on creating healthy communities and identifying monetization opportunities within them. Vocal serves as a versatile home for content creators. The platform supports multiple forms of content such as: short videos, podcasts, music, and written word. This activity is expected to increase at a rapid pace. A fraction of creators achieve meaningful visibility for their content, and even fewer are rewarded financially. Jerrick Media Holdings’ product Vocal provides a solution for the creative community.
 
Jerrick Media Holdings, Inc. partners with content creators and brands that recognize difficulties inherent in the digital advertising space and are looking to capitalize on the branded content marketing opportunities available on publishing platforms like Vocal.

Through 2017 content creation continue to accelerate exponentially. Audiences continued to shift from traditional digital media to independent creator content. Traditional advertising business models continue to be threatened. The intrusive nature of display ads, which led to over 680 million ad-blockers installed and, is causing accelerated margin compression at the largest digital advertisers. Because of these tightening spreads, excessive traffic is required to successfully monetize content. Jerrick’s business model continues to view this opportunistically.
 
While management expects legacy assets that were acquired prior to the launch of Vocal to continue to contribute to revenues and generate strong margins we expect that the majority of revenues going forward will be generated by the Company’s technology. Jerrick’s diversified portfolio combines technology, data analytics and media related products to generate shareholder value. In addition to transactional revenues directly attributed to the long-form social platform, Jerrick will continue to monetize its core library of media assets as well as consult for brands and agencies through its suite of quantitative and fundamental analytics.
 
Our Strategy
 
We have developed a proprietary patent-pending technology platform, Vocal, designed to develop and cost-effectively acquire content that reaches audiences through our portfolio of genre-specific communities, as well as through other social and digital distribution channels. In addition to providing relevant and refreshing content, our technology is centered on efficiency and scalability in both input of content across a growing variety of topics, and output through a growing number of distribution methods. We believe our content-to-commerce model is an integral part of digital monetization. We focus on distribution of content through the Vocal platform that optimizes user-generated content through an algorithmically derived moderation process. Through the moderation process, we reduce manpower costs, and simultaneously increase our ability to publish content and rapidly produce genre-specific websites driven by usage data. Through these genre-specific websites, we are able to provide advertisers with a more transparent and targeted community for their brands, which we believe offers a very high value proposition. The Vocal platform and its proprietary technology can be white-labeled or licensed, to provide seamless integration to independent media companies and brands. We also use the Vocal platform for distribution and monetization of a substantial inventory of content featuring unpublished photographs, negatives, trademarks, videos, scripts, short stories, and articles across various genres. We believe we have a competitive advantage in the ownership of merchandising rights of such content which allows us to sell or license these properties.
 
As part of our strategy, we develop transmedia assets internally, in collaboration with other production and media companies, as well as with our expanding user base. The transmedia assets we produce, such as film, television, digital shorts, books, and comic series can be leveraged beyond digital media and can be distributed across multiple platforms and formats.
 
Our Website Communities
 
We are developing an ever-increasing number of genre-specific websites, designed to create self-sustaining communities, with each revolving around a specific topic or theme. The creation of these websites is driven by two factors: (i) the potential for monetization opportunities, and (ii) by the topical content provided by our users. All of these sites are powered by Vocal, our proprietary long-form digital publishing and content distribution platform.
Intellectual Property
 
We regard our technology and other proprietary rights as essential to our business. We rely on trade secrets, confidentiality procedures, contract provisions, and trademark law to protect our technology and intellectual property. We have also entered into confidentiality agreements with our consultants and corporate partners and intend to control access to and distribution of our products, documentation, and other proprietary information.
Protecting our Content from Copyright Theft
 
The theft of pictures, video and other entertainment content presents a significant challenge to our industry, and we have taken many steps to address this concern. Where possible, we make use of technological protection tools, such as encryption, to protect our content. Notwithstanding these efforts and the many legal protections that exist to combat piracy, the proliferation of content theft and technological tools with which to carry it out continue to escalate. The failure to obtain enhanced legal protections and enforcement tools could make it more difficult for us to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could negatively impact its value.
Competition
 
We face significant competition from many other websites. We face formidable competition in every aspect of our business, and particularly from other companies that seek to connect people with information on the web similar to ours, and provide them with relevant advertising. Although we face severe competition, we believe we have a competitive advantage in that the majority of our content is timeless, as opposed to many of our competitors, who focus mainly on providing timely content that has a limited lifespan, and therefore negligible long term monetization value. Competitive factors include:

● | community cohesion, interaction and size;
--+------------------------------------------


● | website or mobile platform and application ease-of-use and accessibility;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | user engagement;
--+-----------------


● | system reliability;

● | reliability of delivery and payment; and

● | quality of content.

We may be unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors. Some current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, larger user bases and greater brand recognition in other internet sectors than we do. Other online sites with similar business models may be acquired by, receive investments from, or enter into other commercial relationships with well-established and well-financed companies. As a result, some of our competitors with other revenue sources may be able to devote more resources to marketing and promotional campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote more resources to website, mobile platforms and applications and systems development than we can.
 
In addition, we compete with internet advertising companies, particularly in the areas of pay-for-performance and keyword-targeted internet advertising. Also, we may compete with companies that sell products and services online because these companies, like us, are trying to attract users to their websites to search for information about products and services and content like ours.
 
We also compete with destination websites that seek to increase their search-related traffic. These destination websites may include those operated by internet access providers, such as cable and DSL service providers. Because our users need to access our services through internet access providers, they have direct relationships with these providers. If an access provider or a computer or computing device manufacturer offers online services that compete with ours, the user may find it more convenient to use the services of the access provider or manufacturer. In addition, the access provider or manufacturer may make it hard to access our services by not listing them in the access provider’s or manufacturer’s own menu of offerings. Also, because the access provider gathers information from the user in connection with the establishment of a billing relationship, the access provider may be more effective than we are in tailoring services and advertisements to the specific tastes of the user. 
 
There has been a trend toward industry consolidation among our competitors, and so smaller competitors today may become larger competitors in the future. If our competitors are more successful than we are at generating traffic, our revenues may decline.
